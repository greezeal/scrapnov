      "content": "Chapter 1\nWah! Wah!\nIn the early morning, Vincent was roused from his sleep by the sound of a babys cry echoing through the mountain.\nUgh.\nThe sad sound of the infant continued to be heard as he ran his hands through his disheveled hair.\nGod, what have I done so wrong?\nThe hunters muscles strained in the dark as he kicked the blanket off of the bed.\nWho on earth is that this early?\nVincent looked at his sleeping wife, hoping she was having a good dream.\nIf she heard that, there would have been some measure of trouble.\nHaah\nThe couple, who had been married for seven years, had no children.\nThey had visited the clinic once with a large sum of money, but all they said was that the cause was unknown.\nTheres a thing called compatibility in bed. Its just the way it is. Olina and you dont seem to have a problem, so keep trying. Haha!\nVincent smiled through it at first.\nHowever, the situation did not improve over time. By the time they entered their fifth year of marriage, he had no choice but to admit it.\nHe couldnt have children.\nHis wife, Olina, didnt speak of her disappointment. But at times, she would get a lonely expression on her face. And at those times, Vincent couldn't help but be resentful towards his lower body.\nWhat kind of rascal is it? Its like hes trying to rub salt into the wound!\nPutting his complicated feelings aside, Vincent left the house with his single-edged axe.\nWho is it?! Whos the one causing all this ruckus, at this time of the night?!\nHis shout echoed through the mountains.\nThere was no response, and Vincents expression hardened at that silence.\nPerhaps its a trap?\nMost hunters built their houses in the mountains.\nThis was due to the fact that they would have to check the traps they set at night early in the morning, and it sometimes became necessary for them to spend days in the mountains when they were tracking large animals.\nOf course, safety was his responsibility, and there were a lot of bandits looking for vulnerable prey.\nOn the other hand, it could have been a merchant from another country. However, there was no torch in sight in the dark of the night.\nThat rotten! Ill cut you to pieces!\nIn the worst case scenario, there would be no choice but to shed blood.\nHe slowly approached the stable the noise was coming from. Then he quickly flung open the door.\nThe hunters excellent vision scanned the interior.\nNeigh.\nHe heard the horse whinny.\nBecause animals do not lie, the impulsive Vincents heart relaxed a bit.\nTheres nowhere to hide.\nThere was also no sign that anyone had broken in.\nBut, how?\nVincent looked at the bundle laying on the straw bed.\nThe baby, who seemed to be about two months old, was crying with a frown on their face.\nVincent hurriedly hid the axe behind his back.\nWhen he went down to kneel in front of the bundle, he threw the metal somewhere in the corner.\nWah! Wah!\nThere was a baby, as pretty as the moon.\nA baby who didnt know anything yet, whod just been born, and would one day spread his name around the world.\nAt that moment, the baby saw the adults face and stopped crying, a smile spreading across his face.\nVincents lips trembled.\nThen, as if he was struck by lightning, he stood up and ran out of the stables.\nWho is it?! Whos pulling a prank on me?! Abandoning a child! You bastard, come out!\nHis roar rang throughout the mountain.\nCome out! Really?! How can you abandon a child?! Youre a monster! You know that?!\nThere was still no answer.\nYoure really abandoning the baby? Im giving you no more chances! If you show up in front of me, Ill turn your face into a rice cake!\nVincent shouted with all his might.\nHe didnt want to have any regrets when he looked back on this day in the distant future.\nHaah. Haaah\nVincent, after a few moments of staring into the darkness, went back into the stable, breathing heavily.\nThe baby was asleep, perhaps exhausted from crying.\nHolding the baby in trembling hands, he gently pressed his ear to the babys little chest.\nOh\nHis heart was beating much faster than an adults.\nHoney, whats going on?\nHis wife, who had run outside after hearing him shouting.\nVincent showed her the sleeping child in his arms instead of answering.\nWhats with the baby?\nVincent hesitated, as he wasnt sure how to explain the situation.\nIts Its our child.\n* * *\n* * *\nIt was early summer.\nThe stream was cold and the wind was cool.\nWith a dead water deer draped across his wide shoulders, Vincent hurried home.\nRather than catching good prey, he was excited to go back to his family, waiting for him at home.\nShirone! Dads home!\nDad!\nThe 12-year-old boy came running to the front door with a big smile.\nUnlike Vincent, who was as rugged as a rock, the boys face was reminiscent of a specially processed jewel.\nHis hair was as smooth as gold and his blue eyes shone from afar.\nWhenever he saw his pretty son, who looked like a doll, Vincent could not hide his happiness.\nAs soon as he threw the water deer on the floor, he buried his face into his sons shoulder.\nYes, my precious son. How have you been? Have you been good?\nYes! I helped Mom cook and also read a lot of books.\nCooking and reading.\nVincent, who felt the incongruity between the two words, was slightly perplexed but didnt show it on his face.\nHaha! Do you like books that much?\nNo, its theres just nothing to do.\nVincent felt sorry for his son whenever he saw him flinch, as if he had done something wrong.\nIn fact, he knew it.\nHe knew that this miraculous child from heaven was smarter than his peers.\nHe read books with the letters he learned from his mom, and now he had reached the point of reading difficult books alone.\nAnd that was a little pitiful.\nIt wasnt easy to raise enough money for hunters to educate their children.\nThe only thing Vincent could teach him was his lifelong hunting skills.\nThe most stable life for the son of a herbalist is to be a herbalist, and for the son of a hunter to be a hunter.\nBecause even the most trivial job required knowledge and tricks that couldnt simply be spoken of.\nBut Vincent couldnt bring himself to say that.\nNo. Good job, Shirone. No matter what you do, you have to learn to succeed. Ill buy you a book when I go into the city next time.\nIts okay. Ive read the books youve bought me, but theres nothing special or interesting about them.\nVincent laughed at his sons boast.\nPopular books were expensive, so he couldnt even think about buying one of those. So he would go around the antique shops and buy books that were used and thrown away by the nobles, which were a bit cheaper.\nHe did guess that the content was not enough for a child to digest, anyway.\nWhat a considerate boy.\nVincent was moved to tears by Shirones thoughtfulness, who was considerate of his parents situation.\nRight! Anyways, what do you think? Do you want to go cut some trees with me? Its important to learn, but you also have to have the physique and stamina. Today, dad will teach you how to chop some wood.\nWow! Then, are you going to be giving me an axe?\nOf course! Just you and me, why dont we go cut down all the trees!\nVincent presented Shirone with an axe, as if he had been waiting for this moment.\nAfter all I guess he'll become a mountaineer.\nIn any case, it was important to build some muscles in his tiny body from now on.\nBut is it really?\nHe had a sudden doubt.\nShirone looks like a child from a wealthy family, with his soft face and hair. Maybe he was the child of a noble family?\nVincent shook his head. Whenever he had such suspicions, he felt overwhelmed. He felt like he had received a precious gift, but on the other hand, he suffered from guilt.\nIts a useless thought. Shirone is my child. Not a child brought in from the stables, but a child who has my blood flowing through him.\nWith a firm heart, Vincent headed for the logging area, a kilometer away from the cabin.\nIll give you a demonstration, so watch carefully and follow along.\nVincent spat on his palm and began to chop the tree with ease.\nNot long after, with the sound of splitting wood the tree crashed down with a snap.\nAlthough it wasnt particularly important, a lumberjacks ability was measured according to the number of swings it took to cut down a tree.\nBecause he was not a lumberjack, Vincent had to swing 10 times, but that alone took great skill.\nAfter hitting the same area several times, the tree will start to tilt and fall down, as it cant hold its own weight. Can you do it?\nYes, Ill try.\nAs Vincent picked out a tree for Shirone, he started to copy what his dad did by spitting on his hand.\nEven though he only saw it once, his positioning, posture, and even the way he rubbed his palms was a spitting image of his dad.\nJust as expected of Shirone, who was especially intelligent. Vincent watched his son in satisfaction.\nBut as Shirone raised his axe high, it was a bit sloppy.\nIts not something you can do with intelligence alone.\nWhile the weight of the axe was considerable, muscle strength was essential when cutting down a tree.\nHe needs to start training himself, so that he can get married and have children later in life.\nNo woman would want to marry a guy who couldnt make money.\nEek! Eck!\nShirone clenched his teeth and swung, but every time he missed and hit somewhere different.\nVincent gave some tips.\nDon't use up all your strength. Instead, try to decrease your power and replace it with accuracy.\nHowever, no matter how much he continued to aim and hit, there was no sign of the tree being cut down.\nIs my son really this weak?\nVincent was a little sullen.\nPhew, its hard.\nIts okay. No, Im sorry. To be honest, I know you are not fit to be doing a job like this. However, being a hunters son, there is no choice\nVincent was choked up.\nYoure a really smart boy. More than the herbalists son, Barone, or the fruit sellers daughter, Stella. You are smarter than them all. Dont get rattled just because you lack physical strength. My greed for you\nTears began to gather in Vincents eyes.\nHowever, Shirone, who was busy with other thoughts, spoke without care.\nMore importantly, Dad, how can I cut down trees well?\nVincent was slightly embarrassed.\nHe was also surprised. His son, who he had assumed would have no interest, was intent on cutting down trees well.\nYou really want to try and learn?\nYes, teach me. Its fun.\nVincent, who was encouraged by his sons words, led Shirone to the dent of the tree he made.\nAlright, look at this. Strength will work when you become an adult, but this doesnt really require much power. Its the tricks that count. I told you to hit the same spot earlier, but if you tilt the angle a little bit and hit around the spot you aimed before, you will be able to cut down the tree easier.\nOh, I see.\nVincent finally looked at the dent his son had made, away from the spot he was supposed to hit.\nThis is\nIt was quite surprising.\nIt was hard to look at it and think that it was done by a beginner, as the blade had been driven into the same exact spot, over and over.\nIf this continued, it would have been more difficult to knock down the tree without brute strength being used. The trick to easily cut down a tree was to hit around the target spot, instead of aiming at the same place repeatedly. Because of Shirones frightening accuracy, it would have been impossible for his current self to cut it down.",

      "content": "Chapter 2\nIll try again.\nVincent stepped back, but Shirone remained motionless and observed the dented spot on the tree.\nVincent, who briefly thought he might just be goofing off, shook his head to dismiss the thought.\nHes not the kind of kid who would play cheap tricks on his parents.\nHe waited, holding back his impatience, but Shirone made no move to continue.\nWhat in the world is he looking at? When it comes to chopping down trees, using your body instead of your head is much more important. Come on, pick up the axe, Shirone. You just have to hit the tree as hard as you can.\nContrary to Vincents restlessness, Shirone felt a light tremor travel through his body.\nI see.\nHit the same spot, but with a slight twist to the angle.\nIt was complicated to explain the principles, but it was probably one of the oldest realizations in human history.\nAnd that realization was evolving into a more powerful form in Shirones understanding.\nI think itll work. Hit here, like this.\nFinally, Shirone pointed to the base of the tree, where he made the dent.\nDad.\nHmm?\nShould I break it in one hit?\nHahaha! Youre not even halfway through yet. Do you think itll break with one swing?\nWith a bit of luck, who knows? It might work.\nOf course, an experienced lumberjack could break a tree in only a few hits by targeting the vulnerable part of the tree.\nAlright! Lets trust my sons luck!\nRegardless, Vincent went along with whatever his son had in mind.\nThat was because he was proud of Shirones ambition, regardless of whether he did it right or wrong.\nIf I break this, please grant me a wish.\nA wish?\nVincent was anxious.\nWhat if he says that he wants to study? What if he asks me to send him to an academy like the nobles?\nTake me to the city with you this time.\nTo be honest, his request frightened Vincent out of his wits. However, he didnt reveal it in his expression and laughed back.\nIf its just that, then thats not too hard! Ill grant this wish of yours!\nShirone smiled while holding up his axe.\nThen, after a while, the smile disappeared from his lips. Vincent felt a little appalled.\nThe sight of Shirone staring at the tree was eerie. It seemed as if he was looking at something only he could see.\nThe axe swung.\nThis time, although he aimed exactly where the previous dent was located, there was a slight alteration that normal humans would not be able to discern.\nCraacck!\nVincents eyes widened as a sound resembling thunder rang out.\nThats?\nFissures appeared in the place the axe was struck. The tree, unable to handle the weight, fell.\nYay! I did it!\nVincent couldnt believe it.\nWhat Shirone succeeded in doing was called a Thunder Strike, which was considered a legend among lumberjacks.\nIts a skill that even I succeed in performing only once in a blue moon or so, and by luck, that is.\nThere must have been a weak or a vital spot.\nA very small probability, one that existed with variables such as shape, weight, or formation deficiency.\nMost lumberjacks experienced it once, but to do it consciously would be like a dream come true.\nIts not like you had to cut down a tree that way, but if you swing your axe with that thought in mind, expecting and hoping for something, youd only get tired and give up.\nIt was different from the world of swordsmen, where they focused on the importance of swinging technique.\nVincent didnt know the details, but it was a phenomenon that had already been studied amongst them. Even so, beginners among those swordmasters could not even think of attempting something like this.\nI did it! I did it!\nShirone was more delighted to be able to enter the city than about what hed done.\nDad! You have to keep your promise, okay?\nVincents mind, while staring blankly at his son jumping up and down, became conflicted.\nWhat do I do?\nHe felt lost at sea, unable to figure out whether he should be raising this child as a lumberjack or not.\n* * *\nThe cart crossed the city gate.\nAs Vincent grabbed the reins, Shirone was sitting in the luggage compartment, eyes sparkling in excitement.\nIt been so long.\nJust looking at the number of people passing by on the street made his heart race.\nWe still have a lot of time.\nThe luggage compartment where Shirone was seated was filled with materials and resources from the mountains.\nLeathers for weapon stores, meat for the market, and intestines for herbalists or magic shops.\nThe road was quite long, and they would have to sell and haggle over their goods. That would take a good 4 hours.\nWhen Vincent arrived at the market, he took a bag of meat and looked at Shirone.\nYou have to come back before sunset.\nDont worry. Ive memorized all the roads.\nOnly walk on the main roads. Dont go wandering into secluded places. If someone comes and asks why youre alone, point to the nearest store and say youre waiting for your dad.\nDont worry. Plus, nothing happened the last time I came here.\nVincent was heart-stricken because it seemed like he was neglecting his son, but it was inevitable because his familys livelihood was at stake. Their bargain would have to do, for now.\nThe first place Shirone found himself, once he stepped outside of the shopping district, was the largest library in Creas.\nThe boys heart, looking up at the huge and magnificent building, began to beat fast.\nKnowledge.\nDid that place hold all the knowledge written down since the beginning of history?\nThe way to satisfy ones curiosity was to take a look at it for yourself, but access was prohibited to everyone except for nobles.\nTwo girls came out with a book in their arms, and Shirone hurriedly stepped aside.\nTheyre nobles.\nThere were wicked people everywhere in the world, and among the nobles, good people existed as well.\nHowever, when speaking about nobles, Vincent always spoke as if they were the same type of threat as goblins.\nNever oppose them or speak out of turn.\nThe nobles had money and power that could easily crush the lives of a commoners family.\nThey could. But\nShirone looked back at the schoolgirls, who walked past him indifferently.\nI just want to read a book.\nWith a little bit of obstinance and eagerness, he followed the two towards the aristocratic area.\nWhat kind of life are they living?\nHowever, that initial thought was overwhelmed by the aristocratic energy of the buildings. He couldnt raise his head.\nThis was built for people to live in?\nAmong them, the best academy was as large as several mountains combined.\nShirone stopped walking and read the antique inscription on the arch of the main gate.\nAlpheas Magic Academy.\n* * *\n* * *\nMagic\nThat one word was the only word that Shirone could not perfectly understand.\nThat was because, although that term was mentioned in numerous books, none could accurately describe the principles.\nUnless you were a mage, explaining the workings of magic was futile. Youd only be seen as an arrogant being who thought they knew everything.\nWhat the?! You, who are you?\nIt was the security guard guarding the gate that shouted.\nShirones shabby clothes were at fault, as they stood out more since this was an aristocratic district.\nGo back! This is no place for a kid like you.\nOh, Im sorry.\nShirone ran away in a hurry, but no matter how much he ran, the wall did not end, which led Shirone to stop.\nHow wide is this thing?\nJust then, an old mans voice was heard over the wall.\nWell, lets talk about what magic is today.\nNo, I dont want to! Show us magic. Show us one more!\nFire! The one with fire, headmaster!\nShirone stared at the wall.\nSpotting the beautiful tree peeking from the top of the wall, Shirone realized that the headmaster seemed to be teaching under the shade.\nThe voices sounded young.\nOf course, that wasnt strange, since nobles were taught from the moment they were born.\nHohoho, well get in trouble if we start a fire in our academy. Instead, if you get this question right, Ill show you a fun magic trick.\nYay! Whats the question? Hurry up and quiz us!\nCurious, Shirone listened.\nWhat talent do you need the most when learning magic?\nThere was a pause.\nIt was quite a subjective question in Shirones opinion, but those children were recognized for their magical talents. They came up with answers, one after another.\nEffort. Magic is so extensive that you wont be able to learn everything, even if you study your whole life. So effort is important.\nIn addition, there were other plausible answerssuch as concentration and memory, but none really reached the headmaster.\nHe was probably harboring a smile of recognition.\nMoney. You would need to buy a lot of stuff in order to learn magic.\nThe children burst into laughter, and the headmasters laughter was also mixed in.\nIf its neither effort, knowledge, nor money Then what talent do you need the most to learn magic?\nAt last the headmaster spoke.\nThe most important talent for learning magic is perspicacity. This is more simply known as insight.\nA second pause.\nWhat is an insight?\nThe headmaster made a groaning sound, but soon explained with a kind tone of voice.\nInsight is more accurate than knowledge, and faster than effort.\nWoah! Then thats like, the greatest magic.\nHaha! I guess it could be seen that way. No, youre right. All magic that exists in the world began with insight. Let me give you an example. Do you know what one plus one is?\nOf course its two.\nThe children answered in unison, as if they were wondering how he could ask such a question.\nI see. Can you explain\nwhy\none plus one equals 2?\nHuh? Of course\nThe children said nothing.\nThey couldnt figure out where to start, what to explain, and how to explain it.\nAlpheas smiled.\nThat strange feeling you feel now is insight. Long ago, there was a time when you didnt know that one plus one equals two. But its been verified with a lot of knowledge and effort combined. But dont you guys understand perfectly that one plus one equals two, without going through that process?\nShirone slowly immersed himself in the story.\nMagic is a phenomenon that exists from scratch. Like the way that you know the answer is two, even when you didnt know that one plus one equals two. The way someone puts effort and knowledge to figure it out, and the way someone, like you guys, comes to understand and realize it naturally. As such, insight is the quickest way to understand certain rules.\nSo that means we dont have to study or try?\nHohoho, is that so? Does it end up being like that? But to be honest thats the truth.\nIts normal for common sense to be to ones liking, but in some cases, it is common sense because its easy to understand.\nShirone could guess the pressure the headmaster was feeling while speaking of this cruel reality.\nInsight is not something you can acquire with a flick of a finger. The reason why one plus one is two is because scholars have verified it over many years. Of course, there are cases where someone might realize the correct answer without going through such a process. I would call those people geniuses.\nMy mom said Im a genius.\nIm sure thats not wrong. Every human being is born with talent, and if they sharpen that talent of theirs, anyone can be a genius.\nThe moment he heard that, a lump formed in Shirones throat. He felt overwhelmed.\nAnyone can be a genius.\nBut, was that really true?\nWould he be given the opportunity to climb over that far-off wall?\nYes. There, the one standing behind the wall. Id like to hear what you think.",

      "content": "Chapter 3\nShirone jumped back in surprise.\nWh-What should I do?\nShould I run away, or should I answer? No. Do I, a commoner, even have the right to answer?\nAlpheas continued.\nTheres no need to panic. Come over here. I would like to see your face.\nShirone, who continued to question himself, walked to the wall as if possessed.\nIf he didn't cross that wall right then, he felt like he would never be able to cross it.\nAs Shirone climbed the wall, he saw a white-haired, elderly man who would look quite common on the street.\nIn truth, he was a certified Grade 4 mage, recognized by the kingdom. He was well known in other countries for his high virtue.\nAlpheas, sitting on a rock, waved.\nCome. Are you here to be my friend?\nHaving gained confidence from his kindness, Shirone jumped over the wall and entered the academy.\nUnder the shade of the tree, children around Shirones age sat in a circle.\nOne child frowned.\nHeadmaster, hes not a nobleman. I think hes a commoner.\nHuh? Really? Commoners arent allowed here. Hey, get out of here!\nAlpheas looked puzzled for a moment, as if he was expecting someone who was of noble status, but soon spoke warmly.\nIts all right, come this way. So, what part of this old mans words drew your heart?\nShirone hesitated.\nHe wanted to get closer to Alpheas, but the eyes of the children were preventing him from doing so.\nShow me magic.\nHoho, have you never seen magic?\nIve read about it in books, but Ive never seen it in person.\nA child pointed his finger at Shirone.\nAs if! What kind of commoner can read?\nWhen Alpheas looked into Shirones eyes, it certainly didnt seem to be a lie.\nHowever, it was the nature of children of that age to deceive adults.\nOkay. What kind of magic do you want to see?\nIt doesnt matter. I dont care. Anything is fine, so show me. Please.\nShirone realized his situation, so he lowered his head. Then Alpheas waved his hand and laughed.\nThis old mans one and only joy is to show his magic to his honey buns. Alright! Then this time, Ill show you magic that creates wind.\nWooaah! Its wind, wind!\nWhile the children clapped their hands in awe, Shirone clenched his fist in tension.\nWind? How can I?\nIn that instant, when Alpheas raised his hand, Shirones eyes opened wide in shock.\nWhoa!\nThe weight of his body disappeared and flew up to a height of more than 20 meters.\nThe numerous buildings of the magic academy, and the mountain ranges that were situated beyond it, were noticeable with a glance.\nAHHHH!\nScreaming broke out as a matter of course, but the other children were enjoying it while cartwheeling around the sky.\nAfter a while, the children start to drop, one by one.\nThe speed of the drop was so great that Shirone closed his eyes tightly at the sight of the fast approaching ground.\nWha?\nThere was none of the impact Shirone was expecting.\nFeeling strange, Shirone opened his eyes slowly and saw that his body was floating a little above the ground.\nWhen the children burst into laughter at the sight of Shirone, Alpheas also laughed mischievously.\nWhat do you say? This is magic.\nOf course he was kind at times, but he wasnt boring enough to not enjoy the childs reaction.\nThat may be why he came on a bit stronger than usual, but Shirone could not answer him.\nThe beating of his heart was all he heard.\nThis is magic.\nThis sensation he experienced for the first time in his life was completely beyond the nebulous boys fantasy.\nShirone, once he came to his senses, spoke.\nWhat is magic?\nWell, lets see. Magic is\nIt doesnt matter if I dont understand. Please tell me the truth.\nThe childrens expressions hardened.\nEven though they were young, they knew what position Alpheas had in the magical world. Therefore, even the children of the prominent noble families laid low and acted like obedient children in front of him.\nOur teachers cant say things like that to him.\nAlpheas also thought it was bold at first, but after a while, he changed his opinion.\nHes a smart kid.\nHe was not trying to understand things right away.\nI know what kind of opportunity I have right now. Thats why Im not trying to understand it easily, at an elementary level. I would rather have difficult, but accurate information so that I can study it myself!\nIf he hadnt had an education on magic before this, then this childs judgment had to be excellent.\nBut really? Does he believe he can do it alone?\nSo far, Alpheas, who was deep in thought, looked at Shirone with a different look from before.\nHe was tense, as if his life was on the line.\nHaha! Listen comfortably, its not a difficult thing to understand. But if you would like, I can raise the difficulty a bit. Magic is something that deviates from common sense. In other words, its the mental process of exploring the truth of a phenomenon.\nShirone was engrossed in thought.\nIf you dont understand, you can just say so.\nSo its not an easy phenomenon to explain, but youre saying that\nis\nthe truth?\nAlpheas blinked.\nWhere did you learn that?\nOh, well, in a book.\nThere was a book with content like that?\nNo, I just thought about why books are used. Even if someone goes out their way to write down something that everyone knows, no one would bother looking at it. Truth is something that is different from the common sense we normally know, thats probably the reason why books are written and are read.\nAnyone can memorize and recite. However, understanding the concept of a book requires an inherent characteristic insight. Is he really a commoner? What a shame!\nLooking at his appearance, it was highly likely that the commoner was from the lowest of the low, living outside the city.\nShirone asked another question.\nHow can I learn magic? Does it require special powers?\nI dont know what special powers youre talking about, but it does take a lot of mental strength.\nIt was an unexpectedly lackluster answer.\nThats really it? Does that mean you can fly in the sky when you think of the wind?\nWell, thats difficult to answer. But to add a little exaggeration, yes. Of course, its not just ordinary thoughts. The mages consciousness must coincide with the world. An extremely sensitive state of mind, for instance.\nAlpheas serious expression prevented the children from intervening.\nWhat is a sensitive state of mind?\nAlpheas smiled.\nThis isnt curiosity. Hes really planning on learning magic!\nOn the contrary, it was concerning.\nIts unfortunate, but hes a commoner. He wont be able to get a formal education. If I were to encourage him further, he would only be more dejected later on.\nAlpheas looked back at the students, with the intention of cutting off the flow of the conversation before it went any deeper.\nWhen a mage focuses, his mind becomes sensitive enough to sense everything around him. Mages call this as entering the Spirit Zone. Ill show you a demonstration, so watch what this child does. Shuamin, would you like to enter the Spirit Zone?\nYes, headmaster.\nA girl with braids answered confidently.\nIt was natural for them to show off their skills, because they were born with extraordinary talents.\n* * *\n* * *\nShuamin closed her eyes and the other children created a reverent atmosphere on their own.\nAs if such an attitude proved their own superiority.\nI entered the Zone.\nThen lets get started.\nAlpheas, who took out a coin, shook it in his hand. Suddenly, he clenched his hand and held it out.\nNow, how many coins are in my hand?\nSix.\nWhen he opened his hand, there were exactly six silver coins.\nAlpheas repeated it for a second time as Shirone watched with a surprised look.\nThree.\nOnce again, that was the correct answer.\nAfter that, Alpheas tried a few more times, but the result was the same.\nThats enough, Shuamin, you did a great job.\nHaaah.\nShuamin let out a long breath.\nThe only thing she did was guess the number of coins, but her forehead was covered in cold sweat.\nAlpheas looked back at Shirone.\nThat, right there, was an example of an extremely sensitive state of mind. The moment they enter the Spirit Zone, a mage can perceive the outside world with extrasensory perception. Excellent mages can even guess the number of leaves at a long distance. Of course, the skill Shuamin showed us was great, too.\nShirone, who succeeded in performing the Thunder Strike' by relying on his senses, could vaguely feel and understand it.\nShe wasnt counting the number of coins!\nShe was sensing the totality of the primitive data that existed long before that.\nTo sense the entire state of affairs in front of you\nIt was not an empty assertion to say that a master of the Spirit Zone could guess the number of leaves from far away.\nThen a question naturally followed.\nCan I as well No, perhaps I cant?\nAlpheas replied.\nAnyone can do it.\nThe Spirit Zone could be reached by anyone, but also at the same time, not just anyone could achieve it.\nThe grand total of constant effort and talent to test human limitations That was magic.\nPractice in a quiet place. You first have to feel yourself, and then dismiss it. If that happens, a different world will unfold. Do you understand what Im saying?\nAll right.\nShirone understood.\nIf you dont feel yourself, it will be impossible to erase yourself.\nAlpheas couldnt help but admire him again. That was not an insight that a 12-year-old could easily put forward.\nTwo cases occurred to him.\nEither he was a natural talent, or a mischievous acquaintance of Alpheas sent the kid to pull a prank on him.\nWould you like to give it a try? Here.\nThere was no reason to refuse, so Shirone nodded without hesitation and closed his eyes.\nRecall back to the Thunder Strike incident.\nExcept when he started to focus, it was on another level from back when he was trying to find the vital spot hidden in the grooves.\nHow much do we know about ourselves?\nWho am I?\nShirone realized for the first time how difficult it was to clearly define himself.\nI was mistaken!\nThere is just too much of me to delineate, and none of it is accurate.\nMe. What actually am I?\nAt that moment, Shirone felt a very simple truth springing up like a fish.\nAn extremely sensitive state of mind.\nAlpheas previous claim was frighteningly accurate.\nBrain.\nIts not an organ of the body.\nI I dont know the world beyond the brain.\nThe concept of the brain.\nThe truth was that all the senses and realities he accepted were actually arbitrary.\nTheres no need to define it. Just feel it. Its not that my existence gets sensitive\nOnly a keen mind would remain.\nInstead of trying to define it, Shirone erased everything he thought was himself.\nBecause if you erase it like that, eventually there would be nothing left.\nAnd finally.\n.......\nEven Shirones thoughts disappeared.\nAt one point, Shirones eyes opened wide.\nHaah. Haah.\nThe scene in front of him was peaceful.\nThe children were yawning in boredom and Shuamin was playing with her hair.\nShirone did not notice that 10 minutes had already passed.\nAlpheas wasnt expecting much.\nHe acknowledged the concentration that lasted 10 minutes, but that was not enough to succeed.\nYes, I heard it.\nAlpheas raised his eyebrows at the unexpected answer.\nOh, what did you hear?\nSounds. I heard everything.\nHoho, I see.\nAlpheas nodded as if he was expecting that result.\nAs expected, its not possible!\nIt seemed like his senses had become extra sensitive, but the things that happen in the Spirit Zone were different.\nFirst, you experienced synesthesia.\nFrom sound, you could smell. From light, you could taste. And from the shape of the landscape, you could feel it touch your skin.\nThats too bad. He was talented.\nIf he was a noble, wouldnt he have achieved something similar to the children here if he was trained from an early age?\nOf course, that alone wouldnt have caught Alpheas eyes.\nThat was because there were many children in the world who had superior skills to those of the children there.\nWell done. If you practice hard in the future, youll be able to hear more.\nAlthough reaching the Spirit Zone was not successful, that concentration training would be of help in the childs life.\nWell, thats the end of the special class today. You all go back, too.\nWhen Alpheas walked away with the children, Shirone jumped over the wall without delay.\nHe was feeling disappointed in Alpheas.\nHe was trying to be considerate when he walked away first.\nHaah. Haah.\nShirone, who crossed the wall, sat on the floor and breathed heavily.\nHis heart beat to the point that it started to hurt.\nIt really worked. It really did.",

      "content": "Chapter 4\n<<Trigger Warning: This chapter has depictions of\nSexual Harassment\n. Readers Please be Advised>>\nHe had heard a huge sound.\nMaybe it wasnt a sound, but Shirone couldnt think of any other way to express it.\nIt felt like a mouth was attached to every object around the world and had conveyed something to Shirone. All the sounds came together and eventually became one.\nIm not who I thought I was.\nIt was the world itself.\nAs he was recalling what the world had conveyed to him, one enormous truth hit his head.\nIm Infinite.\nHeuk. Huk.\nShirone, who was immensely moved, closed his eyes and dashed off.\nHe needed to run.\nDespite being trapped in his earthly body again, his mind still remembered what it was like being in the Spirit Zone.\nIm free.\nHow much time has passed?\nShrine, who wasnt paying attention to his surroundings, suddenly felt something impact his face.\nUrgh!\nWhen he fell on his back, he looked around and saw a sickening scene in an alley.\nHow did I get here?\nHe was so affected by his emotions that he couldnt remember what happened a while back, but now reality had woken him up.\nWhat the hell?! So annoying.\nA group of tramps were staring at Shirone, eyeing him like how a predator would eye prey.\nThe guy pushed by Shirone grabbed him by the collar.\nHey, you! Are you crazy?\nS-Sorry.\nSorry doesnt cut it! Be honest, you were sent by the Wolf Gang to humiliate me, werent you?!\nNo! I wasn't!\nThey noticed through Shirones eyes that he was a kid who didnt even seem to have the courage to hit a person, let alone use a knife.\nAll that was left was to go through his pockets, but they didnt think he would even have a dime with that attire of his.\nEven so, with that face of his, he could be sold for quite a lot of money.\nIts obvious that hes one of the lower commoners out there Thats even better! I wont have to take responsibility for anything that happens!\nWhile engrossed in their thoughts, a womans voice was heard outside the alley.\nWhat are you guys doing? Did something fun happen?\nThe men all turned at the same time.\nMiss Amy!\nShirone looked at Amy as if he had met his savior.\nSo young!\nShe had red-colored bangs covering one eye. She also seemed to be a girl of his age.\nHehe, what brought you here? Are you bored again?\nHe talked in a light tone, but the hands of the man approaching Amy were modestly clamped together.\nIt was a natural behavior for those who knew her identity.\nAmy Karmis.\nShe was part of the Karmis family, a family labeled to be just below the royal family in terms of hierarchy. They were the 1st-ranked nobility.\nIt was out of the ordinary for the youngest daughter of such a family to hang out with tramps, but for the adolescent girl who was tired of living, being defiant was her only joy in life.\nThis kid tried to kill someone, so were just trying to teach him some lessons.\nN-No! I bumped into him without realizing it.\nHa! As if! You want me to believe that?\nWhen the burly man raised his foot to kick Shirones stomach, Shirone curled up in panic.\nUgh.\nYou got to compensate, boy! Wheres your mom? I said go get her!\nShirone was shocked.\nDont they have parents as well? How could they curse the parents of other people like that?\nThe look in your eyes has changed. Are you upset?\nThe tramps who noticed the anger in Shirone rushed in and started beating him down.\nStop it. Youll hurt him too much.\nAs soon as the tramps backed away, she jumped down from the wooden box and approached Shirone.\nYou okay?\nI-I didnt do anything.\nNobody said anything. Im asking if youre okay.\nAmy stared at Shirones face.\nDont make such a face with just that. Its as if someone just kicked your puppy. Ive lived a much harder life than you!\nIn the eyes of others, being the only daughter of the Karmis family would seem like a privilege.\nIve lived a harder life than you. I worked my ass off to get to where I am today, so why must I sympathize with you?\nIt was also her who conquered the tramps in this back alley, where all kinds of crimes were prevalent.\nEven if it was a childish thought, the story changes depending on ones status.\nAmy turned her head to the tramps.\nWhat are you going to do now? Do you have anything more interesting in mind?\nShirone, who thought he was going to be let go, was surprised.\nOn the other hand, the tramps, who knew of Amys bad temper, spoke calmly.\nWe were planning on just checking for money then selling him away to a brothel after.\nAmy smirked.\nOf course, she had no intention of going through with what the backstreet tramps were planning to do.\nShe was planning on moderately bullying him then sending him home.\nHmm.\nAmy, who was carefully examining Shirones appearance, came up with a sadistic prank.\nThere shouldnt be any defects on a male prostitute. Why dont you take off your clothes so we can check for any?\nShe was actually a bit curious about him, and considering the fact that Shirone was a lowly commoner, she wouldnt have to take any responsibility.\nAnd to be honest, he has the looks.\nHis looks were certainly decent.\n* * *\n* * *\nTake it off. Who knows? If you do as I say, I might let you go.\nShirone was absent-minded.\nHe couldnt believe this was happening to him. These so-called humans in front of him looked like demons in his eyes.\nHow could you? Thats a really bad thing to do.\nDont you know? This is how the world runs. After all, youre just labeled as a victim because youre being harassed. Whether its this or that, its all the same for weaklings. Everyone only cares about themselves.\nThe leader of the tramps snorted.\nBecause if you were to blame the world, youd feel like youve become an adult, youd feel like youve outsmarted others.\nYoure wrong, you immature girl!\nYou talk about artifice when you havent seen nothing. You talk about pain, yet you haven't experienced true pain.\nYou dont know anything.\nLife lasts much longer than you think.\nHey! She told you to take off your clothes! You wanna get beat up again?\nAt some point, Amy began to feel a little uneasy at the unresponsive sight of Shirone.\nDid he go crazy?\nHowever, Shirone didnt go mad.\nRather, he was focused on the changes in his brain more than ever before.\nHe entered the Spirit Zone as his strained mentality became extremely sensitive to the violence he experienced for the first time.\nThis is?\nIt was definitely different from the first time he experienced it. This second time he experienced it, he was levelheaded enough to understand the information flooding his mind.\nHe could almost hear eyes blinking.\nWith the boundary between himself and the outside world torn down, Shirone sent his consciousness along the instinctive path.\nThe place his consciousness ended up in was at the memory of Alpheas teaching magic at the magic academy.\nAh\nHis insight began to collect superficial information about Alpheass emotions, senses, mind, actions, demeanor, and attitude.\nThe information was combined in a limitless pattern that went on forever. And eventually, the essential information was brought into Shirones consciousness.\nHey! Quickly get out of your clothes! The miss says she wants to see!\nAs the tramp grabbed him by the collar and shook him, Shirone almost got thrown out of the zone.\nThe Spirit Zone, which required high concentration to enter and maintain, was vulnerable to outside influence.\nThe danger was comparable to someone shaking the tightrope you were walking on.\nAmy shouted as she detected the change in Shirones eyes.\nWait! Wait a minute!\nHowever, it was already too late. Shirones will strongly distorted nature.\nBOOOM!\nAs the ferocity of the winds rose, all the physical things in the alley came to mind.\nThe wooden crates, the pebbles on the street, the thugs, and Amy, were no exception.\nAHHHHH!\nThe scream brought Shirone to his senses.\nA desolated empty alleyway appeared before him as things began to drop from the sky.\nThud! Thud! Thud Thud! Thud!\nThe heavy sound that gave Shirone goosebumps drummed the ground.\nAs gravity was a familiar thing, it was often overlooked. But the force called gravity was a much more powerful force than most people of this time could imagine.\nThe tramps who fell on their limbs, hoping to use them to survive the fall, experienced first-hand the pain of fractured limbs.\nAuughhhh\nM-My arm My leg\nTheir legs were grotesquely bent and the bones of their forearms pierced through their skin.\nShirone was taken aback.\nHe didnt expect to produce such a disastrous result.\nMeanwhile, the only person who had their body intact and in good health was Amy.\nNobles have their bodies honed from infancy, so it goes without saying that 1st-class nobles were the best skill-wise.\nAmy, who came down while holding her fluttering skirt, turned to Shirone with dumbfounded eyes.\nYou Who in the world are you?\nThe scene created by Shirone a while ago clearly showed why mages were existences to be feared.\nEven Amy, who often boasted about her unique athletic body, could not resist against the brief appearance of a whirlwind.\nAnswer me! Where did you learn that magic?! How could a commoner!\nAmy stopped talking.\nThe guards came running to the site after hearing the screams in the alley.\nAmy clicked her tongue because she knew her family. If she were to get caught, they wouldnt let this one go.\nTsk.\nShe stepped on the building, leaping and zig zagging up the walls.\nShirone, who had been staring blankly at those impressive, inhumane movements, quickly snapped back to reality.\nIm in trouble.\nIf the guards saw him here, they would interrogate him about what exactly had happened here.\nDad!\nShirone realized on that day in the city That the world was cruel to the weak.\nNo one would believe me!\nShirone turned away and frantically ran towards the only person who he could trust.\n* * *\nThe Karmis Family.\nA 1st-class powerhouse of the kingdom.\nAlthough they were not nobility from the capital, the outstanding individuals produced by the family spread throughout Thormia.\nThe only Karmiss now left in their estate were Lord Shakora, the family leader who had retired, and Amy.\nIm back.\nWhere have you been? I heard you skipped your training again.\nAlthough he was over 60 years old, he had the visage of a man in his prime.\nHe was tall, had intelligent looks, and wore glasses. Yet despite the scholarly look, knowing he was the best in the kingdom, he could not hide his pride.\nIve learned everything I needed to learn. Its not even fun.\nSo you played around with the tramps? No matter how much of a tramp you think you are, if you continue with that attitude of yours, kids of your age will end up catching up to you. Even gemstones have to be polished to become jewels. If you let your guard down, one day, you will come to regret wasting those days away.\nGosh! That nagging of yours.\nShakora smirked.\nHe understood the peculiar, pubescent child. He also understood the dissatisfaction she had toward the family.\nThe grass always seems greener on the other side.\nThe reason he was not correcting her behavior was because, unlike her brothers, she had inherited his talents.\nWhen you realize what you have, your tilted axis will automatically find its place, for that is the fate of a genius.\nAmy suddenly stopped. Thanks to her dads nagging, she remembered the morning incident from before.\nWho the hell was that?\nShe trained wholeheartedly because she hated the rumors that insisted she was where she was only because she was born into a prestigious noble family.\nHe looked to be around the same age as me.\nHe definitely wasnt taught how to fight, so how did an uneducated individual master magic?\nAn accident Or is it perhaps the awakening of talent\nThat was the only thing she could think of.\nIf you let your guard down, one day, you will come to regret wasting those days away.\nAmy bit her lower lip.\nI will never lose!\nShe swore to herself that she would never lose against someone from that social class.\nDad\nIt was a surprise to hear Amy starting up a conversation with her dad first. So to sincerely show that he was listening, he lowered the newspaper in his hands.\nYes?\nIm not really saying that I want to fully get into it But there is a subject Im interested in.\nOh?\nShakoras eyes shone in excitement.\nShe was a bright kid who could understand with just half a word.\nTell me. I will actively back you up.\nNo, Im not saying I want to devote myself to it, Im just interested in it.\nThen Ill support your interest.\nAmy was a bit bitter.\nYes, I know!\nThere was nothing difficult in the world if you had the power and wealth of a 1st-class noble family.\nHow foolish of me to think that my parents would exert any effort in trying to raise me themselves But I have no choice but to go with it.\nAmy did not understand how childish it seemed to other people to deny the Karmis family until she was beaten by a commoner.\nIm gonna become the best!\nAmy, who made her decision, spoke.\nMagic.\nMm? What was that?\nIf you know anyone from the magic academy, please introduce me.",

      "content": "Chapter 5\nShirone kept quiet about what had happened in the city.\nIt was not a simple matter. Because once he brought it up, he would have had to tell them about what happened at the magic academy.\nShirone thought back to the incredible experiences that day brought forth.\nWhether it was a blessing or a misfortune, it was clear that since he had crossed the line, there was no going back.\nGeniuses know if they are a genius, and Shirone had more or less realized that he was a bit different from others since he was young.\nAnd although he had never felt superior, his desire to overcome limitations was stronger than anyone else.\nBut he couldn't reveal it.\nHis parents were the most precious things in the world to Shirone, and he didnt want to burden them with such things, as despite the fact they were poor, they never forced him to go through a hopeless path.\nAnd due to that, daily life didnt change.\nHe helped his mom with housework and went to the nearby forest to cut down trees.\nHowever, Shirone now spent most of his time meditating, not wielding an axe.\nEvery single day since the awakening, Shirone had been secretly training the Spirit Zone.\nThanks to this, by the time a month had passed, Shirone managed to cut down the time it took him to enter the Spirit Zone.\nThere were some parts that were not as easy as he thought.\nNo matter how familiar he was with the Spirit Zone, he could not reproduce the magic from the alley.\nIts to be expected.\nHe only subconsciously managed to do it due to his instincts kicking in.\nSo even if a similar situation were to occur, and the same emotions were to surge forth again, he knew itd be difficult to do it while being aware of it.\nIf I want to rationally cast magic, Ill have to skip over insight and instead learn the middle process to know everything!\nBut there was no information available to Shirone, who had not formally learned magic.\nInstead, he focused on digging into the Spirit Zone which was the only thing he could do.\nWhen he finished meditating, he practiced the Thunder Strike.\nUnlike the first time, the success rate dropped as he began to be conscious of the skill.\nThe power of insight is incredible!\nSometimes, beginners succeeded not because of knowledge, but because of insight.\nHowever, cutting wood was different from magic, as you were able to practice doing it.\nWith each swing, Shirone corrected his mistakes one by one.\nCraaack!\nThe tree fell satisfyingly.\nBut Shirone continued to swing his axe without a look of satisfaction or happiness.\nHe was just correcting a mistake he found.\nTomorrow, as well as the day after that\nThat was how he repeated the basics.\nFor the chance to practice magic will come one day.\nWhile dragging the logs home, Shirones eyes shone with intensity as this was the most motivated he had ever been.\n* * *\nStanding by the window, Shirone looked at the magnificent view of late autumn leaves flying through the mountains.\n3 years had passed, and he was now a 15-year-old boy.\nHe still wore childish clothing, but he had a face handsome enough to turn heads.\nIll be back, mom.\nTake it easy. We have plenty of wood.\nIts gonna be winter soon. We have to be prepared.\nHe let out a cold breath as he left the cabin.\nSince seasons arrived faster in the mountains than in the cities, snow was already piled up at the top of the mountain.\nIll have to walk quickly if I want to be back before sunset.\nShirone wasnt scared of the cold as he spent three years training in the Spirit Zone, and due to this, his mental fortitude had already exceeded the level of normal adults.\nAfter his shy character disappeared, he hung out with the other children, but he had no particularly close friends.\nThey were different from Shirone.\nThe children of the mountain were all rough, and most of the girls thought the same way as well.\nFor example, a year ago, a woman named Hauran from a Hwajeonmin Village once seduced Shirone.\nTL/N: Hwajeonmin Village refers to a place where people who practice the slash-and-burn agricultural technique live.\nWhen she, who was six years older, tried to approach physically, Shirone freaked out and refused.\nThen she suddenly changed and threatened to ransack his house if he told anyone about what happened.\nShirone, who recalled the event, burst into laughter.\nIt didnt end up happening, but he remembered being really perturbed about her coming.\nIm sure shes doing well!\nArriving at the logging area, Shirone found a suitable tree and lightly swung his axe. Afterwards, he took a careful look at the dent he had made.\n......\nIf you were thinking of the commonly referred concept of seeing, he was actually not looking at anything.\nIts not something you can find with your eyes!\nYou may automatically realize the principle if you repeat the same action or thoughts over and over.\nShirone, who had swung his axe in numerous ways over the past three years, was finally catching on.\nFeel with my eyes.\nIt was a method called Inner Eye.\nShirones eyes changed for a moment as he swung at the dent with strong force, unlike before.\nFollowing the sound of thunder, the tree fell down.\nThat succeeded with just two tries!\nAlthough luck was on his side this time, he had succeeded with 10 tries before anyways.\nWhoo.\nAfter finishing his quota, Shirone sat down on the stump of the fallen tree and entered the Spirit Zone.\nCurrently, his Spirit Zones domain was a sphere with a diameter of about 40 meters, which was the level of an upperclassman at the magic academy where those who were talented gathered.\nThe shaking of the bushes was felt, the sounds of worms wriggling, and the sound of osmosis from the trees entered his ears vividly. It was as if the earth had assimilated into him.\nNature changed constantly, and Shirone felt it.\nThe five hours of savoring the dynamic world went by in an instant.\nHuh? Its already dark?\nAfter completing his meditation, Shirone split the wood into pieces and carried it to the Jige.\nTL/N: Jige is a traditional Korean A-framed carrier used in the past to carry heavy materials.\nArriving home, Shirone found a carriage in the yard and examined the stable.\nTwo white horses he had never seen before were eating the fodder.\nIm back.\nNo usual greeting welcomed him.\nThe atmosphere was strange.\nHis mothers face was dark, and in the living room, an old man he saw for the first time was talking to his father.\nHuh? Dad? When did you come back?\nYoure home?\nFor someone who left at dawn to go sell materials, he returned fairly quickly.\nIn addition, he would have drowned him with kisses, but this time he remained seated in his chair.\nSay hello, Shirone. He is the deputy butler of the Ogent family.\nThe old man approached.\nHello, Im Temuran.\n* * *\n* * *\nNice to meet you. My name is Shirone.\nShirone politely greeted.\nShirone, who lived deep in the mountains, also knew about the noble family, Ogent.\nThey were 2nd-class nobles located in Creas. They were known for producing skilled warriors and soldiers.\nI came to see you.\nAlthough the deputy butler was a commoner, Temurans tone was imbued with the characteristic sensibility of a noble.\nThe status system of Thormia was divided into nobles and commoners, but in reality, it wasnt as simple as just that.\nThose who worked closely with the aristocracy were more authoritative, and those who lived outside the castle, like the Vincent family, were often called and treated as the lowest commoners.\nEven so\nWhy did someone of the highest status among commoners come all the way to this valley in the mountain?\nThen Ill be taking a look.\nTemuran felt around Shirones body and examined his appearance, physique, and eyes.\nShirone was offended for being treated like livestock, but while Shirone was thinking that, Temuran said something.\nDo you know how to read?\nYes. Ive been reading since I was young.\nHmm.\nShirones patience has also reached its limit.\nId like to know whats going on. Can you tell me?\nTemurans eyes grew cold\nYou have a pretty good reputation. Being the son of a mountaineer, you know how to read, and youre very devoted to your parents.\nTemuran said in a borderline mocking tone.\nWhat the\nAs soon as Shirone tried to reply back, a shocking proposal left Temurans lips.\nWould you like to work for the Ogent family?\nWhat?\nShirone felt as if he had been struck by lightning.\nWhat now?\nNo, that didnt matter because it would mean working for a 2nd-class noble family.\nThe family is relocating the Great Library. Its not work just anyone can do. There are about 10,000 books that cannot be leaked. The porters will do the heavy work, but the classification work will only be done by you and me. Itll take about two years.\nLibrary!\nShirones heart almost burst.\nHis excellent insight had a gut feeling that something ominous lay behind the suggestion, but he felt like he could take on any poison.\nTemuran told Shirone the kind of poison he had to drink.\nWhich was his pride to not use cheap tricks against a commoner.\nYou and your family are the only ones who know of this. If for any reason a book is leaked, or if rumors spread, you and your family are dead.\nShirone then understood why the expressions of his parents were dark.\nEven if he promised not to reveal anything, no one knew what could happen in those 2 years. It was like entrusting your life to someone else.\nAnd yet, the reason why Shirone couldnt turn down the offer was probably because\nWell compensate you with enough money to live a good life. You will earn a lot more compared to your father. Hah, thanks to having a good child, it looks like the family is going to make a living.\nVincent spoke with a red face.\nI didnt hear your proposal because of the money! I just wish that Shirone That he!\nTears welled up.\nA rare opportunity brought by a loving father who wanted only to help his son achieve his dreams And yet said opportunity could end up killing his son.\n...My only wish is for my son to achieve his dreams.\nTemuran snorted.\nWhat are you thinking? Arent you getting ahead of yourself? Wake up. Im only hiring. You were the one who asked me to use your son. Theres no reason for such a request unless its for money.\nYou said he can read books!\nOf course he can read books if hed like. But Im not asking for him to read it, Im saying that its impossible to perfectly keep an eye on him. Thats why Im saying youre dead if anything is leaked. Its a minimal safeguard.\nVincent clenched his teeth.\nHe heard, when he went to sell goods, that the deputy butler of a noble family was looking for a commoner who could read.\nHe thought it was an opportunity from heaven, so he ran to Temuran and begged him to use Shirone.\nBut he didnt expect him to say that.\nImagining his son getting hurt Was the thing that frightened him the most. What if he thinks that his dad sold his child away because he was blinded by money?\nPlease leave. We dont need any money. If I knew this was gonna happen, I wouldnt have begged. So please, leave.\nDad, Ill do it.\nShirone!\nTemuran looked back at Shirone, not expecting that.\nYoull have to risk your life.\nIt was quite the frightening job for a 15-year-old boy.\nAre you sure? Im not trying to scare you. Im telling you in advance that even a small rumor will lead to a blade next to your throat.\nYes, Ill do it. I wont ever leak anything, and I'll not blame anything or anyone if a rumor were to spread for some reason. So let me do it.\nTemuran couldnt help but trust him.\nAll the conditions were perfect.\nHe was a lowly commoner that could be killed anytime, had deep filial piety, and intelligence.\nFeeling his travel was worth the effort, Temuran turned around.\nIll come pick you up in a week, but if you change your mind in the meantime, you can always tell me. But remember, once in the mansion, you wont be able to leave until were done.\nTermuran opened the door and walked out, but his family wasn't in the mood to open the door for him.",

      "content": "Chapter 6\nVincent grabbed Shirone by the shoulders and shouted.\nShirone! Why did you That was a very dangerous thing to do! No, its all my fault! Its because this father of yours is ignorant! Lets just turn it down!\nIts all right, dad. The only thing we have to do is to keep our mouths shut.\nIts not that simple! How can you keep your job a secret? Its crazy no matter how much I think about it! I will take responsibility for the refusal!\nShirone shook his head side to side.\nHe was fortunate that he had good parents.\nFather.\nVincent abruptly stopped, looking dazed at the sudden way Shirone addressed him for the first time.\nWhat was more shocking, however, were the tears falling from Shirones eyes.\nSh-Shirone.\nThank you.\nSaid Shirone, who opened his arms while having a big smile on his face.\nYou gave me the biggest gift in the whole world.\nHeuk!\nVincent cried, not caring whether hed lose face or not.\nIn his entire life, had he ever seen his sons face filled with that much joy?\nDont worry, Shirone! No matter what happens, I will protect you! Dont worry about anything and work hard! I will protect you for sure!\nDad, Ill do my best.\nYes, my son! My precious son!\nAnd the mother, Olina, was also wiping away her tears of happiness at the touching sight of her husband and son.\n* * *\nA week later.\nThe butlers of the Ogent family came to pick up Shirone.\nIt was a project that would take more than two years, but Shirone, who lived a simple life, only packed one bag.\nTemuran decided to give 20 gold a month on the condition that Shirone would live with him. In comparison, the monthly income of Shirones family was only four gold, so it was a huge increase for a hunter family.\nWill this house be a little more luxurious when I come back?\nHe knew what his parents were like, but Shirone tried to imagine something happy and shook off his sorrow.\nThe butlers proceeded with the contract in a hurry, and a distracted Vincent had to send his son away in the carriage without a proper farewell.\nIts just the beginning!\nContrary to his worries, Shirones mind was calm.\nHe didnt show his parents, but he had decided that from now on, he would only make calculated, logical decisions that were not dependent on emotions.\nEntering the Spirit Zone, Shirone felt his anxious parents through synesthesia.\nPR/N:\nSynesthesia is a fancy name for when you experience one of your senses through another.\nDont worry!\nIn that instance, Vincent and Olinas hearts suddenly warmed.\nShirone\nIt wasnt magic.\nIt was just that their sons feelings were conveyed.\nLets go!\nThe moment the carriage rattled, Shirone bounced out from the Spirit Zone, but his closed eyes did not open.\nLets not get shaken up! Have to stay focused!\nWhile entering the Ogent family was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it also came with huge risks. The opportunity was a double-edged sword.\nCould he survive two years while living amongst the rich and powerful?\nI have to concentrate!\nLeaving himself to an unknown future, Shirone plunged back into the Spirit Zone.\n* * *\nThe Ogent family was a household that produced nation-approved Grade 3 swordsmen, which in the military corresponded to the rank of General.\nThe family leader, Lord Bischoff Ogent, is a nation-approved Grade 4 knight. He is currently serving as a military commander in the city of Creas. In short, he is a big shot who commands this citys military.\nUpon their arrival, Shirone, while listening to a butlers explanation, looked at the main gate of the Ogent family.\nWow!\nIn the center of the enormous mansion, a huge road opened up.\nThats the Ogent familys Broad Way. When you think of the Ogent Family, you also think of the Broad Way.\nThe road that stretched far without any obstacles revealed the characteristics of the family.\nHehe, are you scared? Youre not already surprised, are you? Theyre the real deal.\nWatch your words. You want your head to fly?\nAn old male servant snapped.\nHowever, due to the fact that he could relate to some extent, the butler said no more.\nCome this way.\nThe Broad Way was not a road for butlers or servants.\nShirone turned to the garden path next to the road and bypassed the mansion.\nThe place where the male workers were situated was a four-story, circular building. And in the office of said building was where the deputy butler, Temuran, resided.\nYoure here? Follow me, Ill explain the work.\nYes. Ill do my best.\nTemuran, who did not even receive a greeting, headed to the library with thick documents.\nAs soon as the old iron gate was opened, a scenery that Shirone dreamed of unfolded.\nA world of books.\nOn the second, third, and fourth floor, all he could see were bookshelves filled with books.\nWhoa\nSmelling the rich scent of paper, Shirone clenched his fist.\nIt was worth risking his life.\nWe will be moving the books here to the new library. All you have to do is sort the books. Ill give you a list every week, so find and gather those. You work from 9 in the morning to 6 in the evening. You cant go outside and you cant enter the mansion without special orders. But other than that, youre free to do what you want. As for the worker rules, another butler shall tell you of them. Do you understand?\nYes. When do I start?\nTomorrow. Unpack and rest for today. In the meantime, make sure you understand all the rules a male worker needs to follow.\nThe next day, Shirone went to the library to get to work.\nWhen he started working, he finally realized why only one person had to do this job.\nThe list given by Temuran contained hundreds of titles, and among those, the classification criteria was subjective.\nFor example, it was unclear whether the book\nHistory of Swordsmanship\nshould be classified as a history book or a book for swordsmanship.\nMr. Temuran has set the framework anyway. As long as it doesnt go far off from the criteria I set!\nShirone had set his order of priorities.\nSince history was comprehensive and swordsmanship was technical, the\nHistory of Swordsmanship\nwas classified as a book under the swordsmanship category.\nIt took as much as two weeks to set his own criteria in this way.\nOf course, even this kind of work was beneficial.\nThis was because in the process of establishing his own category system, Shirone had realized a fact that he had not known before.\nAll knowledge was connected.\nThe work gradually became easier, and soon afterwards, he was able to reach the targeted quantity each day in time.\nIm going to start reading now!\nHe wanted to use his time efficiently as all the knowledge here would become a huge weapon for him in the near future.\nOkay, there are 10,000 books in front of me.\nEven with the approximate two years left, it was impossible to read all the books.\nWhere should I start? Would it be best to just start off with a random book?\nSuddenly, a thought came to mind.\nRight!\nAll knowledge is connected, so as long as you dig into one field first, youll be able to strengthen another later.\nThen which field should I study first?\nAfter repeatedly thinking over it, the corner of Shirones mouth went up.\nHistory.\nIt was the core of all knowledge. Events and discoveries were recorded in chronological order.\nShirone imagined the concept of history as a horizontal line.\nIf zoomed in, the line would contain all human knowledge, including religion, science, magic, mythology, literature, arts, politics, war, and economy.\nLearning history will greatly shorten the time it takes to reinforce other fields of study. History is truly the Core of Knowledge.\nAccording to his self-written classification list, there were approximately 850 books.\nShirone made up his mind.\nIll read all the 850 books in the two years I have left. This will be my foundation!\nFrom that day on, Shirone read books without going back to his lodging, even after his work was over.\nHe could skip the roll call using overtime as an excuse.\nIn fact, except for Temuran, the deputy butler, there were no workers who cared about Shirone, a temp.\nIts difficult!\nReading history books was a pain in the neck for Shirone.\nThe specific names of places on the continent, famous figures, and the events that occurred could not be easily memorized by a boy who grew up in a mountain for 15 years without ever hearing about them.\nShould I just memorize the whole thing?\nShirone shook his head.\nWhile its important to memorize it, its more important to be able to pull it out of my mind anytime. Understanding even a single event is the quickest way to building a proper foundation!\nIt wasnt easy understanding history.\nThis was because he had to identify in depth why such an incident was inevitable and how it had affected the future.\nEfficiency had dropped significantly and it had reached a point where Shirone couldnt finish a book even after a week.\nNaturally, the days he slept in the library became more frequent, and he would, at times, collapse as if he were about to faint.\nFour in the morning.\nThe iron gate opened and Temuran with a crystal lamp came in.\nTemuran would come in at this time every day to check on Shirone, who was oblivious to this fact.\nHis eyes turned to the book at Shirones feet.\nIts the same!\nEven though it was not a difficult one to read, the book had not changed for the past 15 days.\nTemuran snorted.\nIf Shirone was furiously mastering those practical books, he was going to ban him from accessing the library aside from working hours.\nBut it was complete nonsense. He was a fool who dreamed an absurd dream.\nOf course. Being a child of lowly commoners, what kind of success could you have?\nWhile you have to be smart to get ahead in terms of studies, you also have to be clever and know how to think intelligently.\nTemuran, who only thought of Shirone as a child with a nonsensical, grand dream, thought he was far from promising.\n* * *\n* * *\nThree months later.\nShirone gradually got more used to the classifying job. He also learned several pieces of information through the male servants.\nThe most shocking fact of all was that the nobles didnt care if the books were leaked.\nIn any case, the busy nobles who already had a lot on their plates were not interested in whether or not a few books were to disappear.\nBut that did not indicate less danger.\nAn aristocrat could only have a laid-back attitude if he had the loyalty of the commoners.\nServants, to prevent even the tiniest of mistakes, could become cold and heartless.\nCommoners had to risk their lives in order to not catch the attention of the nobles.\nShirone could tell just how different the two lines of thinking were from each other.\nThen one afternoon, the library door opened and he heard an unfamiliar boys voice.\nHaah That old man. On a day like this, who cares if I rest a bit.\nShirone blinked as an uninvited guest had made a sudden appearance.\nThat person is\nIt was Rian Ogent, the youngest son of the Lord.\nHaving the blood of a mighty knight, he had a masculine, rugged face, and even though they were the same age, he was a head taller than Shirone.\nShirone's train of thought was suddenly interrupted by a shout coming from outside the library.\nRian! How dare you run away! Once I catch you, youll be made to run another hundred laps!\nArgh! Damn it!\nRian, who was running between the bookshelves, finally found Shirone.\nRian, who was running towards Shirone, grabbed Shirones shoulders suddenly and said.\nHey! Dont tell him Im here, okay?\nThen, whilst he hid himself under the bookshelf, an old mans thunderous roar shook the library.\nRian! I know youre hiding here!\nAlthough he was a gray-haired old man, his shoulders were wide. He was also tall enough to remind Shirone of a giant.\nYou! A boy as tall as a peanut with blue hair came in here, right?\nShirone thought about it.\nHe did know the blue-haired boy, but if the blue-haired boy was the size of a peanut, what did he look like in the eyes of this old man?\nFrom what I saw, he looked like the youngest young master. But excuse me, who are you?\nShirone intended to change the subject, but the veteran saw through the boys mind.\nIm a swordsman instructor! Im saying that Im the teacher who has the right to beat up that peanut. Youd better tell me quickly, unless you wanna get beat up.\nShirone pursed his lips.\nAnyone who taught the young master under the orders of the Lord was not a person who could get fooled by the words of a boy.\nOh, I see. The youngest young master is hiding under that bookshelf over there.\nHey! Are you crazy? You wanna die?\nRian crawled out with a frown.\nThen, he discovered his swordsman instructor, who came up close to him. He started to tremble in fear.\nMaster! This is a misunderstanding!\nYou rascal!\nThe swordsman grabbed Rian by the collar and threw him to the ground.\nAs soon as Rians body fell, Shirone closed his eyes.\nRian hit the floor with a loud noise, as his limbs were spread out on the ground due to the shock.\nFollow me, you punk! Forget training! You need to be mentally trained again!\nHis instructor dragged him out with his legs. With an upside down view, Rian faced Shirone.\nAnd mouthed something.\nEven though no voice was heard, and only the shape of the mouth was passed on, Shirone heard it clearly.\nYoull pay for this.",

      "content": "Chapter 7\nAfter that day, the back of Shirones head itched almost daily. But Rian did not show up.\nAccording to the rumors, he got caught by his instructor and was taken to the mountains.\nIt wasnt until a month later that Shirone relaxed.\nHumans were oblivious creatures. As long as nothing big or significant occured, it would soon be forgotten.\nNo way he has a grudge simply because of that.\nWith a light heart, Shirone started reading about the founding of the Kingdom of Thormia, his country.\nThe number of books he had read over the past four months was 82.\nThough not a large number, his reading speed gradually sped up as the number of completed books increased.\nMy prediction wasnt wrong!\nThe first book took 20 days to complete.\nHowever, after fully understanding the first book, many things got easier for Shirone.\nNo books he read, following the first, had any completely new information.\nThere was only a difference in degree of complexity, but the same information would repeatedly appear.\nNo need to be scared. Its only hard the first time!\nIf he were to lay the foundation with about 200 books first, the remaining 650 books would be much easier to take in.\nShirones favorite part of history was definitely the mages active role in it.\nIf a scholar studied a theory, the mages were the ones who implemented said theory.\nAccording to this relationship, the occupations of mages were as diverse as the many fields of study.\nNevertheless, the reason why all scholars were not mages was because they could not enter the extremely sensitive state of mind: Spirit Zone.\nIn addition to the variety of knowledge, a mage must have sensitive senses.\nTherefore, Shirone, who had already mastered the Spirit Zone, was even more frighteningly immersed in building up his knowledge.\nHe suppressed his curiosity towards more miscellaneous subjects, and dug through only history.\nI have to hold myself back!\nShirone suppressed his urges in order to gain the endless efficiency that would come with the Core of Knowledge.\nWhen that efficiency finally arrives, just what kind of mage would Shirone become?\nIt was a waste of time to think about stuff like that.\nWhoo.\nAfter reading the last page of the founding history, Shirone closed the book with a satisfied expression.\nAt that moment, the door burst open.\nHey, you jerk! I went through hell while waiting for today to come!\nIt was Rian Ogent who returned from hell.\nTo call him an incarnation of the devil with that malicious face of his would not be an understatement.\nSo persistent!\nHe harbored the same amount of anger as when he was dragged by his swordsman instructor a while back.\nIf Shirone was to point out any difference, it was that his eyes were sunken and his body appeared thinner.\nAre you really here for that?\nOf course. Do you know how much trouble I went through? I climbed and climbed the cliff countless times. Everytime I thought I would fall to my death due to my waning strength, I managed to hold on as I NEEDED to get my revenge!\nShirone was anxious.\nIf he had been growing that hatred everyday, then Shirone must look like a sworn enemy to him.\nArent you going to answer? You thinking about saying empty words? Im asking why the heck you snitched on me that day, you coward! I feel sick when I see guys like you!\nI didnt rat on you, I just told the truth.\nI asked you for a favor. Why didnt you tell me that you werent going to help me? I trusted you.\nShirone gave up persuading because he couldnt deal with the reasoning of an aristocrat.\nThen what should I have done?\nRian looked slightly taken aback by the unexpected attitude.\nHe looked like a butler who had just started working for his family, but he looked so calm.\nAlright, youre ignoring me too, arent you? You must have heard something from somewhere, but Ill show you clearly who I am. Follow me.\nShirone followed Rian.\nJudging from the degree of his anger, he seemed to be thinking of taking him somewhere to beat him to the brink of death.\nIts better than dying. Lets just let him do whatever he wants to do to me. Whether it be hitting or mistreating me.\nHe couldnt throw away the opportunity that his parents risked their lives for.\nWhenever he felt fear, he imagined his parents enjoying their meals.\nIt was a small exercise hall where they arrived.\nSince the family revered martial arts, there were several large and small exercise halls in the mansion. But the place they were now was a place dedicated to Rian, and no one would hear if they screamed.\nShirone waited with a dry mouth while Rian lit the torch.\nHe wished they could just start quickly because each passing second made him more and more uncomfortable.\nMaybe it was on purpose.\nBut if Shirone were a swordsman, he wouldve known this level of tension on a battlefield was normal.\nHere, take this.\nAs the training ground lit up, Rian threw a wooden sword towards Shirone.\nThe wooden sword, which clung to Shirones hand with a loud slap, had a handle thicker than that of an axe's.\nWhy are you giving this to me?\nA duel. Im not as cowardly as you. Im destined to become the greatest swordsman in the future. But enough about that, This is my way of paying you back for snitching on me.\nShirone thought that was ridiculous.\nHow was I cowardly?\nAs a servant of the Ogent, you have to protect the Ogent. You sold me out to my master because you were afraid of getting beaten. Someone was in trouble, and yet you sold them out. No matter how much Im ignored by my family, I cannot be treated the same way by a guy like you, so bring it on. Considering the gap between us, Ill allow you to come at me three times before I start.\nRians look changed.\nAlthough he seemed to have a simple, ignorant personality, those eyes of his were certainly Ogent.\nShirone, who responded to the fighting spirit, was holding the wooden sword tightly with both hands.\nIn other words, after his three chances were up, he knew his bones were going to be broken.\nVarious thoughts crossed his mind.\nWhat do I do? What can I do?\nIn the midst of despair, Shirone did not give up.\nNo matter how unlikely it was, he couldnt just not try.\nHere I come!\nShirones spirit, which was showcased through his raised sword aggressive rush, was unexpected, but Rian simply snorted.\nHis posture is awful.\nHes never wielded a sword!\nAs Rian blocked Shirones attack, he shouted.\nOne!\nSmack! A satisfying sound spread through the training ground.\nTo Shirone, it sounded like the footsteps of a lion strangling someones neck.\nHe transformed the fear in his stomach to a loud shout and tried to slash his sword horizontally.\nTwo!\nThis time, one corner of Rians mouth rose as he easily blocked the slash.\nShirone choked up, he pulled himself together and entered a state of extreme concentration.\nSpirit Zone!\nAs all kinds of information were integrated into synesthesia, a light bulb went off in his head.\nRian snorted.\n* * *\n* * *\nVertical slash, horizontal slash, vertical slash?\nNo matter how new a beginner was, it would have been harder not to block such a simple pattern.\nRian, who raised his wooden sword to block Shirones attack, took a step and shouted.\nNow its my tur\nCRAACK!\nThe center of Rians wooden sword shattered, and Shirones wooden sword broke as well.\nFragments of wood flew past Rian who had a face of astonishment.\nHuh?\nRian quickly came to his senses and took a good few steps back to look at the wooden sword.\nThe grain of the cross sectioned part of the sword stood up rough.\nThis was a characteristic that occurred when the force of impact was not released properly and remained inside.\nThat That was Sword Smash, wasnt it?\nA skill to destroy weapons.\nJust as there was an infinite amount of ways to perform a slash in swordplay, there was also more than one method to destroy weapons in every school.\nThe Ogent family called theirs Sword Smash, and it was a Secret Technique that was only handed down directly.\nThe reason why it was labeled a Secret Technique was because it was not a skill that one could master with strength alone.\nIn close-quarters combat, the absorption of power is as diverse as the weight of it.\nIn order for Sword Smash to succeed, one needed to perfectly pinpoint the area in which the shock would not be spread. It was also necessary to understand the opponent as to ensure they could not dissipate it themselves.\nRian was shocked.\nEven Rian, who had been wielding a sword ever since he was born, never succeeded in executing Sword Smash.\nMost of all, he was offended because he was the only member of the family who had not yet mastered the technique.\nWho the hell are you? Where did you learn that swordsmanship?\nShirone dropped his broken sword.\nHe sensed with the first blow and analyzed Rian with the second blow.\nAnd on the third blow, he did it, The Thunder Strike he had practiced for three years.\nI never learned any swordsmanship!\nShut up! Youre rotten to the core! How did you succeed in doing Sword Smash?! If youre trying to make fun of me, I wont let you off so easily!\nThat was Thunder Strike.\nThunder Strike?\nMy father is a hunter. Since I used to live in the mountains, I used to cut down a lot of trees. Since I was neither big nor strong, I had to learn how to cut down trees in a more technical way. It naturally came to me. Among the lumberjacks, this skill is called Thunder Strike.\nRians thoughts were all tangled up.\nMountaineer? You went around cutting trees? What the hell are you talking about? Ive been holding a sword for 15 years now. Sword Smash is not a skill you can learn through cutting trees.\nNone of my peers ever succeeded in casting Sword Smash. But if I had to name someone who could\nRian thought of one.\nRai Ogent!\nHe was the second son of the Ogent family. He was two years older than Rian.\nHe was also a genius in swordsmanship. Hes considered to have the greatest talent in the history of the Ogent family.\nRian clenched his fist tightly because he envisioned his brother laughing at him.\nDamn it!\nRai first succeeded in executing Sword Smash at the young age of 12.\nHis family gathered to celebrate and their father held a week-long party.\nRian clearly remembered his emotions on that day, as now, even the child of a mountaineer had surpassed him.\nI cant accept it!\nHe let out a thundering cry as he needed to vent his emotions.\nButwhy?\nHow come he became something While Im still a nobody\nYoung master, Ive shown grave disrespect\nShut up! Nothings over yet! No ones lost!\nRian headed to the outskirts of the training grounds.\nThere, equipped with various weapons, he returned with a high-class long sword used by aristocrats.\nThe sight of the sword gave Shirone shivers.\nPerhaps\nThe sword, which made a ringing sound as it was drawn, reflected the torch.\nOnce he finished checking the blade, Rian put it back in the sheath and threw it to Shirone.\nRaising his head in confusion, he stepped forward in order to catch the sword with both hands.\nRian spoke while stretching out his fingers.\nSince both of our weapons broke, let us consider this match a tie. If you really mastered Sword Smash, then well have to account for that. One month from now on, lets compete here with real swords.\nAh\nShirones heart dropped.\nHe just wanted to survive, but he somehow made the situation worse.\nWooden swords and real swords were on totally different levels. In addition, Rian would not be giving him three chances like before.\nI might actually die this time!\nThe faces of his parents came to Shirones mind, as he felt the fear of death for the time.\nYoung master, please change your mind! I never even learned swordsmanship!\nThats why Im giving you a month. You learned Sword Smash while cutting down trees? Although I cant believe it, if youre that smart, you should be able to come up with something in a month.\nRian didnt think it was unreasonable. It would have been possible for Ogent Rai.\nHe saw his brother in Shirone.\nYeah, I just didnt have enough resolve.\nDont even think about running away. Regardless of my personal feelings, I will definitely surpass you.\nRian's last words tied Shirone down.",

      "content": "Chapter 8\nThe following day.\nShirone, with a tired face, went to work in the library. He couldnt sleep a wink due to what happened yesterday.\nDue to having a lot on his mind, he couldnt speed up his work.\nLets calm down.\nAfter struggling to calm himself down, Shirone was eventually able to regain his composure.\nIm not dying now. I still have a month. Ill be able to figure something out.\nFirst of all, background check.\nAccording to the information he gathered, Lord Bischoff had three sons and one daughter.\nThe eldest son was a certified Grade 6 swordsman. The second son was also a genius swordsman who followed in his brothers footsteps.\nThe eldest daughter was also talented, but she chose music over swords and was working as a royal pianist.\nAnd after figuring out all that, he noticed Rian was the only one who failed to stand out in the end.\nThe Lord even provided him an exclusive teacher, but the reports claimed he was not talented.\nHaah, I shouldnt have done that. I should have just accepted the hits when he was adamant on beating me.\nIt was natural that Rian, who had been compared to his brother all his life, was angry at the Thunder Strike.\nIt seemed that not all nobles were born to excel.\nNow what? Im in big trouble.\nAgitated again, Shirone stared blankly at the real sword, which had been left unattended under the desk.\nI dont have time for this.\nShirone jumped up and headed for the study.\nWhether I fight or not, its always better to be prepared!\nSince he lived in the mountains, Shirone was confident in his stamina and level of fitness, so if he were to learn self-defense, he would be able to at least save his life.\nAfter putting aside the history books for the time being, he collected all the books related to swordsmanship.\nWhile there were technical books like the\nSword Textbook\n, there were philosophical books such as\nWhat is Sword?\nand\nOnly Humans Are Afraid of the Sword\n.\nPractical books such as\nLets Win With Bluff\nand\nThe Stronger Individual Is the Survivor\nwere also seen.\nShirone opened a book with the simple and clear title of\nSwordsmanship\n.\nIt was a book that contained the history of swordsmanship as well as overall knowledge about it.\nIt was also an interesting book in the eyes of the aspiring mage, Shirone.\nIf mages had the Spirit Zone, swordsmen had something called the Schema.\nSchema was both an imaginary body and a schematic of the human body.\nEvery human had their own body image, and the Schema was an extreme embodiment of it.\nMasters of Schema would say that they could fully understand their body and be involved in how their cells moved as well as how their nerves sent signals.\nShirone put down the book and slapped his knee.\nIts nearly identical to Spirit Zone.\nA mage would erase their existence and assimilate with the world, but a swordsman did the opposite and further dug into themselves.\nShirone attempted Schema.\nFeeling an imaginary self while maintaining the senses just before entering the Spirit Zone.\nAs expected, its not too difficult yet.\nHowever, the imaginary body was dark as a shadow and could not be felt.\nIf I were to remove this dark curtain, it would become Schema. It's truly incredible.\nShirone picked up the book again.\nIt was written that the method of mastering Schema varied widely from family to family and that prioritizing specific parts to strengthen it depended on the method.\nWhile there were families that unlocked Schema to simply develop the mind, there were also families that drove the body to the limit.\nSome families focused on muscle strength, some speed, and some used Schema to strengthen nerves.\nCome to think of it\nShirone recalled the red-haired girl from the alley three years ago.\nAt that time, the situation was hectic, but when he thought about it back at home, her movements were not something a normal human could do.\nShe unlocked Schema. She was about the same age as me What great talent.\nShirone closed the book and ruminated.\nRian couldnt have mastered Schema anyways, but Shirone wanted to try doing so, even if there was a barrier.\nSchema is not exactly swordsmanship. Just like how Spirit Zone is not exactly magic.\nJust like how knowledge was significant to a mage, a strong body was essential for a swordsman.\nIf ones body is not supported, the width of reinforcement is extremely narrow. I already have the Spirit Zone, so it would be faster to find a solution to swordsmanship rather than trying to accommodate two completely different concepts!\nIt was a strategy to learn some useful swordsmanship with the Spirit Zone as the base.\nGood.\nShirone opened a beginners textbook in swordsmanship.\nKnowing that his life was on the line, Shirones concentration was at its highest ever despite having to suddenly study swordsmanship, a subject he previously did not have much interest in.\n* * *\nARGH! ARGH!\nDust rose in the Great Training Grounds. Rians legs were the culprit.\nHis heart was about to burst. No oxygen was being inhaled, so the chyme in his stomach flowed back up.\nBlaaargh! Blaaargh!\nHis lunch came out, but Rian did not falter and continued to run.\n100 laps! Pass!\nThe swordsman, Kite, shouted. Rian looked different today, and as his instructor, he couldnt have been any more proud.\nNew record! But what happened to you? Why just start to flow with the training now?\nDamn it! You call this training?\nWhat did you say, you punk?\nKite looked at him with slit-eyes.\nHe complimented him for the first time in a while, but old habits die hard. All Rian did was complain and grumble.\nBut todays whining was different.\nIm still standing on my two legs! Master, is there anything harder?\nOho?\nKite was quite surprised.\nIts been a while since hes shown such zeal.\nIt was the first time in two years since he knelt before the genius of Rai Ogent.\nYou. Something happened, right?\nWith his hands on his knees, Rian raised his sweating head.\n...Theres nothing like that.\nKite did not believe him.\nWith the eyes of his disciple staring ahead in such a frightening way, Kite knew something was definitely bothering him.\nIs it Rai again?\nNo matter how much he thought about it, the only person who could make Rian this way was the second son of the family.\nDid Rai accomplish something again? But what? Didnt Rai already unlock his Schema?\nIt didnt matter. His disciple was Rian, not Rai. And currently, he was bearing his neck, allowing him to push Rian to his hearts content.\nGood! Lets go hard today! Even if you were to die, I want you to know that I wont be responsible for it!\nBring it on!\n* * *\n* * *\nRian swung an iron bar twice as heavy as a longsword.\nThere was no limit on the number of times he had to swing, for if you couldnt realize Schema with your insight, then the only way was to push your body to its limits.\nHa! Ha! Ha!\nKite watched his student repeatedly cut vertically with satisfaction.\nBut not long afterwards, his expression hardened.\nAt last he realized and ran towards Rian with his eyes wide.\nYou crazy! Stop it! Youll burst your muscles!\nThey havent burst yet!\nKite stopped himself.\nTears were flowing down from Rian's eyes as he clenched his teeth and continued to swing the iron bar.\nDamn it! Why arent my muscles exploding! Why cant I break my arm? I can do more! This isnt the end! Im not done yet!\nTears welled up in Kites eyes.\nHe was a teacher who was as upset as his student.\nHow come its not working? Hes pushed his body to the limits So why cant he open Schema?\nKite wiped away the tears with his thick arms.\nThis shouldnt be the case. What would become of Rian if even his own teacher were to doubt him?\nKite intercepted Rians iron bar.\nThis time, Rian did not protest and stopped moving because his teacher had stopped him with his own hand.\nRian, thats enough. Lets call it a day.\nRians madness disappeared with that warm voice, and with that, his arms gave out, and without even knowing that the bar had fallen to the ground, Rian replied with his head down.\nOkay. Thank you.\nKite wrapped an ice towel around Rians shoulders. Seeing that the bones were not damaged, he was surprised at the sturdiness of Rians bones.\nSitting on the hill of the training grounds, Rian was staring at the distant mountain with a fierce expression.\nWhat are you thinking about?\nThat my arms are killing me.\nThere was a small smile on Kites face.\nRian, Ive never written about your talent in a report.\nTsk, did I ask?\nBut I think youre talented. Achieving something quickly is not the only indicator of talent. Reaching for the unachievable is a talent as well.\nYou dont have to comfort me. Its only those words that are sweet. Frankly speaking, Im only working this hard because Im not talented.\nIs it really though? A genius knows that theyre a genius, so they are clearly aware of what they can do. Have you ever thought of that?\nWell, I do know what I\ncant\ndo.\nYes. Thats why youre not a genius.\nRian looked back at Kite with a ridiculous look.\nHe was adding fuel to the fire. He was a teacher who made both his arms and heart hurt.\nStop it. I already know that.\nLooking at his pouting student, Kite smiled.\nBut Rian, do you know what a genius is afraid of? Theyre afraid of effort. Geniuses work hard, but their level of effort is different from normal people. They may experience setbacks and pain, but there exists no doubt as they only do what they can. So effort is a powerful weapon for those who arent geniuses. Youre trying because youre not talented? Dont even start with that. While talent guarantees you something, effort can grant you something talent cant. And that thing is will.\nKite grabbed Rian by the shoulder and squeezed.\nYou have the will to challenge the nigh-insurmountable. That will is something not everyone has. Simply put, will power is the natural enemy of a genius.\nRian liked that. It didnt matter to him if they were just words of comfort.\nYeah, he didnt have talent, but he knew that despite the fact he wasnt born with a road to success, he could pave it himself.\nIll definitely win.\nHe was determined to put everything he had into training.\n* * *\nShirone knew clearly what he could and couldnt do.\nAnd due to that, he began to study swordsmanship without hesitation when he realized the concept of Schema.\nSelection and concentration.\nTalent efficiently designs the shortest distance to a destination through these two.\nShirone set aside all the miscellaneous techniques and dug into the basics of swordsmanship.\n* * *\nA month passed.\nDuring that time, Shirone trained in only two things: the eight ways of cutting and the eight ways of blocking.\nThis is my best!\nSatisfied with his performance, Shirone finished his training.\nAnd finally, he asked a question that would show what he had learned over the past month.\nWhat is swordsmanship?\nWhile It was a sport that was made with the purpose of taking lives, it was also a sport that required high-levels of wits and intelligence in order to come out alive.\nShirone aimed the sword forward.\nHe learned from the books that the enemy could move in every way imaginable, but he knew that was not the truth.\nThe sword that comes in to cut me is real. So there are eight places I need to block!\nHe responded with his imagination.\nEight blades that overpowered eight defenses turned to hundreds as one addition was made.\nUrk!\nIt wasnt possible to calculate all the ways a sword could move.\nIm not counting numbers. Im feeling as a whole.\nJust like how you couldnt see the whole forest when staring at a single tree, Shirone needed to focus not only on the individual aspects of what he learned, but to look at them as a whole.\nThat was insight.\nBut it was easier said than done.\nAs various patterns spread out like fractals, he kept focusing on a specific spot.\nIts okay if I dont make it. Lets observe for now. Im just fixing errors right now!\nFree from tension, Shirone completely let go of his thoughts at some point as he delved into his mind.\nThen the whole thing was visible and all kinds of possibilities began to appear at once.\nWhat?\nShirones eyes were filled with astonishment.\nTheres no end to it.\nHis sword and Rians were filling up the scenery around him.\nShirone, who dropped the sword, stumbled backward.\nHaa.\nSwords, too, were infinite. Shirone saw the infinity of their swords.\nI see the swordsmen chose this kind path!\nShirone chose the infinite path of magic, so being able to relate swordsmanship to that made him feel good.\nMom, Dad, Im sorry. I might not be able to go back!\nHe had no regrets.\nAnd the same was true for Rian.\nDespite his life being on the line, Shirone was happy that he was able to see such a wonderful side of the world.\nDing Ding Ding\nThe bell rang signaling eleven oclock.\nRian, who wanted to have what he couldnt have, did what he could.\nThe clash between the two boys in stark contrast to each other was now just an hour away.",

      "content": "Chapter 9\nThe Great Training Grounds.\nArriving on time, Shirone saw Rian waiting for him.\nThe two stared at each others swords without moving from their spots, as if the battle had already begun.\nLets get started.\nRians weapon was also a longsword.\nThe subversive and vigorous swordsmanship of the Ogent family was originally more suitable for greatswords rather than longswords Until Schema came about..\nTherefore, the reason why they chose the longsword was because it was more suitable with Schema, not for consideration towards the opponent.\nRian carefully observed the Stillness Encompassing Movement learned by Shirone in the beginner level of swordsmanship.\nHis center of gravity was better than before.\nIs that really possible?\nRian, who discovered Rais genius traits in Shirone, suddenly had a thought.\nThat guy might really not have learned swordsmanship.\nBut How can you be so calm when youre holding a real sword for the first time? Arent you afraid of death?\nRian also feared death. Therefore, he trained endlessly in order to gain the courage to face it.\nNo matter how talented you are, catching up to me this quickly is impossible So how?\nOf course, Shirone knew.\nAs a beginner, he couldnt flexibly control this life-and-death duel as well as Rian could.\nTherefore, he developed a special training.\nIf you cant beat fear, then simply understand it.\nIts called jumping off the cliff.\nHuman beings were capable of jumping off cliffs if they didn't imagine what would happen after.\nFear exists in the future, and the future is just an illusion that doesnt exist yet.\nLike a dictator of absolute power enjoying a dinner calmly before a rebellion, Shirone imagined himself standing on a cliff.\nHis body remained in the air when his right foot stuck out in front of the cliff as his left foot followed.\nYoure not falling until you fall. Youre not dead until you die.\nUnderstanding the essence of danger, Shrione knew that that cold intelligence was sometimes scarier than a warriors bravery.\nAnd the cool-headed consciousness of Shirone boosted the Spirit Zones sense of stability drastically.\nHere I come!!\nRian was approaching before Shirone knew it.\nThere seemed to be a flash of light in front of Shirone, and it was definitely a whole different level of swordsmanship compared to his meager level.\nBut I can feel it.\nRecognizing the trajectory of the sword through synesthesia, Shirone calmly titled his upper body.\nRian stared in shock as his sword was dodged, both of his eyes opening wide.\nHes looking at the sword?\nTo dodge a real sword required one to stare at it, which was something most trainees couldnt do.\nHowever, swords were also infinite.\nAs the number of attacks gradually increased, Shirones synesthesia began to develop blind spots.\nThe moment the blade cut his chest, the Spirit Zone suddenly wavered.\nShirones heart sank.\nDang it!\nAt this rate, he would be beaten.\nContrary to expectations, however, Rian still continued with his big attacks.\nThanks to this, Shirone, who predicted the next trajectory, jumped away to avoid the danger of death.\nHow come\nIf Rian had slashed at his side, the duel would have ended then and there.\nHowever, Rian continued to make big moves as if he didnt realize Shirone was taken aback.\nOnly then did Shirone realize.\nMy understanding of swordsmanship is quite lower than I expected.\nAlthough Rian was skilled at using techniques, he didnt seem to be putting much thought into his attacks.\nThen\nShirone realized he had overestimated Rians skills.\nIt was dangerous to let your guard down, but to label the enemy as too strong was also a mistake as one would become too defensive.\nIll attack.\nWhen Shirone suddenly changed his strategy and launched an offensive, Rian got staggered.\nKeuk!\nAs such, dozens of combinations rained down on Rian, and due to the tension, his defense started to drop.\nDamn it! This is not happening! This cant be happening!\nThose are definitely basic swings But why are they so hard to block?! I cant even clearly see the attacks!\nRai suddenly came to his mind.\nThe detestable face that overpowered him with one hand and sneered at him in a match two years ago.\nDont make me laugh!\nRian shouted.\nIm gonna become the best swordsman in the world!\nShirone thought it was strange.\nHe acknowledged the spirit of Rian, who continued to fight back despite fighting a losing battle, but in this way, his only ending would be death.\nDoes he not want to live? Why are you being so stubborn? Does he even think?\nHuh?\nAt one point, Shirone realized that he could no longer read Rians movements.\nPredicting a swordsman who emptied their mind and swung blindly was quite difficult.\nI wont lose! Ill definitely surpass you!\nAs Shirones stamina bottomed out, Rian realized he had a chance at victory.\nShirone had saved his stamina as efficiently as possible, but there was still a huge difference between the two. Shirones sword began to feel heavy.\nThis is it!\nRian, who came running with his longsword hanging down, swung it up towards Shirones chin.\nKEUK!\nShirone responded by swinging his sword down with all his might.\nWith the sound of the clashing blades, a sword soared into the sky and embedded itself far away from the training ground.\nSilence.\nThe two who breathed in harsh, rugged breaths stared at each other.\n* * *\n* * *\nRian lowered his gaze first.\nHe saw Shirones sword pointing at his stomach.\nJust before our swords clashed\nShirone swung his wrist and struck Rians sword from the bottom.\nIn addition to the force brought about by Shirones swing, Rian, who was also low on stamina from having to block the continuous strikes from Shirone, eventually lost his grip on the sword.\nIs that even possible?\nIt was not a technique Rian could attempt with confidence.\nHis sole purpose was to win, and due to his cool-headedness, Shirone won the duel. However, he did not relax.\nHaah Haah.\nHe wanted to immediately lay on the ground, but he couldnt let Rian nullify his hard-earned victory.\nAnd in the next moment.\nDang it. I lost\nRian passively admitted his defeat.\nAh, I lost. I lost again.\nHis malice disappeared, and instead, Rian just scratched his head roughly.\nHe trained past his limits and fought as best as he could, so he didnt have any regrets.\nYou won. I have nothing else to say, so you may now kill me.\nHow could someone be so immature?\nAre you kidding me?\nWhat?\nYou think Ill survive if I kill you? What a ridiculous thing to say.\nWhat do you mean? We fought with our lives on the line, and there was a clear winner.\nYoung master, youre the only one who laid your life on the line! I just fought FOR my life! What makes this ridiculous duel more absurd is that this only started because you hid from training, and then blamed me for snitching on you.\nRian was taken aback.\nAfter a fierce battle, even if there wasnt a heartwarming atmosphere, shouldnt there be at least some passionate emotions left?\nHey, you jerk! Who put the blame on you? It was because of that petty, mannerless attitude of yours! Despite the fact we had met for the first time that day, you should have had at least a small pinch of loyalty!\nHAH?! Loyalty?!\nWhat did you just say, you punk?\nShirone could not put up with it anymore.\nHe turned a blind eye to it considering his life was on the line, but since the problem was now solved, he couldnt keep his temper in check.\nYou call that loyalty? Did you ever consider the position I was in? I had to choose between the Lords son and a teacher assigned by the Lord! Yet you asked me for such a favor despite knowing that?!\nHuh? Of c\nIf you want loyalty from me, then you should show you're worth it! You should be ashamed of yourself for putting that much pressure on a servant! You should have stepped in front of your swordsman instructor! Isnt that a true act of loyalty?\nRian pursed his lips in embarrassment.\nShirone figured Rian out as he did not argue or make excuses.\nHe was not someone to make up stuff. He just didnt speak because he had nothing to say.\nHowever, hating that attitude more, Shirone stopped nagging and sat down.\nSigh! I almost died!\nRian stared at Shirone carefully.\nThe boy who overcame the fear of death and pushed him back was long gone.\nWho was he? It was obvious that he was a genius, but he wasnt Rai.\nUnlike his brother, who wielded a sword with one hand accompanied by a smile, this boy gave his all against him.\nHey, whats your name?\nShirone raised his head. From his sitting position, Rian looked bigger.\nMy names Shirone Arian.\nIm Rian Ogent.\nIt was funny how two people from different social stratas introduced themselves, but that wasnt what shocked Shirone.\nDoes he think I wouldnt know the name of the familys youngest son?\nIrrespective of that look on his face, Shirones head raised higher as Rian approached.\nA hand the size of a cauldron lid was shoved into his face.\nLets be friends. What do you think?\n* * *\nIt has been a year since Shirone first started working under the Ogent family.\nBy the time Shirone turned 16, more than 7,000 books from the Great Library were taken out.\nTemuran was blown away by Shirones amazing speed, but Shirone already predicted that much.\nThis was because it was natural that as the number of books to classify decreased, efficiency accelerated.\nConstant velocity was only a theoretical concept, yet every event in this world was influenced by acceleration.\nTherefore, even if the start was slow, as long as one didnt give up and continued to work hard, one could achieve their goal much quicker than expected.\nOf the 850 historical books that he targeted, only about 200 remained.\nThe average number of books he read per day was over three, and in a few months, the Core of Knowledge that Shirone dreamed of would be completed.\nIn addition, he experienced swordsmanship and understood the essence of fear.\nThanks to this, the durability of the Spirit Zone had also increased dramatically.\nTherefore, the one year he spent here was fruitful and valuable However, none of the benefits could compare to making a good friend.\nThere are an extreme amount of books. Do you think my family has read all this?\nRian, who became Shirones friend after the match, spent the freetime he had in the library.\nInfact, unlike his size, he was affectionate and winsome.\nHe fit the role of youngest son of a noble family.\nOf course. The family leader and the young master often stop by the library.\nTsk, smart people are lucky since they have so much to read.\nRian, who was sitting on the floor, started rummaging through books.\nShirone came down from the ladder and picked up the books. After doing so, he began to nag.\nDont throw them around so carelessly. If you damage anything, Im the one whos going to have to pay for it. Probably with my life.\nI dont like that either. Does it make sense that books are more important than human lives? Even if you burn the library to the ground, Ill protect you, so dont worry.\nJust stop doing what youre doing, then nothing bad will happen, so the solution is just to be careful.\nPlayful words never came out of Shirones mouth.\nBut that was who Shirone was.\nHe was firm and strict, but he wasnt cold.\nRian liked that about Shirone.\nIts fun to be with you, but its stifling to be stuck in the library.\nWhy are you even here? What about your training?\nBasic training only. I told him I wanted to study in the library.\nShirones body shook.\nThen you should hurry up and study! What are you doing?!\nIm bored! Im bored! Im bored!\nRian was lying on his back, flailing his limbs about as he acted like a baby.\nRegardless, Shirone turned away and went to his desk.\nHe wasnt particularly worried about Rians laziness.\nIf Shirones tendency was water, Rians was fire. A fire that grows out of control once it burns.\nHe just needs a trigger!",

      "content": "Chapter 10\nShirone, with a history book in hand, returned to Rian.\nGet up, and bring a book to study.\nUgh, the training these days is too harsh.\nAfter shoving Rian from the study, Shirone sat down and opened a history book.\nAs the fieldwork finished faster than the paperwork recently, plenty of time was used leisurely.\nOnce he was able to focus on the book, the pages were flipped over in a flash.\nHe already knew most of the contents, and even the rest of the book was predictable to him.\nThis meant that the level of knowledge contained in his head exceeded the level of books.\nSince he understood the 650 historical books, the remaining two hundred books would probably be easy to take in.\nHey, Shirone. I found an interesting book.\nAfter finding a book to read, Rian was amazed at the speed Shirone was turning the pages.\nOnce upon a time, Rian had taken over 10 hours to turn a page.\nHe was definitely reading a book, but by the time he blinked, it was morning.\nRian sat quietly beside Shurone to avoid disturbing him and opened his own book.\nSwordsman vs. Mage\nwas the title of the book.\nIntroduction. You may have asked this question at least once before, but if a swordsman and a mage were to face off, one-on-one, who would win?\nShirones hand paused as Rian read aloud.\nIt was also an interesting topic for aspiring mages.\nI have traveled all over the world to find an answer. Even now, when I close my eyes, those thoughts flicker in my head. On the Artusna Mountain, 6,000 meters above sea level, there are carnivorous trees that eat wild birds\nRian closed the book.\nHow terribly boring.\nWhat? I was having fun!\nRian jumped at the sudden shouting.\nHe pretended not to be interested, but he must have kept his ears perked up.\nWhat do you mean fun? There are no pictures, and theres no mention of swordsmanship.\nYou didnt even finish a single page! What are you even talking about?\nA writer should be considerate of his readers. He should start with a fun beginning and a touching conclusion.\nThis is not a novel. Give me the book. So, whos going to win?\nWhats the point of knowing who wins or who loses? For what absurd reason would a mage and a swordsman need to face off? If it's favorable to one side, they would want to fight and if its disadvantageous to the other, they would flee.\nShirone opened the middle part of\nThe Swordsman vs. The Mage\nand searched through the pages.\nThere may be times when they have no choice but to fight. If that happens, who will win?\nMay I make a rough prediction?\nAbruptly, a sharp voice was heard over the bookshelf.\nOf course, the swordsman would win.\nA man with a cold impression appeared.\nHe wasnt as bulky as Rian, but he was much taller, and his limbs were slim and long.\nHe was the second son of the Ogent Family, Rai Ogent.\nAlthough they were brothers, his atmosphere and appearance was quite different from Rians. First, his hair was pitch black.\nThere were two undiluted characteristics that descended from the Ogent family. Bischoff, the head of the family, the eldest son, and the second son inherited black hair. The light blue hair was passed on to the eldest daughter and the youngest son, Rian.\nIn addition, Rians grandfather, a nationally recognized Grade 3 swordsman, also had blue hair.\nThe family had a strong bond, but it was interesting how they would sometimes be divided according to mere hair color.\nWhich heritage stands out depends on the generation, but this time, black hair was leading as Bischoff and Rai had black hair.\nAh! Hello.\nShirone quickly bowed his head.\nNo one knew that he was friends with Rian, so if Rai had heard the conversation a while ago, he would be in trouble.\nThe swordsman wins? How can you say that with such conviction? Because youre one?\nRian knew that, so he tried to get on Rais nerves with a sarcastic tone.\nConviction? Is it necessary to use such a dramatic word? Its a fact that can be acknowledged just by knowing where mages and swordsmen lie on each continent.\nRai didnt seem to care about his brothers relationship with the male servant, but Shirone could not relax.\nHe felt this every time Rai came to the library. He was a difficult man to read.\nWhatever the position, its a face-off. Youre not going to talk like that on the battlefield, are you? Imagine saying things like Its over, I have the high ground!\nRian laughed, satisfied.\nBut Rai didnt even respond and looked at Shirone with indifferent eyes.\nWhat do you think, kid?\nWell assuming were talking about the highest level, magic is definitely powerful enough to inflict fatal wounds on a swordsman. But swordsmen have excellent physical abilities, so if they attack before magic is casted\nNo, youre wrong. A mage cannot beat a swordsman.\nShirone choked up. Although he was only an aspiring mage, he was still undoubtedly working towards becoming a mage.\nRian was pissed that his friend was ignored.\nWho are you to say something like that, huh? You think youre some kind of swordsman representative?\nThe corner of Rais lips went up. It was the infamous smirk that Rian detested.\nNot just anyone can gain the dignity of a swordsman. However, money can buy just about everything you need to become a mage.\nThere was a hidden criticism behind Rais words.\nIn fact, swordsmen had a way to defend against magic. It was an artifact called Anti-Magic.\nA special mental wavelength contained within Anti-Magic can disturb a mages Spirit Zone.\nIn other words, the artifact reduces concentration.\nArtifacts were usually processed in the form of crystal balls and could be installed on armor, shields, and even swords.\nThe price was also quite high, considering one key material was a dragons heart as it emitted the waves required.\nHowever, wearing up to ten artifacts, with each having 10% efficiency, did not equal to 100% efficiency.\nThis was due to the nature of the waves.\nIf a new additional wave was to be added to the already existing wave of Anti-Magic, an overlap would occur.\nTherefore, the more artifacts one had on, the lower the efficiency.\nThe best artifact by far to exist was the Armor Set of the Five Gods created by the Archmage Yakra.\nArtifacts were embedded in helmets, chest plates, gauntlets, boots, and shields. Each with a maximum of 20% efficiency.\nThe Armor Set of the Five Gods reached an overwhelming 65% efficiency worn all together, which was fatal to a mage.\nThe percentage was a result of bypassing the overlap of the waves as much as possible.\nAnother problem was the Essence of the Spirit.\nFour types of essence could be found in nature: fire, water, wind, and earth. And when Anti-Magic is put into the equation, magic activation, along with the elements listed above, could be completely blocked.\nThe total number of essences known to exist so far was 17. 2 for fire, 3 for water, 5 for wind, and 7 for earth. The value of just a single one exceeded the budget of a small kingdom.\nShirone tried imagining it.\nWhat kind of wizard would be able to win against a master of Schema, equipped with each kind of essence in the Armor Set of the Five Gods?\nOf course, it was still all theoretical.\nThe armor set was scattered all over the world, and the locations were all unclear. Adding to that, it was nearly impossible to obtain an Essence of the Spirit unless you were given explicit permission from a nation that had one.\nThere was also a problem with installing several Anti-Magic artifacts.\nEven Yakra, an expert on wave equations, spent 10 years trying to coordinate the waves of the Armor Set of the Five Gods.\nIn short, if the waves of Anti-Magic were clumsily coordinated, the ingredients, along with the produced item, would become worthless.\n* * *\n* * *\nEfficiency did not increase unless the interaction between the waves, the resonance frequency, and the mana relationship was fine-tuned.\nIt wouldnt be a joke to say that half of an aristocrat's wealth could be blown away trying to raise Anti-Magic efficiency by 1%.\nBut thats where the dilemma begins.\nRather than investing a huge amount of money to raise the efficiency of Anti-Magic, it was much cheaper to carry around a mage who knew anti-magic spells.\nThat was what Rais words implied.\nThat a mage was just a subordinate of a swordsman, and that his knowledge could be bought with money.\nIn fact it was mages, not swordsmen, who developed Anti-Magic.\nEven now, numerous mages were studying the effect of dragon mana on the Spirit Zone.\nThis was because if one ended up with good results, one could gain tremendous wealth and honor.\nIt was ironic. Mages were creating a weapon that could only do harm to them.\nRai pointed out that dishonorable situation.\nMages would do just about anything for money. This also meant that they could not win a swordsman in terms of pride and honor.\nWhat do you think? You seem to like history books. You know the position mages in this world. Magic can be sealed off with money, but money cannot stop a sword.\nThis was a biased, swordsman point of view, but Shirone understood what he was trying to say.\nThat is what a mage is.\nWhat?\nRai raised an eyebrow.\nRai thought of the boy as someone who liked magic. So he should have lost his temper, however, contrary to what Rai thought would happen, Shirone admitted it was true Sort of.\nA mage is a person who persistently digs into the balance of all things. So its not strange to study how to suppress magic. What they find important is not whether they win or lose, but whether they know it or not. Artifacts are a result of that never-ending search. For that reason, I think claiming that mages are at a disadvantage is wrong.\nUnlike Rian, Rai had a personality that wished to beat his opponent using his brain.\nNevertheless, the reason why he kept his mouth shut was because he couldnt refute.\nRian struggled to hold back his laughter.\nEhehehe! Serve you right! My friend has a way with words! Im telling you, he has the sharpest tongue. If his tongue were a sword, it would be the sharpest sword in the world!\nRais face gradually began to distort as he could not find a way to refute.\nHe couldnt just make up ideas that were never there.\nWell, that is in an ideal world, but the reality is different. It doesnt change the fact that a mage cant win against a swordsman.\nRai coldly turned around and left the library. Rian had a hard time suppressing his laughter.\nReality is different? Thats it? Ugh, he reeks of stupidity. Get away from here. Quickly, get lost!\nThen, when the door finally closed, he grabbed Shirone and bursted out laughing.\nPUHAHAHA! Shirone, that was awesome! Ive never seen my older brother make that kind of face before!\nWhile being dragged around by Rian, Shirones eyes were staring at the place Rai left through.\nSwordsman vs. Mage!\nMaybe the reality was different, as Rai had said, but Shirone believed he was right.\nHe believed that the mindset of a mage who explored the boundaries of knowledge without hesitation, despite the fact his weaknesses may show, would overcome a swordsman.\nThat cold will was the reason for the existence of intelligence in this world.\n* * *\nThe Great Library was cold enough to make one feel chilly.\nThe bookshelf, which used to be filled with knowledge, was now empty. The luminous lamp that had once brightened up the inside was now also turned off.\nOnly a single ray of sunshine from the 4th floor window shone on Shirone.\nUnder the sunlight, Shirone turned the pages.\nOne page after another Until finally he finished the last page and closed the book.\nShirone stroked the cover gently.\nIt was easy work to flip a book.\nHowever, to finally turn the last page after swimming through a sea of books? Now that wasnt something anyone could do.\n850 books of history.\nShirone read all the history books in the Great Library.\nIm done This is my Core of Knowledge.\nIt was warm.\nHe felt the light filling up his heart.\nAlthough he was a hunter's child, he could now confidently say he knew nearly everything about the whole world!\nA year and six months!\nAlthough it was a slow start, after reading and reading, Shirone started to accelerate, and once he did that, he never slowed down again. He sped up so much that he finished his work six months ahead of schedule!\nNow, he could go back home any time and there would be no reason for his familys life to be in danger.\nIts like a dream!\nHis mind was filled with the numerous experiences he went through the past year and a half.",

      "content": "Chapter 11\nHey, Shirone! Didnt you say you finished your work? Why are you still here?\nAs he opened the door, Rian fanned his hands and coughed due to the dust.\nShirone just smiled.\nWhats the meaning behind that expression? Something good happen?\nRian, show me around your house.\nHuh? What?\nRians eyes swung wide open with shock.\nHe wanted to enter his familys house. Knowing Shirone, Rian was sure he wasnt kidding.\nAt that moment, Rian found a book lying next to Shirone.\nYou are done, arent you?\nYeah, theres nothing left for me to read. At least not in this library.\nThere was nothing more to read.\nEven Rian, who stayed away from reading, seemed to understand how cool that sounded.\nReally?\nThe sunlight that shone through the window seemed to be just for this moment.\nHahaha! Did you really? Youre a real piece of work, dude!\nRian congratulated Shirone as if sharing in his friends accomplishment.\nThough, he did it as the aggressive swordsman he was, and due to that, Shirones eyes went in circles.\nAhh! Im dizzy!\nEven after pushing him away, Rian watched Shirone turn in circles.\nHes an amazing guy!\nHe felt like he finally understood Shirone.\nKnowing who Shirone was and despite his background and status, Rian was only thankful.\nHonestly, I would have been quite upset if he had treated me as a Lords son.\nRian agreed without hesitation.\nGood! If you want to come to my house, youre always welcome! My family isnt at home either!\nIt didnt really matter to him, but it was much better for Shirone.\nAfter arriving at the mansion, Shirone was overwhelmed by the size of the building.\nIts really big.\nHe could guess why ancient people built buildings to honor the glory of God.\nCome on in.\nHowever, Rian, who lived in said house, pushed the door open using his shoulder as if he were too lazy to even open the door.\nShirone asked with an uneasy look.\nRian, what if we get caught?\nWhat are you so worried about? The library relocation work is done anyways, so youre not tied down by the contract. Besides, my family wont be back until the evening. Alright, alright, come on.\nAs they went up to the second floor, Shirones eyes were greeted by the countless rooms littering the hallway.\nAs they approached the very end of the corridor, Shirone saw the familys room.\nAlthough there was no special decoration like a family crest, the interior was especially pink.\nInstead of swords and shields, piano and unknown instruments were on display.\nFrom the musical instruments littering the room, Shirone could tell It was the eldest daughters room.\nThe number of rooms were overflowing, so there would have been many options, but Rian decided on the last room.\nShirone felt like he had seen a side of the alienation Rian must feel despite being part of the family.\nWell, here it is. This is my room.\nAs a passionate swordsman, wooden swords were piled up in the room and books related to swordsmanship were also visible on the bookshelf.\nHowever, there were no professional books. Most of them were novels about myths.\nI wanted to come here at least once!\nThought Shirone, as he considered Rian a friend.\nRooms were said to represent a persons character. And that saying was not incorrect.\nHe really has no interest in decorating at all!\nFor Rian, who was always covered in dust, this place seemed meaningless except for when he wanted to sleep.\nThe two chatted away because they had nothing to do. But when that got boring as well, they played a card game.\nThe game ended in just 30 minutes.\nIt was a complete defeat for Rian.\nShirone asked while sweeping the chips.\nOne more round?\nIm not doing it! Damn it. Its a gamble based on luck anyways. I guess Im just unlucky.\nShirone spoke again while organizing the chips.\nYou have a habit of moving cards outside when the ace comes in. And the time you take to bet is different depending on whether you have a pair. Im guessing the reason why is because when you have a pair, youre taking the time to think of a strategy, but when you dont have a pair, you just give up. But if theres a time difference, it stands out. Just knowing those two things gives me the higher probability of winning.\nRian had a blank look on his face as if he had been cheated.\nHow can you find such things?\nObservation often achieves its purpose when you are not obsessively trying to observe forcefully. If you try to observe multiple things at once, you will never find what youre looking for. Just appreciate and acknowledge them as a whole. Only then will something stand out.\nRian placed his chin on his hand.\nDont be obsessed with what youre trying to get? Maybe this will help me find my own Schema.\nMaybe. I took that into consideration when trying to understand my Spirit Zone.\nHmm. To not be obsessed\nRian echoed Shirones words.\nHis brain was itchy. He felt like he was close to something, but the thoughts eluded him.\nHe felt sleepy and got tired, perhaps because he thought about something deeply for the first time in a long time.\nWhatever.\nRian stretched out on his back.\nI have nothing to do, so let me sleep a little bit. Im so tired because I ran 100 laps this morning.\nThen get some sleep. Ill be reading a book.\nYes, yes.\nRian fell asleep as soon as he closed his eyes.\nSmiling at the sight of his friend who laid down comfortably, Shirone pulled out a novel.\nBloody Fight With the Snake Queen!\nAfter only reading history books for about a year and a half, he didnt notice the passing time as he read an adventure story.\nOn the other hand, it seemed like Rian enjoyed something quite different from Shirones. Key sentences were underlined.\nThe snake queens weakness is her head.\nHahaha.\nThey didnt do much of anything, but he was happy to just be at his friends house for the first time.\nAn hour passed just like that.\nWith Rian still not up, Shirone closed the book and organized the room.\nHe said his family was coming back in the evening.\nWhen the sun goes down, the inside of the manion will get noisy\nShirone thought it best to leave now.\nWhile walking down the hall, Shirone heard the sound of a piano leaking out from a room.\nFor him, who had grown up in the mountains, the music filled with the composers inspiration shook his heart more strongly than thunder.\nThats so cool!\nShirone followed the sound as if drunk, and stopped in front of Rians sisters room.\nA woman with blue hair that flowed like the ocean waves was playing the piano.\nIt was truly a heavenly sound.\nAlthough not the youngest, she was a woman of talent who became a court musician at the age of 19, so to say she was talented was an understatement.\nThe harmony that gradually accumulated and the variations that blended within.\nShirones consciousness abided to Reinas fingertips like a marionette caught in a melody.\nAnd only after the performance did Shirone finally realize where he was.\nPerhaps the emotional whirlwind went on for too long as Reina found Shirone. She smiled and waved at him.\nHi, how was it? My piano sonata?\nHow was it?\nHe learned information about music through books, but what he heard with his ears was beyond what he had imagined.\nUhh, it was\nHe didn't dare to speak his mind.\nReina patted the piano chair and spoke.\nYou can come over here and take a look. Ive never seen your face here before. Are you a new worker?\nYes. Im in charge of sorting out the library. Its been over a year since I joined.\nAah! Youre the one. Ive heard about you before. You must be very smart. Classification work cant be done by just anyone.\nMaybe it was because she majored in art, but Reina was not authoritative, instead, Shirone felt consideration in the way she spoke.\nEntering the room awkwardly, Shirone hesitated for a moment and pointed to the sheet of music papers.\nThis is called sheet music, right?\nYes, its titled In the Dark, which is the third movement of the piano sonata composed by Schreiman. Have you ever played the piano?\n* * *\n* * *\nNo, never.\nReally? Then sit this way. Ill teach you. Its not a difficult song.\nShirone was nervous because the inertia of working while risking his life under the Ogent name remained.\nIn particular, he was even more concerned because he heard from Rian that his sister was a wicked witch.\nIts all right. Nobody is going to rebuke you because I allowed it.\nShirone, feeling somewhat relieved, sat down in front of the piano with much curiosity.\nNow, from here, Do, Re, Mi\nAfter hearing the most basic things, Shirone pressed the first chord, paying attention to her fingerings.\nBaaam.\nThe sound that rippled through the heart.\nFeeling the tension gradually dissipating, Shirone continued by connecting the sound with a second chord.\nReinas eyebrows rose.\nWow! You catch on quick! Despite this being your first time playing, your sight-reading is really good.\nTo play new music for the first time is called sight-reading.\nLike how athletic ability was more important than emotions, the faster the thinking speed, the better.\nReinas compliment made him feel good, but he couldnt move himself to smile while looking at her eyes.\nShirone, who was staring at the keys, raised his head when something came to mind.\nIm sorry, but\nYes?\nCan you please play it again?\nEven in their brief encounter, Reina discovered the unique temperament Shirone had.\nHe is an active child!\nAn average servant of the house would have spent their time currying favor with their masters, but Reina could tell Shirone wasnt like that.\nReina readily agreed.\nOkay.\nTo say that artists were obsessed with talent is false. These were just words made up by fake artists.\nThen Ill play properly this time.\nWhat artists loved the most was passion.\nReina encored In the Dark.\nEven to a non-professional Shirone, He could tell it was an extraordinary performance that was incomparable to the first.\nSchema.\nHer nervous system It was twice as sensitive as the average person. Shirone could tell she understood her body.\nAfter her performance, Reina looked satisfied.\nOn the other hand, Shirone was lost in thought with a serious expression, even after the music was over.\nCould I try again?\nHmm? Oh, sure.\nPlease understand even if its difficult to listen to.\nHaha, of course. Its like that for everyone at first.\nShirone raised his hands gently over the keys.\nAs soon as he thought his posture was acceptable, Shirone quickly started playing.\nReina, who was listening to this unspecific music, bore an awkward smile.\nHowever, as Shirone was midway through, she realized something.\nWho is this child? What in the world is he trying to do?\nAll the notes were off. Completely wrong. But to her surprise\nAll the notes were similar.\nIt may not be called music, but it seemed to convey Shirones feelings.\nWhatever hes playing, hes not doing it as a performance\nReina was correct. Shirone wasnt trying to perform, instead, he was in the process of going deeper in order to understand the concept of playing an instrument.\nA little more!\nShirone focused even harder.\nTake in the whole music sheet, analyze it with your head, and command your ten fingers.\nEven in the midst of many different notes, the feeling was getting clearer.\nMore, more. I need to get closer.\nAs his concentration rose high, the Spirit Zone opened.\nIm almost there.\nReina swallowed.\nPleasant chords mingled between the gritty dissonance.\nDun Dun Dun Dun!\nAt the moment when the score and the performance reached its climax, there was a thrill that shocked Reinas body to the core.\nShirone began an authentic cadence.\nIts here!\nRaising both his hands, Shirone hit the perfect 5th and then pressed upon the 1st interval with the greatest degree of passion\nBAAMM!!\nThe harmony, which started 4 minutes ago, extinguished into seven notes, spreading an infinite, inexhaustible aftertaste.",

      "content": "Chapter 12\nShirone let out a heavy breath. Four minutes felt like eternity.\nReina looked amazed.\nSince it was not quite a performance, she could not evaluate the pitch, but she had the insight to realize the essence.\nWho was he?\nWhy did a child like this become a servant under my family?\nSeriously?! Shut up, you old hag!\nThe emotional atmosphere of the room shattered, and Shirone and Reina turned their heads at the same time.\nIf youre here, just wash your feet and go to sleep! Or even play a nice lullaby to listen to! Why the heck are you being so hysterical!\nFrizzy hair, and half-closed eyes.\nRian, still half asleep, came into the room while scratching his washboard abs.\nThen after he locked eyes with Shirone, he tilted his head.\nHuh? What are you doing here?\nUh, no. I was\nIf it were to be revealed that Rian and Shirone were friends, it would create problems. But fortunately, Reina took the lead.\nSo, do you guys know each other?\nShirone? Yeah, hes my friend.\nRian! What are you saying?\nHahaha! Its okay. Although she has a nasty temper, she doesnt really care about things like this.\nDoes she really?\nHe knew she was pretty open-minded, but there was a high barrier between the aristocrats and the commoners that shouldve been hard to ignore.\nSo your names Shirone. Dont worry about it. Any friend of Rians, is also my friend. Even though hes a little pathetic, he still takes responsibility for what he says.\nShirone wasnt looking any less suspicious.\nFrom the receiving end, that could have been perceived as rude, but Reina accepted it rather well.\nGenuine trust is born from doubts and suspicions.\nBut you are one of a kind. Really, how did you think to play like that?\nWhat? Shirone was the one who did it? And here I was thinking it was your hysteria acting up again.\nShirone frowned slightly.\nHe couldnt understand how words such as witch and hysterical were used to call such a pretty and friendly sister.\nRian, why did you lie to me? Your sister is a kind and nice person.\nShirone! Dont be fooled! This woman is a witch! She might eat you one day!\nRians expression looked really serious, so Shirone could not reply back.\nReina spoke.\nHoho, Im sorry. My little brother is extremely immature, but Im relieved to see that he has a friend like you. Take good care of him for me.\nOh, no. I dont\nReinas eyes sparkled at the sight of Shirone, who lowered his head shyly.\nDespite having an abundance of knowledge, Shirone was still an innocent child in regards to emotion. After all, he is still only sixteen years old.\nYoure quite the cutie.\nRian, who gulped down a cup of water from a table, said while pouring himself another glass.\nIf hes so cute, why dont you just take him and live together. I would love to have Shirone be part of my family. Muhahaha!\nShirone was even more embarrassed at Rians joke, but what he was feeling didnt seem so bad either.\nReina realized something from her brothers words.\nOho, it looks like youre close enough to even give your sister away.\nRian retorted, looking flabbergasted.\nWhat are you talking about? Of course. Shirone is like a brother to me, but I dont mind giving a witch like you to just about anyone. Rather, Shirone is worth too much. Youre not worthy of Shirone.\nOh, really?\nAs soon as she finished talking, Reina jumped high enough to the point where it could easily exceed a persons height.\nWhile still frozen in surprise, she landed in front of Rian and pulled her brothers ear.\nOWW! It hurts! It hurts!\nI went easy on you because you were cute, but it seems like you are trying to walk all over me now.\nIt hurts! I said it hurts!!\nAlthough she was now a musician, Reina was once a talented swordsman equivalent to Rai.\nThe strength of her pinch was so great that Rian turned his head with watery eyes.\nShirone! Run away while you still can! If you get caught by this witch, youre done for!\nHe couldnt tell if he was joking or not, but one thing was sure, He couldnt leave Rian like that.\nIm sorry. I dont think you meant any harm.\nReina, who was staring at Shirone and Rian with a grim stare, pulled his ear roughly one last time and let go.\nOuch!\nJust know that your friend was the one who saved your life. Tsk tsk tsk, do everyone a favor and learn a thing or two from your friend. Such an immature kid.\nTsk, it was only because you held me in a sensitive spot.\nRian grumbled while rubbing his ear. Then he looked back at Reina again.\nWhy the hell did you come home? Werent you on vacation?\nYou havent heard? The news regarding Rai?\nWhen did I ever care?\nRai is taking a certified exam this time. Thats why Im here to pick him up. I left with grandfather, but he said he was going to meet a friend halfway.\nA certified exam?\nRian looked shocked.\nOf course, his brother was a genius, so he accepted the difference in skill But how did it reach this extent?\nA certified license was the dream of all nobles, regardless if you were a swordsman or mage.\nThe exam was held once a year, with only a few applicants being allowed to take the test. And out of those few, the ones who obtained official recognition were less than 30.\nOf course, there was also the non-certified license.\nIt was issued by an institution designated by the royal palace, and in Creas, an example of a representative was the Alpheas Magic Academy.\nAfter graduating from the magic academy, you automatically became a non-certified Grade 10 mage. You could then increase your grade by accomplishing various quests through associations or guilds.\nHmph, he must be happy. Geniuses sure are different. He even shoves me around at home, too.\nReina ruffled Rians hair.\n* * *\n* * *\nHe was a cute little brother, despite his lack of talent. She just hoped he would not be hurt by this.\nFirst, I have to go prepare dinner. Its fresh seafood from the royal palace, so well have to dress and clean those ourselves. It was nice meeting you, Shirone. Dont forget to say hi the next time we meet.\nShirone bowed his head, pushing away the sad feeling.\nYes. Goodbye.\nAlthough the chance to see Reina again may never come again, one thing was clear\nHe would never forget the moment he played the piano with her.\nPerhaps that is why Shirone, who was to leave the mansion tomorrow, was able to gather up a lot of courage.\nRian. Does she your sister, I mean.\nHm?\nDoes she have a boyfriend?\nAs soon as he asked that question, a huge amount of regret washed over him, but there was nothing he could do as the words had already left his mouth.\nRian blinked, then smiled widely, his teeth showing.\nShirone. Do you\nN-NO! Forget what I just said! I was just\nHAHAHA! Big sis! Big sis!\nRian ran out of the room in a flash, he grabbed the railing on the second floor, making Shirone pull him back by the waist.\nBig sister! Shirone asked if you have a boyf\nGosh! Stop it!\nShirone, who barely managed to cover his mouth, dragged Rian back into the room with all his strength.\nHuh? What am I hearing now? Boyfriend?\nThe maids working in the kitchen looked up at the second floor, but Reina just laughed.\nTheyre just messing with each other. Alright, all we have to do is steam it. I removed the poison, so please do the rest.\nOf course, miss.\nWhen the cooking began in earnest, the maids were back to being absorbed in their work.\nHowever, the attention of the man in charge of the mansions affairs did not leave the 2nd floor.\nHead butler Louis.\nHe was a person who rose to the head of the butlers at a young age due to his calculation skills and thorough personality.\nThat was 5 years ago and he was still in his mid-thirties. He was wearing rimless glasses with a cold expression.\nShirone, they called him?\nThe maids may not be able to remember, but he, the head butler, remembered very clearly.\nHe was the contract boy brought in by Temuran for the relocation of the Great Library.\nWhy is he with the youngest young master?\nFor him, who decided to devote his life to the prosperity of the Ogent family, it was not a matter that could be simply overlooked.\nHis glaring eyes turned to a butler near him.\nTell the deputy butler to come to my room. Now.\n* * *\nEarly morning of the next day.\nShouts rang out.\nAfter hearing that Rai was taking a certified test, Rian increased the intensity of his training.\nHA! HA!\nI will definitely catch up.\nThe news added fuel to a fire, and Kite became sure as he watched his students sword dance.\nHis skills have improved!\nStamina, vitality, technique, everything.\nWith that level of skill, he would be able to easily defeat a bandit group near the city.\nHowever, If he were to have a match against someone who learned official swordsmanship, he still had a long way to go.\nThe problem was Schema!\nRians impulsive, wild style was his biggest advantage, but it also acted as his biggest weakness.\nHis swordsmanship is too tactless and honest.\nThere were times when he would have to look back with a cold mind, but he was only moving forward.\nEveryone has their own way. The downside of not having a clear mind becomes nothing compared to that heating power of his. Its obvious that we have no choice but to continue like this!\nHA! HA!\nHe was wielding a club that was twice as heavy as a longsword with only his physical strength.\nKite couldnt imagine how much Rian would improve if he were to learn how to activate Schema.\nStop! 10 minute break!\nRian came back panting like crazy, but his eyes were on fire.\nThat also happened back then!\n...Yes, it happened around a year ago, although it went away quite quickly too.\nThis time was different. Rians flame did not fade.\nYoung master! Young master!\nA butler came running.\nArriving in front of Rian, who was taking a drink of water, the butler spoke before he could catch his breath.\nTheres a big problem. Miss Reina is asking you to come to the mansion immediately!\nBig sister did? Whats going on? If its because of my big brother, I dont care. He can do whatever he wants.\nThats not it, a contract boy named Shirone is on the verge of being executed.\nWhat?!\nShirones in danger?!\nHe was even more taken aback because he was about to see his friend off in a few hours.\nShirone? Why? Whats going on?\nWell, the thing is\nHurry up and tell me! Whats going on?!\nLouis seems to have reported something to the Lord. I dont know the exact details, but I heard it revolved around a sort of friendship between you two\nDamn it!\nKite asked as he watched Rian hurriedly pick up the dry clothes he placed on a rock.\nWhats the matter? Who is Shirone?\nHes a friend. I didnt go around announcing it because of his commoner status, but Louis must have found out about it and reported it to father.\nKite remembered a boy he had met briefly in the library a long time ago.\nKite liked the shine in his eyes, but he wasnt that interested as he was a servant of the family.\nThats what happened?\nRian spoke who was now neatly dressed.\nMaster, lets finish our training for today. I have to see my father. I have to go to the mansion.\nUnfortunately, you cannot.\nRian looked at him weird.\nWhat are you talking about?! My friend is in danger!\nDid you not say he was a commoner?\nWhat does that have to do with anything?! Master, are you that kind of person?! You said it too! Anyone who can converse with a sword can become a friend!\nKite clicked his tongue.\nHis student, who did not understand the ways of the world, had gotten someone into trouble.\nWhat are you going to do when you get there? Are you going to wail and cry like a baby?\nMaster!\nRian, anyone can be a friend. But this is a matter between the people directly involved. Bad rumors can affect the position of the Ogent family. Theyll do anything they can in order to ensure those rumors never see the light of day. Your foolishness will not be of any help in this situation.\nSo I should just stay still?! I reached out to Shirone first. I will not give up on him! I am no coward!\nHmm\nKite stared at his students eyes.\nSuch fine eyes. No lies, only passion. And above all, they are pure.",

      "content": "Chapter 13\nOne does not become a great swordsman with their eyes!\nNevertheless, Rian made him endlessly look forward to something and made him support the kid with all his heart.\nHere, take this.\nKite handed his sword to Rian.\nRian didnt know what his teacher wanted him to do with the sword in particular, but he understood his intentions.\nRian would have to risk his own life if he wanted to solve this situation.\nIf you decide to go to the mansion with this sword, Ill let you go. But dont make a step if youre not determined enough. It will only make things worse. This situation is already out of your control.\nMaster.\nWhile looking at Kite with fierce eyes, Rian smiled.\nAs he bowed his head down politely, he held out his hands and grabbed the sword from Kite in silence.\nThank you. I will never forget this favor.\nRemember, abandoning a friend is equivalent to abandoning another you. Dont you dare half-ass this.\nYes!\nWith a stern nod, Rian ran to the manion with a sword strapped on his waist.\nThere was nostalgia in Kites eyes.\nMy part is over!\nAlthough the time to say goodbye was short, he was happy he was able to leave his mark.\nMay the future of my student be filled with good fortune.\n* * *\nThe atmosphere inside the mansion was cold.\nAll work stopped momentarily, and the male servants and maids kept their mouths shut.\nLouis, the head butler, wiped his glasses behind the sofa where the immediate family members were sitting.\nNext to him, Temuran, the deputy butler, was staring at Shirone, his stress plain for all to see.\nHe was kneeling under all the gazes of hostility and contempt.\nHe felt like he was standing in the middle of a Colosseum.\nReport, head butler.\nYes, my Lord. Shirone, a servant hired by Temuran, is accused of damaging the prestige of the Ogent family during his year-and-a-half-long stay here. The workers have witnessed the youngest young master and Shirone mingling, and I also heard Shirone talking to him carelessly. Attached are the testimonies of the workers in regards to the case. Temuran wrote for them.\nAs Bischoff silently raised his hand back, Louis passed the document into his hand.\nFlap! Flap! While the papers were turning, Reina sneakily went up to Shirone.\nShirone, dont worry too much. Ill try and convince my dad. Nothings going to happen.\nContrary to expectations, Shirone looked so calm that it gave Reina chills.\nNot a speck of anxiety was seen in his eyes.\nHe was not pretending to be calm! He really is looking at the situation calmly!\nShirone was not afraid.\nThis was because the future was just full of possible outcomes. Nothing had been decided yet.\nAfter looking through the file, Bischoff spoke.\nWith a cold impression along with his pitch-black hair, he had the power to petrify with his words alone.\nShirone Arian, is what is written in this file true?\nDad, Shirone and Rian\nReina, I did not ask you. Ill give you a chance to speak. Stay quiet for now.\nReina knew this was not gonna be easy.\nBischoff, a logical man who followed fundamental principles, was not a person who could be persuaded through mere emotions.\nShirone opened his mouth.\nI would like to ask a question.\nAll the servants who were watching were surprised at how composed Shirone was. However, it did not phase Bischoff one bit.\nTell me.\nIf the youngest young master and I are actual friends, what would happen to him?\nReinas eyes turned affectionate at Shirones selflessness. He thought of his friend before himself, even in such a situation.\nNothing will happen. Right now, were here to question you, a commoner. Whatever misdeed Rian has commited, as long as hes part of this family, we will continue to protect and support him.\nBischoffs words had thorns, but Shirone was satisfied.\nShirone, who let a little loose, told the truth with a bright smile.\nThen Im glad. Rian and I are friends. Weve been friends for a year, and well continue to be friends.\nNo one dared to speak up or express themselves, but Shirones words actually caused a great stir.\nIn particular, the male servants who lived with him were the most shocked as his friendship with the youngest young master turned out to be true.\nStupid boy. He doesnt understand how scary this world is.\nA son of a noble family and a son of a mountaineer have been friends for over a year.\nWhat seemed like a baseless rumor that had been passed around ended up being true.\nYou must take the name of the Ogent family quite lightly. Shirone, I will execute you as the Lord of this house. Since you came here signing such a contract from the beginning, you must have been ready for such a possibility.\nReina stepped up.\nDad! Listen to me for a second! You said youd give me a chance to talk!\n* * *\n* * *\nThat was when there was room to make judgment. He has already confessed. Itd be pointless to drag this out. Head butler.\nYes, my Lord.\nContinue the matter at hand. Also, this should never leak out.\nOf course.\nReina became nervous. Even in this situation, seeing as how Shirone continued to maintain his calm and composed exterior, Reina felt bitter.\nBut how could they prevent this? Bischoffs decisions as Lord of the house had never once been reversed.\nWith whose permission?!\nRian opened the door and barged in.\nThe temperature of the room increased with just his appearance alone.\nWhos going to execute my friend without permission?\nBischoff said flatly.\nMe.\nWhy the hell? He didnt commit a sin that deserves death, we only became friends! Just friends!\nOne does not die just because he has committed a sin worthy of death. The intricacies of aristocracy are much more complicated than you think. And those complicated circumstances are handled and resolved by the family, hence you, as a son of a nobleman, were also raised and brought up with preferential treatment.\nIf thats the case, I refuse such a privilege if it means I have to abandon my friend.\nYou are immature, Rian. Friendships are a mutual thing. What you can share with them is fixed and certain. That is a definite relationship. Does that kid think of you as a friend? How can I believe that? Lets say he approached you for money, how could you know? How can you trust him?\nShirone is not like that.\nThats what Im saying. How do you know that? Prove it. Bring some kind of evidence that proves Shirone is not that kind of person.\nReina chewed on her lips.\nHes totally caught up!\nThere was no evidence that could prove Shirone was a true friend because nobody could look into a persons heart.\nFeeling a chill from his fathers words, Rian slowly grabbed the handle of the sword strapped on his waist.\nSomething hot flooded into his heart.\nI understand now, Master!\nRian, who understood what Kite meant, burst into laughter.\nHAHAHAHA!\nThis was not a staring contest between father and son, it was a battle of wills.\nAs expected, I cant beat my dad. I almost fell for it. Prove that were friends My proof is that I believe in him. Even if Shirone does not think of me as one, he is my friend as long as I believe we are. Thats the best proof you can have in this situation! Trust!\nThis time, Bischoff was at the losing end.\nAfter all, what Rian said was also true.\nSo you are going to disobey me, the Lord of this house? This is not a matter between just you and me. It is a matter that involves the house. Noble houses can fall and collapse, even now it still happens. I have to make sure we dont crumble and fall. I am responsible for leading this house. Dont underestimate the situation. Even a son of a noble can be ostracized.\nBischoff burned his bridge.\nTo kick out his own son.\nNot only the servants, but also the members of the Ogent family were shocked at the last remark.\nBut Rian didnt budge.\nInstead, he answered politely with unprecedented courtesy, as if building a wall between him and Bischoff.\nIf thats the only way to protect my friend, Ill happily leave.\nBANG!\nBischoff slammed his foot onto the floor.\nUnacceptable. A mere 16-year-old surviving an ostracism?\nThat foolishness of his His rude, mannerless actions Hes only unreasonable due to the fact that I am his father.\nThen draw your sword. To be ostracized means to be abandoned by your family. If your friend is really worth the fight, then you must risk your life.\nRian drew his sword without a word. The action angered Bischoff even more.\nAre you really planning on pointing your sword at me, your father?\nIts not pointed towards you, father. You dont believe me, so I have no choice but to do this. I draw my sword because I believe in myself and my decisions.\nSince when did you cherish your friends? You never once made connections with other aristocrats your age. You said it was because they were dazzling in your eyes. Youre only friends with this commoner because he doesnt shine. Because he is lower than you.\nFor the first time, you are wrong, father. Shirone is a friend who shines brighter than me. I want to help Shirone shine even brighter.\nBischoff was despondent.\nWhat did this Shirone do to dazzle his naive son to such a degree?\nIs it you? Did you make Rian like that? How did you persuade him into believing that a commoner and a noble could be friends?\nShirone spoke.\nAlthough I did not persuade him, since you think that is the case, maybe I did do something like persuasion.\nRian stood between the two.\nShirone, stay quiet. Ill take care of it. No matter what happens to you\nRian.\nRian turned his head as Shirone spoke with a cold tone he had never heard him use before. Shirone was staring straight at him.\nYou are responsible for what you are responsible for.\nNot only the family, but Rian, too, felt chills at the impassive words that were comparable to Bischoffs.\nHuh? W-Well, yes. Of course.\nBut you dont have to take responsibility for things that you shouldnt be responsible for. This situation was created by the two of us. Well just have to get through it together.\nShirone looked back at Rian and smiled.\nEven if I die on this spot, I dont regret being your friend.\nSilence ensued.\nNot only the servants, but also the members of the Ogent family couldnt help but turn solemn in the moment.\nAnd for Rian, it was like pouring fuel into an already burning flame.\nYeah! Thats exactly what Im saying! Even if Im ostracized, well still remain friends!\nThe servants started to murmur amongst themselves.\nThey were cynical at first, but now they couldnt figure out who to side with.\nReina, who was resting her chin using the back of her hand, smiled.\nYou are really amazing, Shirone!\nHe silenced the adults with indisputable logic.\nThe reason why Shirones words could not be refuted was because they were all human beings. And all human beings had to deal with a thing called emotion.\nIm sure everyone here has had a friend like Shirone. A person they wish they could be friends with forever.\nThe stone-cold logic of the Ogent family was also something that a human created. And as much as one would like to separate emotions from the equation, such a thing was simply not possible for humans.\nHes smart. In a sense, hes similar to dad.\nNevertheless, the reason why he didnt dislike Shirone was because sincerity preceded calculation.\nWell, you never know. Thats the power of sincerity. It makes you want to believe. And Shirone definitely has that power.\nPerhaps that was Shirones greatest weapon, Reina thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 14\nSuddenly, a loud voice from the second floor was heard.\nHAHAHA! Such a masterpiece! I didnt expect to see this kind of a spectacle in my later years! Being young is indeed the best!\nThe startled maids screamed, while the family members sighed as they looked behind.\nThere, an old man with blue hair stood, leaning against the balcony of the second floor.\nShirone stared absent-mindedly.\nEven if Shirone were to consider this man as what Rian would eventually become, he couldnt imagine Rian having muscles that looked like they were about to explode.\nThe old man was Rians grandfather, Klumph Ogent.\nGrandfather!\nReina stood up with a look of happiness.\nConsidering Reina and Rian were definitely not enough to persuade the black-haired Lord, he came at the perfect time.\nIts all good now. If its grandfather\nTurning a blind eye to his daughters expression, Bischoff asked.\nI see youve arrived, father. I heard from Reina that it should have taken a few more days.\nChuckle!\nI came early because my friend ran away with a young maiden. Anyways, this place is as noisy as ever. As expected, youth is a fine thing.\nIts not exactly a good thing in this case. The face of our family has fallen to the ground.\nLets not jump to conclusions here. Ive been watching behind the scenes for a bit now, and its evident that everyone here has a lot they want to say. So, why dont we decide after hearing each others opinions about whether we have lost face or not?\nReina screamed inside, Grandfather is the best!\nAlthough Klumph left the position as the Lord of the house to his son, his voice as a Grade 3 swordsman was still influential.\nReina gained courage and stood up.\nIll go first. Although I only met Shirone for the first time yesterday, I noticed he was a smart and talented child. Also, Shirone has completed all the contract requirements and was supposed to leave the house today. Given these circumstances, its quite difficult to say that Shirone approached Rian with particularly malevolent intentions. Furthermore, I do not believe his actions have tarnished the familys reputation.\nWith her attitude packed with conviction, she sat down proudly.\nThough it was only now that the two opposing sides balanced, the tide still did not turn.\nCompared to those with black hair, it could be said that the bonds shared between those with blue hair was stronger. So Klumph, who was a previous Lord, was fair.\nHence, Rai was given the floor to speak his opinion.\nWhat are your thoughts, my second grandson?\nRai replied in a polite, frosty tone.\nI do not like that kid.\nThe opinions of the servants were shaken once again by the remark of the familys most promising prospect.\nBut I dont want to care anymore. This matter has nothing to do with me.\nBischoff asked him.\nWhat do you mean? You say you dislike him, but you dont want to be bothered anymore?\nExactly. I dont like that kid. But with the only reason being that I dislike him, I dont want to give false opinions. So Im just speaking the truth. I dont care because I dont want to. I dont care who Rian befirends, I simply want this matter to be done with so that we can head to the royal palace.\nReina held her tongue.\nAlthough he was her younger brother, he was egocentric to the core.\nHowever, at least in this instance, his personality seemed to work in Rians favor.\nKlumph giggled like a schoolgirl.\nIt amused him to see that his family members had their own unique personalities.\nThen to conclude, lets hear the opinion of the deputy butler who mustve observed the boy, Shirone, for the longest time.\nAs Temuran took a step forward, Louis sent a sidelong glance towards him, warning him that he had to pick the correct side here.\nWhat kind of words cannot be said between family members? But what was important to the servants was their masters thoughts and preferences.\nShirone did the work I ordered him to do and he did it perfectly.\nLouis forehead wrinkled.\nYou cant even change up a few words or make up a lie. Thats why you cant go higher and escape that position of yours as the deputy butler.\nDid you know that they were friends?\nI knew he was frequently hanging around with the youngest young master, but I did not know they were friends. But in my opinion, if he were such a child, I do not think he would have been able to sort those 10,000 books.\nShirones eyes widened, as if surprised. He did not expect Temuran to speak of him that way. The head butler Louis stepped up.\nAre you taking sides now?\nThere was anger in his voice, but Temuran shook his head calmly.\nNo, I am also shocked that Shirone, a contract worker, managed to befriend the youngest young master. But as a deputy butler, Im only telling the truth.\nThis split the sides a bit.\nBischoff was the only one who insisted on punishing Shirone, and even he, who was the Lord, could not ignore the rest of the familys opinion.\nAfter all, he became the Lord for his family.\nRian let loose a breath as the tension left his body, and Shirones expression as well seemed a bit lighter.\nI cannot approve.\nKlumph made the final decision.\nFather.\nGrandfather!\nBischoff and Rian shouted at the same time, but the reason why they called out were polar opposites.\nI understand that they recognize each other as friends. But it ends now. If the relationship continues, rumors will eventually spread and this might become a weakness for the political opponents to snatch and use against us. It is not good for Rians future either. So just think that you guys built enough of those good memories together, and end the relationship here. I think thats the right thing to do.\nOn the one hand, Reina was disappointed with her grandfather. But on the other hand, she also understood why.\nFamily matters were important. In fact, they were more important than anything else.\nThe family members were still active on duty, and above all, Rai had his certified exam coming up.\nIt was their natural duty to get rid of any room for political strife.\nHe should be grateful that he even gets to keep his life!\nBut Rians thinking was different.\nKlumph responded with a bright smile to his youngest grandson, whose eyes burnt with hostility.\nI see youve got pretty splendid energy, Rian\nAlthough he understood the feelings of his grandson, who was the apple of his eyes, a lot of lives were at stake.\nNo one objected to Klumphs opinion. The decision seemed to have been made by the looks of it.\nShirone, what do you think? I would like to thank you for teaching my naive grandson true friendship, but can you end it here? Its hard for nobles and commoners to be friends.\n* * *\n* * *\nShirone, who thought about it for a moment, spoke.\nI cant do that.\nHis unexpected answer shook not only Bischoff, but also Reina and Rai.\nBut the one who was the most taken aback was Rian.\nSh-Shirone.\nIf I am a hindrance to Rians future, I dont mind not seeing him ever again. But that doesnt make him any less of a friend to me. If you take that into account, Ill follow your orders.\nRians eyes were filled with tears.\nIm ashamed.\nIn the corner of his mind, he thought it was enough that Shirone was fortunate to not die.\nI was the one who lacked faith in my friend.\nShirone knew that abandoning a friend was equivalent to abandoning oneself.\nIts non-negotiable. Right, Shirone?\nRian raised his sword high and shouted.\nI declare\nReinas face was filled with anxiety.\nDont do it.\nRian was different from Shirone, when Rian became worked up, trouble always occurred.\nAnd her uneasiness was proven correct.\nTurning to Shirone, Rian stabbed his sword onto the floor before anyone could say anything.\nRian knelt on one knee as his family stared blankly at the sword that pierced the marble floor.\nI, Rian Ogent, the third son of the Ogent family, will become Shirones sword as of this time.\nWhat?! You fool!\nBischoff threw his image out the window as the Lord and shouted. Even if Rian really meant it, it wasnt something that should be said at his young age.\nWith an absurd look, Reina asked him.\nDid you just take a knights oath?\nA knights oath.\nIt was an oath that could not be overturned and was a decision one could only make if they were resolved enough Resolved enough to become a sword for the one they swore to.\nEven in the noble society full of all sorts of slander, the reason why this oath was always kept was because honor was everything to a knight. The more honor a knight had, the longer their noble house could stand proud.\nOnce in a lifetime. Rian had made that frightening promise to Shirone.\nBischoff was speechless.\nThe moment one took the knights oath, it was impossible to withdraw it. Even if you dont go through the entirety of it, the minute one withdraws it, they become someone respected less than a rabid dog.\nRian, what in the world are you doing?\nShirone couldnt hide his shock, but Rian thought this was enough.\nYou thought I would choose not to see my friend forever? What do you think? Now, youre in a double bind.\nWhen Rian turned his head, his family saw something they had never seen before.\nMaster, it looks like I made quite the splash this time around.\nHowever, to Klumph, it was refreshing nonetheless.\nHmm\nKlumph rubbed his large chin.\nTo be honest, I did not expect him to be this immature, but his actions do not annoy or anger me He reminds me of myself.\nWell, if hes planning on being immature all the way through, might as well go all the way.\nHiding his true feelings, Kumph asked sternly.\nRian, when you say you are going to be his sword, does that mean that boy has the qualifications?\nI believe hes overflowing with it.\nThen answer me this: Is he overflowing due to his own brilliance, or does he shine bright to you because you feel inadequate?\nRian thought.\nIs Shirone the one shining brilliantly, or does he simply shine because I feel inferior? Why did Grandpa ask this question?\nHe replied.\nA sword does not judge. They simply protect.\nHe made a sound of admiration.\nKlumph was satisfied.\nThank goodness his basics are strong!\nAs Rian said, a sword does not think.\nIts only job was to cut in the direction its owner wanted.\nYoure quite good with your words. But with that lame swordsmanship of yours, I feel sorry for your friend who got a sword like you.\nRian shot daggers at him.\nGrandfather!\nOf course, all tension had dissipated at this point.\nIt was partly because they went on a path no one could reverse, but more than that, it was more so because they did not have the energy to care anymore.\nKlumph felt that things came to a satisfying conclusion.\nAll right, thats it. Help that master of yours stand up. Oh, and Shirone, though hes not the most polished sword yet, he will never strike against you. Take good care of my grandson.\nShirone bowed his head. He felt that he had to at least show some respect, after all, his actions had damaged the pride of the Ogent family.\nThank you for your approval.\nIt was all him. I did nothing. I heard that youve completed your work here? Youre planning on going back home, correct?\nYes, my parents should be waiting.\nYou must miss them. However, since the two of you promised to be friends for life, it must be sad to go back like this. Hey, Louis.\nYes, your Grace.\nThe carriage that Shirone was supposed to take to get back home? Take his parents here instead.\nRight away.\nThe head butler immediately left the mansion.\nThe situation with Shirone was no longer something he could deal with.\nLouis realized again at that moment that a nobles way of thinking was completely beyond his understanding.",

      "content": "Chapter 15\nBy the time Shirone and Rian returned to the room, it was nearing noon.\nHaha! Did you see their faces?! That felt sooooo good!\nBut are you really okay? That knights oath I think you overdid it because of me.\nRians expression became serious. Despite how immature he was, he understood the weight of the knights oath.\nShirone, I did not take the oath because you are my friend. Youre different from my brother. You have the power to attract people.\nShirone felt the sincerity.\nBut listening to such praise made him feel awkward, so to lift the mood a bit, he tried to joke around.\nHaha! I feel too much pressure. But if you want to protect me, youll have to improve by several folds.\nRian flinched.\nHey, dont poke where it hurts. I already know that. By the way, you surprised me there. Saying what you wanted to say in front of my whole family. Werent you scared?\nHehe, theres a secret to that.\nShirone explained how he imagined jumping off a cliff, which he realized before his sword battle with Rian.\nThinking it would be of some help towards improving his swordsmanship, Rian was puzzled once he heard the story.\nJumping off a cliff? Why would you do that? Are you perhaps An idiot?\nAn idiot?\nHe couldnt believe Rian called him an idiot.\nNo, just listen carefully. I dont mean you should actually jump off a cliff. Simply imagine it. You arent dead until you fall flat on the ground. It means that you need to focus on the present instead of needlessly imagining the future.\nBut if you jump off, youre dead. Its you who needs to think it over. If you jump, youre as good as dead.\nArgh, seriously! If you dont even jump off the cliff, ultimately, youll end up not being able to do anything!\nAha, then I can do it. For example, I would jump without any hesitation to save you. Because thats what a knight does.\nShirone blinked.\nIt was completely different from what he wanted to convey, but he thought that was who Rian was.\nYou really are the polar opposite of me.\nAt that moment, someone came in. Someone who he thought he would never meet again.\nAs Reina peeked her head inside the room, she let out a small sigh. Shirones face flushed at the sight of her.\nHi. The atmosphere on the opponents side was too fierce, so I came to my allys base to evacuate.\nGet out. We were having a man-to-man talk.\nShirone waved his hands around hurriedly as Rian was sending Reina away.\nWhats wrong with you, Rian? Your sister helped out a lot. You're welcome to come in, Reina.\nHey, you just dont understand. That witch must be\nRian, who was spitting out slander, thought for a while and closed his mouth.\nShirone and Reina. Reina and Shirone. Those two names were coming and going in his head.\nReina came closer, walking briskly like a cat, and sat between the two.\nAnyways. Rian, you were pretty cool back there. I cant believe you took out the knights oath card. I really cant beat you.\nHow come you sound like youre teasing me?\nHeheh, did I get caught?\nAre you serious?! Why the hell are you even here?! Did you just come here to annoy me?!\nWhat do you take me for? I just accomplished my job as the spy of the team. Theres a pretty serious conversation going on over there on the opponents side.\nWhat can be worse than what just happened?\nActually, dad was thinking of sending you, along with Rai, to the palace.\nIt was Rians first time hearing this.\nBesides, despite the fact he was a genius, nobody knew whether Rai would get the approval, so why would he tag along?\nWhat are you talking about? They want me to go on a field trip or something?\nNo, they want to enroll you into the Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy. You know, the largest one in the Kingdom of Thormia? The academy that produced 10 certified Grade 1 swordsmen in 200 years?\nWhat? Why did you guys decide that without discussing it with me? I thought I could play around with Shirone as much as I liked, but now I have to go to an academy? What about my Master?\nYour instructor already knows. Thats why he ended his contract yesterday and went back to his hometown this morning. I heard you guys even said your goodbyes. You didnt know about this?\nRian looked at Kites sword. It was thanks to this sword that he was able to carry out his will.\nMaster!\nHe was someone who cared about Rian more than anybody else.\nThe reason why he ended the contract with no opposition was because he wanted his student to grow a bit more.\nBut this is too sudden. What about Shirone?\nThats why the family is talking. They are thinking about sending you and Shirone to the academy together. You said yesterday that Shirone is better at wielding a sword than you.\nShirone was startled.\nDue to Rians personality, he wouldnt have spoken about it first, and Reina seemed to be puzzled by this too.\nWhy me\nWhile delusional ideas and thoughts flashed through Shirones head, Rian was thinking more realistically.\nWell, thats true. But Shirones not going to the swordsmanship academy. Theres something else he wants to do. Actually, I was thinking about something But since it has come to this, you should ask our grandfather for something.\nHuh? What do you mean?\nReina turned her head to face Shirone, but Shirone didnt open his mouth. It was not something he could openly talk about.\nIn the first place, it was unrealistic to even try and enroll a commoner in a swordsmanship academy.\nHowever, no one in the Ogent family was currently opposed to supporting Shirone.\nSince Rian had made his knights oath, even if it was only for the honor of the Ogent family, Shirone had to succeed. He had to become someone special.\nWhen Rian saw Shirones hesitation, Rian spoke up in his stead.\nBecause Shirone is going to become a mage. Hes not interested in swordsmanship.\nReinas eyes widened.\nWhat? A mage? So you actually lost to an aspirant mage in a sword fight? Rian Thats pathetic.\nShut up! I know! But Shirone is really a genius! Im positive hed be a lot better than Rai if he were a swordsman.\nOho, hes that strong?\nRian was not the type to disparage even his enemies, so to him, Shirone looked different. Special.\nN-No. How could I\nSensing Reinas gaze, Shirone didnt know where to look, so he ended up lowering his eyes.\nAlright. Ill propose that to the other side. But you might still be enrolled in the swordsmanship academy, Rian. Dad is someone who uses his opponents weaknesses thoroughly.\nTsk! Whatever. Ill think about it.\nAfter all, for the sake of his master, he would not only take on the academy, but an army if need be.\nActually, this is important to me, too!\nHe wont be able to protect Shirone with his current sword skills.\nFollowing a knock, a butler entered.\nYoung master Shirones family has just arrived. They are supposed to be escorted to the mansion, but if the young master would like to greet them, I was ordered by the Lord to guide you to them.\nRian slapped his knee.\nOh! Shirones parents? What do you want to do, Shirone?\nThe answer was obvious.\nShirone was bouncing up and down in excitement, his eyes were already stuck in the direction of the front gate of the mansion.\nChuckling, Reina told him.\nBring them here, Shirone. My family will be waiting in the living room. Please, lead Shirone to his family.\nRight away, miss.\nShirone followed the butler out of the mansion.\nThis way. The stairs are high, so please be careful.\nThe butlers attitude made him uncomfortable. Just a day ago, they didnt even bother with him, but now? They were treating him like a noble.\nExcuse me, you can just act the usual way you do. Its not like I became a nobleman or something.\nNo! Please dont say that. My head may fall off.\nShirone, who once risked his life for mere books, knew the stress servants experienced better than anyone else.\nEven if you make a mistake, I wont tell anyone, so dont be like that.\nThe butlers eyes showed a bit of relief, but he was still on his toes.\nNo matter.\nShirone didnt care anymore. No he couldnt care less.\nThis was because a carriage arrived at the end of the Broad Way.\nWhen he saw his parents faces, his vision got blurry. The tears he suppressed while living in such an uncomfortable environment poured out.\nNot even hearing the butlers shout, Shirone ran towards the front gate.\nMom! Dad!\n* * *\n* * *\nShirone took his parents to the reception room. Their eyes were swollen. They could not hold in their emotions.\nIt took them some time to get their emotions together.\nThe meeting was pushed back, perhaps due to Klumphs consideration, and due to this, Shirone was able to release the emotions that he had bottled up inside.\nLet me take a look at you, son. Your face is all pinched and worn out. I can tell youve been through much, my son. You did a good job. Such a good job.\nTears formed in Vincents eyes once again.\nShirones complexion had actually improved, but from his parents perspective, it looked like he didnt eat or sleep enough during his stay here.\nIt wasn't bad, I was able to read a lot of books. I had a lot of fun. How have you been, father? Everything has been good, I hope?\nOf course! Weve both been doing well. Well, maybe a bit too well, perhaps? Look at your mom. She ended up becoming so pretty that you almost ended up having a younger brother.\nHoney, what are you blabbering on about in front of our son?\nShirone smiled ruefully.\nHis parents were much thinner compared to when he left.\nHow would they be able to eat properly when they were busy worrying about their child everyday?\nWhen he considered those thoughts, he choked up again.\nSuddenly, Vincent became curious.\nAt first, he was very nervous thinking something had happened to his son. But after seeing Shirones relaxed form, he felt like nothing bad had occurred.\nSo, why were we brought here? If you finished your work, you should have been allowed to come home right away. Surely they arent stopping you from going back, right?\nNo, no. Its nothing like that. Its just that I managed to take advantage of a nice opportunity.\nHm? A nice opportunity?\nShirone told them the story of what had happened this morning.\nHe was able to tell them the story without any trouble because he had already put together an outline of how he should tell the story in his head.\nBut from the listeners standpoint, the story was so mind-blowing that it left them speechless.\nAs Vincent continued to listen, he became more and more astonished.\nTo be honest, he stopped listening to Shirone past a certain point.\nHe couldnt comprehend what his son was talking about.\nHe became friends with the youngest young master of the Ogent family? And that same person promised a knights oath to him? Furthermore, the family accepted it and allowed them to carry on being friends?\nThe story continued to break apart his common sense, it felt like thunder was reverberating inside his head.\nWhen the story came to an end, Vincent scratched his head in silence.\nHe knew he was a smart and bright kid. But even so, this story made no sense.\nMaybe something went wrong inside his brain? Did he go delusional after being tormented here for a long time?\nShirone, be honest with me. This dad can, and will, do anything for you. What in the world happened to you? Who the heck made you like this?\nIts all true, dad. Why would I lie about something this?\nOkay! You are not a liar. So tell me, who bullied you?! Who treated you harshly?!\nVincent was genuinely angry.\nHes heard of numerous cases where commoners were wrongly entangled with nobles and became forever handicapped.\nEven Shirone thought the story was ridiculous, but he couldnt think of a better way to explain it to them.\nWhile he was stuck between a rock and a hard place, trying to think of a way to answer, the Ogent family entered the reception room.",

      "content": "Chapter 16\nBischoff greeted them as the representative of the Ogent family.\nNice to meet you. Im Bischoff Ogent, the family head.\nKlumph and Rai did not come, but instead, Rian and Reina accompanied him.\nRian bravely stepped forward.\nHello, father! I am Rian, Shirones sword. In time, I will become the best swordsman in the world. Hahaha!\nIm Reina, Rians older sister. Ive heard a lot about you.\nAfter staring blankly for a while, Vincent quickly realized the situation and lowered his head.\nHello! Im Shirones father. Why are such important people, such as yourselves, here?\nOh my, did you not hear from Shirone?\nYes? What do you mean?\nThe only thing that came to Vincents mind was his sons nonsensical story.\nSo youre saying the story is true?\nOh, I see. We should have come sooner. Anyways, what Shirone said is true. My little brother, Rian, and Shirone are bonded together due to the knights oath. Thats why we called for you two.\nWhen Vincent became aware that the whole story was true, his heart skipped a beat.\nHis joy was brief as fear rushed in, quickly replacing it. How could his innocent son cause this much trouble? What was he thinking?\nFirst of all, lets eat. We can talk about the details after.\nBischoff turned around after their short conversation.\nBischoff was not particularly friendly, so Rian could only imagine how uncomfortable Shirone's parents felt.\nEven after the rest of the Ogent family left, Vincent could not leave his spot for a while. Only when Shirone slightly pulled him by his shirt did he come back to his senses. Once that happened, he headed for the living room.\nIs this real? Our Shirone? Staying with the Ogent family?\nEverything confused him, and Olina, still terrified of the situation, grabbed onto her husbands arm tightly. But little did Olina know that even Vincent was terrified. His legs were shaking as if they were leaves being ravaged by the wind. He couldnt even walk properly.\nNO!\nVincent shook his head.\nIf Shirones words were true, he could not show any weakness. For his son, he had to stay strong.\nVarious delicacies were placed on the square dining table. Even Vincent, who was a hunter, saw foods he had never seen before. The ingredients were transported from the royal palace by Reina.\nAs for the seating arrangement, it went according to ones rank. Lord of the house, Bischoff, sat at the head of the table, on his left sat Klumph, while Reina was at his right.\nSeated at the very end of the table, Vincent was finally snapped out of his stupor when he saw the delicacies in front of him. Head butler, Louis, and deputy butler, Temuran, unconsciously puffed out their chest in pride.\nBut Vincent couldnt openly show his enthusiasm. He had to save face for his son. He had to finish the meal quietly, but his eyes couldnt help it. When he saw over seven different dishes around him, his eyes twinkled.\nMost commoners were able to eat whole boars with just a fork. However, the dishes in front of Vincent were all of different sizes. There were even foods in shapes he had never seen before.\nAlthough the Vincent family could not take their first bite, the butlers and maids made no move to help them. This was because acting rashly in this unprecedented situation will only harm them.\nOf course, such a decision was also mixed with a little contempt for the Vincent family.\nBischoff placed down his tableware and spoke.\nEat comfortably. You do not have to follow the formalities of the nobility.\nStill\nFormality is just a discipline necessary to put respect into action. Seeing as how you are having a hard time, and considering my family and I can sense enough of your respect and consideration, please eat comfortably.\nVincent slightly shuddered.\nWhether it was true sincerity or the pride of a noble, from the familys perspective, his words showed great kindness and favor.\nThen the maids faces turned pale.\nThe Ogent familys feelings toward Shirone were genuine. They were really thinking of accepting Shirone.\nThe bewildered maids hurriedly taught the Vincent family how to use the tableware.\nIn fact, it only looked complicated, but in reality, how could using utensils and eating be complicated? The Vincent family, who now had an inkling on how to use the utensils, finally ate comfortably.\nAfter all that trouble, Vincent was worried about his son this time. What was this family going to do to Shirone?\nHe had heard an explanation of what the knights oath was, but that made no difference to what Vincent was thinking.\nShirone was still the son of a mountaineer, and aside from the fact he was brilliant, his future was not guaranteed.\nDid they perhaps have something else up their sleeves?\nHe didnt want to doubt the people who did his child a favor. But he did not want to risk anything in regards to his son.\nIm grateful that you are thinking of him in a good light, but at the same time, I cant say Im not worried. Isnt the Ogent family one of the most prestigious ones in Creas? And I still cant believe that a young master of such a family made a knights oath to Shirone.\nHaha! You dont have to worry. Shirone and I\nBischoff cut Rian off.\nIf I am to speak honestly, it is a little unpleasant.\nThe room suddenly became quiet at Bischoffs statement, But Bischoff continued to eat with the knife in his hand.\n* * *\n* * *\nBut its a knights oath. A knight's oath is a sacred thing, especially in a family like ours. It binds people together for life. If I were to keep holding on to these unpleasant feelings just because the only difference between us is status, that would tarnish Rian's pride. So dont be too uncomfortable by it as we will continue to use honorifics in the future.\nShirone realized.\nBischoff was a cold and cruel man. A man cold and cruel enough to demand the execution of a commoner But only for the sake of his family. His loyalty towards his family was beyond imagination.\nFighting for their beliefs. That is nobility.\nNow that he couldnt choose an easy path, all he had to do was fight against the world.\nThere will be innumerable difficulties and criticisms But Im not afraid.\nThis, too, was the pride of the Ogent.\nKlumph spoke while chuckling.\nIt has been quite a bit since our family head has said something right. But wont you die of loneliness if you send your last son away just like that? Why not just spend another year before doing that?\nBischoff was not provoked.\nRai has unlocked Schema as well as learned the swordsmanship of Ogent. Hence why he is more than likely to win official approval. On the other hand, Rian has yet to unlock his Schema. I have no choice but to enroll him in this Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy.\nIt sounds like youre subtly taking the black-haired approach. However, we blue-hairs have passion, and that passion never withers away. If you look down at our burning passion, you will be in for a rude awakening.\nWhile munching on a lamb, Rian sent a thumbs up to his grandfather.\nBischoff snorted. His fathers playfulness was nothing new.\nHair color does not matter to me. As long as they have the same blood flowing in their veins, they are family. And that family is\nSitting up straight in their chairs, all the family members placed down their utensils and spoke in union.\nOgent.\n* * *\nAfter the meal, everyone returned to the living room and sat down.\nThey began to discuss Shirone's situation.\nReina broke the news that Shirone was interested in learning magic, which everyone agreed was alright. Due to his physique and his tendencies, Shirone would eventually reach a ceiling in terms of swordsmanship.\nUnlike the friendly atmosphere Klumph had during the meal, he told Vincent with a serious expression.\nAs you know, our family intends to support Shirone. It sounds like he wants to become a mage, so were thinking of sending him to Alpheas Magic Academy. The academy is also one of the top five prestigious academies in the Kingdom of Tormia. The Headmaster, Headmaster Alpheas, is also an old friend of mine. Its an institution appointed by the kingdom, so if one graduates from there, they will receive an unofficial license Which means they can become a mage.\nM-Mage\nVincent gulped.\nMages were symbols of intelligence, so needless to say, most were nobles. However, it was a very unique occupation as, due to the ability-based nature of it, status did not dictate how far one could reach. And once they earned their license, they were highly sought after everywhere.\nIn the world, there were country bumpkins who realized magic on their own. There were also commoners who learned magic by learning under a mage.\nThose kinds of people typically became mercenaries. However, there was also the alternative of getting a job in an association and obtaining a mages license that way.\nThough, of course, those cases were extremely rare. And so for commoners, becoming a mage was merely a fantasy.\nBut it wasnt merely a fantasy for Shirone And as such, the offer wasnt something Vincent could refuse.\nAs Olina was moved to tears, Shirone embraced his mother.\nIt was a warm sight, but unexpectedly, Klumphs face was gloomy.\nClearly, the fastest way to become a mage was to enter a magic academy But the problem was status.\nUnlike other routes, a magic academy strictly allowed only nobility to enter for the most part. And despite the fact there was special admission for exceptional talents, to cut past that standard was like finding a needle in a haystack.\nTrying to achieve this was not easy, even for the Ogent family who was the 2nd-class noble in the kingdom.\nIn fact, the magic academy also regularly got enrollment requests from the 1st-class family.\nAs you may already know, Shirones current status does not qualify him for the magic academy. Even if we do aid him in terms of school materials, fees, and other such expenses, there will still be problems with getting him accepted.\nVincent snapped out of his dream.\nAh, of course I know. Yes Thats right.\nDisappointment and shame tinged Vincents voice.\nMy son was acknowledged by a noble family But he cant enter the academy because of my status\nThere is one way. No, its actually the only way.\nVincents head snapped up. Shirone, too, paid close attention as it was his first time hearing this.\nI would like to adopt Shirone into our family.\nSilence ruled the living room.\nKlumphs proposal sounded wrong But in actuality, it was not a bad proposal.\nTo be the child of a mountaineer Or a child of the Ogent It was a no-brainer which one was better.\nNevertheless, the reason why Vincent felt reluctant to speak was none other than the problem with bloodline.\nVincent studied Shirone.\nHis sons expression, while a little obnoxious, was still calm.\nHe couldnt figure out whether his sons expression was like that because he thought his father would obviously accept the proposal, or because he thought the proposal was too preposterous.\nBischoff continued after Klumph.\nWe discussed this between ourselves, and we concluded that this was the best option. I have a cousin who does not have any children yet. If he registers as part of my cousins family, Shirone will become a noble and will be able to enter the academy. Its merely a matter of paperwork, so nothing much will change.\nMerely a matter of paperwork Is it really that simple? Everything in the world is a matter of paperwork.\nTo be honest, Vincent was not confident.\nAm I confident enough to say that I wont be sad if I see Shirone registered as a son of another family?\nShirone, say something. What choice does this dad have to make? What do you really want?\nVincent looked back miserably at his son.\nThen Shirones brows furrowed. Vincent had a hunch that it was because he was frustrated that his father had no answer.\nAs this was a sensitive issue, everyone was careful with their words. It was Reina who broke the ice as she came forward and asked Shirone.\nShirone, what do you think? Its just paperwork. You will get to achieve your dream and become a nobleman on top of that. Of course, your parents will still be your parents. Nothing will change.\nHis frown deepened. And as if he could not understand all this, he said",

      "content": "Chapter 17\nThis is utter nonsense. Clearly, I am my fathers son. There will be no instances where I will be adopted as a son of another.\nSh-Shirone.\nVincent was touched.\nHe said it with no hesitation, and even his tone was layered with disgust as if just thinking about it was unpleasant.\nWhile the rest of his family members were dumbfounded, Klumph asked coldly.\nAre you completely sure you are okay with that? You have the chance to become a noble. This isnt an opportunity anyone can just get.\nIf Im required to become the son of another, I would rather live as a commoner.\nCommoners cannot enter the magic academy.\nThen I will not enter.\nIf you dont get into the magic academy, you cant become a mage.\nThen I wont become a mage.\nShirone!\nKlumph stood abruptly from his seat.\nShirones upright attitude was frustrating.\nOther times, he is such a smart boy, so why now, of all times, is he so hung up on such a simple problem?\nIs it guilt? Living in this world is no picnic. There are things you have to sacrifice for success. Is that dream of yours that insignificant to you?\nSimply looking up the large build of Klumph must have felt overwhelming, but Shirone replied calmly.\nMaybe thats why.\nWhat?\nNo matter how small or big my dream may be, that is something I inherited from my parents. They were the roots that nurtured me and allowed me to dream. I mean, look at me, the child of a mountaineer working in a mansion. And even before all that, reading Its because of them I can read. If I must make a comparison, this one opportunity I have right now does not even come close to standing alongside the countless other ones my parents have handed me. Telling me to deny my roots and to be nurtured by another is no different from telling me to wither and die.\nSilence enveloped the living room.\nThey werent simply impressed by Shirones words He made them reflect.\nKlumph was very shocked.\nIts not guilt. He understands the way we humans grow.\nEven if one were to miss an opportunity right in front of their eyes, new ones would eventually turn up.\nHowever, the moment one abandons the people who helped them get to where they are, they lose everything.\nSuddenly he had this idea.\nMaybe he was thinking incorrectly from the start? Even without someones help, wouldnt this child eventually become a mage?\nRian, maybe it was you who was the lucky one.\nIf even the honor of the Ogent family is just a passing opportunity for this child\nThen no one can restrain this child!\nAfter a long time, since no one bothered to open their mouth, only then did Shirone smile.\nI am grateful for the proposal. But I cant accept it. The only ones who I can call my parents are the two people here right now.\nVincent clenched his fists hard.\nHe was embarrassed. He wanted to crawl under his chair and never come back up.\nWhy feel hurt by meaningless documents? My son believes in me, a parent who has done nothing for him.\nShirone\nFather.\nVincents head hung down.\nPlease, take Shirone as an adopted son!\nNo one thought of him as a lacking parent because they, too, had a family of their own.\nHowever, this was not a simple matter that could be solved by being persistent.\nI understand how you feel, but it cant be helped. How can I turn blind eye to Shirones heart?\nTo be honest, Shirone Shirone is not actually my child.\nHoney!\nEyes widened after Vincents remark, but out of everyone, Shirone was the most shocked.\nIt wasnt because it was kept a secret, in fact, everyone in the room had thought about it at least once.\nShirone looked completely different from his parents. Both in appearance and physique.\nHowever, despite not being blood-related, for the sake of his son, Vincent was ready to give up everything.\nWe cannot have children. Shirone is a child that was given to us by coincidence. Im sure hes a child of nobility, as you would have assumed living with him. I am not worthy of him. On the contrary, if he becomes an adopted son of a noble, its like returning him back to his original position. He wont be denying his roots.\nSeeing the reasoning behind his words, the gathered people thought over it.\nBut breaking their thoughts, Shirone shouted with a very hurt look.\nDad!\nSh-Shirone.\nWhat are you doing?! How could you say that without discussing it?! Youve never said anything about that before!\nIm sorry, Shirone. But since youre now grown up, to some extent\nDo you know why I didnt ask? Because everyone only gets one father and one mother. How many parents are you going to make for me? Its to the point where Im about to have six parents because of you, father.\nVincent was stunned.\nTwo of the adoptive parents, two of themselves, and two of those who abandoned Shirone. A total of six. If he was to think that way, what he was about to do to his child was ridiculous.\nIm just sad that you are giving up your dream because of me\nWho said Im giving up on my dream? If I continue to work hard, another opportunity will surely arise! Do you know how it feels to be abandoned twice?!\nAs soon as he saw his sons eyes fill with tears, Vincent realized his mistake.\nShirone, Im sorry! What in the world did I do? I wont ever leave you under the care of someone else. I will do everything to make your dream come true!\nDad!\nAs Vincent pulled him in for a firm hug, Shirone wiped away his tears and jumped into his fathers arms.\nHow upset he must have been, a thoughtful child who didnt even express his own emotions, in fear he would hurt someone.\nWhile the Ogent family watched with pleased faces, it was Bischoff who was particularly swayed by the scene.\nHe was a father who had to raise four sons and a daughter alone as his wife left without him.\nBischoff quietly told Klumph.\nI have no choice but to ask you to use a bit of your strength.\nYoure asking for all sorts of things from this old man. How would I use my strength? Even the scholars, who are quick-witted, are all tongue-tied under Alpheas obstinacy.\nEven though Klumph was whining about it, his expression wasnt particularly dark.\nThen Ill have to give an order as the family head. How about going through with a special admission? Ive heard there is an old debt\nHmph! Alpheas? That guy? You think he only owes me one? The problem is, hes not one to break the rules.\nSo its not possible?\nWell, who knows? Arent reckless tactics best used against principled men?\nBischoff smiled silently.\nThis was because he remembered the circumstances in which he was forced to take over the family due to such reckless tactics.\n* * *\n* * *\nShirone stayed in the Ogent family until the day Rian left for the Swordsmanship Academy.\nShirone, as well, did not know if his special admission would pass. But even if he were to pass, he would enter the school early next year, so he still had six months to spend with his parents.\nA few days later, an antique-like carriage was stationed near the main gate, waiting to depart.\nIt was a carriage that would take the family to the royal castle.\nRai was already on board, and Klumph decided to meet with Alpheas first and join them later.\nRian, who did not want to say goodbye, could not hold back his tears.\nWhether it was a magic academy or a swordsmanship academy, the period of graduating from one was not specifically set.\nIf one failed the graduation exam, getting stuck in an academy for years was not an impossibility. So if they were to split now, there was no set date as to when they could meet again.\nRian grabbed Shirones shoulder.\nShirone, you must become a mage! Ill write you letters!\nOkay, its not like were never seeing each other again, and we can also come back from time to time. Stop crying.\nIm certain you can graduate! I guarantee it!\nReina socked him in the head.\nFor crying out loud! Worry about yourself! Youre the one we are all worried about the most!\nHey! Im going to work hard, too, you know! Ill become the best knight and become Shirones sword.\nShirone believed his words and had no doubts. He was sure Rian would do well.\nAlthough he was no genius like Rai, he possessed things that Rai did not.\nReina turned to Shirone and smiled.\nShirone, you dont have to worry, have fun with your family for the time being. Im sure my grandfather will get you enrolled in the academy. Hes someone who keeps his word.\nYes. And Thank you for your help.\nShirone spoke with sincerity\nEven if he was friends with Rian, things wouldnt have worked out this well without Reinas support.\nReina stared at Shirone.\nHe really is a unique child!\nAt first, she only thought of him as a boy four years younger than her, but she changed her mind after the incident.\nHe may not have grown up physically yet, but his mind was already something to marvel at.\nAnd above all, the fact that Shirone was interested in her was very important.\nShirone, do you\nJust as Reina was about to say something, she stopped and started laughing as she realized just how absurd the idea was.\nJust 16-years-old His future's so bright.\nIf Shirone gets into the magic academy, he will meet so many talented people. And his eyes his eyes will surely change\nNo, its nothing. Lets work hard, both of us. I also think you can become a mage.\nYes, please take good care of Rian.\nHaha, dont worry. Since hes made his oath, he will do his best. I dont need to nag him.\nReina looked back at Shirone one more time. She waved, and got into the carriage.\nAs soon as the four horses stomped out, Rian opened the window and stuck his head out.\nShirone! You are the best! When you get into the magic academy, crush them all!\nShirone waved his hand big.\nYou too! Be sure to graduate!\nThus, his life as a worker for the Ogents ended.\nHooo.\nWhen he finally grasped that it was over, his heart felt a little heavy.\nThe Broad Way of the Ogent family, which intimidated him when he first arrived, now felt like something that wished him good luck.\nYoung master, let's go. Ill escort you home.\nSeeing the carriage waiting, Shirone finally realized\nHe was really going home.\nShirone bowed his head towards the Ogent familys mansion.\nThank you.\n* * *\nAlpheas Magic Academy, Noon.\nDespite the fact it was class time, there were two old men who sat opposite each other, both drinking tea in the headmasters office.\nA large, blue-haired man and another who wore a gentle smile while looking out the window.\nAlpheas Myrhe and Klumph Ogent. Both have been friends for over 50 years\nThe conversation between the two had stopped over half an hour ago.\nTo be more specific, it was Klumph who was waiting for Alpheas answer.\nHe didnt care how long it took.\nIt was Alpheas turn to answer, so Klumph was just waiting.\nEven if its from you, I cant do you any favors of that kind.\nConsidering how long it took for such a short answer, most wouldve been frustrated by it, but Klumph just grinned.\nHe dragged on, as if making a difficult decision, but in truth, he must have done that for show\nBecause the Alpheas he knew was mischievous like that.\nEven if its from you? Do you know how much I suffered because of you when we were young?\nKAHAHA! For such flattery to leave your mouth, you must be in quite a hurry. But you have to know, the special admission was not made just to become a free pass for nobles. Countless requests are made every year, but most do not meet the heavy criteria.\nKeukeuh, how funny. A free pass for nobles But this is different.\nAlpheas became slightly uneasy.\nThe tactless and stubborn Klumphs eyes were full of mischief, warning Alpheas that whatever he was thinking of was not ordinary.\n...What is it?\nIm not asking you to accept some scoundrel. Its actually the opposite. He is a friend of my youngest grandson, and hes very talented. I see the young you in him.\nRecalling his past, Alpheas eyes dimmed, as he realized that time truly did pass quickly.\nHmm, your youngest grandson You mean that immature and reckless Rian? Hes very much like you.\nKekeke! I threw him into a swordsmanship academy because hes not talented enough. Anyways, Im not here to talk about Rian. Im here to talk about Rians friend.\nIf hes that talented, why not just enroll him in the academy normally? But since youre here, I imagine theres a reason why you cant just do that.\nIndeed, there is a problem. A big one. Hes not a noble.\nAlpheas eyebrows narrowed slightly. A short, but intense memory from four years ago flashed through his mind.\nNo way Is he perhaps a blonde, blue-eyed boy?",

      "content": "Chapter 18\nThis time, it was Klumphs turn to be surprised. He always thought this, but Alpheas was a friend who knew how to play with people.\nHuh? I did hear that when the path of magic opens up, you gain the ability of foresight. I guess its true.\nIts not like that. I just had a short interaction with him before He left a pretty strong impression.\nAs rare as it was to encounter such a man of talent around the world, it was even more uncommon to discover someone as talented as Shirone in the magic academy.\nMoreover, he could guarantee that Shirone was the only commoner who was in the city of Creas.\nSo that is what happened\nAlpheas briefly described his encounter with Shirone who, at the time, was 12 years old.\nAfter Alpheas finished his story, Klumph began talking about how Shirone joined the Ogent family.\nHmm Shirone Arian.\nAlpheas went silent again. But this time, he was actually deep in thought.\nKlumph spoke.\nWhy dont you just take him in? Who knows, maybe it is fate. Dont you think so?\nFate is a foolish word and concept. Humans shape their own futures. If you deem whatever happens to you as fate, then at that point, fate controls your life. You give up trying because whatever happens is fated to be.\nIt didnt work this time either.\nKlumph pursed his lips.\nOn one side, his heart pained. It was because he understood his friends dilemma.\nYou still havent forgiven yourself?\nAlpheas went quiet.\nDespite the sharp stares of the nobles, you probably opened the special admission because of your regret over your youth. But youve done enough. You have already raised countless prodigies, so stop dishonoring yourself. Forgive yourself and let go.\nHuhuhu, there exists arrogance when forgiving oneself. I was someone who trashed the precious talent gifted by god. Its not something that can be forgiven. Im just hoping that a person like me will never appear again.\nKlumph let out a deep sigh.\nAlpheas was a certified Grade 4 mage and was the headmaster of a prestigious academy, but he was not someone who shouldve stopped there. He was a genius.\nIf only that incident never happened\nKeukeuh. Well, in the past, even I found you ridiculously full of yourself. The Myrhe familys light. For a genius who might only appear once every blue moon to be acting as an old headmaster of an academy How funny.\nWith age, one learns to embrace and accept pain, so Alpheas gave no heed to Klumph despite his harsh words.\nChuckle\n! On the other hand, you received the help of god. Who wouldve thought that a once talentless idiot would become a 3rd-class swordsman? Im quite worried for the future of this kingdom.\nThe two broke out cackling.\nTalent and effort It was fair to say that Klumph won in terms of those elements. Alpheas admired him and was simply proud to have Klumph as a friend.\nIve thought about this more and more as Ive gotten older, but I believe genius is just a man-made delusion. Geniuses are only people who just enjoy something a bit more than most people do Can that boy comfort me?\nThats something only you would know the answer to, my friend.\nAlpheas walked to the window with a smile.\nSo in the end, does it all come back?\nThe talent blocked by a barrier called status had once again appeared in front of Alpheas after four years.\nHe believed there was no such thing as fate. The future was something that could change and was not pre-determined.\nBut Alpheas felt a sudden thrill course through his body.\nPerhaps Fate was real?\nI will accept Shirone into the academy.\n* * *\nSpring arrived.\nWith flowers in full bloom around Vincents cabin, Shirone patiently awaited for the entrance ceremony.\nShirones admission to the magic academy was a family celebration, so Vincent did not tell anyone about it.\nThe reason was because he did not want to trouble Shirone in case rumors of it started cropping up.\nAnd Shirone was grateful for it.\nThe reason why they rejected the Ogent familys offer to get a house in the city was because Shirones parents did not want to bother their son.\nThe happy times flew by. It was finally time for Shirone to go.\nAs the deputy butler, Temuran, stood next to the carriage. Shirone said his affectionate farewells to his parents.\nFather, Ill get going. Ill write to you often.\nYes, my son! Do your best! Here, give me a kiss!\nEuk!\nShirone scrunched up his face. No matter how young he may look, he was now 17-years-old, so to ask for a kiss from him was a difficult request.\nKissing now is a bit\nVincent interjected.\nIf youre not going to do it, Ill do it.\nEeuuk.\nAs a pair of meaty lips approached, Shirones neck withdrew like a turtle as he raised his head.\nVincent kissed Shirones forehead and pulled him in for a hug.\nIm proud of you, Shirone.\nFather.\nShirone reciprocated his fathers firm hug.\nWith the strong support of his parents, his fear of the aristocratic academy went away a little.\nI will return.\nLeaving his house with his usual greeting, Temuran approached and bowed his head.\nPlease, climb on. I will take you to the academy.\nYes, thank you.\nBoth men were silent during the ride.\nSince their positions had completely changed in the span of just two years, both were quite uncomfortable. But Shirone did not forget the fact that Temuran had sided with him, despite Louis opposition.\nUpon arriving at the main gate of the magic academy, Temuran turned more courteous as he dropped Shirone off. Since it was a place where nobles attended, he had to make sure he acted properly.\nAlong with the admission fee, the payment for the school materials has already been settled. Dont worry about the financial part, young master! Just study hard!\nShirone politely said.\nDeputy butler, thank you.\nI am just doing what I have to do.\nI dont think Ive properly thanked you. Thanks to your support, I get to go to this academy. I will never forget this favor.\nNo matter how high a commoner might fly, they are still commoners. They can never go beyond the nobles.\nShirone raised his head. Temuran had a stern look on his face.\nBut this opportunity is not something that just appears. When you enter the academy, many nobles will not like you. Even so, please bear it. Endure it, for it will eventually come to an end.\nIt was advice from an orphan who became a deputy butler. It was very Temuran-like.\nThank you. Ill definitely become a mage.\nTemuran smiled. This was the first time Shirone had ever seen Temuran smile.\nFollow me if you are ready. Young master was registered as a guest of the Ogent family and accepted through special admission. Let me introduce for you.\nGuards stood in front of the academys main gate.\nHe did not know if they were the same ones who drove Shirone out, but even if a person were to change, the philosophy and belief in their place would still remain constant.\nWhat is the matter?\nHe is Shirone, he was recently admitted to the magic academy. Here is the proof of admission and the identification notarized by the Ogent family.\nThe guards who saw the proof of admission did not dare to check the identification. This was because ordinary people were not allowed to cross the gates.\nIts an honor to serve you. Im Marco, the guard of the main gate. I look forward to working with you.\nConsidering how he was treated just 5 years ago, Shirone felt strange due to the treatment, but he was no longer a small child.\nYes. I look forward to working with you as well.\nTemuran turned to Shirone.\nThen, Ill get going. Please, feel free to contact me anytime if you need anything.\nAfter receiving the documents from Shirone, he took his first step as a student of the magic academy.\nAttention!\nThe moment he crossed the gates of the magic academy, he was greeted with salutes. This made Shirones heart thump loudly.\nAlpheas Magic Academy!\nWhat could he learn here? And what kind of people would he meet in a place called the birthplace of geniuses?\nThe numerous buildings that were scraping the sky seemed to welcome Shirone.\n* * *\n* * *\nThe academy was using a whole mountain over a site area of 75.425 square kilometers.\nWhen including dormitories, there were a total of 22 buildings. And there were more than 40 training grounds.\nDespite the fact there were only 32 teachers, The total number of students attending was 420. And while this may seem low, in reality, this amount was equal to the best academy in the kingdom.\nEntering a building where the reception desk was located, Shirone saw students with glowing, radiant faces walking around.\nAfter submitting his documents, while waiting, Shirone looked at the curriculum pinned against a wall.\nThey sure are systematic!\nThe Alpheas Magic Academy was run using a system called the Class Ten, where classes 10 to 8 were Beginner classes, 7 to 4 were Intermediate, and 3 to 1 were the Graduate/Advanced classes.\nThe Advanced classes used relative evaluation, and only 10 out of the maximum 30 students could graduate.\nOnly 10 students?\nConsidering that the graduation test was held once a year, that meant 20 prodigies failed every year.\nYou must be Shirone.\nWhen he turned his head, he saw Alpheas, who looked no different compared to five years ago, walking towards him.\nShirone bowed politely, recalling that this place was a magic academy.\nHello. My name is Shirone.\nI think weve met before. Do you remember me?\nThere was no way Shirone could forget the incident that pushed him to dream of becoming a mage.\nYes, I do. Thank you. I am truly grateful.\nWell, well get to those talks eventually. But for now, come. You have to go take the entrance test.\nHm? A test?\nShirone was taken aback.\nHe hadnt learned anything yet, so how was he supposed to take a test?\nTheres nothing to worry about. Its just to evaluate which class to put you in. Can you enter the Spirit Zone?\nYes, I can.\nOho?\nIt was definitely unusual to enter the Spirit Zone alone.\nHowever, Shirone did it outside of school and without proper guidance, so Alpheas could not extinguish all his worries.\nThe reason why Alpheas proceeded with Shirones application last was because of his age difference compared to the other students.\nDue to the nature of this academy, most of the enrolled kids were under the age of 10, if not 14 at most.\nShirone, on the other hand, was 17 years old, so Alpheas adjusted the time to save him face.\nI should probably teach him from the beginning. The fault lies with my poor judgement. If only he had started a little earlier\nAlpheas personally guided Shirone.\nDespite the fact they had arrived early, other students were also taking the test, so he made a turn and headed to a building where the classrooms were located.\nShirone's jaw dropped to the ground. It was as if he were exposed to a completely new world as\nEveryone was casting magic.\nEven though it was the beginner class, the flashy magic could make a viewer's eyes roll.\nA girl floating about four stories high was having a heated discussion with her friends through a window, while another child was reading three books at the same time with all of them open in the air.\nAlpheas watched Shirones reaction through the corners of his eyes and smiled mischievously Because from now on, the real show would begin.\nAs they entered Class 7, Shirone saw students having a heated discussion. And although they were not casting magic like the kids from before, their eyes were burning with passion. They were so immersed in their conversation that they didnt notice people passing by.\nConvection energy to bring the atmosphere below freezing point? Isnt it more effective to condense the refrigerant?\nBut that has the disadvantage of being able to reverse the reaction. How about this? Instead of flipping the directivity of the energy, if we were to rotate the time base\nShirone, who was paying attention to the students conversation, was suddenly scared.\nHe knew what topic they were discussing, but he could not understand the details at all.\nA loud noise was heard at the end of the hallway, and as a door was ripped open, a girl came out with her ears covered.\nThe students turned around in surprise, but soon turned their attention back to the matters at hand and went back to focusing on their work.\nJudging from their reaction, it seems like this kind of occurrence happens rather often here.\nA female student, the culprit of the disturbance, ran to Alpheas with her hands now away from her ears.\nHeadmaster! Hello!\nHoho, yes. It seems like there is a problem.\nIts the sound amplification experiment. There must have been an error on the output circuit. I think I need to redesign it.\nIts important to balance the input and output. The key is to keep the electric power at equilibrium.\nOkay, Ill try again.\nThe girl put on her glasses and went back into the laboratory.\nAs Shirone passed by, he looked inside and saw children of his age having a discussion over a strange magic circle.\nI feel like Im in a different world!\nShirone realized how small the well he was trapped in was.\nEveryone here had special talents like him.\nNow standing in front of the bulletin, the grades of 270 students were listed down.\nIn the Intermediate class, there were 42 students listed under Class Four, the highest level in the Intermediate section. And the one in first place was Amy Karmis.\nOh? The Karmis family!\nDue to his experience working for the Ogent family, Shirone memorized the names of famous noble families.\nKarmis was the 1st-class nobility who lived in the city of Creas.\nCool!\nAll the information overwhelmed him, but instead of being scared, his heart thumped wildly.\nThere were literally infinite competitions.\nHe wanted to compete. He wanted to challenge himself. He wanted to see how far he could reach.\nYo! Amy! Wait for me!\nShirone turned his head.\nThat person definitely said Amy. And now that he had the chance to see the person in first place in the Class Four Intermediate class, he turned to look, only to catch sight of a pretty girl with red hair and a book in her arms.\nAh?\nAt that moment, an unknown tension squeezed his heart.\nTrauma. Emotions crashed over him before the memories had the chance to, and after a while, he remembered who she was.\nIt was the girl he met five years ago in the back alley.",

      "content": "Chapter 19\nH-How could\nShirone, frozen in shock, turned his head away as Amy walked towards him with her friend.\nPlease, just pass by! Just go!\nShirone hoped earnestly that theyd just ignore him for, in his eyes, nothing good could come out of them meeting. Thankfully, the two girls gave him no attention and were about to walk past Or so he thought. Due to being in the moment, Shirone had totally forgotten that he was pretty attractive. And due to this, he did not notice that he had already caught the attention of one of the girls.\nAmy, Amy! Did you see the boy we just passed by? Is he new? He seems a bit too old to be a new student Maybe hes a transfer student? Oh my god, hes totally my style.\nAmy couldnt answer back even though she was listening to her chatty friend. It was because, like Shirone, she felt something weird.\nStrange He looks familiar. Where have I seen him before?\nWait, are you interested in him? You, who never bothered to look at a guy before?\nNo. I really have seen him somewhere before.\nEnough with the lies. Be honest, you have a crush on him, right? Right???\nSeriously, Im telling you, its not that.\nAmy sped up her pace to escape the persistent rambling. And when her friend started to catch up to her, she started running.\nHurry up and spill it! I wont drop this until you tell me the truth!\nNo! I said its nothing like that!\nBoys who saw Amy running away from her friend watched in envy.\nAlthough she was the most popular girl in school, she rejected the love calls of every junior and senior to confess to her.\nThe only one who knew she was once a vicious girl who dominated the back alley was Shirone.\n* * *\nThe Magic Academys 3rd Test Site.\nThe spacious hall had a mirror-like smooth floor.\nLetters were engraved on the floor, but it was too difficult to understand.\nFive teachers were seated side by side behind a table on the north side of the hall.\nUpon his arrival, Shirone saw six students taking the test, and all of them were young kids.\nI see its still not over yet. Thats good. Watch carefully what those children do.\nConsidering he looked a bit old for a newly enrolled student, he paid no mind to the stares he received.\nAlpheas explained the letters on the floor.\nIf you enter the Spirit Zone, these letters will look and feel different. And depending what you feel through them, we will analyze the size, strength, flexibility, and propensity of your Spirit Zone. You just have to answer the instructors honestly.\nShirone, who got the gist of it, watched the test from a distance.\nOkay, Camie. Can you use magic?\nI can levitate objects into the air.\nThe examiners did not check each individual claim to see if they were true. It was because they knew that if the students were to uselessly bluff their way through the academy where they came to learn, they would ultimately be the ones at the losing end.\nI see. Then shall we go right to the Spirit Zone?\nYes.\nWhen the child named Camie entered the Spirit Zone, a young instructor sitting at the far right asked. With slicked-back blond hair, he was a handsome man who made a sharp impression.\nWhat is the farthest number you can see?\nSix.\nOh? A six\nThe man wrote down the number on a paper approvingly.\nIt meant that his Spirit Zone reached a sphere of six meters in diameter.\nTo have that degree of skill as a newly enrolled student, he was on the level to join Class 9 at minimum.\nThe next question was asked by an elderly instructor sitting next to him.\nWith a buzz cut and a forehead full of fine wrinkles, he habitually raised his eyebrows which made him look like an owl.\nWhat is the most clear color you can feel?\nMmm I feel like Ive entered a red world.\nRed. A divergent type. That explains why your Spirit Zone is large for your age.\nThe instructors nodded in agreement.\nThe third and fourth instructors also asked questions they were specially in charge of.\nOne instructor asked whether the large tower stood on the left or the right. This was done in order to find out which side of the brain they typically used. Another instructor then asked how many balls were shaking. This was to check the density of the students Spirit Zone.\nWhat is the temperature you feel right now? Is it on the cold side or the warm side?\nThe last instructor to ask was a young woman.\nHer eyebrows were thin with sharp eyes that gave her a cold appearance. But she was certainly beautiful nonetheless.\nI think its a little hot. Its to the point Im sweating.\nIf one was to feel hot, it meant that their Spirit Zone was variable. If someones application skills increase, their durability would decrease, so having a high application level was not necessarily good or bad.\nOkay, good job, Camie.\nThe remaining students were also tested one after the other.\nTeachers were satisfied that the average standard was quite high this year, and even Alpheas was impressed when a child announced the number 12.\nIt was finally Shirones turn.\nAlpheas gently placed his hand on Shirones back and pushed, taking him to the instructors.\n* * *\n* * *\nNow, dont feel pressured and show off your skills.\nYes, Ill try.\nShirone was not pressured. Since he started out at zero anyways, he wanted to start his study from the basics in order to ensure the best learning experience.\nThe examiners observed Shirone carefully.\nHe was the special admission student whom Alpheas had already notified them about.\nIn his resume, there was a unique status that said he was a guest of the Ogent family, and under the special notes, it stated that he had a high possibility of development.\nTime to time, there were kids like Shirone. Children who only realized their talents later on.\nHowever this magic academy was called the birthplace of geniuses.\nNo matter how much of a genius they were outside of the academy, there were many who realized that they were below average when compared to the real geniuses in the academy.\nPerhaps that was why the instructors did not have big expectation.\nThe blond man sitting on the right asked a question with an unenthusiastic voice.\nFire mage Thadd. He was known to only sweeten his voice in the presence of women.\nShirone Arian. You are 17 years old, correct? Can you use magic?\nNo. I havent learned any magic yet.\nI see. Well A person should be able to do a few things, even without formal teaching.\nThere was a hint of sarcasm in Thadds tone, but he wasn't totally wrong.\nThe Spirit Zone was what allowed knowledge in ones brain to be released into reality.\nOn the other hand, it was something impossible for Shirone to cast any magic since he had no opportunity to receive formal teaching.\nThats why he put aside all other things and was so hung on obtaining a Core of Knowledge. Hence why he knew nothing in terms of how to apply and cast magic.\nOkay, lets take a look first. Stand in the circle over there and activate your Spirit Zone. Ah, you can do it, yes?\nIf he was a special admission student who couldnt even do that, they would have questioned the morality of the headmaster.\nThankfully, that did not happen because Shirone nodded while heading over to the circle.\nThen Ill try.\nWhen Shirone closed his eyes and focused his mind, his synesthesia unfolded.\nWow!\nOnce he entered the Spirit Zone, Shirone was overwhelmed by the countless pieces of information.\nMost of the knowledge from reality was blocked, and he felt as if he had fallen into a whole new dimension.\nThis was what it was like.\nWhen he felt the world through synesthesia, the letters engraved on the floor appeared three-dimensionally.\nThadd asked.\nWhat is the farthest number you can see?\nAmongst the countless numbers orbiting around, Shirone took note of the farthest one.\nHis eyesight was not important because, through synesthesia, he saw things without needing to see them with his eyes.\n......\nHowever Shirone could not answer.\nShirone, what is the farthest number you can see?\nEven as Thadd kept urging him, Shirone made no move to open his mouth. That led the instructors to think that Shirone was embarrassed over whatever number he saw.\nIt was natural to be intimidated after watching kids younger than him show off their talents.\nAlpheas spoke softly.\nShirone, you can be honest. We are not trying to rank or judge you. Were only trying to figure out the right education level for you.\nShirone spoke with a small, doubtful voice.\nUm I do see a number, but its impossible to read it because its so long.\nThadd asked again.\nYou cant read it? Are you saying you cant see it?\nNo. I do see it, but its too long. And even at this very moment its still getting longer.\nThadd was getting annoyed.\nThe magic characters that calculated the size of the Spirit Zone could only output integers. He thought that Shirone was stalling because he was ashamed of his lack of skill.\nThen just tell me the first few numbers in front of you.\nMmm, 3.14.\nEh?\nThe eyes of all the instructors popped wide open.\nThe number Shirone was seeing was the circumference/pi. Since it was an irrational number that was not divisible by an integer, it went on indefinitely.\nThe woman sitting on the far left shot back, raising her glasses.\nShirone, Im sorry, but there is no such thing as 3.14 in the numbers we designated. Are you sure?\nSiena specialized in freezing magic, and like her magic, she had a cold temperament which did not go along with Thadds. Due to this, they were always at each others throat.\nShirone frowned, bothered.\nMm, is that so? But thats what Im seeing.\nIts true\nSiena had lied.\nOf course, it was true that pi was not engraved along with the other magic characters But there was one Just one situation in which pi could appear.\nIt was when the area of the spirit zone exceeded the range that could be measured.\nThis meant that the Spirit Zone, which Shirone extended, had a diameter of at least 30 meters.\nThe accuracy and precision measurement for the 3rd Test Site, which evaluated freshmen, was set to be quite low.\nThis was because if the instructors were to push the young children, who had yet to mature, too hard by starting off too extreme or intense, the experience could traumatize them for life.\nDue to that reason, the diameter range of the Spirit Zone was also limited to 30 meters.\nHowever, no matter how late they entered the academy, there were a few who did exceed this limit. Though it was so minimal that one could count with only the fingers of one hand.\nIf a persons Spirit Zone were to exceed over 30 meters in diameter, that person would typically be assigned under Class 5 at minimum. And if comparing the level of Spirit Zone alone, it could go neck to neck with an uncertified Grade 10 mages Spirit Zone.\nThe old man sitting next to Thadd asked the next question.\nThen what color do you feel most clearly?\nBlue. Everything is shaded blue.\nThe old mans lips stuck out, and a commotion began among the instructors.\nIf hes blue, that means hes a convergent type A type that has an advantage in the durability of the zone rather than the size of the zone.\nOver 30 meters in diameter And he only sees blue His development must have been amazing.\nAlpheas, too, was surprised. He finally understood why Klumph had been boasting nonstop about Shirone.\nHowever, as a headmaster who had encountered numerous, varying students, he became rather critical.\nIf Shirone just had an adequate amount of talent, then there would have been space for his compliments But Shirone went beyond that level.\nAnd above all, since Shirone had yet to step foot into the world of magic, he definitely hadnt yet tapped into even half of his full potential and talent.\nThis is a bit dangerous.\nToo much praise could ruin a talent.\nWith Alpheas too engrossed in his thoughts to say anything, Shirone continued to diligently answer the questions.\nThe development of his brain is bi-hemespheric\nThis meant that Shirone used both sides of his brain at the same time.\nThis was also unique, but the real surprise had yet to come.\nHow many balls are floating around?\nSince synesthesia was applied, he could sense the number of balls all at once. He did not have to count each ball one by one.\nAfter a while, Shirone opened his mouth.\n867.\n867\nThe instructor who had asked the question lost all emotion and went blank. And Siena, who had been watching with a collected attitude, had to pull in her chair for the first time to fix her usually flawless posture.\nThe ball-counting segment measured the density of ones Spirit Zone. This was done in order to measure how evenly spread the casters mental strength was.\nBeing able to sense 867 balls meant that Shirones mental strength covered 86.7% of his Spirit Zone.\nA kid who only recently turned 17?\nHaving such an evenly spread mental strength meant that his mind was extremely stable, so his probability of succeeding in the field of magic was high.\nPR/N: Density = How well spread ones mental strength is.",

      "content": "Chapter 20\nHow cool is it right now, Shirone?\nSiena asked, already assuming that Shirone would be on the cold side.\nAnd she was right.\nIts quite chilly. Almost to the point Id call it cold.\nConsidering the test site, Shirone would not have been able to feel anything beyond the chills he was already feeling.\nSiena, who nodded as if she understood, began to write down her overall evaluation on the document.\nHere was the gist of it.\nConvergent type, defensive, and excellent durability. Even the size of his Spirit Zone is abnormally large.\nSiena wondered if this kind of situation was actually realistic.\nAlthough she had been teaching for over four years, it was rare to see a Spirit Zone go beyond 30 meters.\nHowever, this was the inevitable result of Shirones choice and concentration.\nLike how he dug through the history books to overcome his shallow disadvantages in terms of knowledge, the only thing Shirone could do in an environment where he could not learn magic was to polish his Spirit Zone as much as he possibly could. And his efforts did not betray him.\nWell done. You can leave your Spirit Zone now. We need to have a meeting to decide which class to enroll you in, so could you wait outside for a while?\nYes. Thank you.\nHe bowed his head and went outside to where the children were gathered.\nWhen the door to the test site closed, the instructors who had been quiet began to speak.\nHe is a very peculiar student.\nThadd said with a face as if he did not find Shirone to his liking.\nNot peculiar, but just balanced, dont you think?\nSiena countered.\nIm saying hes peculiar because everything is so well balanced. A 17-year-old boy who doesnt know a thing about magic has a Spirit Zone that exceeds 30 meters in diameter. And not to mention he is a convergent type.\nThe bigger the Spirit Zone, the lighter the density At least thats what usually happens But his density is 86.7%.\nThough we do teach students how to increase the density through techniques, this child has shown a level of mental strength not commonly seen at all. He has the same level of mental stability as a high priest training in the mountains.\nWhile most of the teachers were busy praising him, Thadd, who expressed critical opinions, was annoyed.\nWell, let's not forget the fact that hes only a student. We still have to wait and see.\nSiena asked back coldly.\nWhat do you mean by student? This is an academy where children come to learn. What else would he be if not a student?\nThadds face turned red.\nIf Siena were any less pretty, he wouldnt have put up with her insult.\nWhile the two clashed with their eyes, the other teachers withheld from vocalizing their opinions.\nThadd of the Flames and Siena of the Ice. They were famous for always being at each others throats in the academy.\nAlpheas intervened.\nSo where should we place him? Shirone, I mean.\nSiena immediately spoke out.\nWouldnt Class 5 be appropriate? He has a high possibility of development along with a unique propensity, so I think he should be supervised intensively.\nThadd immediately refuted.\nBut he doesnt know any magic. Doing that would only make him haughty and encourage him to cause trouble.\nThough some students may possess similar characteristics like the ones you have, not all are like you, Mr. Thadd.\nSiena! Theres a limit to how much I can put up with! Let's be honest here. Frankly speaking, since youre the one in charge of Class 5, you obviously want to be the one to supervise him.\nSo what? Whats the problem with that, huh? A teacher wants to guide and teach a student. Is that a problem?\nIm just saying, youre being too greedy. He doesnt know magic, and to add to that, hes at a level where he cant modify his Spirit Zone. The highest class we should place him in has to be Class 7, no more than that. Its the most appropriate.\nAlpheas also asked the other instructors.\nSome said that itd be better to slowly raise him from Class 10, step by step. Others even suggested that placing him in a specific class should be put on hold for the time being.\nThe teacher who resembled an owl came up with a proposal.\nI think Class 7 is perfect. We have to consider his age as well. Since he is a bit older than the average new students, sending him to the Beginners Class would make the kids lose motivation. Wouldnt Class 7 be okay because it also teaches basic lessons regarding the Spirit Zone? If Shirone really displays great talent, we can give him an early advancement.\nAlpheas felt that he had a point.\nIn order to perfect Shirones half-developed talent, it was rather necessary to strengthen the basics first.\nThen Ill assign him there.\nThe entrance test was over.\n* * *\nClass 7 was definitely a high-end class, so Shirone was able to get into a dormitory with kids his age.\nSurprisingly, it was a single, private room.\nSince this was an academy that nobles attended, the subsidy was beyond imagination, so convenience was a must.\nSince the Ogent family became part of the sponsors, Shirone did not have to walk on eggshells.\nHis room was 707 in the mens dormitory.\nWhile nobles would have not been satisfied with it, considering the room was the size of the living room in his home in the mountains, and considering the bed and desks were all luxurious, he did not have any complaints.\nThere was also a bookcase nailed against the wall, though it was empty.\nDo the students here have free time?\nWhen Shirone asked the person who guided him to his room, the person said that he was free to do whatever he wanted as long as classes were finished for the day.\nHowever, except for the weekends, going out was prohibited. But this was not really an issue as most convenience facilities were built inside the school as its land was so large.\nThe students could even create their own research groups for subjects they were interested in. And if there were more than a certain number of members, funds would even be provided.\nThere were a total of four libraries around the school that operated 24/7, and there were no specific restrictions on how many books one could borrow as long as the deadline was met.\nShirone was satisfied with everything.\nIt was the best environment to study in.\nLastly, the staff had told him about unauthorized magic.\nExcept in laboratories, magic after school was prohibited, especially to those who study unorthodox magic. They were punished regardless of any reason if caught practicing it without supervision.\nA representative example of unorthodox magic was the Necromancers Soul Pact Magic. Anti-Magic was also categorized as one.\nShirone asked why Anti-Magic was prohibited, but the staff only said they didnt know and left.\nWell, then\nShirone plopped on his bed and decided to plan ahead.\nHe thought he didnt need to join a research group yet. There was also the problem with him being a commoner, but in addition to that, Shirone himself was unsure as to what area suited him.\nI should start visiting the library. Since I studied only history for two years, I have to now acquire a wide range of knowledge.\nShirone was confident. He built his Core of Knowledge by suppressing his curiosity for months.\nFrom now on, all he had to do was acquire knowledge like crazy.\nShirone woke up due hearing the beautiful melody of a piano.\nIts already morning.\nThe sound was transmitted through a magic called Ethereal Resonance, a form of magic typically studied by students who majored in music.\nHowever, even this masterpiece did not compare to the moment when he played with Reina.\nSuddenly, the people from the Ogent family came to mind.\n* * *\n* * *\nAre they doing well? Is Rian entering his first class with a nervous heart like me?\nAfter those thoughts and after cleaning himself up, Shirone headed to the cafeteria to eat breakfast.\nIn the dormitory where men and women living quarters were separated, the cafeteria was one of the only places where they could sit together.\nShirone sat in a corner.\nAlthough conversing with people and making friends was an option, Shirone enjoyed eating in peace.\nBecause of this tendency, he was once teased by the children of the mountaineers for being timid.\nHowever, there were many students who were similar to Shirone, and no one cared if someone ate their food with a fork or with their hands.\nBut, the issues between men and women were another thing. Shirones appearance attracted the attention of female students, and soon, he could hear whispers around him.\nEven if he tried not to notice, it was impossible to completely block the whispers out, so Shirone finished his meal quickly and returned to his room.\nWhilst walking to his class, due to the weight of the textbooks on his back, his shoulders began to hurt.\nHe lugged around many textbooks because there were a lot of subjects to study. And Class 7, which was the beginning of the Intermediate Classes, was where magic began to be taught.\nThe lessons were naturally difficult.\nCompared to the nobles who had the resources to study before entering the academy, Shirones knowledge was limited.\nHowever, Shirone was able to keep up because of his shallow, yet vast, Core of Knowledge.\nMy judgment was right!\nCategorizing different types of subjects using the framework he had built over 2 years really helped Shirone focus in class.\nLunchtime passed. During the afternoon, there was a combined lesson for Spirit Zone training.\nFrom Class 7 to Class 4, 280 Intermediate students sat side by side. The training ground quickly became noisy as everyone was busy introducing themselves.\nI was able to take the test thanks to your help!\nHere! I saved you a seat!\nAt first, Shirone simply friends were chatting with friends, but after hearing some conversations, he noticed many of the conversations were between upper and lowerclassmen.\nIt was also common to see people who looked older greet a younger-looking student politely.\nEven though we are all in the same Intermediate Class, things are kept strict!\nWhether certified or uncertified, a mages rank determined their position or job. The same could be said here. The strict barriers between upperclassmen and lowerclassmen were also proportional to their level.\nOf course, there may be embarrassing situations where yesterday's lowerclassmen may become todays upperclassmen, but it was natural for students who were more experienced to condescend those lower than them.\nDoes that mean theres almost no turnaround?\nShirone felt indirectly how difficult it was to jump up a class.\nThe instructor of the Spirit Zone was a certified Grade 6 mage named Ethella Romie.\nShe was probably around her mid-20s at the most.\nSimply tied back Brown hair, large glasses, and a gentle appearance that did not fit the image of an instructor.\nAlright, everyone. A new student has joined the Intermediate Class today. Shirone, stand up and introduce yourself.\nAll eyes turned to look at Shirone. Of course, among those eyes were Amys.\nOh, Amy! Isnt that the boy we saw yesterday?\nUnintentionally ignoring her friend, Sharelle, who was making a fuss, Amy got lost in thought.\nDespite his strong impression, enough to make him look familiar, it was her first time hearing the name Shirone.\nA Class 5 student stepped in.\nDid you know? Hes the new kid who was assigned to Class 7 right away. According to my sources, the teachers are pretty interested in him.\nInteresting. From which family is he? Do you know his family name?\nAt that moment, Amy shouted.\nDamn it!\nIt was her first time saying such harsh words, so Sharelle asked with a surprised look.\nAmy, whats wrong?\nAh No, its nothing.\nIt was not nothing.\nIn retrospect, he was actually the one who put an end to her dark history. And whenever she thought back to it, she felt stupid.\nRight, he did have talent. But Im sure he was a commoner. How did he get into this academy?\nShirone introduced himself.\nHello, my name is Shirone Arian. Starting today, I will be taking Class 7 with you all. Please take good care of me.\nThe students welcomed him with applause.\nWhile the upperclassmen were happy that one more student was included in their list of lowerclassmen, the female students were happy for the new addition of one more good-looking male.\nHowever, among the students, there were some who looked displeased. It was hostility toward a future competitor.\nIgnoring everyones thoughts regarding the newcomer, Ethella began her class.\nAlright class, lets begin. What is the Spirit Zone?\nThe mind of a mage.\nYes. The Spirit Zone is the embodiment of the mind. The very first form is a sphere. But in practice, the shape of a sphere might sometimes be inefficient.\nEthella entered a magic device called Image Zone.\nA magic circle with concentric circles was drawn on the smooth floor. It looked similar to the place where kids took the entrance test.\nSince the floor disappeared and a black space appeared, Ethella looked like she was floating.\nIn that state, when her Spirit Zone with a diameter of about 10 meters was opened, students could surprisingly see that the shape of the Spirit Zone was visible.\nThis is the Image Zone Ive only heard of!\nTo materialize your mind into reality.\nIt was a device that could not be made without the highest level of magic engineering And huge sums of money.\nHowever, since the students could now physically see the Spirit Zone, it made teaching lessons in regards to the Spirit Zone a lot easier, which also helped the students excel even more.\nThat was one of the reasons why Alpheas Magic Academy was part of the top 5 prestigious academies in the kingdom.",

      "content": "Chapter 21\nEthella walked around comfortably, as if she did not enter the Spirit Zone, and continued to explain.\nThis is the basic form of the Spirit Zone. It takes up all the space equally. However, in an actual fight, more often than not, you will not have the opportunity to use the entire space. Let me give you an example.\nWhen Ethella flicked her finger, a target appeared 20 meters away.\nWith a diameter of only 10 meters, you won't be able to affect the target with magic. As such, you would have no choice but to either move towards them or increase the size of your Spirit Zone. However, simply changing the size of your Spirit Zone isnt something you can do on a whim But by changing the shape, you can do something like this.\nEthellas Zone lengthened in the direction of the target. It had the same volume but was able to reach the target by changing its shape.\nThe shape of your mind dictates the shape of your Spirit Zone. And then\nEthella held out her hand and chanted.\nFire.\nFire burst out and burned the target 20 meters away. The eyes of the new students who were in their first-ever class popped open. Ethella, who had been taken lightly because of her gentle appearance, suddenly looked imposing.\nHowever, there is a fatal problem when using this method.\nDue to Ethellas words, the new students were embarrassed after hearing that the demonstration a while ago was actually an example of something bad.\nThe shape of the Zone can vary. However, having to change the shape every second in a battle is inefficient. So mages use a specific pattern to decrease its inefficiency. And they do it through the Spirit Zones four patterns, the Four Way Formation.\nShirones heart started pounding after hearing the concept for the first time.\nThe first form in the Four Way Formation is the Defense Form.\nEthellas Spirit Zone closed in and transformed into a cube with 20 triangular faces. Although it looked rough, it appeared similar to a sphere from a distance.\nPR/N: Imagine a sphere thats sort of squarish and has a low-polygon count, thats what it looks like.\nThe basis of the Defense Form is the cube. Its about building a mental framework using the frames. Oh, and the frames are the triangular faces, for those who dont know. The more frames the cube has, the more durable it becomes. It's also a shape that can protect a large number of allies. Next is the Attack Form.\nEthella changed the shape of her Spirit Zone. The spherical surface area seemed to decrease, while dozens of long needles extended in all directions.\nThe Attack Form has, what we call, a star shape. In return for decreasing the center area, it extends the number of Zones. It covers all directions, so you dont have to worry about the location of your target. Its the ideal form when dealing with multiple enemies. Next is the target form.\nEthellas Zone changed once again. Her Spirit Zone extended out into the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, and west. The final form was shaped like a cross.\nThe basis of the Target Form is the cross. It has the longest range among the basic forms of the Four Way Formation, and although its power is less than that of the Offensive Form, it can easily detect and seize the target.\nAs she flicked her finger, the targets began to encircle Ethella and in response, she followed the targets with sharp eyes.\n45 degrees to the side. Fire.\nThe cross started spinning, and every time the cross caught a target, fire shot out. Magic was cast simultaneously, front to rear, left to right. And no mistakes were made. It was as if she also had eyes located at the back of her head.\nWhat you need to master for the Target Form is the speed of your Spirit Zone rotation. While, when done to an extreme, the Straight Form will have the greatest range. But this adjustment is only really used when attacking from a distance and if the target is straight ahead. Since a mage is usually stationed at the very end of a straight line, it is extremely difficult to change the direction of the Spirit Zone.\nEthella stopped talking for a second and took the time to wipe her glasses.\nLastly, the Deviate Form is about shifting the center of the Zone. In other words, it would be like moving your brain.\nShirone did not understand. The center of the Zone indicates the mages head, so how could someone just move it?\nEthella returned to the basic form.\nAfter a while, her Spirit Zone began to move while maintaining its shape as a sphere.\nTen seconds later, her Spirit Zone completely detached from Ethellas body.\nShirone was amazed. If a Zone was a mages mind, what was in the center of that Zone?\nThis is the Deviate Form. Its a special one among the four forms. This is because the further away it goes, the smaller the zone becomes. And learning it is quite difficult. It is to the point that there are mages that specialize in only that form. That is how hard it is to handle the Deviate Form. However, there is one thing to keep in mind It is the fastest among the four forms. Its activation speed is instant.\nFor a finale, Ethella showed her students the Four Way Formation in sequence, one after the other. From a hardened cube, to a jagged star, then a stretched cross, and finally, when it returned to a sphere, the Zone broke off from her body and rapidly whirled around her.\nWhoaaaaa\nClass 7 students finally realized. The Four Way Formation was not something easily achieved within a year or two. The teacher in front of them was a certified Grade 6 mage, not a brainless, innocent-looking child.\nFrom now on, you guys will be practicing the Four Way Formation. Youll be practicing the four forms in repetition. Now, lets spread out by class and practice.\nThe students were taught different lessons according to their class. Shirone took Ethellas class along with Class 7 students.\nFirst of all, let's learn more about the Defense Form. Depending on the mages propensity, they will have an easier time with certain forms. But its good to constantly polish and strengthen the Defensive Form. Because even in chaotic battlefields, you will be able to concentrate, and above all, you will gain the strength to resist Anti-Magic.\nShirone recalled the precautions he had heard yesterday, and since the staff did not answer, his question still remained.\n* * *\n* * *\nMs. Romie, I have a question. Um May I ask a question?\nHoho, feel free to ask. I hope asking if you can ask a question was not your question.\nUm, yes. Why is Anti-Magic a forbidden magic? I hear that a lot of mages are studying Anti-Magic legally.\nHmm, let's see. There are two types of Anti-Magic. Anti-Magic for mages and Anit-Magic on artifacts. Do you know this?\nYes, I do.\nAnti-Magic is the Spirit Zone imbued with special properties. Therefore, the effectiveness differs depending on the mind of the mage. That is whats different from artifact Anti-Magic.\nSo it can be dangerous if clumsily handled.\nThats exactly it. If you were to cast it without being familiar with it, it might lead to an accident. Mages who specialize in Anti-Magic train in only that for a lifetime. Though a lot of times, they reach a dead end. The academy does not recommend that path to all of you.\nShirone nodded. It was a magic that destroyed minds, so it was not a subject to study at an academy filled with kids.\nOkay! Back to the Four Way Formation.\nEach Class 7 student began practicing. The trick was to build a mental framework first and then connect it together.\nAfter practicing for a while, Shirone felt his Spirit Zone becoming solid, so he opened his eyes. He couldnt visually confirm as it wasnt an Image Zone, but he certainly seemed to have achieved something.\nIt was a remarkable achievement considering Shirone was a convergent type. This was the result of him focusing only on his Spirit Zone for 6 years.\nWow! Look at that!\nHis classmates pointed to an Image Zone and shouted.\nClass 4 students were taking turns, and now it was Amys turn And she put on an amazing show.\nAmy cast the Target Form. Her cross turned 90 degrees to the right and then 270 degrees to the left, twisting between angles incessantly and shooting flames.\nThe length of the Zone was about 20 meters, which was an acceptable level for a Target Form, but the rotational speed of the Zone was incredible.\nAlthough the targets were up from all directions, the number of flames shooting out from four directions was at the level of rapid firing.\nAfter destroying 120 targets in an instant, Amy removed her Zone. Beautiful looks with outstanding skills. Underclassmen looked up at her with twinkling eyes.\nShirone realized again after seeing the awe in the eyes of the Class 7 students Why was a girl from such an amazing family hanging out with thugs six years ago?\nAfter ruminating in his head, Shirone suddenly flinched. Amy, who just came out from the Image Zone, was staring right at Shirone. And naturally, other students followed her gaze and also turned to stare at Shirone.\nHuh? Do they know each other?\nNo? Wasnt he admitted just yesterday?\nDont tell me she fell for him Shes someone who doesnt even glimpse at anyone\nAfter hearing the whispers among the crowd, Amy hurriedly turned her gaze away. She felt like she was going crazy.\nAmy knew Shirone was the only one who knew about her immature past. After all, she had straightened herself out after she started learning magic.\nThis cant be Im graduating soon. If a rumor were to spread now, everything could go down the drain. What should I do?\nAlthough Amy went back to her place, none of the students moved to use the Image Zone. In both fame and reputation, she was No. 1 in the Intermediate Class, so no matter who volunteered to come forward, they would only be humiliated in front of the lowerclassmen.\nShirone thought right now was an opportunity and walked up to Ethella.\nMs. Romie, if you dont mind, can I go next?\nHm? You mean into the Image Zone?\nEthella tilted her head. What reason could there be for a student who had just started learning the Four Way Formation to use the Image Zone?\nWait a minute the upperclassmen have to go first. Thats the rule.\nEthella waited But nobody made a move to use it. So instead of letting such an expensive device go to waste, she thought itd be best to let someone give it a go, even if it was for just a simple experience.\nAlright. It wont hurt to try it out in advance. However, the targets wont be up. You might get hurt.\nOkay, I just thought itd be a good idea to have a look at my Defense Form.\nWhat?\nEthella asked, dumbfounded. But Shirone, who didnt catch it, was already walking away.\nAs the Image Zone went up, upperclassmen whistled and applauded However, they didnt do it to encourage him. Rather, they just wanted a good show. They werent expecting much. Without giving them his attention, Shirone walked to the center with no care.\nAmy, who was drinking water, looked towards the stage. And as soon as her eyes caught Shirone's figure, she spewed out the water in her mouth.\nPFFFFFFFFT!\nYou okay, Amy? Whats wrong?\nWhat the heck is he doing? Hes from Class 7, what can he do? He should know better than that.\nAt the sudden occurrence, class time turned into break time. However, Shirone was solely focused on what he was about to do.\nAs Shirone entered the Spirit Zone, his sphere began to swell rapidly. As soon as he saw it with his eyes, he stopped breathing. Overwhelmed by the image, Shirone unconsciously stopped expanding.\nThe noisy students were at a loss for words. The size of the Zone was 20 meters in diameter. Considering the average diameter for Class 7 students was 13 meters, it was safe to say that this was the appearance of a new prodigy.\nWow! Its huge!\nHumph. Can anything be labeled as magic if it just increases in size? Its nothing more than an air bubble.\nShirone was taken aback. Just before he entered the Image Zone, the frame he had built was fine, but now it was bending like a Korean taffy.\nHow come its not working?\nDid my mentality waver after seeing my own Spirit Zone? That cant be the reason\nShirone did not think he was that weak, so he was positive the problem laid within the basics.\nAHA! Thats it!\nIn his current state, The Four Way Formation would inevitably collapse. This was because this was his first time casting it, and due to that, he needed to concentrate way more and expend way more mental strength in order to cast the Four Way Formation.\nThere was a lack of materials to build the structure. At a diameter of only 20 meters, he would not be able to construct a frame as rigid as steel.\nI have to increase the size to the maximum.",

      "content": "Chapter 22\nShirone concentrated more. When he averted his attention from the Image Zone and only focused on delving into his Spirit Zone, the already large sphere expanded twice as much.\nThe jaws of the upperclassmen dropped. The numerical value shown on the scoresheet was 41 41 meters in diameter.\nConsidering that the average diameter of a Class 4 student was 27 meters, it was a number close to a student from an Advanced Class.\nWh-What? How the heck does he have such a big zone?\nEven Ethella was surprised.\nOf course, the diameter of a Spirit Zone could always be increased through training.\nHowever, not only did it require extreme physical discipline, but one also needed to have grown mentally.\nThe human body did not lie. So as long as one trained consistently, results would surely follow. Though, unlike training the physical body, the mind needed to battle against vague illusions where definite answers were not set.\nDespite dedicating their lives to pursuing a goal, there were countless mages around the world who fell short of achieving their desired results.\nIt was for this reason that magic was called the realm of talent.\nIve never seen such an exceptional zone from the start. He probably grew up contemplating the world and exploring his inner self But he just turned 18. Is this really possible?\nCompared to just a while ago, Shirone began to feel confident. As his Spirit Zone grew bigger, he finally felt the frames establishing themselves.\nNot noticing the crowd of students paying close attention to him with a look of surprise, Shirone busied himself connecting the framework.\nDont be fixated on it. Tighten it all at once.\nShirone clenched his teeth and opened his eyes wide. When he entered the Defense Form of the Four Way Formation, the large sphere began to tighten, as if trying to crush Shirone.\nThe force was so strong that the people who were watching heard an auditory hallucination of cracks and snaps.\nWoooaahhh\nA groan was heard from somewhere.\nShirone stared bewildered at the Four Way Formation he unfolded. He felt like he was trapped inside of a hard, diamond crystal.\nLike the cubed-shaped form Ethella had shown before, everything was perfectly interconnected. A diameter of 13 meters. Though the efficiency decreased by 30% as the size scaled down from 41 to 13 meters, a success was still a success.\nHe did it for real! That kid succeeded on his first day!\nMany upperclassmen frowned when the inadequate Class 7 students made a fuss.\nHowever, the number of people who expressed their interest stood on equal footing. Of course, most of them were girls.\nAmy did not affiliate with either side. But really, Shirone began to get on her nerves.\nHow could she have forgotten? Didnt he decide to learn magic because he was humiliated?\nThat guy Who the heck is he?\nThis was not an academy where one could just enter by having talent alone. She was positive that he had a benefactor. But the question was Who was it?\nMs. Romie, the volume shrunk much more than I thought it would.\nHm? Thats inevitable. But its durability would have improved a lot. With the way it is right now, being able to withstand physical impacts to a certain extent wouldnt be impossible.\nI heard he surprised the instructors during the entrance test. I guess the rumor is true.\nThough, success does not happen overnight.\nEthella admitted that he had great insight, but he was only able to succeed due to two factors. His unusually large Spirit Zone, and his convergent tendencies.\nRealizing the peoples reaction belatedly, Shirone returned to being a shy boy and went back to his spot in the corner.\nWas it because he was buried in other peoples stares? Because Shirone did not notice Amys fierce gaze.\n* * *\n* * *\nShirone was busy studying various subjects. Once one got to the Advanced Class, one could choose a major, but before then, one had to study all the subjects, so the range was enormous.\nHis first period was basic chemistry. When he entered the lecture hall of Class 7, he saw the students seated. And on the platform in front of the class, he saw a familiar face.\nSiena Olifer, Master of Ice Magic.\nShe was the second daughter of the Olifer family and a graduate of the Olifer School. She was a 26-years-old genius who became a certified Grade 6 mage with just ice magic alone. She had a pretty face and a cold attitude.\nThanks to that cold attitude of hers during the entrance test, she made a strong impression on Shirone.\nHowever, she was surprisingly popular with the male students. She had a beautiful appearance as well as a feisty personality. She was the ideal type for many of the students.\nWith her long, purple hair neatly tied up, she spoke while stroking her horn-rimmed glasses.\nHello everyone. Im Siena Olifer, and Ill be teaching this Class 7 chemistry class as of today.\nLoud applause exploded across the class. There were some who whistled and others who bluntly asked if she had a lover.\nSiena ignored them and opened her book. She then gently raised her eyes and looked somewhere.\nShirone flinched because he felt like she was looking straight at him.\nHe thought he was mistaken, but in fact, Shirones hunch was correct. The only reason why she, who was in charge of Class 5, took the time to purposely open another course was because of Shirone.\nTalents rot if they remain stagnant. Its best to advance him as soon as possible.\nReal talent was being able to follow and catch up despite being placed somewhere high. She intended to advance Shirone to discourage her rival, Thadd, and keep her stance strong as a teacher.\nWhatever the circumstances were, the students were just happy to be taught by the most popular teacher.\nMs. Olifer, is it true that youre dating instructor Thadd? Its not true, right?\nTell us about your first love. This is our first class.\nPlease, Ms. Olifer! Tell us!\nAs the students continued to be persistent, Siena frowned. Then suddenly, an ice crystal with a diameter of 30 centimeters materialized.\nCrack! Fizzle! Pop!\nThe ice began to spin and grind, and suddenly snow fluttered in all directions. The cold particles instantly lowered the temperature of the classroom.\nAt first, the students laughed it off saying.\nIts only a little chilly.\nBut their faces quickly hardened. The temperature dropped endlessly. It was to the point where the students couldnt even talk.\nMs. Olifer! I-Its cold\nLets start the class.\nSiena came down from her platform and approached the students. The temperature rose as the speed of the ices rotation gradually decreased. But it the temperature still remained negative.\nWhat is the principle of the ice magic I just performed?\nSiena spread her palm as an ice crystal formed and floated above it.\nCold. What exactly is cold?\nAs she clenched her fist following the question, the ice crystal shattered into pieces.\nTo be cold refers to a state of lacking energy. There is no such thing as cold energy. So while the thing we call temperature can go infinitely high, it cannot go infinitely low. The state of zero energy is called Absolute Zero.\nShirone frantically wrote down her words into his notebook.\nBy taking the energy from the atmosphere, you can create ice crystals. Of course, its ordinary ice. However, what would happen if you were to break it down into particles and blow it away using the power of the wind? Even ordinary ice can drop the temperature down to a level that can kill people Which is something you experienced a while ago.\nThe students faces paled after hearing the word kill.\nAlright, then how do we absorb that energy? No, let me rephrase that. How come mages can freely command and cast magic?\nSiena raised two of her fingers and first pointed at one.\nOmniscience. Omnipotence. Mages cast magic through those two things. The Spirit Zone aligns the mages mind with the world. Thus within the domain, the mage holds a divine position. And thats why I say omnipotence. But you cannot cast magic with that alone. The temperature in the Spirit Zone does not simply rise through a command. You need to know how to raise the temperature. You need knowledge. Hence, omniscience.\nShirone nodded his head. The reason why he had not been able to use magic thus far was because he had only trained for omnipotence.\nAll of you will be exposed to a variety of studies. The Spirit Zone encompasses only half the magic, and without omniscience, you cannot become a great mage. So now, let us start with the basic chemistry class.\nSiena then turned around and started writing on the blackboard. It was the start of the class, and the concentration of the students was at its highest.\nSure enough. She did not become the most popular teacher through simply being pretty.\nHaving trust in a teacher boosted a students desire for achievement, so Shirone lost track of time as he listened to her lecture.\nThere were words that were difficult to understand, but he didnt care.\nHis Core of Knowledge had been completed, and from today on, he was planning to eat up other studies in earnest.\n* * *\n5 P.M.\nAfter classes ended, students began to swarm out of the lecture hall. Shirone also headed to the dormitory because his head felt heavy.\nStudents who joined research groups were walking in pairs while carrying their lunch boxes. Shirone, who was not a part of a research group, was thinking of visiting the library after grabbing a bite to eat.\nHuh?\nSuddenly he felt light. When he came to his senses, he saw himself floating while also being quickly pulled somewhere.\nThe force pulling the back of his shirt was so strong that it was suffocating.\nAfter about 3 minutes, he arrived in a garden forest.\nAs he slowed down, Shione, who was floating, fell on his butt.\nThe shock traveled from his butt to the rest of his body.\nWhile coughing and catching his breath, he looked up at the person who brought him in a hurry.\nThe mysterious person, who covered their face with a black mask, looked around anxiously. After checking that there were no people, they took off their mask.\nWh-What?\nShirones eyes widened. The identity of the mysterious person was none other than Amy Karmis.\nAmy raised her hand as if realizing something from Shirones expression. As soon as she did so, fire magic erupted from her hand.\nI was right. You. You remember me, dont you?\nUh Huh?\nLeaving you alone will only bring me trouble. I will scorch your mouth and make you mute.\nShirone stared at the approaching flame without moving to avoid it. Unless one was a madman, one had to have a reason for committing a violent act. He did not find it probable for her to burn someones face at school.\nAs expected, her palm stopped right in front of Shirones face. The fire had already disappeared. She, who had planned to threaten Shirone through fear, asked with a frown.\nWho the heck are you? Are you really that coward?\nShe could not find a hint of the boy who had been caught by the back alley thugs with trembling legs and a pale face.\nYou remember me too, right? Upperclassman?\nAmy grabbed Shirone by the collar and pulled him up.\nWho are you calling your upperclassman, you bastard?! What the heck happened to you?! You are a commoner, not to mention a total country bumpkin! How the hell did you get in here?!\nShirone did not know why she was so agitated. If she were annoyed by the fact that a commoner entered an aristocratic academy, she would not have brought him to such a quiet place from the beginning.\nI do have my reasons, but before that, why did you drag me here?\nWhy?\nIt was actually an impulsive decision. At first, she was planning on ignoring him, but she couldnt. She was someone who found it uncomfortable for even a small secret of hers to be discovered. But Shirone did not have something small He knew a huge secret of hers. A secret big enough to end her school life.\nTell me honestly! How did you enter this academy?\nThe punch that was coming towards him fast did not seem to stop, so Shirone hurriedly confessed.\nAmy loosened her hold when she heard that he was attending as a guest with the support of the Ogent family.\nOho! As a guest of the Ogent family?",

      "content": "Chapter 23\nAmys head was spinning. She was sure he was lying.\nTheres no way a commoner could enter as a guest of a noble family.\nThat was the conclusion she had reached because she did not know about Rians knights oath.\nYou didnt tell anyone that you know me, did you?\nI didnt. Its not even a pleasant memory, anyways.\nHearing Shirone say that, she knew he was going to stay a huge ticking time bomb. The thought of going to the same academy with such a bomb did not sit well with her.\nAmy came up with an idea. She raised her head arrogantly and said.\nYou are from Class 7, right? Im from Class 4.\nI know.\nYou will be my underling from today onwards.\nWhat? An underling?\nI know your weakness. Youd probably get kicked out of the academy if I expose it. So be my underling from now on. You have to listen to everything I say.\nShirone made a confused face after hearing her threat.\nWhy should I? Whether you hold my weakness or not, youre still my upperclassman. So if you were to tell me to do something, shouldn't I obey?\nHow naive. Do you think Ill make it that easy? I'm gonna make sure to make you cry, so look forward to it.\nIn Amys head, even if she failed to get him kicked out, she could at least make sure Shirone followed her. If she locked him in sight and prodded at his self-esteem, she would be able to find out his hidden intentions.\nWhat are you going to make me do?\nAfter class, come running with bread and coffee, kay? If you spill even a drop, Ill make you go back to base one.\nAlthough Shirone was someone with a good personality, this time he was angry. Bread? Did she think he came to this academy just to deliver some bread?\nHohoho! Alright, starting from tomorrow, wait for me in front of the First Library. Ill end it quickly if you do whatever I tell you to do competently.\nShirone was so disconcerted. Was she really the Amy who was called the goddess of Alpheas?\nOh right. And\nTurning around, Amy looked back at Shirone. The air around her began to spin as her hand pierced up. At the same time, Shirones body rose into the sky.\nHeuk!\nTornado magic controlled atmospheric pressure to create wind. It was a spell that Shirone managed to barely cast as a child, but for the current Amy, casting it was childs play.\nShirone floundered in the air. Perhaps because he was facing a crisis, the ground looked much clearer. Even the fallen leaves scattered on the ground were vivid.\nEven that smirking face of Amy.\nIll die if I fall.\nAs soon as that thought passed his mind, Amy jumped up and grabbed the back of his collar. As his collar started to tighten around his neck, he could not breathe. When he came back to his senses, he was lying somewhere on the ground.\nCough! Cough!\nFollowing that magic, she demonstrated the power of Schema, and she dusted off her hand, seemingly satisfied. Amy stopped her Schema training after the age of 12, but nevertheless, her movement was beyond normal human ability.\nConsider that payback. See you tomorrow. Hohoho!\nAmy laughed cheerfully and walked away. Shirone was furious, he had never met such a hateful girl before.\nIn his mind, she was still the thug from many years ago. Shirone, who tried to diminish his anger, lowered his head and exited the forest. The thought of meeting her from tomorrow onward made him plunge into despair.\n* * *\nThe five oclock bell rang for the last period.\nThe basic physics class was over. Shirone, who packed his bag and left the classroom, sighed deeply. He had been running around as Amys bread shuttle for the past 10 days.\nHe bought bread and coffee from the school shop. It was a price that could not compare to the donations provided by the Ogent family, but the problem didnt lie within the money, but with his feelings. And that was what Amy was aiming for.\nWhy is she doing this to me? She was the first to make a mistake.\nTrying not to spill the coffee required a lot of concentration. Yeah, lets just think this is some kind of training. He tried to adjust his walk so that the coffee did not shake.\nAs if! How long do I have to endure this!\nShirone himself thought he was in a miserable state.\nOh my! There he goes, the pure and innocent boy.\nHe must be heading to her to confess again. Im telling you, he has some kind of illness.\nThe schoolgirls whispered amongst each other, pointing to Shirone who was passing by. This was his biggest problem.\nAlready, a rumor had spread around the academy that Shirone had a one-sided crush on Amy. And the more that kind of rumor spread, the colder the students treated Shirone.\nShirones fantasy about women was completely shattered by Amys tenacity in resolving her resentment 6 years ago.\nHey! Over there, your prince.\nWhat do you mean prince? Hes just a servant.\nAmy and Sharelle were waiting for Shirone together in front of the library. The area around them was crowded with students who were curious to see the extraordinary sight.\nAs Shirone walked up the stairs, the schoolgirls who were watching laughed and clapped. Shirones face flushed like a red beet.\nSharelle smiled pitifully and said.\nBut I kind of feel sorry for him. Hes going this far, why not just accept him?\nWhat? What nonsense are you spouting? Why would I accept him?\nOh stop pretending to be shy. For someone who doesnt glimpse at a guy, you sure do take all the bread and coffee from Shirone. There are even rumors about the goddess of Alpheas finally getting a partner.\nIt was ridiculous. This was a strategy to provoke Shirone, but it seemed like things were flowing unexpectedly.\nActually, she was only thinking of keeping it going for a week. But somehow, Shirone never expressed any displeasure and had regularly brought her the food.\nUrk! At this point, Ill end up associated with a really strange rumor. I should stop now.\nWhen Shirone handed Amy the bread and coffee, people cheered. They were deeply moved by him, who spent much effort not to spill a drop of coffee for the woman he loved.\nHeres your coffee.\nGosh! So annoying!\nAmy raised her hand. The best way to reverse this ridiculous misunderstanding was through embarrassment.\nShe was going to hit his arm and spill the coffee. Then Shirone would be just like the other countless boys who had been dumped by her so far, and the strange rumor would subside.\nWho told you to bring something like this?\nAs Amy swung her hand, the students eyes grew bigger. However, the expected tragedy did not occur.\nAmys hand trembled as she glared daggers at the coffee.\nAt least act like you dislike it. Are you stupid? A fool? Do you have no guts or what?\nUnexpected guilty conscience. But that was Shirones strength.\nHis mindset went something like this.\nIsnt it better to think positively about the things I have to do?\nAnd that attitude made Amy feel guilty.\nUm Excuse me, heres your coffee.\nShe knew because Amy herself was someone who studied harder than anyone else.\nThinking back on it, she felt quite sorry. Nevertheless, she didnt avoid men because she was afraid of attention, it was simply annoying. The arrogant kids with no talent who called themselves nobles did not really suit her tastes.\nWhatever. Let them think whatever they want. As long as the rumor isnt about me.\nAmy accepted the bread and coffee. And as if they were watching a show, applause broke out from all sides.\nI dont need this from now on, so dont buy it! Okay?\nYes? Oh, okay.\nSo now, did her anger disappear with just this? Thinking he would never have to see her again, Shirone let out a deep sigh of relief.\nHowever, as a result, Amys remark aroused more misunderstanding by the students.\nShe accepted it! Amy accepted Shirones feelings!\nShe said she doesnt need coffee. Doesnt that mean he can just come without buying anything?\n* * *\n* * *\nAmy went into the library as if to show that she had no intention to answer. Sharelle followed behind quickly. She couldnt hide her excitement.\nHey! What are you thinking of doing? If its actually true, thats great and all, but is that really what you were trying to say?\nI dont know! Just let them think however they like. Do they have nothing better to do? Whatever, I dont have to worry about it after I enter the Advanced Class. Let them enjoy their childish jokes among themselves. It wont matter to me soon enough.\nShirone was so happy he felt lighter as he came down the library stairs. The ten days of torture were over. Honestly, he didnt think things would end so soon. Starting tomorrow, he could go straight to the library without wasting time.\nYay! I can read one more book!\nShirone captured Amys heart. Such deluded schoolboys were looking at Shirone enviously as he hopped away in happiness.\n11 P.M.\nAmy closed the book and sighed.\nShe never thought studying was fun, but she liked it as much as she liked the library. Rather than hanging out with those who gossip about other peoples love affairs, or those who thought themselves more important than others, the library was a much better place.\nEven though it neared midnight, the library was still packed with students. They didnt care who dated who. They were racehorses running madly to achieve their dreams.\nThrough observing them, one would realize that indulging in miscellaneous thoughts was nothing but a waste of time.\nBut despite the fact Amy was not as much of a bookworm as them, she still ranked 1st in Class 4 and never even considered the possibility of being overthrown.\nSharelle, who was sitting next to her, turned her head.\nHuh? Why did you close the book? Are you leaving already?\nYeah. I have a lot on my mind today. Ill just have a good night's rest and get up about an hour early tomorrow.\nReally? Then lets go together.\nNo. You dont have to leave early because of me. Ill see you tomorrow.\nOkay, then. See you. Make sure to get up early tomorrow.\nAmy smiled and packed her bag. During her 6 years in the academy, Sharelle Portrisse was her one and only friend. She was a chatterbox no different than any other kid her age, but she did her job as a student better than most. Her ranking in Class 4 was 6th from the top, so being placed in the Advanced class would not pose a problem.\nAmy liked Sharelle, who was a respectful competitor who could enjoy and share a mature rivalry.\nAfter encouraging her friend for a bit, Amy left the reading room.\nEveryone except those on night duty got off work, so the hallway was quiet. Students came to the academy to achieve their dreams, but employees were just here for the job and to make money.\nAmy descended down the stairs, stretching out her days fatigue. But suddenly, she saw someone standing in the dark stairway.\nPale face with large dark circles. Black hair covering the cheeks. Amys face wrinkled once when she identified who the person was.\nIt was Jake Ardius.\nHe was 2nd-class nobility, and the family head was the financial executor of the royal castle. It was known that the power his family held was no less than that of a 1st-class noble family. Perhaps it was because of the family heads job.\nJake was arrogant and had a rough personality. But the main reason why Amy didnt like him was because he was a student who had little to no talent. He never even put in any effort to try and compensate for it.\nAlthough he was taking the same class as her, Jake had a long way to go before he could be placed in the Advanced class. Furthermore, there had been rumors that he was the president of a research group called Black Magician.\nIn Amys opinion, Black Magician was a group that researched how to bully students who were better than them.\nSince they were not a research group approved by the school, they were not financially supported. Essentially, it was a dark circle in which kids who had an inferiority complex harassed students.\nOf course, they did not openly pick a fight or extort money. Since most were children of high-class nobles, if they were to act like snotty, back alley kids, they would be immediately expelled.\nNevertheless, it was clear that some students in the group were active, seeing that rumors of students being attacked by Black Magician still existed.\nAmy, you finished early today. I was going to wait until midnight.\nWhy were you waiting for me? Dont you have anything better to do?\nDont be like that. I heard a rumor about you. You accepted a lowerclassman way below your level Shirone was his name, right?\nAmy sighed, rubbing her forehead.\nIs he sane? Out of all the places, he came to talk about such a pathetic thing in front of a library?\nJake put forward his coffee with an overly cheesy smile. Amy could tell just by the smell. It was the civet coffee that was popular among the nobles.\nI even warmed it up. The Amy I know deserves this much. I cant dirty your mouth with substandard coffee, right?\nAmy looked at the coffee and raised her head in absurdity.\nWhat are you doing?\nAs you can see, Im courting you. You already know of my familys power, and Ill be the next in charge of the finances of the royal family after my father. Am I not the perfect man for you?\nSorry, but I dont have private chats in the library. So youre wrong to court me in such a place and time. Oh, but you forgot the most important thing The fact that I hate you. Something like this better not happen again.\nAmy stepped aside and walked down the stairs. However, Jake placed his hand against the wall and blocked her way.\nWhat the hell are you doing?\nI guess Ive been too soft. I also have to consider my family's reputation, so you coming out like this puts me in a very difficult position. Isnt it the same for you? Arent you studying that much harder so as not to disgrace the Karmis family? Look, were concerned about the same thing.\nAmy snorted. No matter how prosperous the Ardius family was, the Karmis family was not one to be pushed around by small fry either. Most of all, she did not like Jakes way of talking.\nSays the cheapskate that only counts money.\nWhat?\nTo live while doing the things you want to do, thats what my family always says. We are qualitatively different from people like you, who simply take great pride in counting money while acting as if its a big deal.\nHis veins popped. A normal 1st-class noble would never insult him like this.\nHis father was a royal financial executor. The whole world begins and ends with money. It was Amy who was being immature.\nYou think the Karmis family is that prestigious? Think about it. Youre only 1st-class in name only. How many people actually hold strong authority among those on active duty? My family can run circles around yours in terms of money. What do you think? Should we test it out if you dont believe me?\nAmy felt Jakes unpleasant energy and shuddered. He was the kind of man who would torment others forever if it was for his own sake. She finally realized why she was so uneasy and disturbed throughout the day. She let out a breath.\nThanks to you I understand. I understand why I accepted that coffee.\nWhat?\nYoure different from Shirone. Simply put, youre a coward.\nHAHA! Im more of a coward than that lousy bastard? Should we confirm that right now and see if its true or not?\nYou must be dying to do something, but if youre going to do it, get on with it. Dont waste my precious time just flapping your lips. You thought Id get scared if you tensed your eyes a little and acted all scary? By you? A coward?\nAmy smacked away Jakes mug. Expensive coffee splashed all over the wall, while the mug crashed down the stairs and shattered into pieces.",

      "content": "Chapter 24\nJake felt his blood start to boil. His hours of effort in waiting for Amy were slighted like this.\nHow dare a bitch like you! Keuk!\nHe closed his mouth shut and cowered in fear. Amy had already entered the Spirit Zone. Most likely in the Target Form of the Four Way Formation.\nHow dare a bitch like you? To a guy whos all bark and no bite, do I look that easy to you? If youre that angry, why not just come at me? Im willing to set you on fire right this instant.\nJake ground his teeth. He was mistaken to think she was a model student who only devoted herself to studying. She used to also be a vicious girl who jumped from back alley to back alley.\nIts against the rules to use magic at this time.\nWouldnt you have used magic first? While warming up that civet cat or something.\nYou crazy! How is that the same as the Four Way Formation!\n\"Haha!\"\nAmy couldnt help but burst out laughing. At least he was only small fry. A small fry who gets scared once he finds out his opponent isnt easy. Most of the men she met were like that.\n\"Do you know why I accepted Shirone's coffee? Because he seems to take responsibility for everything. Unlike you, who immediately resorts to using his family, he does everything he can before resorting to those methods. If you don't disappear from my sight, right now, I will set you on fire. Ill burn you enough so that not even a trace of you will be left behind.\nJake was certain. Those were not empty promises. The red eyes of the Karmis family, which he had only heard through rumors Her large eyes were glowing red.\n\"If you kill me....\n\"I don't care. I can take responsibility for what I do or do not do.\nJake clenched his teeth hard. He had never felt so humiliated before.\nHowever, in front of the pressure of the red-eyed girl, the worlds #1 good-for-nothing boy named Jake, had no choice but to step back.\nHe was already overpowered by Amys Four Way Formation. In the hands of the first-placed student in Class 4, he knew she wasnt bluffing when she said she could burn him to nothingness.\n\"You will definitely pay for this, you haughty bitch!\nJake gritted his teeth and strode out of the library. It was only after he disappeared from view that her red eye lost its glow. Amy, who staggered for a moment, rubbed her eyes and muttered.\n\"So annoying. What a snob.\nInstead of being able to go back to her room to rest, she had to instead waste her time arguing with a bastard. That fact was unbearably irritating to her because she knew that once enough time had passed, they would resort to the same underhanded tricks again.\nShe could not understand why all the guys clinging to her were all so equally despicable like that trash. She wondered if there was something wrong with her personality.\nA short laugh escaped from Amy.\n\"Well, its true that theres something wrong with it.\"\nAmy suddenly felt sorry for Sirone.\n* * *\nShirone, who had finally managed to escape Amy's clutches, was happy. Studying became more enjoyable when he realized how precious that 1 hour Amy took away was.\nHe had to suffer from peoples attention thanks to the scandal with a girl from the academy who was known to have the highest standards, but no one cared as much in the library. Their eagerness to study was the driving force behind why the Alpheus Magic Academy was in the top 5.\nFinished with todays classes, Shirone was on his way to the library while humming a tune. Then he saw a familiar face near the instructors lodging.\nIt was Amy's friend, Sharelle Portrisse. Shirone turned to the sight of her wandering around restlessly as if she was in a hurry to the bathroom.\nAlthough they were only at a stage where they would greet each other during the integrated class, he personally found her amiable. Unlike Amy, who growled whenever he was in sight, she would always give words of support. Though, he still hasn't figured out what she was rooting for.\nWhen Sharelle found Shirone walking towards her, her eyes widened. Then her face turned pale and she started running to him.\nHel\n\"Hey! What are you doing here right now?\nSharelle grabbed Shirone by the collar and shook him.\n\"Why are you here? If I knew about this, I wouldn't have sent Amy away!\"\nShirone tilted his head. She should know that he goes straight to the library after class.\n\"What's going on? You have to tell me so I know.\"\n\"Read this! Did nothing really happen to you?\nSharelle held out a crumpled paper. Shirone took it silently and unfolded it. It was a short warning message sent by a sender named Black Magician.\n* * *\n* * *\n30 minutes ago.\nA guy blocked Amy and Sharelles path as they were on their way to the library.\nHe was a Class 5 student who was held back for a long time and was currently over the age of 23. A year ago, they knew his name because he was in the same class, but they never had a conversation with him because he had a sly personality.\n\"Hello, I see that you're still on the roll.\"\nAmy snorted along at the way he cunningly came up to her in a polite manner.\n\"Get out of my way. I'm busy. I have nothing to say to you.\"\n\"Ah, you can't be like that. I was once your classmate, but cant you give me some of your time?\n\"Am I the only classmate you have? There should be at least a few hundred other students who have gone through Class 5, so search for another.\nAlthough they were respectful to him because of his age, they could not hold back their tongues. They did not like the guy. Being a Class 5 meant he was not completely talentless, but he was distracted by things. Why would she hold a conversation with a human dog who was complacent and touched female lowerclassmen?\n\"Haha! I see you still have that kind of attitude, Amy.\"\nAmy's face darkened.\n\"What? What did you just say?\"\nShe only treated him neutrally because of his age, but now he was trying to climb to the top of her head. However, just as Amy was about to burst, the guy calmly handed over a note.\n\"Boss wants to see you. You'd better do as you're told if you don't want us to torment your prince.\"\nPrince? What are you talking about?\nAmy frowned and read the note.\nWe have Shirone. Come to the 14th training ground by 6 o'clock before we do something to him you wont like. If you let the teachers know, well make you regret it for the rest of your life, you decide.\nBlack Magician\nShe crumpled the note immediately.\n\"So what? Shirone has nothing to do with me. But let's say he does have something to do with me, you think you can just start ordering me around?\n\"Hoho, well thats for you to decide. I'm just a messenger.\nThe guy, who successfully completed his mission, put on a nasty smile and walked away.\nAmy, whose anger soared to her head, threw the note to the floor. Sharelle picked up the note, her hands trembled after reading the contents.\nBlack Magician, an unidentified circle among students.\n\"Amy, what do we do? They are really evil. People say the reason Tyra dropped out last month was because of them.\"\n\"Tyra did?\"\nTyra, a classmate of Class 4, was not at the level of Advanced Class, but she was a talented student who maintained at least a moderate grade to be in the Intermediate Class. So if they had actually threatened her, they must have come at her using cowardly tactics.\n\"I should go for now. It's because of me that Shirone was caught anyway.\"\n\"Lets just talk to the teachers. I'm worried about Shirone too, but it might also get dangerous for you.\"\n\"Teachers? Hmm\nAmy thought it over. Despite the bad blood between them, Shirone had a secret Which was that he wasnt exactly of nobility.\nIf this incident grows, rumors will spread throughout the academy, and Shirone's school life may come to an end.\nShe was sure because she knew how the nobles felt towards anyone not of nobility.\n\"I'll go first. If I don't come back by 7 o'clock, then dont hesitate to report to the teachers.\"\n\"What do you mean? We need to tell them right away\n\"Sorry. Theres a reason why Im doing this. I'll tell you everything when I get back, okay?\"\nWhen the always-so-confident Amy asked in this way, Sharelle did not know what to do. It was her first time ever seeing Amy like this.\n\"Then lets go together. We dont know how many there will be.\n\"You should stay and get ready to call the teachers. Don't worry. Maybe the leader is Jake. He can't do anything to me with that thing he calls his talent.\nSharelle knew Amy's brilliance better than anyone else. Although it was blocked by the barrier of the Advanced Class, the gap in the level between her and the rest of Class 4 was wide. Amy was a talented person who never lost her place as the lead.\n\"Okay, it's exactly one hour. If you don't come back by 7 o'clock sharp, I'm going to tell the teachers.\"\n\"Okay, I trust you. And dont worry, I'll come back safe and sound.\"\n* * *\nUpon hearing the whole story from Sharelle, Shirone was bewildered. It was surprising enough that an unruly circle called the Black Magician existed, but to hear that Amy took the risk for him Thats what truly surprised him.\n\"You're saying she went because of me, right? So why are you standing here, doing nothing?\"\n\"I don't know either! Amy told me to wait no matter what. Why the hell are you here?!\"\nShirone could somewhat understand. This one-hour delay was only placed because she was confident that she could solve it herself. Also, another reason for her action was her consideration in hopes to keep his secret. It was an excellent decision to leave her friend, Sharelle, as a messenger.\n\"I have to go! Please do as Amy said.\"\nShirone ran to the 14th training ground. There were 30 minutes left until 7 oclock, but the distance was a problem. The 14th training ground was located deep in the mountains because it was a place for actual, real-life combat.\nAt that moment, the landscape suddenly shook and buildings quickly began to be pushed back in an instant. When he turned his head, he saw Sharelle hugging his side.\n\" Youre running? How long do you think thats gonna take? Also, Im going with you.\"\nIt was short-distance teleportation, a mages essential magic. It was prohibited to use it on campus because collisions between the teleporters could occur, but it was not the time to be thinking about that.\nThe students looked up as they heard the popping noises coming from the sound waves. Sharelle, who was holding Shirone, started teleporting away to the mountain, flashing at intervals of 10 meters each time.\nArriving at the entrance of the mountain, the two quickly climbed the mountain. Teleportation was extremely dangerous as one needed to be extremely precise because one could teleport into an object and die.\nThey arrived at the 14th training ground before 7 oclock. But Amy was not in sight. In fact, they couldn't even feel any existences nearby.\n\"Amy! Amy! What happened?! Are you here?!\n\"Maybe they took her somewhere else. Im sure they took into account the possibility of someone reporting to the teachers since the location was exposed on the note. Or maybe we were fooled?\"\n\"What now, what about Amy?\nRealizing the meticulousness of Black Magician, Shirone was convinced. They were really going to cause a huge problem this time around.\n\"Go down the mountain now and tell the teachers. You can go much faster without me.\"\n\"Amy told me to wait until 7 o'clock. She said there was a reason. What if Amy gets disappointed later?\n\"And that reason is because of me, so just go! Quick! It doesnt matter because I said Im fine!\"\nSharelle had a blank expression. She remembered the desperate face Amy had when she read the letter.\n\"Really? Whats going on with the two of you? Are you guys really not dating behind my back?\"\n\"Is this really the time? Things will get dangerous if we waste any more time!\"\n\"Ah, right! Okay! Stay here and don't go anywhere!\"\nSharelle turned and went back the way they came. Anyway, there was no reason not to report to the teachers since telling them wouldnt harm Amy in any way.\nShirone went into the mountains to search for Amy. Unlike those of nobility, he spent half his life in the mountains, so the dense forest was rather familiar.\nHis Spirit Zone was expanded as much as possible to check for any traces of Amy. After about 10 minutes of climbing the mountain, the first footstep was finally discovered through synesthesia.\nTheyre here!\nBut there were no further traces. Based on how the bushes were trampled, he guessed that they flew into the sky.\nSince Shirone didnt know any magic, there was no way for him to find Amy. Worried and troubled, Shirone wandered around for a long time. Then at one point, a sound wave exploded in the sky. Shirone turned his head fast to the source of the sound.",

      "content": "Chapter 25\nBOOOOOOM!\nBlack smoke rose from Amys face. However, if one looked closely, one could observe that there was a gap the size of a finger protecting her from the attack. It was a magic spell called Air Shield. It compressed air in order to create a barrier.\nA surprise attack as soon as the meeting place changed. I see youre still the same petty person from before.\nAmy raised herself from where she landed and looked back. The man who gave her the note stood with a fishy smile.\n\"Hoho, I myself have a lot of pent-up anger because of you. If you had just obediently let me, I would have had the honor of having the famous Amy's first kiss.\"\n\"Your tongue is as dirty as you are. But thats not why Im here. Where is Shirone?\nFive people fell from the sky, circling Amy. Among them was Jake, the leader of Black Magician. Looking around, he said as if he found it really surprising.\n\"You really came alone. Is he that precious to you that youd put yourself in harms way?\"\nWhat nonsense. I alone am enough to handle all of you. Im asking again, where is Shirone?\nHahaha! That feeble bastard is probably in the library, completely unaware as to what his girl will be experiencing from this point on.\nAmy finally realized that she had been tricked. But to her, this was the better outcome. She was confident that, without hostages holding her back, the scoundrels would not be able to touch a single hair of hers.\nCalling me out means youre ready to die, correct?\nHow confident. But did you really think wed come here unprepared? If you look at the list of guys who looked down on Black Magician Youd notice that most of them were beaten half to death.\nTheres a limit as to how far his intellect can drop. He babbles too much.\nAmy entered the Spirit Zone. When the shape was transformed into the Target Form of the Four Way Formation, Jake, remembering last nights incident, immediately moved to cast it as well.\nHowever, the cost of being one step behind and missing a preemptive attack was huge. Amy ignored Jake and went after the members behind him.\nThe men hurriedly flew away when she cast consecutive Fire Strikes, her special skill. Since strike type added physical force to magic, Air Shield alone was not enough to block it.\nAmy quickly rotated her Spirit Zone to aim at the target. However, humans were quite unpredictable, so it was not possible to achieve 100 percent accuracy like during practice. Every time the Spirit Zone rotated or did a reverse rotation, her head throbbed.\nJake manipulated the wind and soared into the sky. If Amy's specialty was fire, Jakes was wind. After all, in face-to-face combat, one lethal move would determine the outcome. When he cast the magic he was most confident in, Windcutter, a sharp wind slashed through the air.\nAmy didn't sense the magic approach. The cross-shaped Target Form could dramatically increase the range, but it was bound to be weak in defense compared to the sphere form. In particular, the cross-shaped target form was weak to air magic.\nAmy sensed Windcutter penetrating her Spirit Zone and immediately moved her body. However, by the time she moved, it was already less than a meter away.\nThe moment Black Magician was about to celebrate in delight, her body twisted so quickly that she could not be seen. The Windcutter brushed past her red hair, freaking out Jake.\n\"What? How did she?\"\n\"It's called Schema, you bastards.\"\nAmy raised the cross-shaped Target Form at an angle. Seeing this, Jake hurriedly tried to flee, but her targeting speed was the best in the Intermediate class.\n\"Fire Strike.\"\nA fireball the size of a cannonball was fired. Thinking it was impossible to avoid, Jake wrapped himself in an Air Suit, a higher-level air-type magic.\nJake, who was hit by the Fire Strike, crashed to the ground with a loud bang.\n\"ARGHH! That bitch!\"\nHe got up and glared at Amy. The fire continued to blaze on his Air Suit as the flames sucked in oxygen from it. With his whole body covered in flames, he looked like a demon. Jake detonated his Air Suit and the flames came down like petals. However, because the physical force of the strike had already made its mark, his stomach was damaged.\n\"I'll kill you!\"\n\"Hohoho! Did you actually think you could defeat me with your meager level of skill? Youre far from moving up, let alone graduating. Youre at the perfect level to fail. You should be focused on your studies, not on girls, you dipshit!\nAmy, the genius of the Karmis family. Indeed, the difference in their skills was as vast as their fame.\nBut then suddenly, Jake smiled wickedly.\n\"I doubt that. Your reign of terror ends here.\"\nAs if to prove that he wasnt bluffing, members of Black Magician held out their hands at the same time. Then Amy's face paled. It was a strange sensation that she had never encountered before. Something had entered her mind and was messing with it.\nAmy glared at Jake with anger.\n\"This is... Anti-Magic?\"\n\"Hahaha! Are you surprised? This is the Black Magician's specialty. It's also the magic that sends countless talents back home.\"\n\"How crude!\"\nIt really was a cheap shot. Anti-magic, it was a magic prohibited in the academy due to the dangers it brought. It was the Achilles Heel of all mages.\nFive resonance waves messed up Amy's Spirit Zone. It felt like someone gripped her head and was shaking it like crazy.\nAmy knelt down, unable to hold on. If she kept staying in the Zone any longer, she felt shed go crazy.\nWith a victors smile on his face, Jake cast Air Chain. Chains made of air wrapped around Amys limbs and lifted her up.\nTrapped and unable to move, Amy struggled with all her might. However, it was a binding force that could not be escaped, even after she activated Schema.\n* * *\n* * *\n\"Heh, I finally got you. The feisty female kitten.\"\nJake pulled out a pocket knife.\n\"Well, well, well. Now, what should I do with you? For your information, I still remember what you did a few days ago. I'm in the mood to commit something.\n\"Im warning you, if you put even a single scratch on me, you won't be safe.\"\n\"PUHAHAHA! Is the great Amy calling forth her family now that shes cornered? I told you so, we're all the same. After all, without youre family, you're just a bitch who can't do anything.\n\"Don't place me on the same level as scum like you, Im pretty sure I told you this, too. I'll make sure to get rid of you with my own hands.\"\nJake's eyes were filled with hatred. Even in this situation, her attitude of not swallowing her pride was pissing him off. The hand that held the knife trembled as if it was about to stab something.\n\"Youre not exactly in a position to talk like that right now. Do you want me to scribble on your face? I'm sure there'd be no one whod bother to follow you around if you become an ugly bitch.\"\nAmy became slightly afraid after seeing Jake's abnormal eyes. They held an inferiority that had no bounds. He really meant every word.\nJake grabbed the blade with his other hand. Although he wasnt skillful in fire magic, he knew enough to easily heat the knife. The knife started to glow red.\nLets do this. The arrogant Amy ruined her eyes while researching magic by herself. She dropped out of the academy and forever lived on as a loser. Hows that? Amazing scenario, is it not?\nThe blade seemed like it would drip molten iron at any moment. A sudden shove to her head made Amy turn. Her burning hair crackled and popped.\n\"Oho! So there are times when Amy gets scared, too. I'll give you one last chance. Beg me to let you off this once. Even better if you shed tears. Then, if you promise to leave the academy, I wont burn off your eyes.\nAmy realized why Tyra dropped out.\nThey did this simply because they were inferior. Simply because they were upset and offended. Karmis red eyes filled with anger and glowed red.\n\"Do it if you can. But don't ever think you'll get away with it.\"\nJake smirked. Hed heard that kind of promise more than once. All Nobles were unyielding. However, the moment a blade is pointed their way, theyd shout and beg for mercy like any other human.\nThe bigger their self-esteem, the harder it was for them to recover once it was broken. Watching the students leave the academy like that, Jake soothed his feelings of inferiority.\n\"Well then, shall we get started?\"\nThe pocket knife slowly approached Amy's left eye. Amy was determined to endure it. However, when she felt the scorching heat nearing her skin, she was forced to close her eyelids tight.\n\"Stop, you sick bastards!\"\nA sudden shout made the Black Magician jump. Seeing Shirone who was huffing with a clenched fist, Amy opened her eyes wide. Jake also turned around with a startled expression, as if he didnt expect him to actually face them.\n\"Aha! The knight in shining armor has made his appearance! Thats too bad, your girl would have surprised you with a new appearance if youd arrived just a bit later.\n\"What are you trying to do to her?\n\"Who knows! What\nwas\nI going to do? Why not ask your lover yourself?\"\n\"You dimwit! You can't come here alone!\"\nAmy shouted. Yet Shirone was more stunned by the situation in front of him than by her words.\nOlder students were surrounding a girl who had her limbs shackled. And if that alone was not enough, the rascal, Jake, was wielding a red-hot pocket knife.\n'Because of me....\nFor the first time in his life, Shirone felt an intense wrath bubble up inside him. Picking up a tree branch from the ground, he hollered!\n\"Let her go! If you don't, I won't let you off easy!\n\"PUHAHAHA! Did you hear that? What can you possibly do with that piece of wood?\nIrrespective of Jakes mocking laughter, Shirone rushed straight at them. He was confident in his skill in close-quarters combat. After all, he was the person who had defeated Rian in a swordsmanship match. After calculating it in his head, he knew he could buy enough time for the teachers to arrive.\n\"Here I come!\"\n\"Guys, he says hes coming. Open a path for him.\"\nNo one moved when Shirone came running. Rather, they smiled tauntingly, as if wanting for him to come closer.\nBy the time he realized something was amiss, it was too late. Shirones mind shook as if he had been hit on the head with a hammer.\n\"Keuk!\"\n\"You stupid! Get rid of your Spirit Zone! It's Anti-Magic!\"\nAnti-Magic? Shirone finally realized what was happening. He realized how Amy, who securely held her place as the first in Class 4, was caught by these rascals.\nIt was truly a tremendous shock and vibration. The resonance wave caused by the five people shook his mind.\nShirone raised his head. Colors smeared and shuffled around as if the world had been dunked underwater. But he couldn't give up here. Holding onto his distant consciousness, Shirone slowly, but surely walked.\n\"Amy, Im gonna save you now.\"\n\"I told you to stop! Youll never be able to cast magic for the rest of your life! You'll become a cripple!\"\n\"Because of me... This happened..\n\"Get rid of your Spirit Zone! Quickly!\"\nShe knew Shirone was in a state where he couldn't hear, but all she could do was shout. With every step he took, she felt her tears start to well up more and more.\nShirone clenched his teeth hard and kept up his Spirit Zone.\nNo! I have to hang on! I need more frames!\nResponding to his strong will, his Spirit Zone gradually began to change into the Defensive Form of the Four Way Formation. This time, it was the Black Magicians turn to be dismayed. Casting Anti-Magic was not an easy feat, but maintaining it against a strong force was even harder. They felt as if they were being crushed by a boulder.\n\"Wh-What?! What's going on?! \"\nShirone extended his Spirit Zone to the max. It was shaking precariously like dew on a leaf, but he continued to press on.\nI have to push even harder! So stable that it cant collapse! So hard that it cant be destroyed!'\nFinally, as the frames started to connect, Shirones Spirit Zone regained stability. Then, like a domino game, one after the other, members of the Black Magician wailed in pain.\n\"Keuk! Whats happening?! My heads pounding!\"\nAt that moment Shirone's eyes lit up. As the Four Way Formations Defense Form was completed to perfection, the huge sphere was tightened into a cube. The pain caused by the Anti-Magic disappeared, while a feeling of sturdiness flooded in. Shirone felt like he could crush even diamond.\n\"ARRGHHHHH!\"\nThe five who cast the Anti-Magic collapsed, screaming. They felt as if they were being crushed by something. They couldn't even lift a finger and were bleeding from the nose.\nThis was why the academy banned the use of Anti-Magic. If one didnt cultivate the mind enough, Anti-Magic was a poison that destroyed the mind.\nAmy was shocked to see the tossing and turning Black Magicians. Five Anti-Magic casters were crushed by one brand-new class-7 student\nShirone felt as if a small lizard was under the soles of his feet. He felt a wiggling sensation in his mind, but that was all. And as time passed, even such resistance faded. They released the Anti-Magic right as their minds were about to collapse.\nAmy burned the air chain with fire magic and landed on the floor. Through her own Spirit Zone, Amy could feel the shape Shirones Spirit Zone was in. It was extremely cold, hard, and heavy.\nNo way. How is this possible\nShirone still had fierce eyes. When he took a step forward, Jake stepped back unknowingly. It was the result of his instinct that didn't want to bump into Shirones Spirit Zone.\nHowever, the 15-meter-diameter Spirit Zone could not be avoided by taking a step back. Eventually, their two Spirit Zones overlapped, and Jake asked with a stricken look.\n\"YouWho the hell are you?\"\nIt was something beyond belief But a Spirit Zones synesthesia didnt lie. A huge cube comprised of 88 sides was surrounding Shirone.",

      "content": "Chapter 26\nBlack Magician.\nA research group created by six problem children, led by Jake.\nAside from Jake, it was a group of students who had no dreams or futures and were students who were repeatedly held back.\nThere was a time when they, too, were noticed as brilliant talents If only they had the spirit to try again, they could have made great achievements.\nBut they took their hands off the competition. In a way, they were the only losers in the fierce competition.\n\"This cant be. There must be something wrong.\nJake shook his head. This may have been possible for Amy, but it should have been impossible for Black Magician to lose to a freshman who had just enrolled.\n\"Yeah. I didn't lose. I just got unlucky.\nSo far, the students Jake had forced to drop out had excellent grades. How could Shirone even compare? Jake felt he was just unlucky.\nDoesn't everyone go through a day like this in their lives?\nIt's not over yet. I'm a Class 4. Im naturally different from those backstabbers who use Anti-Magic.\nAfter reading Jakes deadly atmosphere, Shirone tensed. Jake's Spirit Zone, which turned into a star shape, was felt by Shirone through synesthesia. It felt as if hundreds of archers were aiming their bow at him.\nWhat do I do? I haven't learned magic yet.\nHe was able to resist Anti-Magic because it was a battle fought using the Spirit Zone, but a magic battle was a completely different story.\nThere was no way Shirone, who had not mastered any offensive or defensive magic, could face Jake.\nJake called forth wind between his palms and pressed them down to compress. Then the air began to rotate in the form of a disk. It was Windcutter, a magic that could easily cut through tree trunks.\n\"I'll take your arms first. Then your legs.\"\nJust as Jake was about release the Windcutter, someone grabbed his shoulder from behind and turned him around. The person touched his body at the same time Jake sensed their approach through synesthesia. The speed at which the person moved was inhuman.\nAmy's face appeared right in front of him with eyes glowing red. As her fist smacked his chin, the scenery in front of him shook.\n\"Argh!\"\nTo a mage who was not well-rounded physically, physical attacks were like rat poison. And in addition to that, being attacked by a punch that contained the power of Schema would do even greater harm. Their Spirit Zone would not be able to withstand it.\nAmy got on Jake's stomach and threw out a barrage of punches. The power of a single strike was like being struck down by a big stone.\n\"What did you say you were going to do to me? I dare you to blabber again, you bastard! Say it!\"\nJake's head snapped side to side as if it were close to being yanked out. Worried that something terrible would happen if left as is, Shirone ran to Amy.\n\"Amy, stop it! Hes going to die at this rate!\"\n\"Let go of me, you bastard! You must have thought I was easy to target, Jake!\"\n\"Hes going to die!\"\nJake heard the conversation as his consciousness slowly started fading away. He no longer felt pain, only a dull shock traveled from his face to his body whenever Amy struck.\nDie? I'm going to die?\nThe fear of death awoke Jake's mind. He covered his face with his arms and shouted at the top of his lungs.\n\"H-Help me! Just spare my life! Please!\"\nAmys eyes watered. She had almost lost her eyes. She had been on the brink of going blind. Remembering that she had been shamed by this good-for-nothing scum, she felt her blood boil even hotter.\n\"I will never forgive you! You sick bastard!\"\n\"Amy, please stop!\"\nShirone tried to pull Amy back with all his might. He felt like he was pulling out a wooden stake stuck in the ground due to her Schema. But, when he pulled her one last time with a forceful tug, Amy fell back and crushed Shirone.\n\"That's plenty enough, Amy. Please stop it.\"\nShirone was breathing hard. When he came to his senses, Shirone felt something soft and tender against his arm. Realizing that he was pressing Amy's chest, he hurriedly pulled his arm away.\n\"S-Sorry!\"\nAmy was unresponsive. She was only shivering sporadically as she exhaled and inhaled roughly. Her body was clearly reacting to how she was feeling, so Shirone, feeling sorry for her, gently hugged her waist and softly said.\n\"Amy, because of me\n\"AHH! That felt soooooo refreshing!\"\n\"Ack!\"\nAmy bounced up, ramming Shirone's lower abdomen with her butt.\nShirone turned around, clutching his abdomen. If he had been hit a little further down, a horrible situation he did not wish to further imagine could have happened.\n\"What's wrong? Are you not feeling good somewhere?\"\nHe was able to avoid the vulnerable spot, but a cold sweat broke out on his forehead because the impact poured downwards. But he did not show it.\n\"No Its nothing.\"\n\"Hehe! Of course you should be. I know how light I am.\"\nThere was no way that Amy, who had been a very curious girl since childhood, was unaware of Shirone's state. It was a sign of her own friendliness, as she was poor at expressing emotions. It also reflected Shirone's success trying to quietly overlook the dangerous collision with Amy a minute ago.\n\"Anyways, what now?\"\nShirone changed the subject and turned to the members of Black Magician. He didn't notice while they were chaotically fighting, but after assessing the situation after things had settled down, he noticed the condition of the boys was serious.\nAll of them fainted with bloody noses, and Jake was crawling on the ground, half-dead.\nAfter examining their wrecked faces, Amy decided to cover the situation at this point. She wanted to expel them from the academy, but if the case grew bigger, Shirone's identity could be revealed.\n\"Let's head down. They'll lay low now that they have something to feel remorseful about.\"\n\"But Sharelle is probably on her way.\n\"What? Did you perhaps tell the teacher?\n\"Of course. How can I come alone when you're in danger?\"\nAmy sighed, facepalming. She could accept the fact that she was humiliated, but Amy thought that she could at least enjoy the victory. However, she was bummed out by the fact that the incident had already been reported to the teachers.\nShirone was deeply moved. The reason Amy was disappointed was because she was trying to keep his secret.\n\"Thank you, Amy.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n* * *\n* * *\n\"You came here all by yourself because of me. But dont fret over it. It doesn't matter if my secret is revealed or not. I'm just glad you're safe.\n\"No, I didnt......\nAmy avoided eye contact, scratching her cheek. There were times when she felt neglected in the freewheeling atmosphere of the Karmis family. She yearned for human affection. She wandered through the back alleys to search for it. Shirone's kind words made her happy, but at the same time, she couldnt completely digest them.\n\"Hmph! Who said it's because of you? It was only because I could handle these guys on my own. In fact, I've been thinking of doing this for a while now I just had the perfect chance to carry out that plan today.\"\nAmy's cheeks were completely red. Shirone was satisfied. He felt like he knew what she was like.\n\"Kekeke, youre so childish it makes me cringe. You call yourself geniuses? As if. You guys are just a bunch of ignorant kids.\nJake stood up with his hand against a tree. His face was a mess, but his eyes were full of malice.\nAmy placed her hand on her waist and spoke.\n\"You are really pathetic. If you can't even stand up properly, just stay sprawled on the ground. Are you a pervert? You like being punched by me that much?\n\"Puhahaha!\"\nThere was no such thing as defeat in Jakes mind. After all, it was money that ruled the world. He may have lost this fight, but he still had strong financial power.\n\"You think everything is over? No, this is just the beginning. Lets be honest, you can't actually kill me, can you? Kill me if youre so confident. You guys will never graduate as long as I'm here. I'll destroy you guys through any means necessary!\"\nShirone was appalled. However, Amy, who had dominated the back alleys since she was young, knew people like Jake all too well.\n\"Kill you? Why should I kill you? Id only be wasting my time on a guy like you. But keep this in mind I wont kill you, but I can still beat the living daylights out of you.\"\nJake flinched as Amy walked towards him with a clenched fist. No matter how hard he tried to stay strong, his body remembered the fear afflicted by her previously.\n\"...Do you think Im scared?\"\n\"Did someone say something? Since youre up and talking, I should beat you again. I still havent gotten over what you did to me.\"\nJake choked up seeing Amy's dramatic motion of rolling her shoulders, and his face was distorted in fear.\nScreeeeeeeech!\nA shrill fricative/sound was heard from the sky. Shirone looked up, but the other two knew without looking.\nIt was a noise unique to Spatial Warp, an upper-level of teleportation magic.\nThe moment Shirone thought starlight was shining in the sky, the flash quickly bent and came down to the place where he and the others were.\nSharelle landed with two instructors.\nWith a restless heart, Amy glimpsed at the instructors faces. Then she let out a small sigh.\nIt was Siena of the Ice and Thadd of the Flames.\nUgh, of all the possible teachers\nAlong with Ethella, the youngest instructor at the magic academy, there was no way they would handle this incident lightly.\n\"Amy! Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?\nSharelle ran to Amy with a crying face.\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not so easily beaten, you know.\nSharelle didn't miss a small change as she had a sensitive personality. Amy's bangs, which flowed down as if slightly covering her right eye, were burned.\nAlthough she had thought that Amy's hairstyle was too retro compared to her pretty appearance, Sharelles heart ached when her friend's hair, which shed been sticking with for six years, was ruined.\n\"Why is your hair like that? What happened?\"\n\"Oh, geez! I said its nothing. By the way, is it already past 7 o'clock?\n\"What do you mean? Do you know how long we've been looking for you? I wouldnt have arrived in time without the instructors.\"\nThe sun had set and it was getting dark.\nAs the surroundings became dark, Thadd casted a fire magic. The ball of flame soared up and lit up the surrounding area like a small sun.\nSo this is the Fire Sun magic.\nShirone admired the glowing sphere in the sky. The heat wasnt felt even though the surroundings brightened as if struck by broad daylight.\nThis was impossible without converting thermal energy into light energy. According to a book Shirone read, the Fire Sun, unlike its appearance, was an advanced skill and was mainly seen on a battlefield.\nThadd approached Amy with a tearful face.\n\"What's going on, Amy! How could a brilliant kid like you do such a foolish thing\nThadd, who was only vulnerable to women, did not seem to care about Shirone. In particular, Amy's grades were first place, her family was first class, and her appearance was also top one, so he couldn't help but worry.\nDisgusted by Thadds attitude, Siena turned to Shirone.\n\"Shirone, can you explain what's going on?\n\"Oh, umm, the thing is\n\"Let me tell you what happened.\"\nAt Jakes words, the instructors turned their heads. The person who was responsible for the incident said he would explain it. It was questionable whether something went wrong in his brain after being punched so hard numerous times.\nBut this was also part of Jake's calculations.\nHe would only be hit with disciplinary actions. A school that needs the funding of the Ardius family would never be able to throw him out.\nOn the other hand, what about Shirone? Jake heard clearly about Shirone having some kind of a secret in the conversation a while ago. And along with Amy's behavior to cover it up. That meant there was something fishy going on.\n\"I called Amy out. But since her skills are far superior compared to mine, I had no choice but to use Anti-Magic But it was fair play. The emotions that had stacked up over time eventually led to a battle for pride. As you can see, it's only our side that has been seriously injured.\"\nSiena spoke with a disgruntled look.\n\"Are you telling me to believe that? You guys broke the academy rules.\n\"I'm not saying I did anything good. But think about it. If Amy's a victim, why didn't she report this? Since theyre trying to cover up this incident, they must be also guilty of something.\"\nAmy shouted.\n\"What the hell are you saying?! What do you mean were trying to hide something?! You were the one who threatened to kidnap Shirone!\n\"Haha! But did we actually kidnap him? We did not. Moreover, Shirone didn't inform the teachers after reading the note we sent. What do you think this means?\n\"You You bastard\nAmy couldnt refute. It would not be understandable to anyone who did not know the actual circumstances behind the matter. After all, Shirone, who had not been kidnapped, came running without reporting to the instructors. However, if she were to tell the truth, Shirones secret would be revealed.",

      "content": "Chapter 27\nJake mounted his high horse.\nBehold, this is the real battle of adults. In this world, dirty, cheap humans will always end up winning. Kekeke. Goodbye, Amy. Even if I fall into hell, Ill make sure to bring you with me.'\n\"Don't get cocky, Jake.\"\nSiena narrowed her ice-cold eyes and spoke.\n\"Ive already heard from Sharelle before coming here. You won't be able to attend this academy anymore.\n\"Don't make such assumptions. You're a teacher who teaches students. Youre not a part of the management team, correct?\n\"\nWhat did you say\n?\"\n\"You know how much the Ardius family donates, don't you? It's more than 10 first-class aristocrats combined. You think you can expel me?\nMost aristocratic academies ran on a donation system. It was for the maintenance of expensive equipment. If the equipment was underdeveloped or outdated, students would not be able to reach their highest potential. If their grades drop, the title of being one of the top prestigious academies would be taken away, and the vicious cycle of talented students being reluctant to enter would repeat.\nIf there was history and tradition to back up an academy, it would at least be able to hold out to some extent. However, that was not the case for Alpheas Magic Academy as it was an emerging one that was only 30 years old, it needed support from the nobles.\nIt was Thadd, a graduate of Alpheas Magic Academy, who knew this better than anyone else. If the money from Jake's family disappeared, they would be financially damaged.\n\"Ms. Siena, I think youre being a bit too hasty regarding the talk of expulsion. Wouldn't that matter be for the disciplinary committee to decide?\"\n\"No. Jake is expelled. If we dont expel him from the academy, how will we be able to face those who dropped out? If Jake stays, I will take responsibility as a fellow instructor and resign.\"\nThadd imagined an academy without Siena and immediately stamped out the thought. Much to Thadds displeasure, she was a woman with a cold personality But he knew she had great magical qualities. Her quitting the academy was a different matter from Jake's expulsion.\nJakes shoulders shook as he laughed.\n\"Hahaha! Youll quit? Im down for it! Lets see if it will be the teacher or me who leaves first.\nFrost materialized on Sienas shoulder. Since she was an ice mage, even her boiling anger manifested through cold ice.\n\"Where do you think your salary comes from? How do the libraries buy their books? What about the money to open a training ground? Expensive magic devices? At the end of the day, the world revolves around money! Money! There's nothing in this world that cant be achieved through money!\nAt that moment, Siena raised her hand. Jake looked around at the ground around his feet in bewilderment. The moment he felt his surroundings get chilly, cold air whirled above ground in a vortex.\nKeuk!\nRealizing that it was an Ice Tornado that would drop the temperature of the air on call, Jake curled up and covered his face.\nCRRAACKKK!\nThe whirlwind of frost ascended and trapped Jake. Hundreds of icicles revealed themselves as the air froze over.\n\"Ughh!\"\nA sharp icicle scraped past Jake's face, shoulders, sides, and legs. Jake couldn't move an inch. It was as if he was trapped in a mold.\n'Wow! That's amazing.\nShirone genuinely admired Sienas work. Even if a mage was omnipotent, it was difficult to control the freezing phenomenon at a molecular level. The rumor that she was a genius mage coveted by the royal palace was no exaggeration.\n\"How dare a student lecture me, an instructor? Unlike what that minuscule brain of yours might think, there are many things in this world that money cannot buy.\"\nJake scrunched up his face. There was nothing in this world that money could not buy. He grew up watching countless nobles turn into mindless beasts when faced with the gold he would at times present to them.\n\"Something you can't buy with money? What the hell is that?\"\n\"Talent.\"\nJake flinched. Siena stabbed where it hurt most.\n\"Quality. Personality. Faith. Intelligence. Trust. Effort. True willingness. Should I continue?\nJake wanted to scream. Why was this woman bothering him? As long as he could shut that blabbering mouth of hers, he didn't care about how much money hed have to give. He just wanted her to shut up.\nThe Ice Tornado shattered into pieces when Siena flicked her finger. The ice shards smacked Jake in the face with no remorse.\n\"Eeeukk...\"\nJake didnt even have the courage to open his eyes. He was terrified. He was worried that his face might get ruined by the sharp ice shards.\n\"Now you understand, Jake? Money can't buy everything And that is why you don't have anything.\nSiena, who had grabbed Jake by the collar, pulled him hard and looked him dead in the eyes.\n\"Urgh!\"\n\"So, Im telling you, don't get too full of yourself. The Academy is the only place that teaches you things that money can't buy And you just took that for granted. When you leave this academy, no one will teach you these things Because no one outside of this place truly can.\"\nJake had a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He had never thought about that. A situation wherein he would not be attending the academy.\nSiena would definitely expel him. If that happened, he wouldnt be able to challenge anything. That's how he would become a loser and stay one for the rest of his life.\nThe son of the Ardius family labeled a loser\n'It's over. I'm...\nAn appearance of a young juvenile boy gradually began to emerge from his pale-stricken face. Jake, with a scrunched-up face as if he was about to cry, knelt at Siena's feet and burst into tears.\n\"I'm sorry, Ms. Olifer. I was wrong. Please, don't kick me out of the academy. Give me a second chance. I won't do this again. I'll really study hard from now on.\"\nShirones company became solemn. They understood how scary it would be for a student if they were to get kicked into the real world.\nSiena bent her knees and pulled Jake.\nWhen the disciplinary committee is held, sincerely apologize. Thats the bare minimum you need to do in order to put everything back in place. I will be on your side, so let's do this one step at a time.\"\n\"Thank you! Thank you so much!\"\nShirone realized again that there were so many things that money couldnt buy. Many students here also had to work their butts off in order to advance and achieve their goals.\nSo what if you were a commoner or an aristocrat? Not all dreams could be achieved with money.\n* * *\n* * *\nMembers of Black Magician were confined to a punishment room and treated.\nThe disciplinary committee was scheduled to be held around tomorrow, and Shirones group had a separate meeting with the instructors.\nAs Thadd wrote the affidavit, Shirone detailed how he suppressed Black Magician. As expected, the instructors eyes widened.\n\"What? You overpowered Anti-Magic with your Spirit Zone?\"\n\"Yes, I heard from Ms. Romie that Anti-Magic is a magic that requires high mental fortitude, so casting it recklessly is dangerous. I guess I tried to hold out with the Defense Form without realizing it.\nEveryone, except Amy, was speechless.\nOf course, if one did not specialize in Anti-Magic, it was difficult to achieve full efficiency. However, even taking that into account, it was a simultaneous attack by five people against one.\nThis kind of result would have been impossible if Shirones Spirit Zone was not stronger than all of the five Black Magician members combined.\nSiena leaned her face close to Shirones. She lifted his eyelids around to observe his pupils, and when no abnormal findings were found, she sighed in relief\n\"Never do that again. Anti-magic is a much more dangerous magic than you might believe. We made it through safely this time, but if things had been different, someone could have ended up crippled with no way to use magic.\nEven Shirone, who had nerves of steel, felt a sinking feeling when he heard such a possibility directly from Siena. At the time, all that was going through his head was protect Amy.\nAmy avoided his gaze. Since she was the one who put Sirone in danger, it was natural for her to have a guilty conscience.\nSiena rested her chin on her hand and got lost in thought. To be able to subdue Anti-Magic meant that you had great talent. She knew from the beginning that he had excellent durability, but she didn't expect it to be this splendid.\nThadd, on the other hand, scowled in disapproval. He got annoyed that Shirone could do something Amy couldnt.\nWith that in mind, Thadd said.\n\"Shirone, why didn't you tell us right away? The first thing you should have done was report it to us, not fly over and then report. I can't understand why you, by yourself, went to go save a senior who is in a much higher class than you.\"\nShirone and Amy felt that the time had finally come.\nFor once, Siena did not step in to stop Thadd. Since they were in a situation that involved Black Magician, an organization that has forced multiple students to drop out, she wanted to get at least this cleared up.\nShirone smiled and nodded to Amy who had a questioning look. Even if the secret was revealed, he wouldnt resent her.\nAmy sighed as if she could not do it.\n\"Okay. I'll tell you the truth.\"\nSharelle was more curious about Shirones secret than anyone else. How long have they known each other? No, rather than that, why was Amy covering for him?\n\"Actually, Shirone is\nAs everyone waited in anticipation, Amy scratched her head, and with a big smile, she said\n\"My lover.\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nThe unexpected answer shook the room.\nDespite his disbelief, Thadd pressed her for answers.\n\"Since when? You were never interested in dating. Besides, Shirone is a freshman who just entered the academy.\"\n\"I met him when I was young, haha! This is common, is it not?\"\nAmy made a fuss on purpose.\nThis should do it.\nAfter all, she would soon graduate to the Advanced Classes anyways, and she wouldnt run into Shirone much if their class time was different.\nIt would be noisy for a while, but it wasn't a bad thing. If students found out that she had a lover, there would be fewer boys chasing her around.\nIt was an excellent improvisation, she thought.\nOn the other hand, Shirone, who had to accept this new announcement, had a pounding heart. Amy was a higher-than-high upperclassman and was the object of envy for quite a lot of students. He knew this was just something to solve the current situation, but to say it was a huge burden was no lie.\n\"Right, Shirone?\"\nAmy looked back, smiling with her eyes. It was obvious it was forced. Shirone felt like he could hear her voice threatening to kill him if he did not answer quickly.\n\"Oh! Yes, yes that's right.\"\n\"KYAAA! How could this happen? I'm shocked, no, I'm moved! My hearts throbbing with emotions.\"\nSharelle slapped herself and spoke quickly.\n\"Hoho, I thought so from a long time ago! No wonder this girl always turns nice whenever she sees you! When did you guys start dating?! Who confessed first?!\nSince Amy's friend, Sharelle, believed the story, even the instructors could not help but suppose it was true. If they actually were a couple, Shirone chasing after Black Magician with such vigor was not surprising.\nThadd wrote the affidavit as he tore out his hair.\n\"The victims of this incident, Shirone and Amy, have a relationship\n* * *\nThe rumor spread quickly.\nThere was no student at Alpheas Magic Academy who did not know that Shirone and Amy were lovers. The news became so big partly because of the shocking behavior of Black Magician, but it was mainly thanks to the saga delivered by the chatterbox Sharelle.\nShirone infiltrates the enemy's camp alone to protect his lover. Black Magician fought back with Anti-Magic, but he overcame it with the power of love and rescued Amy.\nThe villain boss Jake was overwhelmed by the gleam in Shirone's eyes and shed tears. And with a runny nose, he begged for forgiveness. After everything was done and dusted, the two kissed each other amidst the moonlit mountains.\n\"SHARELLE!!! You wanna die?! Why the hell did you run around spreading such a baseless rumor?!\n\"KEKEKE! Why? Its all facts!\nroughly\n.\"\n\"Roughly? Roughly?! That also means not everything is true! When the hell did I kiss Shirone?!\n\"Oh my, dont act so coy. You said you guys were dating. And since you two have been dating each other for quite a while, you mustve already kissed. Don't you think you need this much to dramatize things?\n\"Are you some kind of a playwright? Why are you dramatizing other people's stories on your own?\"\n\"Well, isnt this better? The boys who were bothering you wont dare to come close now! Hahaha!\"\nSHARELLE!",

So the boys who chased her around were in a state of panic.\nWhat are you gonna do about today? Arent you going to go meet Shirone? Hm? Hmm?\nDont know. We both agreed to focus on studying for the time being.\nThere was a hint of disappointment in Amys tone.\nI know were only fake dating, but even so, how can he be so indifferent?\nHer pride was hurt by Shirone's stone-cold attitude. It was no princess syndrome, but whenever Amy looked in the mirror, she herself thought her appearance was enough to turn heads. But Shirone seemed to have zero interest, seemingly because of his concentration on studies. Even if it was only a pretend relationship, they were definitely an official couple in the eyes of most.\nShouldnt he be at least a\nlittle\nconscious?\n\"I don't know and I dont care either. I have a pile of work to do. I dont have time to get distracted.\n\"You're disappointed, aren't you? Well if you are, I wouldnt be surprised. I also think Shirone is being too harsh. How could he leave such a pretty girlfriend unattended? I'd stick together around all day if I were him. Oho! Maybe that part was what cracked the iron-hearted Amys heart?\n\"Sharelle...\"\nWhen she saw Amy's eyes burning red, Sharelle shook around her hand and released cold sweat.\n\"Haha Okay, okay! Ill stop!\nAmy let out her anger with a snort. In a sense, Shirone was well aware of the situation. If he was distracted by something he shouldnt be distracted by, it wouldnt be worth it for her to keep up their relationship, even if it did chase away the boys.\n\"Oh! Amy, isn't that Jake over there?\"\nJake was coming down a hill. He had bandages all over his face and was carrying a large backpack on his shoulder.\nThe disciplinary committee had decided to put those part of Black Magician on probation for two years. With a condition that they ask for forgiveness from the students who dropped out, but anyone could tell there was an unusual leniency.\n\"Hey! Long time no see, Amy.\"\nJake's face was bright, unfitting for someone who was essentially getting kicked out for two years.\n\"You still haven't left? Gosh, so clingy.\n\"Kekeke! Ive done so many bad things that there are a lot of places I need to pass by.\"\n\"That doesnt suit you. Did you change? Hah, no way. How can a person's personality change so easily?\n\"Thats true. But there are people who trust a wastrel like me, so now I can't do anything bad anymore.\"\nIt was known among students that Siena struggled with the committee to lower Jake's disciplinary penalty. If it weren't for her, Black Magician wouldn't have been able to avoid expulsion from the academy.\n\"By the way, what are you going to do now? Taking two years off will make you have to drop your classes.\n\"Ill have to beg for forgiveness from the kids who dropped out. They probably won't forgive me, but I'm prepared. And in any case, wont something come to mind after I try and put everything back to how it was before?\"\nAmy didnt think it would be easy. Most of the kids who were tormented by Jake were first-class nobles and suffered from injuries that could not be healed, so the possibility of Jake getting beaten to death was not completely out of the question.\nHowever, the one who knew this better than anyone else was Jake himself, and yet instead of being afraid, he was rather relaxed.\n\"I've got to go. You'll be graduating by the time I get back. I don't know when the opportunity will come, but when that time comes, I will do my best. Take care. I wish you the best with your relationship.\"\nAs Jake turned around with a wave of his hand, Amy responded with an awkward smile. Even Jake, the person involved in the case, found it absurd when he thought back to how Amy was dating Shirone.\nDespite what happened, seeing him being sent off in this shabby way left a bit of a bitter taste in Amys mouth as a fellow student. She thought for a moment as she remembered something. She called out to Jake.\n\"Hey, Jake!\"\nHe looked back.\n\"Two years will go by real quick! Don't give up!\"\n\"Haha! Call me whenever you need my help. At the very least, I can help by lending you as much money as you need!\"\n\"Two years... Yeah, it's probably nothing. Itll go by quick.\"\nAmy thought as she looked at Jakes figure growing smaller and smaller in the distance. He would not be able to go to school for at least two years. But was that really something to cry about? After all, if one didnt have the skills, one would rot in the same place for the rest of their life, anyways. That was the world of magic.\n\"Sharelle, I've made up my mind.\"\n\"Hm? Are you going to see Shirone?\"\n\"I'm going to apply for promotion to the Advanced class.\"\n\"What? Already? Arent you being too hasty?\"\nUpon entering Class 4, you were automatically eligible to apply for the Advanced Class. However, if you were to fail the promotion exam, you would not be able to apply again that year, so the battle of nerves had been fierce since the beginning of the semester.\nNot to mention, graduation was a long way off, even if you were to pass the promotion exam. This was because only the best talents could enter the Advanced Class out of the whole magic academy where many geniuses were gathered.\nAccording to graduates of the magic academy, the Advanced Class was a battlefield far more fierce than the one in society. It was a place where only 30 prospective mages competed for survival, having to put aside their friendship for the time being.\nSome criticized this system of infinite competition, but considering the specificity of the job as a mage, it was inevitable.\nThe Alpheas Magic Academy was a state-designated institution, meaning if you graduated, youd receive a non-certified license, which meant you were recognized as an official mage. Essentially, as long as you graduated, you were given instant power.\nIn the worst-case scenario, the students would have to fight for their lives on a battlefield once they graduated, so instructors shared the common opinion that strict standards had to be imposed on the Advanced Class students.\n\"Why don't you wait a little bit? The garden is still empty, and it wont be too late to apply after analyzing the level of the Advanced class and its trends, right?\n\"No, I don't want to dwell on it. I just want to keep moving forward right now.\"\nKnowing how stubborn Amy could get, Sharelle knew she couldnt stop her. On the other hand, she was also looking forward to how far her genius would get her in the Advanced Class.\n\"Alright, I'll cheer you on. You can do it.\n\"Thanks. I'll be heading up first to see what the atmosphere is like.\"\nHehe, I'm actually a little nervous, so I'm thinking of collecting some information first. Anyway, let's both work hard.\"\n\"Yes, I'll help you, too.\nAmy looked up at the blue sky with a light heart.\nDreams were as far away as the sun. However, dreams were also a guiding light, a beacon to those who needed something to cling to.\nI will definitely become the best mage.\n* * *\n* * *\nThe integrated class for the Intermediate class was back.\nWhile upperclassmen and lowerclassmen were going around interacting, no one approached Shirone.\nSometimes standing out too much was also a problem.\nSurprising the teachers during the entrance test, managing to showcase one of the Four Way Formations on his first try, crushing Black Magician, and becoming Amy's official lover.\nIn a short period of time, the marks left by Shirone were considerable. Nevertheless, since he belonged to Class 7, the lowest Intermediate class, the feelings of his classmates were inevitably complicated.\n\"Huh? There he is, Amy! Your boyfriend, Shirone!\"\nSharelle waved from afar. Shirone pushed his way through the crowd. Amy stood with her arms folded as if she were sulking.\n\"Hello, seniors.\"\n\"Hahaha! Whats up with the formalities? Its not like were strangers, and plus we're the same age anyways, so no need to be so polite. Talk casually.\nAmy continued sulking despite Sharelles matchmaking temperament. From some point on, going beyond his indifference, Amy felt like Shirone was avoiding her.\nShe wasnt trying to brag, but inside this academy, Amy Karmis was not someone who got turned down by anyone. So on the other hand, she thought a lot about how to deal with Shirone if he did approach her seriously.\nBut what was Shirone doing? He drew a line as if they couldnt even be simple friends at all. Aside from their occasional business-like conversations, he paid her no mind.\n\"Haha! But even so, I would have to refuse. You guys are still my upperclassmen.\"\nAmy almost threw a punch at Shirone due to his impassive response. but she firmly held it in. If she got angry here, it was like acknowledging that she was unattractive.\n\"Just speak comfortably when we're alone. And it's funny if you speak formally even though you guys are dating.\"\nAt Amy's trembling voice, Sharelle recognized the power of love. Amy was empty without her pride, but she still calmed herself in order to earn Shirones favor. Normally, this would not have been possible.\n\"No, its okay. I'll get going. I have class to attend.\"\nAs Shirone returned to his previous seat, Amy was on the verge of crying out in anger and shame.\n\"Whatever! Do whatever you want! If you hate this so much, don't do it!\"\nSharelle chased after Amy. Even from her perspective, she thought Shirone was acting quite strange lately.\n\"Amy, did you have a fight with Shirone?\n\"I don't know! I don't care anymore! Hes so full of himself!\"\nShirone returned to Class 7, holding back his feelings of guilt and regret. Amy was a good person. However, being close to the queen of Class 4 brought too many troubles.\nPR/N: Amy? A good person? Now, maybe. A good person for you? Cap. #ReinaSupremacy\nAs Shirone sat down, his classmates began to murmur amongst themselves.\n\"Yeah, yeah. He thinks hes the best. Does he want to show off that much?\"\n\"Dating during class? Really? He doesnt even know his ass for his elbow. Did he come to this academy depending only on that face of his?\nTheir jealousy was up to their eyebrows. It was much worse than Shirone had expected.\nThe average age of Class 7 students was 15. It was only slightly younger than Shirones age, but one year was still enough to create a huge gap. In this age group, immature happenings often occurred.\nThe kids disliked the fact that the new freshy who just entered the academy was chosen by Amy, the top student of the Intermediate class. And with mob mentality at its fullest, even female students were now gossiping about Shirone.\n\"Gosh, there must be something wrong with my eyes. Isnt he actually a total player? All he does is date and not study. Thats why he is still unable to cast single spell.\"\nShirone decided to stay away from Amy. If not, shed be the one to receive a fatal blow in terms of image.\nIt would be a lie if he said he wasnt offended by the numerous criticisms. Though recently, the degree of their accusations had gotten worse, so he was slowly getting irritated.\nBut whenever that happened, he stomped those feelings down, recalling Temuran's advice, he grit his teeth and manned up. His job right now was to rise through the ranks as quickly as possible.\n\"From today onwards, I will reduce the amount of theory and focus on training. Practice the Four Way Formation you specialize in for an hour. And for the rest of the time, practice pattern changes.\"\nUnder the instruction of Ethella, students began to gather to train their Four Way Formation, but Shirone couldn't mingle with them.\nIn the early days, he inadvertently displayed his Spirit Zone and suffered a setback. The students avoided Shirone's Spirit Zone, which was transmitted through synesthesia, as if it were a bag of filth.\nShirone moved to a secluded place. Since he had the largest Spirit Zone in Class 7, this was the only way for him to train comfortably.\nShirone, who trained the Defense Form for an hour, practiced the remaining three formations. While they were not as good as his Defense Form, his Attack Form was quite good, while he found the Target Form quite difficult to manage.\nHis biggest problem was with the Deviate Form. Not to mention its difficulty, he couldn't even imitate it.\n'It's really tricky. What in the world do I have to do to get my Spirit Zone to deviate?\nShirone tried to deviate the Spirit Zone to the right, but the shape got all distorted. It was not an exaggeration to say that there were only a handful of higher-class students who were able to use the Deviate Form.\nCenter. The key is to move the center.\nShirone corrected his mistake and tried again. The center slowly moved while the shape of the Spirit Zone was fixed.\nHe felt woozy.\nIs this what it feels like when the soul leaves the body?\nShirones consciousness became distant and numb. He felt disoriented. Then right before his Spirit Zone was about to deviate, it burst like a bubble.\n\"Phew!\"\nThe only thoughts going through his head were that Deviate Form was too difficult for the current him. For ones mind to take off somewhere was not a natural phenomenon, so he had to approach it very carefully.\nRather, should I move the center first? No, the first method is right. If the shape is not perfect, the center won't move.\nAs Shirone struggled, Ethella came up to him personally.\n\"Hows it going, Shirone?\n\"Deviate Form is difficult. It's not easy to move the center.\"\n\"Thats normal. It's usually quite a challenge for convergent types. The Four Way Formation is a natural phenomenon Except for the Deviate Form, which is an unnatural phenomenon. By the way, what about the other formations?\"\nEthella did not have high expectations for Shirone to succeed in the Deviate Form. What she was looking forward to was Shirones natural insight, not computational competence.\n\"Mmm, as for the rest I don't think there are any issues.\"\nShirone answered honestly. He was becoming proficient in the Four Way Formation to the extent that he was satisfied with his own progress.",

      "content": "Chapter 29\nEthella was lost in thought, fiddling with her lips.\n\"Then would you like to try it out in the Image Zone?\"\n\"Yes? But Right now?\"\n\"Why? Are you feeling unwell?\"\n\"No, it's not that.\"\nEthella blinked, puzzled. The ambitious student who couldnt contain his excitement in regards to the Image Zone had turned passive.\nWhat's going on? He doesn't look very happy. The kids seem to be keeping him in check, is that why? Hes more sensitive than I thought.\nEthella said while patting his shoulder.\n\"If youre not feeling well, you can always do it next time. I was simply curious and wanted to see because you're the only one who can change between the Four Way Formation in Class 7.\"\n\"No, I'll give it a go. Please assess me.\"\nShirone changed his mind. Even if his classmates went around criticizing him, he would not give up the opportunity to receive Ethella's guidance for just that reason alone.\nAbusive remarks started to fly around the moment Shirone entered the Image Zone.\n\"Huh, look at him go. He must be thinking of doing it again. He just loves to stand out, doesnt he?\"\n\"He wants to show off to his lover. Well, its true that that's the only thing he's good at. The dude cant even cast a single spell.\"\nOn the other hand, upperclassmen stopped whatever they were practicing and turned to focus on him. A month had passed since the successful demonstration of the Defense Form of the Four Way Formation, so they were curious to see how much he had grown since then.\n\"Ms. Romie, Ill begin.\n\"Alright. First, let's do it one by one.\nShirone started off with what he was best at, the Defense Form. A strong, huge Octacontaoctagon was formed.\nThe upperclassmen were awed.\n\"When speaking in regards to your Defense Form alone, it's high-class.\nOn the other hand, the Class 7 students glared at Shirone as if they were dealing with a public enemy. Nevertheless, the reason why they couldn't complain was because his skills were actually really great.\nShirone shifted to the Attack Form of the Four Way Formation. Instead of the size of his zone being reduced, it stayed the same with the only difference being numerous, dangerous-looking thorns emerging.\nNext was the Target Form. The length of the cross was considerable, but its torque was too weak to use in practice. Nevertheless, Shirone was making rapid progress.\nEthella smiled in satisfaction. It was safe to say that Shirone would soon probably be promoted to Class 6 considering his skills.\nBut Shirone didn't stop there and attempted the Deviate Form. It was also important to fail so that he could get advice from Ethella while she was here.\nThen he hit a wall. The shape of the Spirit Zone might change, and even if the center was shifted, the Zone often exploded instead of just successfully deviating.\nEthella's eyes lit up in astonishment. She didn't expect him to attempt the Deviate Form as it did not fit his convergent tendencies. But surprisingly, things were going roughly, which was to be expected.\nSeeing this, each of the Class 7 kids, who had no intention of even trying to aim for the Deviate Form, breathed out a sigh of relief.\n\"Kekeke, what the hell is he doing? How is that the Four Way Formation? Hes just horsing around.\"\n\"They said he was a genius, but hes nothing close to one. He should be doing at least one thing well. How the hell is he going to become a mage doing things like that.\"\nShirone was offended. Not a single person from Class 7 could pull off the Deviate Form. He couldn't understand their way of thinking at all, especially considering the fact that they placed standards on him that even they couldnt reach.\nHis Spirit Zone shook when he lost his composure. The more it shook, the more the Class 7 kids continued to gossip and bring Shirone down.\nAmy, who was watching, frowned. So far, she was satisfied with his demonstration of changing between the different forms of the Four Way Formation, but suddenly his Zone started shaking.\n\"What the hell's wrong with him? What is he doing?\n\"Deviate Form is usually hard to control. I guess hes bothered too much by the reactions of the kids.\"\n\"No way. Hes never that shaky. Is he really going through something these days?\"\n\"Oh, are you covering for him? Well, I guess he\nis\nyour boyfriend.\nAmy shut Sharelles mouth with her red eyes and got lost in thought. It was certainly strange. Where did the Anti-Magic-resistant durability go? How come his Spirit Zone was stumbling around like it was drunk?\nIs there really something going on that I don't know about?\nShirone tried everything to suppress his emotions. However, anger was not easy to control because once it bloomed, it grew by consuming itself.\nWhy do they hate me? What did I do wrong? I just want to study hard and do better. What's wrong with wanting to be a mage?\nHis Spirit Zone began to convulse as if it was about to explode. His mind was all over the place.\n\"Hey, you have too many miscellaneous thoughts.\nShirone broke out from his thoughts. Someone from Class 5 side spoke.\n\"If you want to do something, just do it. You're here to learn magic.\nShirone finally looked back on his condition with impassiveness. When he came to his senses, he realized how foolish he was being.\nWhat was I doing?\nShirone, who erased all distractions, attempted once again.\nIts okay to fail. The important thing is to learn from it and grow.\nA Zone with a 40-meter diameter slowly began to deviate from the center. As the center moved away, the diameter decreased exponentially.\nWould it deviate first or get extinguished first?\nAll the Intermediate class students stared at the scene.\nBy the time the size of the Zone was reduced to two meters in diameter, the surface of the Spirit Zone had been completely pulled off from Shirones body.\nThe shock that the Class 7 students were in was indescribable. Even upperclassmen in the Intermediate class found it difficult to succeed, so it was natural for them to be in a daze.\nThe Spirit Zone began to hover around Shirone. Every moment, new information entered his mind. He felt like his head was about to explode due to the huge amount of information pouring in. When he opened his eyes, the Spirit Zone burst and disappeared.\n\"Hah Hah.\"\nHe was out of breath, even though he didn't do anything physically taxing.\n\"I did it. I really succeeded in the form I made it work.\"\nThe upper-level classes began to stir.\nIt was an achievement that was incomparable to the success of a Defense Form. Not one person in Class 7 nor Class 6 succeeded in the form.\nSharelle shook Amy's arm and made a fuss.\n\"Amy, Shirone did it! He really did it.\"\nAmy was smiling, too. Regardless of her emotions, in terms of being a colleague reaching for the same dream, he had talent worthy of her respect.\nHis growth rate is monstrous. Its insanely fast. If a month was enough to achieve the Deviate Form, I'm sure\nHes a talent equal to me Or even greater.\nAmy was a little upset. Perhaps Shirone trained his mind without wasting even a single day. But what about her? She had gone around the back alley, doing stupid and morally-disgusting things.\nWhy did I Waste my precious time doing such things?\nShirone, who succeeded the Deviate Form, looked around for the person who gave him a piece of advice and turned his head toward Class 5. However, he could not figure it out through voice alone since he didn't have a chance to talk to the upperclassmen.\nI just wanted to say thank you\nEthella was absorbed in thought as she looked at Shirone, who was being applauded by nearly everyone. Everyone was influenced by Shirone's growth. She came up with a way to give rise to the atmosphere of the class a bit more.\n\"Hmm, you came earlier than I expected.\"\n* * *\n* * *\nRecently, Shirone had one concern no one knew about. It was that he did not know how to use any magic.\nThe knowledge needed for magic was not easy enough for lower-level class children to simply obtain. Therefore, even in school, fully-fledged magic practice was conducted starting Class 5.\nBut in reality, that wasnt true either. The nobles were educated from birth, so even lower-leveled students knew how to use at least two types of magic. On the other hand, Shirone studied only for a year and a half with the Ogent family.\nShirones dilemma was this.\nIf you concentrate on one subject, you may be able to use simple magic.\nThe problem was He felt like he would never be able to overcome students who had been taught since childhood.\nSo the strategy he came up with was to study all the disciplines at once.\nAs a result, the number of books he started to borrow increased, and these days, he pretty much lived in the library.\nThe students laughed at Shirone. They thought it was foolish to study so much in the library considering he wouldnt be able to keep up with his classes.\nBut Shirone did not falter. He had the Core of Knowledge, so any discipline or type of knowledge could be arranged in chronological order. In other words, this meant that the probability of forgetting the content was significantly reduced.\nThe immediate results may be minimal, but I must keep this up for a minimum of two years If it is possible to study for two years in this state, all the main points in each field will start to connect.\nThis was the framework of knowledge. An entire encyclopedia in his head that he could reach out to at any time.\nAfter turning over a new lead, Shirone focused back on the book. It was well past midnight when he came to his senses. The only person left in the library was a girl from Class 6.\nWhen Shirone nodded to her as she packed her bag, she also nodded back with a shy smile.\nIt was two in the morning when he left the library.\nHowever, even if he went to bed now, he would only be able to sleep for about 4 hours. Whenever he thought about how behind he was in comparison to the nobility, he felt that sleep was a waste of time.\nWhenever he had those kinds of thoughts, Shirone recalled a book he once read called \"The Great Scholars' Dialogue.\"\nAmong them, he found the interview of a biologist named Torkcholin most impressive. He, who claimed that a person must get more than six hours of sleep, joked at the end of the interview like this.\nOf course, I only slept four hours during my student years.\nAnd the author of the book asked.\nThen, arent your claims incorrect?\nTorkcholins answer was:\nHaha! Those who are in their teens are not humans. They are superhumans. Whether they sleep or not, it would not affect them in any way.\nThose words uplifted Shirone who was always pressed for time.\nYeah! Lets work hard. If I do my best, results will follow naturally.\nThe lights in the Advanced class building were on. The lights from the window flickered as if someone was conducting a magic experiment until late at night. What new magic was being created there?\nShirones eyes were already on the Advanced class.\n* * *\nAt the end of lunchtime, Ethella went to see Siena. They were the same age at 26, and they had already worked together for four years, but they still remained formal with each other.\n\"Ms. Siena, can you spare me some time?\"\n\"Yes, but I don't think I can talk for too long because I have a class to teach in Class 7 soon.\"\nIt was common to easily exceed an hour while discussing things related to magic, so Siena asked for understanding in advance.\n\"Oh, I see. I have something to discuss with you about Shirone.\"\nSiena showed interest at the mention of Shirone. Unlike in her class where he laid low, she heard that in practical training led by Ethella, he stood out like a sore thumb.\n\"How is he these days? Looking at his practice score, it seems like hes doing quite well.\"\n\"He certainly is. Last time, he succeeded in performing the Deviate Form of the Four Way Formation.\"\n\"Oho, I see.\nSiena smiled with satisfaction. As an instructor in charge of Shirone, it was a pleasure to hear him being praised by other instructors.\n\"So I'd like to make a suggestion, Ms. Siena.\n\"Yes? A suggestion?\"\nIt was quite rare for Ethella herself to give suggestions to another instructor, especially in regards to a student. So as much as that was a rare occurrence, Siena thought it to be an exceptional suggestion.\n* * *\nChemical theories filled up the blackboard in Class 7. The students taking notes were busy trying to write everything down. They felt like the class was going really fast, especially today. As expected, Siena, who finished the class about 10 minutes early, came down from the platform.\n\"That's it for today. Instead, I have something to announce.\"\nThe students were very compliant. The students were willing to eat rice seeds if it meant ending a class early.\n\"Early promotion has been decided. Shirone Arian, please stand up.\"\nShirone was pleasantly surprised at the very sudden and very unexpected early promotion. His classmates, on the other hand, looked displeased. Early promotion was not uncommon. However, the problem was that the person getting promoted was Shirone.\n\"Shirone, you will be promoted to Class 5. Please make sure to check and follow your new schedule starting tomorrow. I hope the rest of you will also work harder to earn the same opportunity. That is all. Class dismissed.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 30\nThe class became noisy. Class 5? It wasn't just an early promotion, it was a ticket to the 2nd-highest floor. This was an unconventional decision not only for students but for the school as well.\n\"Teacher, I object! How can Shirone jump two classes? He can't even use any magic.\nThis was the first time Siena heard of such a thing. Ethella had also never mentioned it, but maybe she didnt know either. After all, one never really used magic in the lower-level classes.\n\"Is that true, Shirone?\"\nHis classmates looked back at Shirone. Their eyes seemed to be saying:\nPlease just say you can't. Say you can't.\n\"Yes, there's no magic I can use yet.\"\n\"Hmm\"\nEven so, there was no problem with early promotion. Magic was taught in earnest starting from class 5, and the curriculum of the lower class focused on strengthening the Spirit Zone.\nShirone had mastered the basics of the Four Way Formation, and the size and durability of his Spirit Zone were not inferior to those of the upper-leveled class. Therefore, in determining the exact class, five was quite appropriate.\nBut it was indeed quite unusual that he still couldnt use magic. If you were a student, you were bound to try and use magic secretly. After all, the only reason one would ever come to the academy would be to learn magic.\n\"I, too, find it a bit questionable. However, there is no magic evaluation until Class 6. Shirone's early promotion will progress as originally planned.\"\n\"I can't allow this!\"\nMark, the implicit leader of Class 7, jumped to his feet. He was a student with a large square jaw to match his big size.\n\"How can you show such favoritism? Please, provide us a reason why. You said omniscience is just as important as omnipotence! I do not and cannot understand the special treatment given to Shirone!\"\n\"That's right! To be honest, even if I compete with him in terms of grades and achievements right at this moment, I'm confident that I'll win! He can't even keep up with the theory class!\"\n\"If you promote Shirone early, I will present this situation to the student council and hold a hearing!\"\nThe students' protest was much stronger than expected. Even though they were young, they were all children who pushed through competition from Class 10. Siena had expected them to be spurred on by this happening, but they were burning with hostility as if facing an arch-nemesis.\nThere's something I don't know.\nSiena realized that the situation had turned pretty serious considering the look of the students faces who were set on fighting as if this was a war. If their resistance was this strong, it could adversely affect the class atmosphere, opposite to how she had originally hoped it would.\n\"This hasn't been officially decided yet. Accurate notices will be announced after an instructor meeting. I will wrap up today's class here.\"\n* * *\nSiena, who returned to the instructors office, placed her chin on her hand and fell deep in thought.\nCompetition was inevitable due to the nature of this specialized academy. Also, the students were aware of this fact and voluntarily enrolled in the academy.\nWhat was it? Those strange looks in the students eyes?\nIt wasn't simple jealousy. Early promotion had been around for a long time, but it was the first time that there was such a strong backlash to someone receiving it.\n\"Excuse me, Ms. Siena.\"\nA female student named Maria came to see Siena.\nShe was the oldest in Class 7, at 19 years of age. She has not been promoted for four years and has been drifting in place.\nShe was not lacking in talent at all, but because she had a timid and fearful personality, the academy pitied her, as they knew the atmosphere in the academy was not one that welcomed someone like her.\n\"Yes? What's the matter, Maria?\"\n\"Um I have something to tell you.\"\nMaria, who was hesitant for a long time, confessed everything. What kind of treatment Shirone was currently facing in class, and why the children were so angry at the announcement a while ago.\nAs the story progressed further, Siena's frown deepened more and more. They were tormenting Shirone with a method that was too foul to be considered a simple emotional quarrel.\nAs if they planned to do so, whenever they encountered Shirone, they would pretend to vomit, and there were many cases where they intentionally flocked around Shirone and talked among themselves.\nMaria ended the story in tears.\n\"I'm not really affected by it now now, but looking back, I was treated like that once too, at least to a degree. At that time, I didnt care about studying or anything. Honestly, I think Shirone is amazing. How can he be calm in such a situation?\"\nSiena grasped the full extent of the situation. One student was being ostracized by a group. Without fair competition, There was no reason for this academy to exist.\n\"Alright, thank you for telling me. I'll take care of it from here.\"\n* * *\nShirone arrived at the dormitory around midnight. The bullying got worse ever since the early promotion was mentioned, so he found it better to just return early and read a book.\nKnock, knock.\nSomeone knocked on the door. When he checked the time, it was already past 1 a.m.\nWho is it at this hour?\nIt was a time when students were unable to go out and for employees to leave work. Could it be that the kids came all this way to bully him?\nHe couldn't easily approach the door because anxiety left him stunned, but he heard a familiar voice from the other side of the door.\n* * *\n* * *\n\"Shirone, are you sleeping?\n\"Ms. Siena?\"\nShirone hurriedly opened the door. It was really Ms. Siena.\n\"Can I come in?\n\"Oh, yes. Come in.\"\nWas Ms. Siena on watch today? Her hair was still a bit wet as if she had recently come out from the shower.\nThe Intermediate class dormitory was not a place for female instructors to come and go at night, as students in their early 20s also resided here. However, Siena chose this time to interview him secretly away from his classmates.\nUnlike the rooms of other male students, Shirones was very tidy and organized. Guessing from Shirone's personality, she checked each book on the desk. There were textbooks as well as books on subjects that he had yet to learn.\nSo its true. His thought process is extraordinary.\nWithout observing closely, one would think the books were spread open with no relation whatsoever, but if someone knowledgeable saw this, they would notice that all of them were very closely related fields.\nSiena could roughly assume the reason why Shirone could not use magic yet. It was not because he couldn't, but because he didnt want to start yet.\nHe was weak in omniscience from the moment he entered the academy. He is desperately looking for ways to make up for his shortcomings. This kid doesn't want to just learn magic He wants to become a mage.\nSiena supported Shirones decision. The process of linking and finding the relationship between different fields was difficult, but it was a worthwhile one. This was because linked knowledge was never forgotten.\n\"Excuse me, teacher. Would you like a cup of tea?\"\n\"No, it's all right. I came here because I wanted to ask you something.\"\nAs Siena sat on the bed, Shirone dragged over a desk chair. It was his first time seeing her face up so close. She looked much younger than during academy hours, perhaps because she had her hair down and was in plain clothes now. He lowered his head gently, feeling embarrassed for some reason.\nSiena looked at him calmly.\nHes quite the shy boy. Is this his usual personality?\nHis reaction was very unfamiliar to her because in class, Shirone would stare and focus so intensely at either the board or her that it seemed like he was trying to burn a hole with just his eyes.\n\"Isn't academy life difficult?\n\"Yes, but it's fun. And I find it enjoyable to study.\"\n\"...Why didn't you tell me that the kids were bothering you?\"\nShirone had already anticipated shed ask that. In fact, it would have been stranger not to know. Due to recent events, the kids started to bully Shirone quite openly.\n\"It's okay, you don't have to worry about it.\nSiena, who heard of the students abusive actions from Maria, didn't believe what Shirone said.\n\"You can be honest about this. It's nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed by.\"\n\"It's really okay. Its a pity that I cant make friends, but if they find me unlikeable, I cant really do anything about it.\"\n\"The bullying is whats wrong.\"\n\"Well, how people think of me and the emotions that come with it isnt something I can just change on a whim. Of course, it was hard at first, but now Im okay. I can't help it if the kids of Class 7 don't like me. But that doesn't mean I'm hated by everyone in the world.\"\nSiena could understand. For some, the group they belonged to was everything to them, but to those looking up, such a group was no more than a stopover.\n\"I want to meet more people. And I believe there is someone out there who will listen to me more seriously.\"\nShirone had an apparent attitude towards early promotion. If Ethella thought that he should be placed in Class 5 at the very least, then there was already someone who accepted Shirone without feeling inferior.\n\"Shirone, I certainly sense your determination. I'll make mention of this at the instructors meeting.\"\n* * *\n\"And with this, we conclude the presentation of our discovery regarding Shirone's early promotion.\"\nWith headmaster Alpheas and the Intermediate class instructors in attendance, Siena submitted the documents relating to the case of Class 7 bullying and sat down.\nThe teachers who read the contents frowned. The circumstances in which Shirone was being persistently ostracized under the pretext of not being able to use magic were being revealed one after another, in detail.\n\"Does this even make sense?\nThis\nis why they would bully a kid in their class? How Disappointing.\"\n\"It's quite possible in the lower-level classes. There are many young children, and there are also students who have thick hair, but stay behind because they have no talent. After all, theyre only kids, and kids often lack the wisdom to make the right choices.\n\"Then we'd better promote Shirone quickly. That child will be able to graduate in at least 4 years. Now that nearby academies are challenging the Alpheas Magic Academy, the more early graduates, the better.\"\nThe age of graduates was also part of the data that proved the excellence of a specific academy. If an academy didn't perform well enough to help students graduate in a timely manner, their credibility, along with the students, would decrease.\nThere are rumors flying around that the other academies are now stepping up in order to produce early graduates\nIt was a standard method used to elevate a normal academy to a prestigious one. After all, once that prestige was won, outstanding talents would gather, and then the quality of the class would also improve naturally.\nIn the face of severe checks from other academies, the solution the Alpheas Magic Academy came up with was to educate and focus on students with excellent quality in order to help them graduate earlier through the early promotion system. In that sense, the instructors had high expectations for Shirone.\n\"I, on the other hand, disapprove of this.\"\nThadd raised his hand and voted against it. And automatically, Sienas face wrinkled. At this time, considering the fact that early promotion had become a standardized reality, she was annoyed to death at seeing Thadd, once again, picking a fight. However, Alhpeas expressed interest in the first different opinion.\n\"Against it? Why is that?\"\n\"I know that Shirone is talented, extremely talented, but the whole point of this case is focused on Shirones inability to use magic. That's where the resistance of the children comes from. Shouldn't we be talking about that?\"\nSiena spoke.\n\"I've already mentioned this, but sure, Ill say it again. Hes not in a position where he can devote himself to one discipline. Instead, hes focused on mastering all aspects of knowledge. Personally, I also think that this is the optimal way for Shirone to grow.\"\n\"I'm not questioning that choice, the problem is that Ms. Siena favors him too much.\"\n\" What did you just say?\"\n\"Anyway, the Class 7 children also attend the academy and they also study hard. I mean, the problem of Shirone not having enough time to acquire knowledge is not something we have control over. Most of the students who come to this academy prepare extensively beforehand because they know its gonna be hard. Thats why I dont think its fair that Shirone gets a special pass in regards to the assessment because he didnt have enough time. If not, why cant other students be promoted early? Even if their Spirit Zone is weaker than Shirones, in theory, they have the upper hand.\"\n\"Stop pettifogging! Im not judging this case emotionally. It's a conclusion based on pure academy regulations. The main thing that is truly evaluated in the lower-leveled classes is the Spirit Zone.\"\n\"The problem is the students' opposition. This incident may motivate them less. Are we instructors supposed to just bet everything on one genius, forgoing the other\nless\ngenius students?\"\n\"Well, its also not our job to just neglect those who are talented because of the misguided jealousy of other students!\"\nThe two stood up, slamming their hands on the table at the same time. This was a common sight to see every time there was a meeting held.",

      "content": "Chapter 31\nOlder instructors possessed looks of disapproval at the relentless debate. Nevertheless, the reason they remained silent was because the rank of the two that were arguing was higher.\nSiena and Thadd were both active as certified Grade 6 mages while only being in their mid-20s. Not to mention Ethella, who was also the pride of the Alpheas Magic Academy.\nThe argument showed no sign of abating. Ethella tried to intervene, but no side yielded.\nAlpheas was just smiling. If you didnt have a passion to teach, it was impossible to fight like that.\nThadd wanted the development of his alma mater, while Siena wanted the growth of her students. If one was an instructor, they would have to side with Siena, but it wasn't that they couldnt understand Thadds side as well.\n\"Ive heard both of your opinions well. I understand your positions, so let's stop and take a seat.\"\nAs soon as Alpheas' words fell from his mouth, Siena and Thadd listened and stopped arguing like two obedient puppies. The only thing they had in common would be their respect for Alpheas.\n\"I find both sides' arguments and points to be valid. Ms. Sienas words are logical, but we're also instructors. Shouldn't we avoid prejudice and favoritism?\n\"That's exactly what I'm saying, headmaster.\"\nThadd laughed and Sina was expressionless But Alpheas wasnt done. After carefully devising something, he revealed his idea with a big smile.\n\"That is why we should How about it?\"\n* * *\nA single official notice was pinned on the bulletin board of the Intermediate class building.\nDozens of students gathered in front of the bulletin board and were shocked at the contents of the official notice.\nThis was the first time in the history of the Alpheas Magic Academy that a promotion was open to a whole class. In this case, Class 7.\nThe main gist of the notice was this.\nWe are providing an early promotion opportunity for all of Class 7. We will only pick one person who is eligible for promotion and the moment they pass the exam, they will be promoted to Class 5. As we fully acknowledge the students concerns, this evaluation will be graded in terms of magic and not Spirit Zone.\nThe subject of evaluation is teleportation.\n\"T-Teleportation? I don't know how to do it. Can you do it?\"\n\"No, of course I can't. It's an official Class 5 designated magic.\n\"I've done it once. But it was so scary that I dont dare to try again.\n\"You stupid! It's easy if you follow the original formula. The problem is that its just so difficult to apply.\"\nThe noisy children suddenly died down. Shirone was walking their way. Arriving at the bulletin board whilst under many different stares, he read the official notice. This was the conclusion reached by the instructors.\nTeleportation.\nShirone engraved the word and concept in his mind.\n* * *\nThe so-called Class 7 bullying incident interested the upperclassmen. In particular, because the target was Shirone, there was a lot of talk due to that fact.\n\"Oh my God! Something like that happened? Amy, did you know?\nAmy, who only checked the bulletin board at the end of the day, read the official notice and frowned. When Sharelle informed her of the specifics of the rumors, her knuckles turned white.\nYou were being bullied? Is it because of me too?\nAccording to Sharelle, some of her classmates dont even make eye contact when looking at Shirone. Moreover, there were some who even antagonized Amy during integrated classes.\n\"What do you think? I mean, they are kids from Class 7. Actually, I went through something similar, but since I was promoted quickly, nothing happened.\"\nBullying and Isolation are not things that can be excused just because one is young. If we start thinking that its okay, then shouldnt we be doing the same things? After all, were also young.\n\"We're in Class 4. Magic requires maturity and a lot of mental and emotional control, so age\ncant\nmatter.\nAmy didn't want to argue about this or that. In fact, she couldn't think of anything because her mind was a mess. Amy was just angry that Shirone was being tormented and was suffering.\n\"Stupid! Why didn't he tell me?\nIf he had been honest and discussed it with me, we could have come up with a better solution!\nShe was certain they would have. Popularity aside, she was still at the top of Class 4. And Shirone was dating her. Thinking about the possible things Shirone had to go through angered Amy. She was angry in fact that one could mistake her for the victim.\n\"I need to go see Shirone.\n\"Thats no problem, but what are you going to do?\"\n\"Well first, Im going to hit him once. Then Ill get all of Class 7 to assemble. I should be able to do at least that since were in a relationship.\n\"What? Are you crazy?!\"\n\"What do you mean? So you want me to sit still and do nothing? This happened because of me.\"\n\"Gosh, you really don't know men. Do you know why he didn't tell you? It's because it would hurt his pride. What do you think will happen if you go and assemble all of Class 7 hmm?\nAmy couldn't understand. The only reason he didnt even make eye contact with her was because he was scared of Class 7 children?\nIt was Amy whose pride was hurt by this incident.\n* * *\n* * *\n\"Men, you know, like to be recognized. Men live for pride and die for pride. But since hes getting bullied, do you think hed tell that to the girl he likes?\nThere was some truth in what Sharelle was saying, but that was only in the case of those who were in a really loving relationship. How could she know that Shirone and Amy were in a fake relationship?\nHe must be thinking that he stepped on poop because of me. That's why hes avoiding me.\nSharelle viewed the school's initiative positively.\n\"But isn't that a relief? If he passes the promotion exam, he will enter Class 5. They did really well in choosing teleportation as the subject of evaluation. All of the Class 7 students will need to learn from scratch.\nAmy's thoughts were different. There was a difference between having a broad understanding of the magic type and understanding the specific spell.\nAnd whats more. It was teleportation magic.\nWhen learning teleportation, the most important thing was to overcome fear. It was on a whole other level compared to flight magic in terms of speed and the perception of things during transit. Just knowing of the fact that you could teleport into something and lose your life was deterrent enough for many.\n\"Come to think of it, isn't this a very dangerous test? What are the teachers thinking?\"\n\"Im sure they will adjust the difficulty level appropriately. They could also just be testing the students' passion and bravery. More than half of Class 7 will probably take the test.\n\"What? That much even though theyve never been taught teleportation?\n\"The passing reward is being raised up to Class 5. And it's all about learning from scratch. If I were in their position, I would totally go for it.\nAmy couldn't get rid of the uncomfortable feeling. Perhaps the students who took the test would practice intensively with help from their seniors or a dedicated teacher. It was clear that the students who were planning to take the exam would practice intensively with the help of their upperclassmen or with their exclusive instructor.\nShirone, on the other hand, was not so lucky. Having an exclusive teacher was definitely out of the picture, and he did not even have any friends to ask for advice.\nAt this point, what if he doesnt succeed?\nAlthough Shirones talent was acknowledged, in the short run, the exam could never guarantee his passing.\n\"Right! Amy, why don't you help? Take this opportunity to make up with him.\"\n\"Hmph! He didnt even say a word about being bullied, you think hell accept my help? Im just going to keep pretending like I know nothing.\"\n\"Ugh, you guys are really something. If you like each other, just like each other. Whats the problem with you two?\n\"Mind your own business, this is our way of dating. Its not like I'm free anyway. The Advanced class promotion exam is just around the corner.\"\n\"Oh, right! I forgot about that. Sorry.\"\nNothing was more important to a student than promotion. No matter how smart Amy was, she couldn't afford to lose focus if she wanted to overcome the high barrier of being promoted to the Advanced class.\n\"Hell be fine on his own. If he cant do even that, he shouldnt be allowed to be called my lover.\"\nTurning away from the bulletin board, Amy continued to speak inwardly.\nEven if hes a fake one.\n* * *\nAround midnight.\nA masked figure infiltrated the garden of the men's dormitory. As they moved forward, no sound could be heard, not even the rustling of grass. When they checked that the light on the 7th floor of the building was on, they scratched their head in annoyance.\nI am NOT doing this because it bothers me. I'm only helping because I feel a sense of responsibility!\nAmy ground her teeth. Even though she tried to forget and move on, she couldn't concentrate on her studying because she was worried about Shirone.\n\"Yall better watch your backs! I'll make you all kneel and beg for forgiveness once Shirone passes!\"\nAmy climbed the wall to the 7th floor. If rumors spread that she had crossed the threshold of the men's dormitory at night, she would not be able to carry her head high anymore. But at the same time, her old playfulness went nowhere.\nHoho, since this is already happening, may as well surprise him enough to make his heart jump out of his ribcage.\nAmy did a forward roll as soon as she opened the window. The calculations were made upon her landing. She was going to subdue Shirone and throw him on the bed. Then twist his arm to the point that it would make him scream.\n\"Huh?\"\nBut Amy couldn't even take one step. Shirone stared at her with eyes that screamed surprise. And next to him was Ms. Siena, who was sitting on a chair.\n\"T-Teacher?\n\"Are you Amy?\nSiena adjusted her glasses and looked again. It was clear that the trespasser was Amy as she was the only student with red hair and thick, double-eyelid eyes.\nShe knew Amy was dating Shirone, but she thought that they were both focusing on their own goals. However, after she thought about it once more, and considering the current situation, she couldn't help but feel that what they were doing was absurd and deceitful.\n\"Do you guys meet like this all the time? Pretending you don't know each other during the day whilst secretly enjoying meetings at night?\n\"I-Its a misunderstanding! That is a huge misunderstanding!\"\nSiena hurriedly placed a finger over her mouth.\n\"Shh! The room over will hear.\"\nAmy covered her mouth and looked at the room next door. This was the mens dormitory. If rumors spread that a woman's voice was heard in Shirone's room, the first suspect would unconditionally be herself. Well, even if that happened, she had nothing to say.\n\"No, wait! Forget about me for a second, what brings you here? At this hour?\"\nCome to think of it, it was Ms. Siena who didn't fit in this situation the most. This was because there was no reason for a teacher to come in plain clothes at night.\n\"Please, do say. Why are you here at this hour?\nAmy's reasonable misunderstanding flushed Siena's cheeks. However, she quickly returned to her original state and spoke coldly.\n\"I'm here to give Shirone some advice about the promotion exam. I didnt think it would be good to stand out by showing everyone that Im helping him, so this is how I do it.\"\nIf the promotion test was the reason, then Amy had nothing to say. It was because she went for that same exact reason herself.\n\"Um Excuse me, senior.\"\nShirone, who prepared tea, held out a cup to Amy and spoke.\n\"First, heres a cup of tea\n\"Hmm\"\nAmy took the cup and savored the aroma. As a polite lowerclassman, he had the basic posture of welcoming a guest.\n\"...As if! This all happened because of you!\"\n\"S-Sorry!\"\nAs Shirone apologized, Amy was even more annoyed. Because of that nice temperament of his, he was currently being pushed around by those lowlives.\n\"Sit down for now. I want to finish what we were talking about.\nSiena offered a seat. Amy sat next to Shirone and quickly turned her body away from him. Because although she did come because she was worried, she was still angry with him.\n\"As you guys know, the evaluation will be on teleportation. The headmaster made the decision himself.\"\n\"The headmaster?\"\nAmy finally understood the situation. She thought it was a test that was not suitable for Class 7, but since it was the playful headmaster who decided it, that explained it all to her.\n\"Yes. To be honest, I don't understand his intentions either. Teleportation is a dangerous magic.\nAmy asked.\n\"The test will probably be done at 'The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed', right?\n\"Im not quite sure, but thats the only place I can think of.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 32\nThe Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was a bridge that connected two mountain peaks that were both about a thousand meters above sea level, the highest amongst the training grounds. The bridge was 700 meters long, and a torrent flowed down the valley.\n\"How come it's a bridge that cannot be crossed?\nAmy explained why.\n\"It's literally a bridge you cant cross. It's a training ground for teleportation practice. The level of difficulty ranges from 1 to 10, and I, despite being a Class 4, have to risk my life from level 8 or higher.\"\nSiena added.\n\"The promotion exam was adjusted to a difficulty level of 1. Currently, there are no obstacles. Since it's impossible for Class 7 children to even jump* 700 meters.\"\nPR/N: Another way of talking about teleportation in this context.\nAmy questioned.\n\"Huh? Then how are things going to work? Isn't the first person to arrive the one that gets promoted then?\"\n\"The student who leaps the furthest will be selected. It won't be too dangerous. There will be safety devices as well as teachers from the Advanced class overseeing things. The problem is the students. There are many cases where they collide with each other if their competitiveness gets a bit excessive.\"\nIn Amys opinion, that was the difficult part of the exam. But since it was a test for early promotion for those in Class 7, such a thing would probably not happen. But nevertheless, it was still Shirone who was most disadvantaged.\n\"How about this method? From the beginning, Shirone will go all out before anyone else does. Of course, it will take a lot of mental energy, but I'm sure Shirone can do it.\n\"I was thinking the same. That's why I'm going to be training Shirone from today onwards.\"\n\"What? Really? You will?\"\nAmy opened her eyes wide in bewilderment. A teacher of Ms. Sienas caliber being in charge of a particular student was frankly unfair to the other students. Knowing this, Amy was worried that if someone found out that Ms. Siena was teaching Shirone privately, strange rumors would appear.\n\"How come Ms. Siena is going so far to help Shirone?\"\n\"This incident is something Im responsible for. My original intention was to list Shirone under Class 5 from the start, but my proposal was rejected due to opposition from other teachers. If things had gone the way I planned, Shirone wouldnt have been bullied in the first place.\n\"But if some kind of a rumor spreads, the problem will grow. Im sure other students will also learn and study teleportation with help from others, but Shirones a special case. If word gets out that a teacher is in charge of handling Shirone, the students could complain that the test was rigged from the start. And this test is too good of an opportunity to risk that. Lets not do that, I'll be in charge of Shirone for the time being. I can teach him everything he needs to know if the level of difficulty is only 1.\"\nSiena shook her head.\n\"If I remember correctly, you recently applied for the Advanced Class promotion. Wouldn't it be better for you to focus on that? You dont have the time to worry about Shirone.\n\"Huh? Really?\"\nShirone asked, seemingly unable to believe it. Nobody applied for the promotion this early in the school year. And the fact that Amy would be the very first one to apply meant that she was going to have to tackle things blindly.\n'I see. That's amazing.\nShirone was grateful that she came to see him despite the fact she was most definitely busy preparing for the exam. However, the situation was now heading in a different direction from the nice, heartwarming atmosphere Shirone was expecting. The two women, whose prides were lit on fire, did not back down even a single step.\n\"No matter how busy I am, I can make time to help him with something as simple as teleportation, so I think you should be the one to back off on this one, teacher. Rather, such meddling could have a negative effect on Shirone.\"\n\"As a teacher who knows that this is a very important period for a student such as yourself, I cant just let things be. You can only apply for the Advanced Class exam once a year. Dont you think itd be better to leave things to the teacher and focus on the exam?\nBoth had smiles on their faces, but contrary to their lips, their eyes remained serious and their wills unbending. Realizing that they would not reach a consensus, they looked towards Shirone one last time.\n\"Shirone, you choose. Is it me or teacher? Of course, it would be better for your girlfriend to teach you.\"\n\"Yes, Shirone. You should decide. Wouldnt I be the better choice instead of a student who is about to take thier Advanced Class exam?\"\nDespite their friendly voices, Shirone felt a sort of veiled threat underneath the facade. However, Shirone was not swayed by their argument and confessed what he had originally thought of.\n\"I'll just do things myself. Thank you, but I don't need any help.\nThe women were speechless.\n\"Getting help from a teacher is against equality. But I also don't want to get help from an upperclassman who is about to take an important exam. I'll try my best to pass this exam on my own.\"\n\"You idiot! The other kids will, at the very least, take private lessons to pass! And everyone is keeping an eye on you! Keeping you in check! Im telling you, you are not at the level to try and do things on your own!\"\n\"I dont care.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I honestly admire the fact that you plan to take the Advanced Class exam blind. Frankly, I think its amazing. Its as if youre making a statement to those below you. That if you cant do it, then no one else will be able to do it either.\n\"Yes? That's That's true, but\n\"It's the same for me. I will do my best and pass. As your boyfriend, I will not bring shame to you.\"\nRealizing how strong Shirone's determination was, Amy could no longer object. But above all, she was grateful to him for acknowledging and respecting her decision.\n* * *\n* * *\n\"Humph. O-Of course you should.\"\nNo one was chosen by Shirone, but looking at the atmosphere, it was Amys victory this time.\nSiena stood up, adjusting her glasses.\nIf that's what the student wants, then this teacher will accept. But whenever youre stuck on something, dont be afraid to ask. All my students get to do that, so there is no fairness argument that can be found there.\"\n\"I will, thank you for your concern.\"\nAs Siena walked towards the door to leave, she said something to Amy.\n\"I have no choice but to let it slide this one time, but from now on, refrain from entering the males dormitory. If you get caught next time, you may get punished.\"\nAmy lowered her head, grateful for Ms. Siena. Even in her opinion, she could only say that she was very lucky today.\nWhen Siena left, an awkward silence came upon them.\nShirone, despite the calm facade he put forward, could not say one word as this was the first time he was in a room alone with a woman of his age.\nAmy was also swept away by the strange atmosphere. She came all this way with the intention of teaching him a lesson, but now she found herself fidgeting in front of Shirone.\n\"W-Well, then... I'll get going, too.\"\n\"Oh, yes! Thank you, you know, for worrying about me.\"\nAmy sighed with relief and prepared to head back. Then, as if something suddenly came to mind, she looked back at Shirone and shouted.\n\"You idiot! Why didn't you tell me? If that kind of thing happened, you should have discussed it with me.\"\n\"I'm sorry, but I didn't want to tell you.\"\n\"Because of pride? Thats stupid.\n\"Rather than that... Its because I didnt want to break up with you.\"\nAmy's cheeks heated up.\n\"If I did tell the truth, it wouldve only made things more awkward between us. But I want to continue to have a good relationship with you. Because reaching you is my goal.\"\nShirone remembered his first day at the magic academy. From the moment he saw the name Amy Karmis at the top of the Class 4 list, he swore to himself that he would catch up to her.\n\"I will definitely catch up to you. So please do your best, too.\"\nDespite being in a good mood, Amy was burdened. In fact, she had similar feelings due to the incident with Black Magician.\n\"Then don't just call me upperclassman from now on.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"We're the same age anyway, and I acknowledge you, so don't call me upperclassman from now on.\"\n\"But\n\"Im saying that I feel bad! What the hell is that? Acting like you follow and obey me while calling me senior or upperclassman, but in reality, youre actually coming after me? Stop being so coy and stand next to me and challenge me proudly!\"\nThe specific Class in the magic academy was also a matter of social status. When she said not to treat her as a senior, it meant that she thought of Shirone as an equal.\n\"Instead, hurry and catch up! If you blabber with only your mouth and continue to stay down there pathetically, I will dump you, okay?\nAmy walked towards the window with a face flushed red. Since she couldnt leave through the door, she had to go out the unorthodox way.\n\"Amy.\"\nAmy jumped and looked back when Shirone called. Embarrassed, she thought she looked back too quickly when Shirone called out.\nBut Shirone's eyes were burning brightly, almost to the point it was scary. As soon as she met his eyes, her stupid feelings disappeared in an instant.\n\"I will definitely catch up. Please wait for me in the Advanced class.\nAmy's eyes bent like a seagull. Her smile was hidden behind her mask, but she was clearly smiling.\n\"Hmph. I'll have already graduated by then. Feel free to chase after me. If you can, that is.\"\nAmy jumped out the window. By the time Shirone looked out the window, she had already disappeared.\nHe sighed. Shirone pretended to be strong, but it was true that he had no idea where to start.\n\"Teleportation\n* * *\nThere was a month left until the promotion exam. He had to somehow learn teleportation in that time frame. First, he went to the library and raked up all the books about teleportation magic. Contrary to his expectations that there would be none in stock, it was actually not difficult to get them.\nRumor has it that about 20 students are going to take the promotion test. In the end, all of them study in their own special way without relying on books.\n\"My, my I might actually fail this time around.\"\nShirone calmed his anxious mind and steadily learned the basic concept of teleportation.\nOne of the greatest discoveries in the history of magic: the theory of photonization. It was a type of magic that turned the mages body into light.\nThe thing of importance was the property of light, which was too difficult to understand with the human head.\nLight had no relative velocity, did not even contain mass, and even had the properties of particles and waves at the same time. But Kergos obtained great insight from its abstruse nature. By using the absoluteness of light that had no relative velocity, it was possible to quickly jump through space.\nBy adopting the photonization theory as omniscience, anyone could successfully teleport. That was why it was such a great discovery.\nHowever, the problem of control arose. Since teleportation was instant, calculating using the brain could easily lead to death.\nUnderstandable. Since we cant calculate the speed of 10 to the power of 20.\nShirone continued to read books. It was said that mages divided the speed of light into four main categories: ultra, super, sub, and semi.\nUltra-light speed was faster than light, and in theory, time-slip magic was possible. But so far, it was an unknown area that no mage had reached.\nTherefore, the most outstanding mages of light among humans were those who used super-light speed. They could learn Stop magic, which was labeled as something under the realm of gods. However, there were only a handful of mages who reached that level throughout history.\nIn the end, most of the professional mages who deal with light had their skills divided and categorized in the realm of sub-light speed.\nAccording to the definition of the mages, sub-light speed was a speed that transcends the maximum speed of matter, but was much slower than that of light.\nThe sub-light speed was also the basic omnipotence of space movement. In super-light speed, it would take no time to travel, but with sub-light speed, it took seconds.\nShirone read the book in amazement, but all the information had yet to reach reality for him. What he had to worry about was the last speed of light, the semi-light speed.\nThe definition of the semi-light speed given by the mages was that it was a speed that transcends the maximum speed of any living organism, but was much slower than sub-light speed.\nTherefore, even if teleportation had the property of light, it was possible to capture the path with the human eye.\nSince it was not at a speed that could distort space, an irreversible mishap may occur if you mistake your surrounding environment.\nThe moment I miss even one detail, it's over. Even if the photonization theory reduces our mass, hitting something would still be fatal due to the speed.\nHe realized why Siena emphasized that there would be no obstacles on The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed. Teleporting itself was dangerous. However, she had said that there were no specific countermeasures for clashes between students.\nCan I really do it? With just the basic formula?",

      "content": "Chapter 33\nMoving from point A to point B took no more than 1 second. It was quite difficult to calculate variables in your head since you were limited to that 1-second time frame. And above all, due to the nature of teleportation, short distances had to be repeated several times, meaning multiple calculations.\nAh, I get it now.\nShirone slapped his forehead. You couldnt calculate with your head, but you could still feel with your intuition.\nJust as the number of leaves in a tree could be counted through the Spirit Zone, the speed of light was also perceivable through insight.\nThis was exactly what Alpheas wanted. A magic that anyone could utilize, but not everyone could master.\nShirone gained confidence. Although he lagged behind in terms of omniscience, he had been honing and polishing his omnipotence every day since he was 12 years old.\n* * *\n30 days left until the exam.\nShirone did his best to expand his knowledge of Kergos' theory on photonization. After class, he spent night and day digging through the books in his dormitory. After 20 days of doing so, he could no longer find a book that could offer him anything new.\nSo from that day onwards, he started visiting a training ground dedicated to Class 7. The training ground was empty, presumably because his classmates had better, more private training areas.\nShirone combined the omniscience of the photonization theory with the omnipotence of the Spirit Zone. He found it difficult to grasp the feeling because this was his first attempt.\nShirone stood between omniscience and omnipotence. In that state, as soon as Shirone erased himself, the omniscience and omnipotence grew an affinity with each other. They then attached themselves as the magic activated.\nShirone cast the magic while in a state of trance. As he felt his body disintegrate, a light flashed before his eyes. At the same time, he bobbed his head to move forward, the distorted world crashing down on him.\nAHHHHH!\nShirone, after traveling 5 meters, rolled on the floor. He felt like all the bones in his body were breaking.\nUghh\nAs he grit his teeth and endured the pain, the word failure got engraved in his mind. If the mass was not completely reduced by the photonization, the impact force from the speed would follow. Hard.\nIt was a magic too dangerous to try alone.\nHowever, Shirone, who had no upperclassmen to ask for advice, let alone a private teacher, had no choice but to learn by tackling it with his body. And while yes Amy and Ms. Siena offered to help, he could not accept either. He chose not to out of principle.\nI won't give up. Ill definitely succeed.\nFrom that day onwards, Shirone went through numerous trials and errors to correct anything he was doing wrong. An ignorant method at first glance, but in the end, only muscle memory would remain when facing the actual test.\nA few days later, a mysterious person suddenly appeared on the training grounds and started watching Shirone. They could have been a spy sent by someone, but Shirone didnt care. There was no other suitable place to train.\nHow many times did he roll on the floor and bust his lips on the ground? He had bruises all over his body while his muscles did not forget to ache each time he woke up in the morning.\n* * *\nThe day before the exam.\nWith ten minutes to go before midnight, Shirone stumbled back to his position.\nNever give up Never give up\nHis throat was dry and sore from inhaling all the dust. He stood in the center of the training ground with half-open eyes.\nHe had corrected most of his mistakes by this point. All he had to learn now was perseverance in front of pain and gain the will to overcome fear.\nShirone couldn't move. He was too afraid to teleport. His stamina had fallen to the point that it could no longer get any lower, while his bones and muscles were bruised so bruised that just a light brush of anything left them throbbing in pain.\nLet's do it I have to do it\nShirone muttered these words as his consciousness began to fade. He was mentally knocked out. But maybe that was a good thing as he did not have to put in any effort to erase himself.\nTeTeleportation.\nShirones body stretched 10 meters out. His speed was not comparable to light, but to the naked eye, it seemed as if he was.\nAfter arriving at point B, Shirone hurriedly straightened his upper body as it was about to drop forward.\n......\nHe just stood there for a long time. He didnt feel it. This time around, he didn't feel any pain.\n\"Hehe I did it.\"\nThen the midnight bell rang loud.\nHearing the reverent sound, Shirone dropped to the ground from his standing position. The smell of dirt irritated the tip of his nose.\nThe result of the 30 days of training was only 10 meters. But still, this was the first time he had successfully leaped 10 meters.\nHow much farther can I go with this?\nTo cross the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed, he had to cast a minimum of 70 teleportation magics as the bridge was 700 meters in length. Furthermore, since this was a race, he had to pay careful attention to his stamina as well.\nCasting a single teleportation magic was much more costly than casting a single attack magic.\nThis was because it was simply better to just run fast rather than use teleportation that only moved you 10 meters forward. It was more efficient.\nUltimately, the key was connectivity.\nIf you could not cast it consecutively, teleportation was a magic one was better off not using.\nIf one arrived at their destination in a fully photonized state, the inertia would disappear. And thanks to this, the mages body would not shatter and be destroyed due to the inertia.\nI don't have time for this. I shouldn't be lying down. I have to practice a little more. At the very least, I should be reinforcing the connecting part\nShirones determination remained the same, but sadly he couldn't lift a finger. His consciousness was tugged into an abyss, and Shirones eyelids closed gently.\nAnd just like that, the morning dawned.\n* * *\n* * *\nMark opened the window and enjoyed the fresh morning breeze. He stretched and went into the bathroom to wash his face. The smile on his face did not fade while he got changed.\nToday was going to be a historic day in his life.\nPromoting from Class 7 at full speed. Haha. Im already looking forward to the kind of treatment Class 5 will give me.\nMark was incredibly strong at the young age of 15. In the magic world, physical appearance was not very important, but young children were still intimidated by height. And in addition to that, he was gifted with magic talent, so there was no brave soul who dared to bother him in Class 7. Thanks to that, he gained this opportunity by driving Shirone into a corner, so knowing that he made this opportunity fall into his hands, it strengthened his pride.\nHow do you feel, young master?\nA slender man opened the door and greeted Mark. It was the mage who taught Mark teleportation for a month. Although Mark was pressed for time to hire someone quickly, he managed to find someone who was a certified Grade 9 mage.\nAll right. How about Shirone?\nStill the same. Even if teleportation is easy to learn, there is a limit to training alone. Even if he takes the promotion exam, he wont even be able to come close to the young master.\nHmm. But I shouldnt let my guard down. His Spirit Zone is bigger than mine.\nMark was satisfied with what he had just said. It was often said that the weakness of genius was laziness. But Mark thought himself different. In his head, with his natural talent and hard-working character, there was no way he could lose against Shirone.\nBy the way, how many kids are participating in the operation?\nAs of yesterday, four.\nThat's quite small. After all, receiving private tutoring from a certified mage is rare.\nThey either do not know their limits or are simply ignorant. Or maybe too prideful.\nMark snorted at the thought of the students who refused to participate in the operation. Those losers who had not a speck of talent were blinded by the opportunity for early promotion and kicked off the lucky chance with their feet.\nWell, whatever floats their boats. Let them do whatever they want. I'm the one who will get promoted anyway. Its Mark Sliders victory.\nThe House of Slider was not very high up in the social class. However, despite being 3rd-class nobles, most of the family members worked for the Magic Association, so in the magic society, they had a pretty significant influence.\nIn any competition, if there was an upper rank, there of course would also be a lower rank. Mark decided to draw in half-baked kids with poor grades to form an operational group. When he offered to help them get a job at the association after graduation, several chose to come over. They concluded that it was more realistic to make a deal than to pass through the eye of a needle.\nFour people are enough. We can just crush him from the beginning.\nHow about teleportation\nMark opened the door and gave a thumbs-up as he walked out.\nPerfect. I will cross over 700 meters with my eyes closed.\nI wish you all the best, Young Master.\nThe certified Grade 9 mage was courteous to Mark til the end. From his perspective, he was a distant lowerclassman, but Mark was the son of his employer, who was a technical advisor at the Magic Association.\nMark headed to the Intermediate class building. There was no class because it was the day of the promotion exam, but students who were not participating in the exam remained and were studying on their own. Mark also visited this place for a meeting with the operation team.\nAs expected, the expressions of the students self-studying on their own were not good. It was because of the sense of shame they had for knowing they did not have a chance in the exam.\nMark enjoyed a sense of superiority whenever he looked at their faces. He burst out laughing when he thought that the kids who were left in the classroom today would probably be polishing shoes after going out to society.\nYo, Maria! Are you giving up on the exam?\nMark raised his hand at Maria, who was approaching from afar. Then Maria's face turned pale. She had become an outcast ever since she filed a complaint to Siena about Shirone's bullying.\nMark looked abhorrently at the helpless Maria.\nTsk. This bat-like girl. She goes out and snitches on us, forgetting the times we used to bully together? So old and so useless. Why the hell is this\nthing\neven attending the academy?\nFrightened Maria spoke first.\nMark, you didn't go to the training ground? Are you going to self-study like us?\nHaha! You seriously think that? I'm not you. I just came here to meet my friends because I have some time to kill.\nMaria, who was being condescended by Mark who was four years younger, turned gloomy. However, she couldn't even blame anyone because she was the one who lacked the talent and skills.\nForget me, what are\nyou\ndoing here? What difference can you make by studying today? That's why your grades look like that. Come up to the training ground and take a look. Watch us. Observe. Observing those who are talented is also another form of studying, you know.\nYes, I guess so\nMaria gave an awkward smile while listening to Mark. She just wanted to end the conversation quickly and leave.\n\"W-Well, then, good luck. I really hope you pass.\nKekeke! Do you really think so?\nMarias heart sank at Marks sneering.\nIve only tolerated you for so long because you were in the same class as me. But if I become an upperclassman, you better be prepared. I won't forget the time you snitched on us.\nMaria urgently tried to make an excuse, but her mind went blank and she couldn't think of anything. In the end, she resigned and ended up bowing her head as she walked off.\nMark snorted while watching her walk away. He entered the classroom where the operation team gathered. Four classmates were waiting in the empty classroom.\nThree men and one woman. They were students who had been training for a month to interfere with Shirone's path. In particular, the place they focused on was the situation that would happen within 100 meters.\nShirone for sure knew he was being kept in check, so he was definitely going to go all out in the beginning. Eliminating him by using any method possible before that happens was the key.\nThey had to be careful since a deliberate collision could lead to them being disciplined, but from Mark's point of view, it didn't matter if they crashed into him. He thought so because he felt that their sacrifice was equal to the compensation he was going to give them.\nSo how is it? You guys must have set up a plan, right?\nYes. As soon as the exam starts, the two of us will cling to Shirone. In the meantime, the other two will cover you. If Shirone breaks free from us, well at least have another two waiting.\nThe number of opportunities they had to fail Shirone was at most two times. However, considering his victory was going to be determined within the first 100 meters in the exam, Mark was pretty satisfied with the plan.\nShirones leaping distance was probably a standard of 10 meters. If so, the operation team needed to bring him down within the first 10 times they cast teleportation magic.\nI wont forget your help today. I will lead you guys if I get an early promotion.\nOkay. Well be trusting you.\nMark was satisfied. Everything was going according to plan. He was going to be the winner.\nGreat! Shall we get started?",

      "content": "Chapter 34\nTeleportation training grounds.\nOne after another, students arrived at the peak that was 1,000 meters above sea level. Since there were no classes, students from other classes were also there.\nAfter today, a student from Class 7 was going to be promoted to Class 5.\nConsidering that it usually took an average of two years to pass one class, in the worst-case scenario, it was possible for a student who was 4 years younger than the average to be attending a class meant for older students.\nWow! So this is the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed! It's my first time up here.\nThe participating students were amazed by the enormous size of the training ground. Instructors and students were also gathered on the opposite peak, 700 meters away.\nBut why is it called the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed? Where even is the bridge?\nIdiot. Its over there.\nA long iron bar connected the two peaks. As the length increased, the tension dropped. The fact that the bar stretched out 700 meters indicated that it was an alchemical material.\nA few students walked to the cliff and looked down. Contrary to what the instructors had told them, there were no safety devices, let alone anything that looked similar to it.\nWhat the hell? Won't you die if you fall?\nThadd, who leaped over the peak with Spatial Warp, spoke to them.\nYou don't have to worry. There are safety devices.\nThe students were not reassured. In fact, they heard that in another academy, a student had actually died during teleportation practice.\nHow does it activate?\nIf you fall 100 meters, the Air Net Magic gets automatically activated. It was designed to be invisible so you guys push yourselves not to fall.\nWhat if it malfunctions?\nHahaha! I can't say that its impossible. But so far, nothing like that has happened before.\nSo there's no guarantee that well be absolutely safe?\nWell, so to speak, yes.\nThe students paled. Then Thadd turned around with a smug look. Even if the safety device broke, there would be no accident. Thats why all the classes were canceled and why all the instructors were told to gather here.\nHowever, even if an accident were to occur, there was not much anyone could do. The magic academy was a special-purpose academy supported by the kingdom, so it was part of the rule not to blame anyone for an accident, even if someone was injured or killed during class. Students were already aware of this fact before applying for the Intermediate class.\nIt's been a long time since I've been here. Amy, let's go that way.\nSharelle grabbed Amy's hand and dragged her up the hill. Amy looked like she didnt want to go, but she eventually followed as Sharelle led her.\nI said I don't want to see it. Its a Class 7 exam! The results are obvious.\nOh, look at this girl! What are you saying when your boyfriend is about to proudly go up to Class 5? How will you ever score some points with your boyfriend if you dont do it on a day like this?\nTsk! Whats the point of cheering? Whether I cheer or not, those who are bound to fail will fail, and those that are bound to pass will pass.\nAmy was pretending to be unconcerned, but she was quite bothered inside. How much did his mastery of teleportation go up? Could he even teleport?\nPractical training was the best way to grasp the feel of teleportation. However, since the process was so painful, the advice given by experienced professionals was to learn the tips and tricks first.\nAmy, on the other hand, was literally the type of person who learned by tackling with her body. Of course, it was not too painful for her since she had Schema to rely on.\nBut its different for Shirone. Hes not one to give up. I hope hes in good shape.\nClass 7 had some remarkable talents. Depending on the situation, it would not be too unusual if Shirone failed.\nHuh? I don't think Shirone is here yet.\nWhen Sharelle, who was looking through the peak with a telescope, said that, Amy snatched the telescope away. As she said, among the 20 students standing on the cliff, Shirone was not one of them.\nWhat? What happened?\n\"You dont think he failed, right?\"\nShe couldn't guarantee it. She also believed in him because he was Shirone, but in all honesty, teleportation was not a magic that could be easily learned on one's lonesome.\nYou idiot Where the hell are you? What in the world are you doing?\n* * *\nShirone opened his eyes, squinting against the bright, warm sunlight. Visibility was low and the sky was higher than usual. When a jay flew up in front of his eyes, he came to his senses.\nAHH! What's this?\nLooking around, he noticed he was in the middle of the training ground. He did not wake up once ever since he collapsed and lost consciousness last night.\nEver since he started practicing and studying teleportation, Shirone only slept for three hours a day. Plus, on the final week, he overworked his body to the point he dropped dead.\nPromotion test!\nCold sweat dripped down Shirones back. He rushed out of the training ground without even having the time to feel disappointed in himself. To climb 1,000 meters above sea level, he had to start running like crazy, no matter what his condition was.\nPlease! Please!\n* * *\n* * *\nWell start, Headmaster.\nMm, do begin.\nAs Siena burst the Illumination magic toward the sky. Tension enveloped the training ground. Ethella, who noticed the illumination from the opposite peak, looked back at the students and spoke.\nOnce my signal goes off, run to the cliff. Whoever teleports the furthest will pass the promotion exam.\nThe students gulped loudly, their mouths dry. The difficulty of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was level 1, so there were no obstacles, but the fear of moving through empty space shook them to their core.\nRegardless of rank or whatnot, they had to link at least 70 teleportations to safely reach the other end. Moreover, if their rhythm broke in the middle, even their Spirit Zone would disappear due to their fear of falling.\nWe can't cross the whole thing, anyway. We will eventually fall But what if the safety device doesn't work?\nMost of the students were stiff with tension because it was human psychology to not fully believe something unless seen. Mark and the operation team were the only ones who could manage to stay a little more relaxed.\nHmph. I trained every day. I can easily leap 70 times if no one just gets in my way.\nThe variable was that Shirone was absent. The mage dedicated to Mark reported that Shirones progress was slow, but it was true that Mark didnt believe the report until he saw it with his own eyes. But since Shirone wasnt there, he thought that he was uselessly nervous over a nobody.\nTeleportation. I see he couldnt learn it. Well, he never had anything else but his Spirit Zone to show.\nThe person most anxious due to Shirones absence was Amy. Her unconcerned facade disappeared and she began walking back and forth uneasily near the cliff.\nGosh! What happened?! Why isnt he coming!\nAmy, look over there!\nSharelle pointed to the opposite peak. When Amy checked with the telescope, she saw Shirone running to the top. It looked like he rolled around on the ground somewhere because his clothes were covered with dust and his face was beet red.\nWhat the hell has he been doing until now?\nSharelle let out a sigh of relief.\nThat's a relief, though. He arrived on time. But he must be tired. I wonder if hell be okay?\n\"Whatever! Who cares?! Im just relieved that he didnt drop out!\nAnyways, seeing as how he managed to get to the training ground, it seems like he can teleport.\nWhen they saw that his lips were busted open and his arms were black and blue, they could vaguely imagine how extreme Shirones training was. Amy regained her senses and looked around.\nIt's quite windy today. This is going to be a tough test.\nAlthough not as much as flying magic, teleportation was not completely unaffected by wind speed and pressure. The students could not lose their concentration for even a moment in this test.\nAt the appearance of Shirone, the gazes of the students hardened. Thinking he had given up, they were caught off guard by his sudden appearance.\nTsk! He probably did that on purpose to mess with us.\nHes a wolf in sheeps clothing. Does he want to be promoted even after doing such a cowardly trick?\nIt was true that his appearance shocked some of the kids, but Shirone was the one who was most at a disadvantage due to his current state.\nEthella got troubled when she saw Shirone panting. Since he arrived before the start of the exam, there was no problem with him taking it. However, he was not in a shape comparable to everyone else\nWill there be no issues with inequality if we proceed like this?\nShe launched an orange Illumination spell into the sky. Blue meant ready, red was to start the exam, and orange was for a question.\nInstructors who saw Ethellas flare shared opinions. There were mixed opinions. One side stated that they should start right now while another stated that they should wait for 10 minutes to give Shirone a break.\nWhat do you think, Headmaster?\nAlpheus was adamant.\n\"Let's start. Being in control of your condition before an exam shows competence. I do not believe it is a matter we should concern ourselves with.\nAlright, then\nSiena conveyed the message to continue with a red flare. Shirone cut in between the students standing in a row. The person who kindly stepped aside to make space for him was someone who was part of Marks operation.\nThe students were all nervous. After all, no matter what special training they went through, teleporting across a 1,000-meter cliff was another matter entirely. It was an uncharted territory where all of them had an equal opportunity to get through.\nThen starting now, we will begin the early promotion exam of Class 7. Get ready.\nThe students took a running stance. Once only the sounds of heartbeats could be heard, Ethella cast the Illumination magic.\nA red sphere soared into the sky with a bang. The instructors on the other side were flipping through the files, ready to record.\nThe students shot off from the ground.\nThe lead! I have to take the lead!\nI might have a chance if I start first and take the lead!\nMost students had similar ideas. Shirone, whose legs had pretty much no strength, was forced to fall behind.\nBut Shirone was not bothered for there was still a chance to make up for the loss. Depending on the persons determination, the point they would cast teleportation before reaching the edge of the cliff would be different. The best method was to reach the edge, jump off, and then teleport.\nBut how many people could do that? The starting line was the point that held the highest tension amongst the competitors. Also, the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was 1 kilometer above sea level.\nWind speed, wind direction, and air pressure. All these factors differed in comparison to the environment they trained in. If they jumped off with their bare body and their magic failed, that was it. Risking their life for the chance to take the upper-hand was not something most students had the guts to do.\nAs Shirone predicted, with five meters left to the cliffs edge, students who could not withstand the fear began to teleport away. The rest of the students followed one after another. The students that were part of Marks party were among the few that did not teleport immediately.\nNo! Just a little bit more!\nHe staggered on, stomping down the rising fear. Shirone was aiming for the best possible start.\nCan I do it? What if I fall?\nDespite clenching his teeth in an effort to calm his racing heart, the feeling of nausea did not disappear.\nAs they got closer and closer to the cliffs edge, the team escorting Mark couldn't hold out any longer, so they began to teleport away. Soon after this, Mark followed suit.\nShirone continued to run despite over half of the students no longer being on the cliff. And due to that, the team who was keeping pace with Shirone felt their blood dry up.\nIf they kept going, they were going to fall off the cliff. With two steps left to the cliffs edge, the operation team cast teleportation.\nBut despite the close distance, Shirone kept moving forward. Fear was of no hindrance to him, who understood the nature of the danger.\nShirone knew that as long as he could keep could running forward on foot, he could make up for the time he lost due to his condition.\nThe competition isnt over yet!",

      "content": "Chapter 35\nREAPER\nSCANS\nInfinite Mage\nDespite the fierce mental battle happening between the competitors, in the eyes of the spectators watching from afar, it simply looked like they were busy jumping off.\nIm not teleporting until I start falling down.\nDespite the edge of the cliff being one step in front of him, Shirone's body did not disappear with a flash. Seeing him so close to the edge, the hearts of those watching thumped loudly.\nAnd their eyes widened.\nHe jumped off\nShirone jumped off the edge, as far as he could, and into the sky.\nThe weightlessness of floating. Strong winds shook his body and mountain birds flew in flocks, dozens of meters beneath his feet.\nShirone grit his teeth and focused on teleporting. At the critical point of the leap, his body finally jetted off with a flash.\nShirone was the last to get off the cliff, and as the people ahead started to get ready for the second round of teleportations, the rankings got overturned. The group that started first sagged to the rear.\nShirone made up for his late start But above all else, he was able to get ahead of Mark by a narrow margin.\nWha\nMark freaked out when Shirone suddenly popped up in front of him.\nWhat the hell?!\nHow late did he start to overtake me in the first cycle of teleports?!\nOf course, they were still on their first turn, so the chances of the rankings getting reversed still existed, but the fact that the first operation went down the drain ticked Mark off.\nYou weasel! Stop right there!\nWith a hair width of a difference, Shirone and Mark cast teleportation magic almost simultaneously.\n* * *\n10 minutes before the start of the promotion exam.\nA girl headed towards the training ground with a gloomy face.\nMaria Earlin.\nShe was the third daughter of the House of Earlin, which was a 3rd-class noble family. She was a 19-year-old talent who entered the Alpheas Magic Academy after waking up to her magic talent early.\nAlthough she was now stuck in Class 7, it was not as if she never stood out from the beginning.\nShe entered the academy at the young age of 10 and has since then been fighting fiercely to rank up.\nBut when Maria entered Class 7 at the age of 15, she was so happy she felt like she could fly. But her happiness was short-lived as her fear of the competition grew.\nIronically, her best performance was in her first year of being promoted to Class 7. However, starting the following year, her grades gradually started to decline. This trend continued to the point that now she was even ignored by new students.\nAt some point, such competition felt meaningless. She realized competition was not something she desired.\nKnowing it would only bring her suffering, she couldn't find a reason to push for the top-level classes. She knew that even if she were to get promoted, it would just be the start of a new competition with new people. Like a marathon that had no destination, she hated the continuous climb up the world pyramid knowing there was no end to it.\nShe didnt want to deal with the competition, She only wanted to learn magic for that was what she loved.\nHaah, what am I doing right now?\nShe felt like she had missed all her opportunities to climb up. And coupled with the fact that she eventually realized she was the oldest in Class 7, she felt like everything she worked for went down the drain. This realization took everything from her. Even her love for magic.\nBut yet she still couldnt find it in herself to leave the academy. Was it because it was part of her life already? Or was it because she still had a little bit of that passion from before left inside her?\nHaah\nMaria, who entered the magic academy because she liked magic, sighed when she realized she was starting to not even know who she was.\nTo her, the promotion exam was none of her business. But to also study side by side with her younger classmates while the exam was happening did not sit well with her.\nThat was the only reason why she started heading to the training ground.\nI think itll start soon.\nAs soon as she checked the time, an Illumination magic flashed near the peak of a mountain.\nIt was blue in color. And the moment that light flashed, she could hear the cheers of the students echo.\n......\nShe couldnt continue walking. Tears flowed down her eyes.\nI have no place there. I guess only the talented ones out of Class 7 are there.\nWas this the end?\nAs soon as she realized that she didnt have the courage to even leave the academy, fear consumed her.\nAt that moment, a devils thought consumed her mind, leading her astray.\nIf Mark wins\nHe would never let the person who snitched on him about Shirones bullying go.\nIt felt like her heart was about to burst out of her chest and her field of vision turned dark.\nNo!\nShe knew that she had to stop Mark, but she knew that with her strength alone, there was nothing she could do.\nShe looked towards the location of the engine room of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed.\n......\nMaybe, just maybe.\nA small hope sprouted within Maria.\nShe contemplated once again. She was positive that letting Mark win was the worst possible outcome.\nGrasping that hope, she opened the worn-out, iron door.\nScreeeech.\n* * *\nOne employee who was seated on a chair yawned.\nWhen will this end? I just want a jug of beer.\nAfter blinking once, his eyelids started to slowly close while his head started bending forward.\nHooh\nMaria let out a breath while standing behind the employee who had fallen into a deep sleep.\nSleep magic that relaxed the mind hardly worked on mages, but for those who did not practice magic, it had a significant effect.\nMaria looked around the engine room. After searching for a bit, she found a rotary switch that controlled the difficulty level of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed.\nIt seemed as though it wasnt even activated because the protruded indicator was pointing to level 1.\nGrasping hold of the switch, her hand shook.\nIs this the right thing to do? No, whether its the right thing to do or not, is this something I can even do?\nShe just had to turn the switch. It would cause something terrible, but when a person was possessed, only the sweet rewards blinded their thoughts.\nI just have to make it so that no one passes.\nMaria turned the switch.\nShe expected something big to happen right after she turned it, but contrary to her expectations, her surroundings were dead quiet.\nThe silence weighed down her shoulders, making her plop down to the ground.\n* * *\n* * *\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\nExplosive sounds erupted from the competing students. They were in a situation where 20 people were each flashing and trying to cross at a height of 1,000 meters.\nAt an average of 3 turns, while the distance between the leading group and the one lagging behind was not so huge, talent-wise, it was clear who was better.\nThose who started off early could not endure the considerable height. They were Class 7 students who did not even learn flying magic, so the shock and fear were enough to hinder them.\nWhat do I do? Am I really gonna fall?\nThe other side seemed too far from reach.\nThe Spirit Zone demanded extreme focus from a person, so it was an extremely sensitive state of mind. Therefore, even a little distraction might shatter it. Eventually, the students in the rear group, who failed the omnipotence of teleportation, began to plummet.\nAHHHHHH!\nHelp! Save me!\nThe upperclassmen burst out laughing. Since theyve already experienced this, they only thought those lowerclassmen were adorable.\nEven the instructors had little smiles on their faces while writing the names of those who failed in order.\nHowever, the festive atmosphere took a complete 180-degree turn.\nOne after another, the instructors raised their heads in surprise. During the time the students started dropping, the Air Net should have had plenty of time to activate, but the siren did not sound.\nWhat?! What happened?!\nSave the students first!\nSiena dived down the cliff and cast teleportation at a terrifying pace. And Ethella, who was watching from the other side, noticed the strange situation as well and jumped down.\nHeadmaster, what should we do?\nAlpheas hummed and let out a breath.\nSince two Grade 6 mages took the initiative, all the students were gonna be fine. If they were to stop now, the students who did their best to maintain their position in the leading group would suffer great losses. It would be better to respect the will of the participants as long as their safety was ensured.\nLets watch for now. We have enough manpower to protect 20 people. Instead, wouldnt ending things here disrespect the students passion?\nSiena and Ethella both shot up from the bottom of the cliff at the same time, students in tow.\nWhats happening? There must be something wrong.\nSharelle spoke while looking through the telescope. Other students murmured at the unexpected situation.\nBut Amy wasnt really bothered. A student dying due to falling was impossible with certified Grade 6 instructors on watch. Besides, the students in the front remained undistracted. If it was her, she wouldnt have cared either. The ticket to be promoted to Class 5 was on the line, so who cared about safety?\nHowever, the second half of the group was in a noticeable uproar. They saw instructors jumping off the cliff to grab the students who were falling.\nIs there no safety device?\nThe only reason why they made it this far was because no matter how similar it was to a real match, it was not an actual one where their lives were on the line.\nAAAAAAHHHHH! NOOOO!\nInstructor! Please save me! I give up!\nIm dying!!!\nA large number of students started dropping like flies, but the instructors came to the rescue, saving all of them.\n* * *\nThe leading group who were still in the game continued to fight their fear.\nWhats going on?\nThey could hear the loud noises from the upperclassmen. This ruffled their currently sensitive feathers greatly.\nTheir shouts reached the ears of the leading group, but it affected no one.\nIn fact, it actually caused their blood to boil even hotter knowing that there were fewer competitors.\nThis is my chance! All of you, just keep dropping.\nThe leading group had advanced 270 meters, and considering they were from Class 7, that was pretty good.\nAnd while all of this was happening, Shirone continued to protect his place as the first.\nMark and his team tried to take Shirones place multiple times, but to avail. Shirone bested them each time.\nMark gritted his teeth.\nWho the hell is he?\nShirone had so far leaped 27 times, and each time, he teleported exactly 10 meters.\nIf compared to a pull-up, it was the same as someone doing a rep of 20 while maintaining the same pace.\nIs he a machine?\nHe knew Shirones mental endurance was high, but he didn't think there would be this big of a difference.\nAnd all of this was being analyzed by the instructors.\nEthella spoke out.\nOho, Shirone sure is a talent.\nThe weight behind her words was heavy since she was an influential figure who never really commented on anything.\nOther instructors started joining in.\nWell, Mark isnt too bad. He is still young, after all. His routine is being shaken up. From a minimum of 9.5 meters to a maximum of 11. Hes being inconsistent.\nIt was safe to say that his mind was shaken.\nOn the other hand, Shirones routine is consistent. Their speed is about the same, but the one with a higher chance of winning is Shirone.\nIn the midst of the compliments, Thadds expression wasnt so bright.\nTalent\nHe glimpsed at Alpheas face, worried about him But his face showed nothing.\nSuddenly, the students of Class 7 who did not participate in the exam approached Thadd.\nMr. Thadd, how is Shirones routine that stable? Ive never seen anything like it.\nLeaping a set distance consistently did not seem like something a human could do.\nThadd couldnt help but agree.\nThats\nAmy spoke.\nHes using Compulsion.\nSharelle nodded in agreement.\nTo be specific, hes using Repetitive Compulsion. When you objectify yourself, your mind becomes more stable and develops a characteristic inertia. Its impressive that hes able to activate it at will. After all, its an advanced-level Spirit Zone technique not taught in Class 7.\nSince it was not something taught in Class 7, that meant Compulsion was a dangerous state of mind.\nHe must have learned it before coming here. Since it helps one endure pain Sometimes, becoming a machine is necessary\nTo take what we want.\nKeeping that last thought to herself, Amy watched Shirone continue to widen his lead.\nIt seemed as though he was flying towards her.\nYoud better come quickly Since I wont wait for you.\n* * *\nShirone's stubbornness in keeping his lead annoyed Mark to no end.\nFuck! Why cant I pass him?!\nKnowing things couldnt keep going like this, a female student, who was part of the operation team, flinched as Mark glared at her.\nIs he telling me to do it here? Right now?\nThere was a way.\nAs long as they gave up on their goal of completing the exam, Mark would be able to overtake Shirone for a short while.\nThen after that, drop out together.\nTheir plan was too obvious, but in their heads, it was better than doing nothing and ending it there.\nMy life is at stake, too.\nWith a boom, she teleported right in front of Shirone.\nShit!\nAs soon as Shirone hurriedly tried to brake, another member of the operation team flew towards him from the side.\nSorry. We have to make a living too.",

      "content": "Chapter 36\nI'm sorry. We have to make a living too.\nThe male student closed his eyes tightly and teleported to Shirone.\nFatal injuries were inevitable in the event of a collision.\nEek!...... Huh?\nHe cried out in fear, but he did not feel the impact he was preparing for.\nWhen he opened his eyes, Shirone was exactly 10 meters away from where he was.\nHe dodged?\nIn the process of traveling forwards, Shirone abruptly curved right to avoid a collision. It was better than dropping out due to a collision, but he still took a speed loss nonetheless.\nThe female and male students plunged down with satisfied looks. They had successfully slowed down Shirone.\nNo!\nShirone, whose repetitive compulsion was cut off by the dodging he did just now, gritted his teeth and focused his mind to try and raise back his teleportation tempo.\n\"Hey. Just now, the movement of those two kids. Wasnt it kind of weird?\"\nA kid from the Intermediate class said with a frown.\nI thought so too. Maybe they just got tangled in a rush? No way they tried to crash on purpose.\nBy no means was that an accident. They did it on purpose.\nThe person who made that comment was a student from Class 5, Yiruki Mercodine.\nShe was the same person who had given the advice to Shirone back then when he was in the Image Zone. She was thin as a rail, had heterochromia, jagged teeth, and a pointed nose.\nHow are you so sure? Sure, it was suspicious, but you cant be positive unless youre part of the accused party.\nWith one palm spread open, she collided it with her other hand which was clenched in a fist.\nOne person blocks the road. The other hits from another side. Its a great strategy to block both the instantaneousness of teleportation and the space leap aspect of it. If Shirone didnt dodge by modifying his usual cycle, he would have fallen down. Well, I would have found some other way using equations of motion.\nHer classmates turned their heads towards the training ground again.\nGosh, what a poser.\nMeanwhile, Shirone began to get a little nervous after looking at the growing distance between him and Mark.\n350 meters remaining.\nBy the halfway point, the only competitors left were Shirone and Mark.\nI won! Im first!\nConvinced that he was going to win, Marks body vibrated with excitement.\nAlthough he had leaped about 40 times, seeing as how there was no one standing in his way, he did not feel fatigued.\nIm the one who will pass!\nHigh-speed promotion to Class 5. The faces of envious classmates and the sour faces of Class 6 upperclassmen crossed his mind.\nHAHAHA! Im first!\nAs Mark sped up the tempo of his teleportation, the distance between him and Shirone began to widen even more.\nMark is in good condition. He will complete the exam by the looks of it. At the rate Im going, I wont be able to retake first place.\nThere was only one possible method left for Shirone.\nAcceleration.\nWhile he might be able to get closer to Mark, the risk of breaking his routine was high.\nHowever, the only solution was to increase his teleportation link rhyme by a beat faster.\nHEUP!\nWith clenched teeth, Shirones rhythm suddenly accelerated. The sound of the teleportation wave resounded like the beat of a drum.\nThe excitement of the students reached its peak.\nShirone is starting to catch up! The winner is going to be decided soon!\nMark! Faster! Faster!\nLike the last spurt of track and field, everyone's adrenaline shot up as the distance shortened.\nThen, something strange was detected by Mark.\nThe iron bar of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed started fluctuating like waves.\nMark frowned.\nAt first, he thought he was mistaken, but now he was sure that the bar was squirming around like a living creature.\nWhat the?\nThe material of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed had alchemical components to it. It was a special material that could change its shape in response to electromagnetic force.\nThere should be no obstacles though It should be set to level 1.\nShattering Marks belief, the bar bent like rubber and turned into a lasso.\nAAK! What the hell!\nAt the same time he freaked out, Marks body passed through the huge circle and came out the other way.\nThough the situation was not too dangerous, since the bar completed its transformation, it was now as solid as steel.\nWhy is this happening?\nThen, the mechanical voice of a woman rang out within the training ground.\nWarning. Warning. The engine system of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed has been activated. Level 10. Level 10.\nWhat?\nWhile Mark was questioning who exactly was operating the engine system, he was also doubting if he had heard the system right. He heard it say level 10.\nThe black iron bar that bent and twisted created an ugly-shaped obstacle.\nWh-What is that?\nSince Class 4 trained on a difficulty level of 6, The class 4 students watching couldnt help but fear for Mark and Shirone.\nHow the hell did this happen?! Why did the engine activate all of a sudden?!\nThe instructors were in disarray.\nIt was not enough that the safety device was turned off, but the difficulty of the traps was also at its highest.\nThe advanced-class level obstacles had complex shapes and their speed was also very fast, so the risk of injury was extremely high.\nDamn it! Engine room!\nThadd was the first to teleport to fly off to the engine room, while the rest of the instructors questioned what to do now.\nHeadmaster, what should we do now? The promotion exam\nThe only students left were Shirone and Mark. They had come so far.\nIf the exam was interrupted while there was no clear winner, some people might speak ill of the academy.\nIn particular, since this was a promotion test, they would have to suffer pressure from many nobles.\nThis is not a simple promotion. Students who have already dropped out will insist on fairness as well.\nIn that sense, the instructors questions were understandable, but Alpheas shouted in outrage.\nAre you all really asking that right now?! Halt the exam immediately and signal the participants to stop!\n* * *\nThadd, who came down to the ground with a boom from teleporting, frowned and headed towards the engine room.\nWhoever it is, if I catch you\nFor the prestigious Alpheas Magic Academy to have an engine system malfunction Its probably a mistake done by staff.\nHe roughly twisted the door to the engine room.\nHuh?\nThe door was locked.\nThinking that maybe this whole thing was not a mistake, his eyes turned hard.\nOh, so you want a piece of me?\nWhile he held up his right hand that held a big fireball, he felt the inside of the room with his Spirit Zone.\nWhat?\nSomeone had their back against the iron door.\nIf he released his fireball like this, it would put that person in danger, so he first sent a warning.\nOpen the door. Now. Im going to cast Fire Strike. If you dont open the door, youll die.\nI dont care. In fact, please do it.\nYou Are you Maria?\nAlthough Thadd had never been her instructor, she had entered the academy while he was in the Advanced class.\nIt is Maria, isnt it? What are you doing? The promotion exams a mess. This has turned into a huge problem.\nIm sorry. I troubled everyone once again.\nFirst, let's talk face-to-face.\nMr. Thadd, am I going to be expelled? Will I go to jail?\nNo, Maria. I dont know what your circumstances are, but Ill listen.\nI dont think I was thinking straight. I only came to my senses after I did everything. I mustve gone mad. Im sorry\nSo open the door. I dont want to use harsh methods.\nBut the thing is I dont want to live, Mr. Thadd. What should I do?\n......\nHearing Marias cry, Thadd quietly put out the flame in the palm of his hand.\nHe no longer thought of turning off the engine system to turn the promotion exam back to normal. He knew it was going to get canceled anyway and that the students would be fine.\nMaria Earlin.\nWhat kind of a student was she?\nA quiet, timid child whose name had never once appeared on any paperwork at the academy.\nAll right, I understand.\n* * *\n* * *\nThadd scratched his head and turned his back. He just leaned against the railing as if to say he didnt want to think further.\nIf you dont want to come out, dont.\nMaria did not answer.\nHowever, the fact that he didnt try to turn the handle and start yelling at her calmed her a little.\nAmidst the silence, Thadd looked up at the sky.\nStill the same.\nThe blue sky of the Alpheas Magic Academy that he so hated during his academy life.\nMr. Thadd.\nYes?\nYou hate me, right?\nDont you know? I dont hate girls.\nWhy is the world so unfair?\nWhy? Cases where someone is born as pretty as you are rare. Youre not lacking in any way.\nYou, someone whos called a genius mage, wouldnt know what it means to have no talent. Even if I do my best, despair is always waiting for me ahead. It feels like anything I do just goes down the drain. Nothing feels like its working, I cant seem to do anything. Do you know what that feels like? Do you know how daunting that is?\n...Of course. I know that feeling very much.\nMaria turned her head toward the iron door.\nYou do?\nI graduated when I was 22, so its already been four years since Ive become an instructor. When you entered the academy, I must have been in the Advanced class. You know Im a graduate from here, right?\nYes.\nThen do a bit of thinking. Have you ever heard of a student named Thadd attending this academy?\nNow that she thought about it, she couldnt remember a single time she heard his name during his time as a student.\nShirone was an outlier as he was the topic of the students gossip as soon as he entered the academy.\nNo, never.\nAnd that makes perfect sense. My grades were low, I didnt have any talent, and in addition to that, I wasnt from a big, rich family. In fact, I used to always go start fights outside of the academy.\nYou did?\nYeah. It took me an average of two years to go up a class. Hell, when I got into the Advanced Class, it started taking me three. Though, I know things are a little different for you.\nThadd continued while imagining Maria sulking.\nBut arent our situations quite similar? Unless you are the best period, everyone is bound to fail or be defeated someday. The same principle applies to me. I had gotten into the Advanced Class, but I flunked my classes every time without fail.\nBut how\nHow did I become who I am now? Its all luck. Luck. I met a wicked mage who yelled and scolded me. You know, I convinced myself that I was doing my best, but compared to others, that best was nothing. And struggling to defeat someone was something I got sick of. But one day, that same wicked mage, told me this\nThadd recalled that time.\nTo dream of success while not having the courage to give up something in order to achieve it is arrogance.\nMaria kept silent, but a lot of thoughts were going through her head.\nMaria, you dont need to compete. You dont always have to win over someone. If you like magic, there you go. Thats all you need. There are people in this world who dont wish to compete with anyone. Like me. While it may be a tougher path than the one most tread, you have the courage to take that path. Its something you can do.\nSomething I can do\nMaria asked.\nWhat kind of person was he? The mage that scolded you?\nHes someone youre very familiar with. The headmaster of the Alpheas Magic Academy.\nReally? The Headmaster?\nThadds eyes dimmed at the memory.\nYes. From that day on, I became his full-time student and received private tutoring. It was a great privilege. Well, thanks to that, my life worked out for the best. Doesnt that explain why a dirtbag like me gets called a genius? Its because I was taught by a man whose name is known all around the continent. Hows that? Jealous yet? Life is all about luck. Hahaha!\nMaria once again felt blue.\nSo, what Im really trying to say is, the world isnt fair. Some people are born with talent while most arent. Some, whether its because theyre dim-witted or laid-back, jump into any competition. Some just work their butts off. But for someone like me who has no talent or anything like it for that matter, sometimes, very occasionally, a miracle happens. Thats why I find life worth living.\nThadd rose from his seat and turned around.\nWhat do you think, Maria? Wouldnt ending things here be a waste and an affront to the effort you put in to get this far? How about trying just a little bit more?\nMaria dug her face into her knees.\nWhat more are you saying I should do? That miracle you mentioned I dont even know if it will ever come Like, what if it never comes? Then what would happen to me?\nWhat are you saying, Maria?\nThadd spoke with his hand against the iron door.\nThe miracle youre looking for? Youre looking right at it.\n......\nMaria's face scrunched up.\nHeuk\nPerhaps those were the words she'd been hoping to hear her entire life. Warm tears dripped down her face.\nCan you trust me and try one more time? Ill help you become an outstanding mage.\nReally? You think I can do it?\nOf course. Talent isnt being good at something. Its having the heart to love that something so much your body devotes every facet of its being into it. That heart makes everything possible. Maria, youre an excellent student.\nMaria started sobbing.\nShe, who was pouring out her emotions, suddenly realized and opened the iron door.\nMr. Thadd, quickly, the system!\nIts already too late. When I got here, an Illumination magic flashed. The promotion exam is canceled.\nTh-Then\nThe situation has gotten a little complicated, but Ill take care of it.\nAt that moment, a person suddenly appeared in front of them. It was Siena.\nMr. Thadd! What in the world are you doing?\nMs. Siena?\nShe first glared daggers at him, but after seeing Maria, her face was full of shock.\nThadd questioned.\nWhy? The exam is already over. More than that, the person responsible for this incident\nIts not over!\nWhat?\nBoth of them did not give up. Im saying the competition is still ongoing!\nWas that even possible?\nLevel 10 of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was a practice assignment for the Advanced Class.\nOf course, it was not an assignment that those in the Advanced Class really worried about, but for the two who were in Class 7, completing it was nigh impossible.\nAH! FUCK!\nThadd, who grasped the magnitude of the situation, was about to turn to the engine room, but a flash caused by Spatial Warp turned up near them.\nEthella rushed over.\nInstructors! Something big happened!\nSeeing her pale face, Siena asked while trying to hide her anxiety.\nWhat happened?\nEthella shouted.\nShirone, Shirone is!",

      "content": "Chapter 37\n* * *\nPrior to Siena arriving at the Engine room.\nUnder Alpheas instruction, the other instructors cast the Illumination magic which was meant to stop the exam.\nThe sky glowed red, but Shirone and Mark showed no intention of stopping.\nIt's a huge trap.\nAs the iron bar bent, circular rings of various sizes started heading towards them.\nFrom the front, the trapps overlapped like a net, so there seemed to be no room to escape through it.\nDo I have to give up?\nShirone and Mark glanced at each other. And right as their gazes collided, they teleported.\nBOOOOM!\nSome instructors started shouting when the shapes of the two were obscured by the obstacles.\nHow foolish! Are they planning on going through with this to the end?\"\nSiena spoke.\nThey just dont want to give up first because the one who does will definitely be shamed later.\nThis is a problem. What the hell is Mr. Thadd doing?\nAnother reason for this chaotic atmosphere was that Alpheas was silent. To be honest, anger was boiling inside Alpheas. Especially towards Shirone.\nSometimes you have to know when to back down. Dont you know that much?\nBut he also knew that at times, doing such a thing was not an option.\n...There are times when you can never back down.\nThere was no right answer in life.\nWhatever you choose to do, as long as you take responsibility for your decision, what others think becomes meaningless.\nLet them proceed. Neither of them seem satisfied with my decision.\nThe instructors were surprised.\nWhat? But if an accident were to occur, this could turn into a huge problem.\nNo matter what happens\nAlpheas' eyes turned icy.\nI'll take responsibility.\nThe instructors were bewildered and could not reply back to their Headmasters cold attitude that did not usually surface.\nThe only one who could perhaps somewhat understand Alpheas intention was Thadd, who was currently absent.\nHis gaze went back to the competition.\nAlright, I understand your will.\nHe had heard all about Shirones past, his origins, and the things he had to go through to enter the academy.\nEvery moment must feel like your last. I will respect that. But if you cant take responsibility for the results\nAlpheus was resolved.\nThis will be the end of your path to becoming a mage.\n* * *\nShirone felt dizzy.\nKeuk!\nThe traps were so fast that he had no time to dodge one and have the luxury to think about the next.\nI have to look at the whole thing all at once.\nTo compare it to a maze, it was like running after memorizing the whole map.\nThere's no end to it.\nDue to being too focused on avoiding the obstacles, Shirone advanced less than two meters.\nAt this rate, my mental strength will be exhausted first. I have to try and move forward somehow.\nMark was thinking the same thing.\nThere is a possibility that both of us will fail. The one who gets the furthest will probably be the winner.\nLike a lion in a circus jumping through a hoop of fire, Mark broke through the obstacle.\nHere I go!\nThe instructors admired Marks bravery and decisiveness as he sharply swerved and penetrated through the obstacle.\nThe change of direction of teleportation is by no means easy. I see Mark has prepared well.\nMark was delighted.\nIt worked! I can do it!\nWhen Mark turned his head to look back, he saw that Shirone was in the same place he was previously.\nKekeke, hes terrified.\nMark was no longer worried about Shirone as he felt he had taken a far enough lead.\nShirone shook his head.\nNo.\nIf it was simply avoiding a couple of obstacles and advancing forward, that was something Shirone could do as well. However, after analyzing the combination of all obstacles approaching from afar, Shirone realized that there was only one way out.\nThe path Mark chose is blocked.\nAs expected, Mark felt the difficulty of the traps increase as time went by.\nKeuk!\nThe iron bar that waved around like a whip came at him in the shape of an X.\nHEEUUK!\nMark looked like he was about to break down.\nThe endless number of iron bars that were seemingly dancing in the air suddenly tangled up and transformed into a net.\nI can't avoid that.\nEver since the beginning, Mark was mistaken to think he had chosen an easy path. He tried to leave the current route belatedly, but the net was already right in front of his eyes.\nThe observing students paled.\nHes going to collide!\nAs soon as the obstacle passed with a roaring sound, the eyes of those watching tightly closed. On the other hand, students who could not move a muscle had their eyes opened wide.\nShirone!\nShirone had snatched Mark away on time and escaped the net using teleportation.\nDid he jump in to save Mark? One can only be so nice. He still annoys me.\nHow can you say that? Isn't it natural to try and save people who are about to die?\nNatural? Would you be able to do that?\nHey, you jerk! Why are you imposing that on me?\nYiruki had a knowing smile while the other students were busy arguing with each other.\nIt's not that, idiots.\nMeanwhile, Shirone was lost.\nAlthough he did good in saving Mark, he was knee-deep in trouble.\nAAK! S-Save me!\nMark, who had already lost his beast-like will, floundered about with tears in his eyes\nJust keep still!\nEven though he was shouting, Shirone's eyes did not leave the coming obstacles and continued to analyze.\nTheres none.\nHe had rescued Mark from trap hell, but he himself couldn't find a way out.\nNo, theres no way. They wouldnt make a trap that has no way out.\nAt that moment, his frame of common sense shattered.\nI was being stupid\nWasnt there another escape route? Go back out the way he came in.\nAhhhh! We are all gonna dieeeee!\nIgnoring Marks screams, Shirone rushed backwards with teleportation.\nYiruki jumped to his feet in the audience.\nThat's right!\nBacking up was also a strategy.\nThe key was to not obsess over moving forward. Shirone didnt have to only go straight in order to avoid the obstacles.\nHere I go!\nShirone, who was moving rapidly, jumped over a huge obstacle that was approaching.\nYes, it worked!\nThe immediate threat had passed, but level 10 was not level 10 for nothing.\nAs soon as Shirone jumped up, the iron bar tracked him down after transforming into a large parabola.\nSo its impossible to escape this cycle even if I move up?\nAs long as the participant did not fall to the ground, the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed would continue to harass the participant until they either failed or got to the end.\nKeuk!\nThe trap became harder to analyze than before due to a slope being created because of its parabola shape. Though, the presence of Mark was also a big burden on Shirone.\nSharelle grumbled frustratedly.\n\"Why is he doing such a reckless thing? If Mark is eliminated, he will be promoted. And not to mention, it's really dangerous to teleport with someone else. You only do that in case of an emergency.\nAmys replied.\nThats just who he is. He actually does the things other people only dream or talk about doing.\nI know that Shirone is kind, but Mark even hired people to bother him.\nPerhaps that is why hes more\nShe thought it a little strange that she understood Shirones intention.\nHe wasn't interested in the ranking from the beginning.\n* * *\n* * *\nShirone is not competing with anyone. His only goal is to become a mage. A person who is deadset on a goal does not really care about the process or what other people think. It doesnt matter whether theyre first or last. All the things they do are in service of reaching said goal\nAnd in his case, its to become great at magic.\nWhile Sharelle was lost in thought, Amy watched the struggling Shirone.\nShe knew Shirone had no luck this time.\nNo one in the Intermediate class can cross level 10. It's right to stop the exam here.\nAll she could do was hope that Shirone would come back alive.\nAAAHH! AAAAAKK!\nShirone was so focused on the traps that he couldn't even hear Mark's annoying screams.\nIt's getting more and more difficult.\nThis was of course natural, however, the difficulty was so high that it now seemed like the iron bar was a huge worm-like parasite, instead of an object.\nIts unpredictable.\nMark's scream disappeared around the time Shirone advanced 100 meters through the wriggling parasite.\nMark fainted with foam coming out from his mouth, but Shirone continued on with no care. He had already forgotten about him.\nFocusing on one thing while thinking of the whole was similar to the Deviate Form of the Four Way Formation.\nThe instructors who were arguing and the students who were making a fuss a minute ago had all gone silent.\nAlpheas narrowed his eyes.\nCrisis raises ones ability However, everyone has limits\nHow was he still holding out? The traps present in the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed were moving at a speed of 200 km/h.\nIt was safe to say that any average student would have long lost consciousness.\nYet, Shirone continued to pass between the black iron bars.\nDoes that boy have no limits?\nThe reason why some couldnt soar indefinitely even when they once rode through an upward trend was because they would eventually feel satisfied with themselves.\nThe same went for magic.\nWhy couldnt all mages be the best? Was it just a matter of skill or talent?\nSatisfaction was the enemy of progress. But at the same time, it was human nature and something everyone eventually felt. The feeling of satisfaction was not something humans could do without.\nBut I don't even see a hint of that in you. Shirone, are you dreaming of infinity with that human body of yours?\nIt seemed like he never had a vessel that held him back to begin with.\nSince satisfaction did not exist in him, his mind was able to handle the ever-increasing difficulty.\nShirone, who mustve been in a trance, would not remember this moment.\nHowever, Ethella, the youngest bishop of the Karsis Order, would never forget the dance No, the valor she observed today.\nEven in a trance, hes constantly calculating and finding a way out. An exit that he has a one over-infinity chance of finding.\nWhat kind of mental state did one have to have to be able to do that?\nEven a high priest can only maintain that kind of mentality while in a transcendent state for a short while.\nHowever\nEthellas face turned serious.\nEven if he can feel and calculate everything, techniques and skills are a whole other matter. The next trap is really hard.\nShirone had anticipated it.\nThe distance between the obstacles was extremely narrow. They left Shirone with only a 1-meter gap.\nIt was literally a trap of chaos where no such thing as rules applied. The only rule was that things would continue to become more difficult.\nI have to break it down smaller.\nHe had to reduce his 10-meter teleportation distance to 1 meter.\nDoing so would place Shirone at a level that absolutely surpassed Class 7s, but no such distracting thoughts bothered him.\nLeft and right pattern.\nShirone analyzed dozens of ring-shaped traps arranged in pairs at the same time.\nLeft, right, left, right The moment his thoughts finalized, he teleported left and right without even taking the time to look at each trap.\nA flash of light zigzagged through the rings.\nI made it\nHowever, the moment Shirone finally started to regain his bearings, the rings with up-and-down patterns rushed towards him.\nKEUK!\nIn a situation where the angle was not straight, his body took another leap forward.\nIf I break it down to the extreme\nShirones body shone once again, and as it did a flash of light that bent appeared.\nThe students eyes opened like saucers.\nThe light bent?\nYiruki got up and opened his different-colored eyes wide.\nRainbow Drop! He actually did it!\nMost of the students did not understand the flash that followed the trajectory of a wave, but that was probably because Rainbow Drop was a top-level skill that teleportation specialists learned.\nIs that really possible? How does teleportation bend? Lights only travel in a straight line!\nYiruki tapped his head twice and said,\nIts a simple principle. Differentiating a circle yields an infinite straight line. Break down the interval of teleportation enough times and you can make it look like light bent.\nHow do you even calculate how many times you need to break it down?\nIt's not a calculation, it's a sense. Even then, it's hard to do, but lets just say he has more omnipotence than omniscience. Though, I can confidently say that he is a genius with a tendency opposite to mine.\nThe students turned their heads back to the examination hall.\nFor someone whos only in Class 5? Genius my ass.\nWhen the speed of the Bridge That Could Not Be Crossed reached its maximum, even the shape of the structures could not be easily distinguished. Though Shirone's eyes had adapted to it, so he could still tell.\n30 meters left to the end.\nThe students began shouting words of support towards Shirone.\nFor the first time in the history of the magic academy, they were expecting a student from the Intermediate class to cross a level 10 Bridge That Could Not Be Crossed.\nHeadmaster! Over there!\nThe faces of the instructors paled.\nAs if jealous of Shirones near success, the iron bar started twisting randomly, creating a three-dimensional structure.\nDamn it! Its the Dragons Labyrinth! What the hell is Mr. Thadd doing?\nWhile the instructors were busy shouting, Siena had a deep frown and hurriedly cast Spacial Warp.\nThadd! You fucking!\nThe Dragons Labyrinth, which only appeared at level 10, was a trap with a gigantic dragons head.\nOnce you were swallowed, it was the end, so you had to link your magic while also remembering how the structure was created step-by-step.\nShirone bit his lips and analyzed the pattern.\nAAAAHHHHH! What the fuck?! What the hell is that?!\nWhen Mark regained consciousness and screamed his head off, Shirones Spirit Zone shook violently.\nKeuk!\nEven at that moment, the Dragons Labyrinth approached at its fastest speed with its jaws wide open.\nHere it comes!",

      "content": "Chapter 38\nThe time left until the collision was at most one second, and this time, Shirones heart couldnt help but race.\nHe could smell death.\nLets stay calm.\nHe was not yet dead, so with that in mind, Shirone narrowed his eyes at the iron structure that wished to swallow him whole.\nThink.\nIntense electrical impulses hit his brain, and Shirone quickly readjusted his omnipotence and omniscience to repair his Spirit Zone which had been shaken by Marks shrill screams.\nThat took a tenth of a second.\nShirone thought to himself.\nWas that enough? No, not yet.\nHe thought faster.\nA hundredth of a second.\nHe reconstructed the internal structure of the Dragons Labyrinth and simulated exactly how it went in his mind in order to find a way out.\nA thousandth of a second.\nThere were 6 roads in front of him. Shirone needed to link nine teleports in order to escape.\nNo. It would be possible alone, but with Mark? I have to find another route\nRight as Shirone was about to begin a new simulation, the Dragon's Labyrinth devoured them both.\nMany students turned their heads, and some even screamed.\nSharelles scream was the loudest among them.\nBOOOOOOOM!\nThe sound wave in the narrow space sounded like the screams of Shirone and Mark.\nten-thousandth of a second.\nDespite only being given ten-thousandth of a second, a time which was too faint to be perceived with insight, Shirone somehow managed to analyze all the patterns and teleport accordingly.\nA single flash of light pierced through the Dragons Labyrinth. And in a flash of dazzling light, Shirone crossed the finish line.\nHahh Hahh.\nShirone dropped Mark onto the ground and walked a few more steps. But his body couldn't take it anymore, so he ended up curled up on the ground. There was no place in his body that was not overloaded and aching.\nNobody made a sound. The students who took in the scene were blown away. They looked at the boy who triggered this response with frightened eyes as if they were looking at a ghost.\nEthella cast Spatial Warp towards where Siena had left in search of Thadd, and shortly thereafter, the engine system turned off, and a voice echoed out.\nThe engine system of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed has been deactivated. Level 0. Level 0.\nShortly after the empty voice of the machine sounded out, the movement of the iron bar slowed to a stop, and the vine-like structure returned back to how it was initially.\nThe upperclassmen from the Advanced class were the first to speak up.\nWh-What the\nAll the students had uniform thoughts.\nIs that really possible?\nNo way. This is absurd. That was level 10. He passed the Dragons Labyrinth\nAwakened by the students voices, Shirone took a second to look around.\nHuh? Why are they all staring at me?!\nSome parts of his memory were hazy, but he at least knew he had crossed the Bridge That Could Not be Crossed.\nAs his head started to clear, and everything came crashing down, Shirone's eyes got teary as his lips trembled.\nWahhhh I really thought I was going to die.\nConsidering it was said by a person who just made history, the remark was almost\ntoo\ntasteless and uncool.\nSharelle pulled Amy in for a hug and cried out.\nShirone did it! Your boyfriend really did it!\nIt wouldve been better if she didnt mention the boyfriend part, but Amy let it go this time after feeling her teary friends sincerity.\nStudents shoved each other around to reach Shirone in order to congratulate him.\nCongratulations! You were really cool!\nSo I guess youre going to be promoted to Class 5 now. Hahaha! Class 6 kids are going to go green with envy.\nWhile Shirone was busy getting praised, the instructors that had gone to the engine room returned With Maria in tow.\nSiena first looked Shirone up and down.\nThough he did seem distracted by the surrounding students, he did not seem to be seriously injured.\nHe passed the Dragons Labyrinth? How in the world did he do that? Even the Advanced Class kids have to practice dozens of times.\nShe narrowed her eyes at the person who made her miss such a historical moment. Thadd just shrugged his shoulders and made an excuse.\nAs you know Actually, no you probably dont, but I did my best.\nSighing, Siena headed towards Alpheas.\nIt was unlikely, but since Shirone and Mark came in at the same time, Siena thought it would be better to clearly announce the results so that there would be no arguments later on.\nHeadmaster, lets first announce the win\nSiena stopped when she saw that Alpheas eyes, which always shone with intelligence, were deep in sorrow.\nIs something wrong?\nThadd approached fast.\nIll do it. He seems to have a lot on his mind right now.\nWhat? There were no casualties or major injuries, though.\nYes, but\nThadd fell silent.\nAs someone who knew of Alpheas past, he understood his teachers feelings.\nThe sight of Shirones witty and lively appearance must have reminded him of his youth.\nDont blame yourself. Its not anyones fault.\nThe House of Myrhes Light.\nAlpheas was famous because he redefined photons.\nIts an old theory now, but at the time, his idea was so unprecedented and so shocking that it even won him the Gold Circle Award, an award bestowed upon him by the Emperor.\nHowever, it was that brilliant talent of his that plunged young Alpheas into the depths of despair.\nWhat would have happened if he hadnt wandered through the dark for 10 years due to a single mistake?\nIf that hadnt happened\nAlpheas would have become an archmage etched in history.\n* * *\n* * *\nThadd tried to put up a bright face.\nHeadmaster, a word, please? A man of talent who will brighten the future of this academy has appeared.\nMm? Hoho! Right, it slipped off my mind.\nAlpheas, who smiled as kindly as ever, looked back at the students.\nThe one who passed this exam is Shirone Arian. And although there is only one victor, I would like to applaud the rest of the students who participated. The courage you showed today will be the driving force that will lead the world in the future. I hope that you will continue to work hard and achieve great results. I wish you success.\nThe upperclassmen started clapping, followed by the lowerclassmen.\nNo one could possibly grumble about Shirones early promotion now. Even Mark had to admit his loss.\nThere really is such a thing as a genius.\nThe scene in which Shirone cast teleportation at an incredible speed during the Dragons Labyrinth stage was still vividly etched in his mind.\nIt wasnt a matter of talent.\nMost would get intimidated and retreat when faced with a near-impossible situation, but there were also those who didnt run.\nAt this point, I cant even make an excuse.\nMark wobbled over to Shirone with his trembling legs.\nMost of the students knew of the existence of Marks operation team, so there was no way Shirone, who experienced it first-hand, did not know of it. But Mark was prepared.\nI lost. I wont ask you to forgive me, I dont deserve it. But do know I will take responsibility for my actions.\nShirone looked at him.\nIt was certainly out of the ordinary for a belligerent man like him to admit his defeat.\nOn the other hand, Shirone thought that since Mark had no way out of this and had to accept it, he was trying to keep his pride and face by bearing with it.\nAll right. You worked hard. I hope you do better from now on. As a person.\nHe had many complicated feelings regarding the issue, but Shirone wanted to leave the rest of it for the academy to deal with.\nAnd Seeing how Mark raised the white flag, other Class 7 students began to give congratulatory words to him.\nCongratulations, upperclassman. You were awesome.\nHaving proven his skills, no one from Class 7 even thought of treating him as someone from Class 7.\nAmy smiled subtly.\nCongrats.\nAnd after staring at Shirone for a while more, she turned around.\nLets go, Sharelle.\nAlready? You should stay with your boyfriend on a special day like this one.\nI dont have time for that. Since Shirone succeeded, its now my turn. I have to prepare for the promotion exam.\nHer steps were heavy for she did not want to leave yet, but she knew that in order to respect Shirones resolve and meet it, she had to go and train.\nYou sure its okay to just leave like this?\nAmy.\nAmy flinched when Shirone called.\nWhen she turned around, their eyes met. The students around them murmured with surprised faces.\nDid he just call her by name?\nOf course. Arent they dating?\nI mean, even then, Amy is still an upperclassman\nAmy, who had never given up her place as 1st, was more than just a simple upperclassman.\nShe was considered to be more than skilled enough to enter the Advanced Class. That was why this situation was quite a surprise for them.\nNow there are only two steps left.\nHaha\nA corner of Amys lips lifted up.\nIf she passed the Advanced Class promotion exam, the gap between Shirone and herself would be two classes.\nAmy turned around and walked down the mountain with Sharelle hot on her heels.\nAround the time the Advanced Class students started dispersing, Thadd approached Alpheas.\nHeadmaster, I have something to discuss regarding Mary.\nThadd reported everything that happened in the engine room.\nI see. What made you decide to do such a thing\nMaria bent over 90 degrees.\nIm sorry. Ive made an irrevocable mistake. I will accept any punishment readily.\nAlpheas sank deep in thought.\nHmm.\nOf course, disciplinary action was unavoidable, but there was much to consider due to the harassment she faced.\nThen first\nI have something to confess. Everything that happened today was because of me.\nAnd there stood Mark.\nWhat do you mean?\nI really got under Marias skin this morning. In fact, if I were in her shoes, I would have flipped out as well. Ill take her punishment. Im the one who caused all of this.\nSiena spoke.\nEven so, there is a problem with Marias behavior. But why are you doing this?\nI know Im a shitty person, but Im not a coward. Ill take full responsibility for my actions as well as the actions of those under me. Everything I did, I did knowingly.\nAnd that aside, the other kids know it too, anyway. Continuing to keep my mouth shut like a petty loser will only serve to embarrass me. Also, I was the one who came up with the plan to keep Shirone in check.\nI was overwhelmed in terms of skill.\nThe way Shirone jumped over walls he had yet to overcome made him envious.\nIn any case, thats what happened. I will take the heat. But please let it slide for the other kids. Especially Maria\nGlancing once at Maria, Mark spoke again.\nShe must have been under severe stress due to the constant bullying. Think about it. To do such a thing, she mustve lost her mind for a second.\nAlpheas pondered for a long time about Maria.\nAlthough her grades werent the best, she was an aspirant mage who had been training for a longer period of time. Longer than most people in the academy However, she made an awful mistake and was on the brink of being expelled.\nTeacher\nThadd looked at him with sad eyes.\nYou will both be referred to the disciplinary committee. Maria is guilty of interfering with the test by illicitly operating the engine system. Her actions caused unnecessary risks. However, since Mark gave rise to the whole situation, we will take that into account and deal with the punishments accordingly.\nAs Mark and Maria lowered their heads, other students from Class 7 also started raising their hands one by one.\nUm, I also bullied Maria. I think that makes me responsible for this as well.\nI joined the operation team and attacked Shirone.\nI did something bad, too.\nWhen all the students raised their hands, Siena spoke out, concerned.\nThis is not a class meeting. You broke the rules. And since youre all confessing, you will be punished.\nThe students did not back down.\nThese punks! If youre going to act like this, why bother breaking the rules in the first place\nEnough.\nAlpheas held her back.\nSince Shirone showed such an amazing performance, one at the level of an Advanced Class student, Im sure they felt and learned something.\nBut theres also that mob mentality. I think they think that if they hold out and confess together, theyll end up fine and with no punishment. Do you really think thats repenting for their mistakes?\nAlpheas only smiled and let out a small laugh.\nCome to think of it, I think I see an adorable side to Ms. Siena.\n......?\nDont expect much from humans. Humans are humans. There is no one who is only bad and no one who is only good. Even if they didnt plan on repenting, at least they have a strong enough conscience to confess. And considering they did confess, Im sure theyre ready to accept responsibility as well as disciplinary action.\nSiena closed her mouth shut.\nTo shoulder all responsibilities together. Such a thing can barely be seen in Class 4, let alone in the Advanced Class. Look how all of them are growing up like that. So, well, I dont exactly hate it. If only everyone in the world had this level of belief and conviction The world would be much different. Though I suppose the question is whether they can keep this level throughout their lives.\nAlpheas walked up to the students.\nI understand. In other words, you guys are saying its okay to punish everyone, is that right?\nA few were startled, but after looking at each other, they answered.\nYes!\nA corner of Alpheas mouth rose up.\nGreat. Ill reveal the details of your punishment right now. The entirety of Class 7 will be placed under probation for a month.\nWhat?!\nThe students were surprised, but the instructors were shocked.\nNot only was the period long, but this punishment meant that Class 7 would be shut down altogether.\nBut Headmaster, words of complaint will come from the students families. This will also cause conflict with the class progress\nIll be responsible for that.\nAlpheas cut the instructors words and stared at Shirone, who stood a little away from the group.\nHe looked like he had something to say, but in the end, he gave a small smile and went down the mountain.\nThe rest of the students stood stunned.\nOne month\nThey felt woozy for a second, but they didnt feel afraid.\nI-It doesnt matter! Were under probation together. None of us can take a class.\nYeah. Its much better than something like a three-day suspension. After all, probation is not even written in our academic record.\nThe students calmed down a bit.\nHaha! So what now? Do we get to play around and relax starting today?\nAs if! I have to stay up all night in the library. Why dont we all get together and study?\nYeah, lets! Maria, youre coming too, right?\nHuh? Um Thats\nMaria was conscious of what the instructors might think.\nThadd simply smiled and nodded his head. Maria then smiled and spoke shyly with teary eyes.\nYes, Ill join.\nThadd felt happy as he watched the scene. It would be awkward at first, but as long as the punishment kept the kids together, she would be fine.\nWere you aiming for this? You are always a step ahead of me, teacher.\nPerhaps this situation was a miraculous opportunity for Maria. One that would never come again in her life Just like how becoming the student of Alpheas was for Thadd.\nWe say the world is about luck But once you give up, even that string of luck will be of no help.\nIf Maria hadnt really loved magic, would she have survived that long in Class 7?\nAlthough the world was unfair, Thadd thought it was worth living for that reason.\nAs long as one held on strong and persevered, opportunity was bound to come knocking eventually.",

      "content": "Chapter 39\nShirone was promoted to Class 5.\nSiena, who knew the unique study method of the Core of Knowledge, became the homeroom instructor.\nIt was hard for Shirone to keep up with the classes as he had jumped up two levels, but Shirone decided to stick with his old method nonetheless.\nClass 5 had a test that occurred once a week and had a final exam at the end of the month that determined a students rank for that month. In the first test, Shirone placed 40th out of the 40 students.\nThere were a total of 11 different subjects, and his average score was only 32 points.\nHowever, it was worth noting that his score across all the different subjects ranged from 30 to about 33.\nThe average score for the second theory test was 34.\nA two-point improvement in average might seem insignificant. However\nHis scores for all subjects increased simultaneously.\nThe third test was similar. However, there was one slight difference this time, as there was a steeper upward trend for he scored 36 to 39.\nIts increasing all at once.\nShirones will could be felt through his progress.\nIts a relief. Staying in the lower ranks for a long period of time can lead to a decrease in self-confidence.\nSiena saw no such anxiety through his progress graph. He was just quietly walking his own path.\nTheory tests are important. It is one of the key components that helps one evaluate omniscience.\nInstructors regarded a score of about 60 or higher as the minimum standard for one to start using magic.\nIf he were to raise his average by 10 points per month, he can start using basic magic after three months. And if so\nIn less than half a year, he should be able to use basic magic.\nOf course, since humans were not machines, their aptitudes varied depending on their dispositions.\nHowever, looking at the graph now, she had a strange feeling that it might be possible since it was Shirone.\nHow far could he raise his score without missing a single subject?\nDepending on the results, the level of Shirones potential could be judged.\nHis relationships are also smooth.\nThere were no students who looked down on Shirone because of his low grades.\nBy the time the students reached Class 5, their attention was focused towards the Advanced Class rather than rankings.\nCountries around the world did not cut corners when trying to maintain the highest level of magic hierarchy. And especially in such situations, it was important for students to specialize in their major in order to differentiate themselves from other mages.\nTherefore, students who did not yet have any kind of special skills were envious of Shirone, a specialist in light.\nI, too, think he has an affinity in the Photon field.\nBut above all else, The photon field utilized omnipotence more than omniscience. This was because the limits were more so with the human brain itself rather than aptitude.\nIf Shirone had not felt the segmentation of time through insight, he would not have been able to complete the Bridge That Could Not be Crossed.\nFor this reason, Shirones classmates could not ignore him and lowerclassmen would often greet him during integrated class.\nIronically, one student amongst the lowerclassmen who followed Shirone the most was Mark, who returned after being punished.\nPlease, sit here. I saved a seat for you.\nThanks.\nThe leader of Class 7 took pride in the fact that he could be friendly with Shirone.\nOh! You were here! Any place for me?\nMark gasped and jumped up to greet Sharelle.\nHello!\nSharelle was one of the top students of Class 4, so she was an upperclassman who could not be easily approached.\nSharelle waved her hands with no care and sat right next to Shirone.\nOur Shirone, you look a bit frail these days. I mean, your lover did leave, so obviously.\nHaha! Its not like that.\nA week ago, Amy took the promotion exam and finally got promoted to the Advanced Class.\nAccording to Sharelle, she passed effortlessly, but anyone could tell how hard she trained for the exam.\nYou must be more lonely than me. You were always together with Amy.\nYeah, thats true. But its okay. Im thinking of going to the Advanced Class sometime soon.\nYes? The Advanced Class?\nSharelle was more than capable enough to get into the Advanced Class.\nThere were many talented people in Class 4, but she was a talent who stood out in terms of recovery magic.\nMoreover, since the Advanced Class was a class that only focused on majors, recovery magic that had high performance would give her many advantages.\nAlthough Im not doing it just to follow my friend Like Amy, I was inspired after seeing you. My original dream was to go work at a public health center and live whatever, but at some point, I thought it would be a waste to end it like that.\nHearing that a talented person recognized by the academy wanted to work in a public health center as her dream job caused Mark to nearly burst into tears.\nIf you say something like that, then what does that make me, senior?\nHoohoo, dont worry too much. I didnt come all the way up here knowing there was something I was particularly good at. Anyone can make it to Class 4 if they work hard enough. Shirone is just a special case.\nShirone hurriedly shook his hands.\n* * *\n* * *\nNo, I was pretty lucky too. The promotion exam last time was also something that was out of the ordinary.\nI told you, theres no need to talk like that. I assure you, you will be going up to the Advanced class sooner or later. Although Amy is saying that she will never let you be her classmate. Hoho, try your best anyways.\nHuh. Never be her classmate.\nThat was something Amy would say. And as Shirone imagined her grinding her teeth while training hard, he felt his blood heat up.\nRight. Come to think of it, did Amy decide on her major?\nWhat? You mean you still dont know? Ive had this thought for a while, but you guys really date mundanely.\nWe were always like this.\nShirone smiled and swallowed quickly. Sharelle rested her chin and fell in thought.\nHmm, Amys specialty is fire magic, and she specializes in the Target Form of the Four Way Formation. From what I heard before, it sounded like she was probably aiming to be a sniper.\nMost fire mages aimed to become battle mages, so sniper was a fairly unique field for it.\nSniper? Does that mean she wants to join the army?\nReading Shirones thought, Sharelle smiled bitterly.\nShe cant. I also think its weird for Amy to become a soldier, but its normal to choose a career based on talent. Besides, Amy is a Karmis, a 1st-class family. She will have to do anything for the honor of the family.\nShirone was worried.\nBut its dangerous work. After all, if a war begins Well, Im sure you already know.\nThat can happen, but honestly, if a war really breaks out, majors mean nothing. Anyone with a mage job will be made to fight. No exceptions. The magic academy will also become a training center to train prospective mages according to the kingdoms order. From then on, such a thing as graduation will not exist. After receiving basic military training, they must be put into service.\nIt was the bitter truth that was hard to take in.\nTo put it simply, we are just tools for the kingdom. After all, the more talented and stronger a person is, the stronger the deterrent.\nEven so\nThormia was a kingdom of great power in its own way, but peace could not be maintained at all times. So being in the military was not the safest profession.\nThis is because if a kingdom they were allied with asked for support, Amy would have no choice but to fight on the frontlines.\nMark did not take it seriously and took interest in something else.\nAmy becoming an officer in the army Im sure shed be incredibly popular in her unit. To be honest, I cant imagine her as a soldier.\nHohoho! Its because you dont know Amys personality. I personally think she fits well as one. And Shirone, dont worry too much. After all, its not like mages will sword fight on the battlefield. Snipers tend to focus on espionage and covert operations. Amy the Beauty Spy. Great name dont you think?\nHaha, I guess so.\nShirone put aside his petty worries.\nIt was true that he was worried, but it was a choice made by a talent who never lost her first place, so he was sure she could handle it.\nAfter the integrated class ended, it was time for practice, so students categorized themselves by Class.\nShirone waved goodbye to Sharelle and Mark then made his way towards his own classmates.\nAs many were the same age as him, there was a very lively and fun atmosphere.\nWow, Shirone. Youre blazing hot today as well.\nNade started off.\nHe was the same age as Shirone, and He had green hair which made him look like a troublemaker.\nHe had a cheerful personality and was a very sociable person, so there was nobody he wasnt close to. Nade was also the first person to talk to him.\nHe has a good personality.\nHis grades were somewhere in the upper-middle ranks, having no particular subject he was neither good nor bad at.\nWell, if Shirone had to pick a subject he was a little better at than others, he would say it was electric magic. This was because Nade was at a level where he could somewhat cast electric magic. And considering an affinity with electricity was quite rare, he could be considered a rare talent.\nThere was no easy magic in the world, but the electric field was a particularly difficult one to acquire omnipotence.\nIts not an attribute humans are familiar with.\nAfter hearing his story, he understood why Nade had an affinity for it.\nNades dream was to become an inventor of magical weapons, and thanks to his constant handling of machines and electricity since childhood, he found it easy to acquire omnipotence in electricity.\nBlazing hot? As if. Its so hard its killing me!\nHaha! Thats why Im here. Twos better than one.\nEverything put aside, he was a friend who had a talent for making people comfortable.\nThat was probably why Shirones classmates would go to Nade first whenever there was a topic to talk about, even if it was something trivial.\nMeanwhile, two boys started walking towards where they were, arguing to and fro.\nHey, hey! Shironade, hear this.\nShirone and Nade canceled their Spirit Zone after hearing the neologism of their two names.\nA classmate came close and questioned.\nWhich side are you, Ms. Olifer or Ms. Romie? Oh, maybe Shirone doesnt care since he has a girlfriend? What about you, Nade?\nHmm, Im, of course, Ms. Romie. Though Ms. Olifer is beautiful as well.\nOhh, my comrade! Ms. Romie is the best, Im telling you. She has a baby face! And her body Ugh!\nShirone realized again.\nIts really different from Class 7.\nI think they are both pretty.\nSiena had a calm and cool aura, while Ethellas looks triggered everyones protective instinct.\nPerhaps it was because of her curves, but even after growing, she had a baby face.\nAs Shirone started to worry about getting asked that question, his classmates suddenly left.\nEh?\nShirone thought it was strange and turned around to see a boy with an eccentric look heading towards him.\nIt was the Class 5 geek, Yiruki Mercodine.\nIt could be seen as bullying, but in Shirones opinion, Yiruki really didnt seem like a people person.\nBut even such an oddball had someone he talked to, and that was Nade, the friend of all.\nWhat fun things were you guys talking about?\nNade shrugged.\nJust the same old thing. Whos prettier, Ms. Olifer or Ms. Romie? Things like that.\nAll gone was his excited demeanor, for he purposely looked less excited in consideration of Yiruki.\nShirone admired his quick, mindful personality.\nSomething suddenly came to Nades mind.\nOh right, Shirone. Let me introduce you. This guy here is Yiruki. An outsider of Class 5.",

      "content": "Chapter 40\nIt had been a month since Shirone was promoted, but it was his first time having a direct conversation with Yiruki.\nIt wasnt like he was purposefully avoiding him. It was because there were more days of Yiruki missing classes than attending them.\nYo, Shirone Arian. Arent you the genius who caught the academys attention? Im so honored Im going to record this moment in my diary.\nJust by his first words alone, Shirone could understand why his classmates tended to keep away from Yiruki.\nHi, Im Shirone. Please take good care of me.\nKekeke, why is the genius asking for such things? Actually, Ive been watching you ever since you were in Class 7. When you succeeded in the Deviate Form and also when you crossed the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed. I was there.\nShirone had a look of surprise.\nYou watched me?\nAnd thats when he noticed.\nThis voice\nThe thin voice It was the voice that encouraged him when his Spirit Zone was shaken by the students criticisms back when he was in Class 7.\nAre you the one who cheered me on back then?\nI wouldnt call it cheering. I was just frustrated, so I said something. And I also didnt like you being swayed by the kids.\nYiruki said it as if it was a small, troublesome thing to do, but Shirone was still grateful nonetheless.\nNo, it was a huge help.\nAt that, Yiruki stared hard at Shirone.\nYou are quite a boring kid, arent you?\nHuh?\nIt was Shirones first time hearing such a thing, and it strangely offended him.\nThat was when Nade butted in.\nHey, hey Yiruki! Hes still thanking you. Its rude to say that.\nYiruki twisted his head and turned around.\nYeah? I was complimenting him. Anyway, do your best. Of course, things wont be easy. Class 5 harbors lots of obnoxious kids.\nThen he walks away with a cackle.\nHey, where are you going? Lets practice together.\nIts tiresome. Id rather just sleep.\nThe magic academy classes are tiresome?\nShirone was left dumbfounded. Class 5 was an Intermediate class. He couldnt understand how such a student got all the way up here.\nHe seems to have a little bit of a Strange personality.\nSorry, Shirone. Hes not that bad after you really get to know him.\nBut\nI know what youre thinking. We will be the only ones left tired if we try to pry. That guys a genius too. The problem is that hes a different type of genius compared to you.\nGenius? Yiruki is a genius?\nAh! You probably dont know because you havent been here for too long.\nNate told Shirone who Yiruki was. Contrary to the word genius, his grades were similar to that of Nades, but none of his classmates looked down on him for it.\nYiruki was the epitome of a master-of-one human being. He was a genius who received zeros on all subjects that were influenced by emotions, like literature and art. But for subjects that required computational ability, he was a genius who would get full marks with his eyes closed.\nAt first, the instructors went nuts over Yirukis talent and fought over who would be his homeroom instructor and be in charge of him.\nHowever, because of his eccentric personality, most of them gave up and paid no more attention to him.\nNevertheless, talks about him possibly surpassing those in the Advanced class in terms of mathematics arose, and many instructors started to observe him in order to see if he would be promoted in the near future.\nThough, if Shirone continued to raise all his subjects together, he would eventually overshadow Yiruki, who tended to cover up his weaknesses with his strongest strengths.\nThe field Yiruki performed best in was computational physics, which only a limited amount of people with special brain functions could do.\nFor example, calculating phenomena that occurred in extreme conditions such as absolute zero or high heat in the 100,000,000 degrees range or more using numerical figures.\nA person with a brain capable of such calculations often had such a thing called the Savant Syndrome.\nThe possessor of such a brain capable of mechanical calculations beyond the limits of human beings. That was who Yiruki was.\nAfter hearing the explanation, Shirone had an absent-minded look.\nIf everything Nade said was true, then it was an amazing talent.\nWhy is a person like him still in Class 5? No, even if he had no talent, scoring zero makes no sense. Even if he rolled a pencil and took a guess, he should have still gotten a few questions right.\nNade laughed.\nThe thing is, hes always been like this. About a month ago\nHe told the story of Yirukis theory test.\nIn the natural science section, he received perfect scores, but things were a whole lot different for the literature exam. His results were disappointing in the instructors eyes.\nIt was a problem that had an excerpt from a poem called by a poet named Gilberto.\nThe last verse was leaf that has fallen in zigzags, and the question asked the students to answer why the leaf fell that way. Most interpreted it as the poet expressing his fear of death But thats not what Yiruki came up with.\n* * *\n* * *\n[Answer] Since the speed of the fluid (in this case, gas) flowing on the surface of the leaf is met by different levels of air resistance, the leaf would move in the direction of the vector with the greatest sum of force exerted by the pressure. Equations using the standard model for the leaf are written below.\nEquations using the standard model for the leaf are written below\nBelow that, there was a formula that the one who was grading the test couldnt even understand. Instructors who knew Yirukis personality simply thought it was just Yiruki being himself and passed over it. But Adelia, a literature instructor, could not tolerate it.\nAs a mother of three, she rushed into the classroom with her plump body. Then in front of Yiruki, she slammed the exam paper down and demanded an explanation.\nYiruki! What is this?\nThe exam paper.\nNot that! Look at the answer you wrote! This is a literature test, not a math test!\nDoesnt the distinction between mathematics and literature itself prove the unrealistic aspects of literature? And it also asks why the leaf fell the way it did. And I answered it.\nAdelias round face turned red like a tomato.\nHow dare you brag like you know something. Youre a student. Its still a few years too early for you to act like youre an expert. There are also deep and mysterious ideas in the world that you cannot grasp mathematically.\nTeacher, theres no such thing. If some part of the world is illogical, that would be scary. If such a thing were true, then theres a possibility that I might just turn into an orc right now. Who knows?\nSo youre saying everything is logical? Even poet Gilbertos verses?\nYes. Thats why I wrote that answer.\nAdelia kept standing for a while, then pointed her finger and shouted.\nThen answer this. A thousand innocent people are at risk of dying. But you have the power to save everyone by killing one innocent person. What will you choose to do?\nId let the thousand people die. Mathematically, the lives of one thousand people who are supposed to die, and the life of one who wasnt, dont follow the rules of equivalent exchange. The equation cannot be formed in the first place.\nAdelia stomped the rising anger from deep within her.\nShe came up with something.\nIs there a god or not? Answer that!\nThere can be none.\nHis logical reply made Adelia even more virulent.\nMom or dad? You can only pick one!\nBoth.\nGet out!\nAdelias fingers trembled.\nGet out, you punk! You dont deserve to be in my class! Get out!\nA faculty meeting was held.\nIn the end, the instructors concluded that Yirukis answer contained ridicule against the authority, so they dropped all his scores for the humanities subjects to 0.\nWow, thats no joke.\nUpon hearing Yirukis story, Shirone couldnt believe he was 17 years old like himself.\nHaving the temperament to go against an instructor took courage.\nHaha! It really isnt. Anyways, hes that kind of a person. Hes extremely hard to get along with.\nNow that I know his personality, I kind of get why he called me boring. But how is that a compliment?\nWho knows? Maybe he saw something extraordinary in you. Anyway, thats why I purposely introduced you to him. In hopes that he might get along well with you.\nShirone got curious and wanted to know more about Yiruki. If he had known earlier, he would have talked more with him. With that, he searched around for Yiruki, but ended up widening his eyes in surprise.\nEh? Nade, look over there.\nYiruki was walking towards the Image Zone with half-closed eyes. As he approached, the kids around took notice and backed off, not because they wanted to avoid him, but because they respected him since he was an upperclassman.\nDamn it! What is he thinking of doing now? Lets go and see.\nShirone ran after Nade.\nOne by one, other students started gathering to watch.\nWhy is he like this again? Isnt he supposed to take his clothes off and lay down somewhere like he usually does?\nAt their words, Shirone's eyes popped open. He was gonna take his clothes off while female students were watching?\nIgnoring the audiences uneasiness, Yiruki opened up his Spirit Zone. A sphere with a diameter of 15 meters. It was on the small side, considering he was in Class 5.\nThe Deviate Form?\nThe moment Yiruki performed his Four Way Formation, his Spirit Zone broke away from his body and separated.\nOho, that guy. Its been quite a bit since he last did that.\nDont we have to stop him? That jerk was banned from using the Image Zone by Ms. Romie.\nLeave him be. Even if we tell him to stop, he wont listen.\nAt that moment, Yirukis Spirit Zone began moving around a large area.\nAmidst everyone's admiration, Yiruki saw Shirone in the audience. The edges of his lips curled up.\nHe flicked his finger and targets popped out from all directions and flew around him like birds.\nSome students simply sighed as they knew it was forbidden for students to release targets arbitrarily, while some just enjoyed the spectacle.\nWow\nThe Deviate form of the Spirit Zone pursued the targets.\nLike the bouncing of a rubber ball, Yiruki freely bent the angle of his Zone and even its speed. It was impressive.\nShirone was genuinely surprised.\nThats amazing.\nEthella, who was instructing Class 4, looked around the Image Zone once and started running.\nHuh? Yiruki! What are you doing right now?!\nSeemingly already having made up his mind, Yiruki hardened his eyes and flew his Spirit Zone to a target.\nThe moment the sphere swallowed up the target, light began to bubble like foam.\nThat lunatic!\nBy the time the students turned their backs on it, Yirukis Detonation magic was completed.\nAtomic Bomb.\nThe wind pressure caused by the explosion pushed back the people around. Some students even fell on their butts.\nKeuk!\nWhen Shirone faced forward again, he saw Yiruki standing at the end of the Image Zone.\nHe had his hands intertwined behind his back and spoke with a blank face.\nSee you next time, Shirone.\nWhat did he mean by See you next time?\nWhat was he thinking? What compelled him to do such a thing?\nShirone couldnt understand him at all, but thankfully, one question was quickly resolved.\nEthella pinched Yirukis ear and dragged him away.\nYiruki! I told you last time that if you were to do something like that again, you would be punished!\nOw, ow! I held back so that the device wouldnt break. You know what happens when I make up my mind to blow something up.\nYou! You really dont reflect on your actions until the very end! You are on probation for a week starting today! Dont come to class!\nAak! Thats too harsh!\nYiruki shouted, but he continued not to acknowledge that he had done something wrong.\nRather, while he was being dragged away, he looked at Shirone and Nade and smirked.\nHa! In the end, he did it again. Sorry, Shirone. I think Ill have to go.\nEven after Nade chased after Yiruki, Shirone did not move from his position.\nDetonation magic.\nIt was the most extreme way of handling energy.",

      "content": "Chapter 41\nThe other students who were stimulated by Yirukis action started busying themselves by talking.\nIsnt that punk amazing? Though the explosive power is the same, the detonation reaction seems to have gotten faster.\nIts probably just the Savant Syndrome doing its work. He can calculate the reaction equation at an astonishing speed.\nShirone cut in.\nYou mean the equation that causes the explosion?\nYeah. I dont know much about detonation magic, but I heard that the explosive power changes depending on how you set up the reaction equation. You could say it's a similar concept to that of the combustion equation for fire magic.\nI see. With that level of explosive power, I guess he doesnt even need to learn fire magic.\nNo. Denotation magic is used differently from fire magic. First of all, fire magic activates immediately. Even for Yiruki, if his firepower is that strong, it will take that much longer to detonate. Well, reducing that reaction time is up to the detonator.\nIf Shirone's insight specialized in teleportation, then Yirukis superhuman computational power was specialized for detonation magic.\nThe biggest advantage of detonation magic was that it could create an enormous explosion from a tiny dot.\nThe further away from the center the Deviate form got, the smaller it got. It was a magic that was optimized for the Deviate form in that respect.\nYiruki's talent, spirit zone's propensity, and his main specialty were all specialized for explosions\nWhy is Nade close to someone like that?\nShirone did enjoy reading history that involved wars with mages, but he didnt think that magic had to be so destructive.\nIve never learned magic with the intention of hurting someone.'\nHe was curious about Yiruki, but it was Shirone who thought that getting along with him was out of the question.\n* * *\nAs if he really put himself under probation, Yiruki did not come to class.\nAlthough he felt a little bad, Shirone was relieved by this.\nI wouldnt know what to say if we ran into each other again.\nAfter an ordinary day, Shirone took his first formal Class 5 evaluation.\nHis average score was 41 points.\nIt was still in the lower range, but it wasnt an easy feat to raise all subjects by 10 points in one month.\nAfter checking the test results, the students tidied up their desks and stretched.\nPhew, I guess I can lay back for a while. Shall we buy something and go to our research group?\nLets. With all the stress off my shoulders, Im feeling hungry.\nStudents started leaving in pairs or more, but not Shirone, for he was not part of a research group yet.\nI should go to the library and study some more. My average score is still 40 points\nHe was not satisfied with the results, but the process of enhancing his Core of Knowledge was going smoothly.\nShirone was pleasantly surprised when he noticed that all the knowledge was connecting much faster than he expected.\nIts proof that my network of knowledge is evolving. Lets not waver and stick to it until the end.\nThe fact that he had already finished the 20 books he had borrowed a week ago kept his spirits up.\nHey, Shirone.\nYes? What is it?\nA female student approached him as he was packing his backpack.\nFrom a corner of the classroom, her friends were eyeing them with excitement.\nIve talked with my friends about this, but would you like to join our research group? Were researching object-moving magic. We thought that if you were in our group, we could maybe make more achievements. Its also a field that has a lot to do with photon magic.\nShirone thought carefully.\nHe had received offers from several groups after being promoted, but this was the first research group that suited his aptitude.\nWhether students wanted to join or not was 100% up to them, but there was no case where joining one would be a waste of time.\nThe academys evaluation methods were largely divided into three parts. Practical exams, theory exams, and performance evaluations.\nAmong them, the performance evaluation required one research paper on whatever topic to be submitted between semesters. Thats why many students joined a research group, to save time and effort.\nMost of the students did it this way, as during vacation time, they would be able to visit their hometowns or stay at the academy to focus on fixing their weak points.\nOf course, Shirone also checked the qualifications to join a research group, but eventually changed his mind.\nSince he did not complete his work of enhancing his Core of Knowledge, his clumsy participation would only cause them harm.\nThey gave their proposal based on his previous achievements, but Shirone wasnt sure if he could match their level once all the work and activity started.\nUm Im sorry. Theres a field Im studying right now, and I havent been able to make much progress on it yet. Im planning on focusing on that for the time being.\nOh, I see. Thats a bummer.\nSorry to turn you down even though you personally made the offer.\nShe gave a light laugh.\nNo, you dont have to be sorry for anything. Let me know if you change your mind.\nThe girl went back to her group after leaving behind kind words. In fact, there were not many students in Class 5 who acted upon their emotions. Though there were eccentrics and exceptions like Yiruki.\nIm jealous. It looks fun.\nA corner of Shirones heart ached. He had friends like Rian and Amy, but Rian was studying a different field, and Amy was in the Advanced class, so she was busy.\nThey say that life is a lonely battlefield, but he felt that he couldnt get any lonelier considering he had no comrades in Class 5.\nEh? Shirone, you leaving now? Wait for me.\nNade ran towards him and put his arm around Shirones shoulder. This was a regular occurrence already.\nThe two walked to their dormitory while talking about random things. Most of their talks were about topics Shirone liked.\nThe library is fine, but there are quite a few specialized books exclusive to research groups. Come to think of it, why did you refuse earlier? Theyre a pretty decent research group.\nI just feel like I dont have enough time.\nWell, I get you. You should busy yourself with raising your theory grades first. Im still envious. I dont even have that kind of desire.\nYou have so many friends. I think it would be okay for you to join any research group.\nWhat are you talking about? I already have something like a research group. Im even the president.\nWhat? Really? I didnt know that.\n* * *\n* * *\nShirone assumed that Nade would hate belonging to a certain group, so he didnt even ask. But for him to be the president?\nWhat kind of research group is it?\nHaha! Im actually embarrassed to brag about it. There are only two people. Myself included.\nHuh? Isnt that below the minimum? Your subsidy should have been long cut off.\nThe academy required at least three or more members in a research group. It was because two was company, while three was a crowd.\nOur upperclassmen graduated last semester. Thats why I became the president. But yeah, Ive been really worried about that.\nOh, so thats what happened.\nThere were numerous research groups in the academy, but having one with Advanced-class members was rare. Moreover, the fact that they graduated meant that they were cream of the crop upperclassmen.\nIf its okay, can I take a look?\nReally? I thought you werent interested in research groups.\nI have always been interested, but I felt that if I joined one, Id just be a nuisance. I was just being careful.\nHahaha! What are you saying? Even though its called a research group, its just kids grouping up to study and play together. There is no need to feel any pressure.\nHmm Is that so?\nActually, to be honest with you, you have a side that makes it difficult for people to approach you. You know, kids our age hit on each other, play around, tease, and do all that. And although Class 5 does have its share of vulgar fellows as well, Ive chatted with most of em, and there arent any bad guys. So open up a little more.\nRealizing that both Rian and Amy reached out first, Shirone took note of those words.\nNoticing Shirones attitude change, Nade shouted as if he had made up his mind.\nGreat! Im feeling good. I dont normally do this, but this is a special case. Let me introduce you to my research group. In exchange, dont tease me and say that it was boring or lame.\nReally? Thanks a lot. I swear I wont tease you or anything like that.\nThere you go again. Why so serious? Loosen up. Now, come on, lets get going!\n* * *\nThe place Nade took Shirone to was a remote place northwest of the central park of the Magic Academy.\nIn front of them was a building formed out of 100 tetrahedron-shaped structures that were all connected together to create one building.\nThe material of the building was iron, and if one looked closely, one could see magic patterns engraved on the surface.\nShirone was surprised by the shape and structure of the building since it defied common sense.\nWhere is this?\nIts a warehouse we use to keep the magic equipment. Almost all teaching materials are kept in there. Of course, our labs there too.\nThe laboratories were not specifically assigned. When the president of a research group submitted their application documents, the academy would simply give an empty room to them.\nEven so, a warehouse?\nShirone couldnt understand why the academy, considering the vast land in its possession, would place a lab in such a remote place.\nThis place is something akin to a hideout. Upperclassmen have been protecting it for generations. Actually, our research group has quite a long history. You dont know how many fights there were to occupy this place.\nBut this is a bit\nHaha! Its okay. The coolest thing is the countless materials in the warehouse. You can make anything. Oh, thats supposed to be a secret. Im only telling you this because it's you.\nShirone gasped.\nReally?\nHe was quite surprised. Nade, the king of normalcy at the academy, breaking rules?\nCome, Ill show you.\nNade led Shirone into the building. As the building was complex, there were multiple entrances and exits. It was like wandering around in a maze.\nHow is it? Cool, right? You dont have to study it so closely though. We change the structure of the building whenever.\nChange the structure? Is that possible?\nThe official name of this building is Estas, the magic warehouse. The building itself is a magic device. It was made with the concept of allowing the building to bring us the items we need Or bring a section of the building we need. Its quicker than having to manually go somewhere to get something and then go back. Thats why there are times when the structure changes on days when students are training. The point is, no matter what you do, if we dont want you to find us, you wont find us.\nNade ended with a cackle.\nA hideout no one can find\nShirones heart thumped loudly. In the end, when in the face of cool things, he acted the same as any other boy his age.\nTo be honest, finding the path is simple. But youre not a member yet, so I cant tell you that. Let me know if you have any thoughts. You're always welcome.\nNade quickly led Shirone through a complex path that made them pass through 20 warehouses. Finally, the two arrived at a building with blue-painted walls.\nThere were about 10 large warehouses and 10 small warehouses located in the building. Nades research group stayed in the largest one.\nTada! Here we are!\nShirone approached with a nervous face.\nWhat kind of research group hides in a place like this?\nAt that moment, Shirones eyes landed on a signboard that was hanging crookedly above the iron door.\nSupernatural Psychic Science Research Group\nPsy-Psychic Science?\nShirone murmured in bewilderment.\nHe had thought about many different fields while on his way here, but he hadnt even thought of psychic science.\nAn excited Nade suddenly spoke quickly.\nHow is it? Our research group is awesome, right? We literally do research on the supernatural. Ghosts, spirits, the afterlife, aliens, hell, gods. It encompasses all that.\nAt first, Shirone thought it was absurd, but after hearing a bit more, Shirone was not totally uninterested.\nThe topic that caught his attention was\nGods.\nSome mages denied the existence of god/s.\nOf course, each country had its own state religion, and there were priests who performed miracles. However, their abilities were also considered just another form of magic.\nOn the other hand, some religious people regarded magic as just a type of miracle, while some labeled magic as heresy.\nWho is right?\nDoes a god really exist?\nYeah, sounds interesting. I dont know if it has anything to do with magic, but it might be worth studying.\nRight? I knew you would understand. Come in. Make yourself at home.\nNade opened the door.\nShirone imagined a neat research area filled with books that covered their research topics But instead, a thick cloud of dust welcomed him.\nCough Cough\nSeeing as how a thick cloud of dust welcomed him the moment he opened the door, Shirone frowned and was not looking forward to seeing the rest of the space.\nThe room was about 534 square feet. The desk had a broken leg and was filled with bread and crumpled papers.\nAnd he told me they renovated the warehouse\nAs a matter of fact, it seemed that only the sign had been renovated.\nHahaha! A little dirty, isnt it? Youll get used to it after a while. Dont just stand there, come in, come in.\nShirone did not understand why he had to get used to it.\nWhy not just clean the place up.\nHowever, even those questionable things disappeared the moment he saw the board hanging in front of him.\nThere was a boy who was writing mathematical formulas at an insane speed.\nAs Shirone approached, he noticed it was a familiar figure.

      "content": "Chapter 42\nShirone was speechless. Nade gave a sheepish smile and explained the situation.\nSorry. Actually, our research group has a bit of notoriety. Its a bit difficult to reveal our members.\nNow Shirone understood why Yiruki was close to Nade, but aside from that, his confusion stemmed from the fact that Yiruki was in the Supernatural Psychic Science.\nConsidering that Yiruki followed and praised logic, him being in an unscientific group was extremely surprising for Shirone.\nYou mean Yiruki is interested in stuff like this?\nNade shook his head.\nNo, its actually the opposite. Hes approaching it from the opposite side. He believes that theres nothing illogical in this world. So what better group could there be to join than this one?\nEven amidst Nades and Shirones conversation, Yiurki murmured something as if he hadnt noticed anything.\nThen after looking Nades way, he noticed Shirone. His face brightened.\nShirone!\nHe approached without even giving Shirone time to say hello and shook his shoulders.\nYou came just in time. I just came up with something great! That great thing is Splitting the smallest matter! You might think how splitting the smallest is possible. Thats exactly what Im saying. If you split the smallest matter, its no longer a substance! So then, what the hell is it? Ive been doing the math for three days, and to my surprise, my god! It contains tremendous energy! What if this whole thing is possible? Hm? What do you think will happen? Quickly, tell me.\nYiruki spoke so fast Shirone couldnt clearly understand, but seeing as how Yirukis eyes were burning with passion, he felt like he had to say something.\nU-Um, well? The energy will be released?\nAn enormous explosion! An unimaginable explosion! An explosion that can blow up an entire city! Can you imagine it? Huh? If its you, you might be able to imagine it!\nShirone was dumbfounded.\nOf course, he could imagine, but it was terrifying to even think about.\nIf that happens, a lot of people will die.\nWhat do you mean? Im telling you, its an explosion! An explosion! The city will be completely blown away!\nThats what Im saying! What will happen to the people living in the city if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur?\nHuh? The people living there?\nYiruki tilted his head, unable to understand what Shirone was saying. Shirone finally realized something and asked again.\nYou Youve never thought about that, have you?\nOf course not. Whats of importance is how big the explosion can be. Do I have to bother thinking about things like that?\nShirone got goosebumps.\nHow could you? Does it make sense that a mage doesnt even consider the ramifications of his magic?\nYou talk foolishly, Shirone. Leave those things for anthropologists to ponder over. It is the duty of a genius to breakthrough. Its not that other mages don't do it even though they can. Its simply because they cant. The genius-ness given to us only exists so that we do something with it.\nGenius or not, I dont care! Id rather be a fool than be a genius who chooses to harm people.\nYiruki did not back down either.\nHandful geniuses lead the majority that are fools. History proves it. Its also the unwanted reality in which we belong, Shirone, you should know how much I hate rubbing idealism in someones face.\nNo, your logic is derived from defeatism, not reality. Ideals can come true.\nAn ideal is only that. Something that we WISH could be.\nConsidering how heated their debate had gotten, Nade finally decided to break them apart.\nNow, now, stop it. Discussions and debates are all good, but emotional fights are a no-no. Lets sit down and talk calmly.\nNo, I have nothing to say. Nade, Im leaving.\nShirone opened the door and left.\nSeeing the benignant Shirone leave so coldly meant he was really angry.\nH-Hey Shirone, wait up! How are you going to find your way out alone?\nLeave him. Its not like the structure has changed. He should have at least memorized the way to get here. If he cant even do that, then hes really stupid.\nBy the time Nade opened the door and left the room, Shirone was already walking out of the building.\nReturning back to their hideout, Nade frowned and asked.\nWhy did you do that? You could have said it in a more acceptable way.\nI dont know why I did that either. Ill admit, I was a little aggressive. After all, he is my rival.\nWhaaat?\nIt was extremely rare for the word rival to leave Yirukis mouth. Not because he was arrogant, but more so because Nade knew his friend wasnt interested in competition.\nIts not just a competition to him.\nRelationship with the opposite sex, wealth, fame. Nothing could move him.\nThe only thing Yiruki was crazy about was the mathematical expression he considered the most beautiful in the world.\nShirone is your rival? Are you serious about that?\nYiruki smirked and sat down on the sofa, causing a cloud of dust to fume into the air.\nShirones early promotion exam. Did you see it?\nI saw it. Thats why hes our classmate.\nDo you know how fast a person who first learned teleportation must think to pass level 10? And the Dragons Labyrinth at that?\nWhile Nade kept quiet, Yiruki tapped his head.\nIts impossible without an enormous division of time. According to my calculations, Shirone must have made his decisions in a ten-thousandth of a second.\nA ten-thousandth of a second\nAs Nade tried to imagine that, Yiruki let out a shrill laugh and cackled.\nThats the mystery of insight. Faster than effort while also being more accurate than knowledge. Any conscious calculations will be slower than intuition. But, say, Nade.\nYirukis eyes gleamed.\nWhat if it was me?\nShirones insight versus Yirukis calculation speed, the question was which of the two would be faster.\nThe question remained unanswered.\nLike a showdown between different species of animals from different myths, Nade's blood rushed just thinking about it.\n* * *\n* * *\nAfter being called out by Siena, Shirone followed her into the teachers lounge.\nShe spoke as she set down the teacup.\nNow, since I was treated last time, its my turn this time.\nHaha, thank you.\nHe seems to be faring much better than when he was in Class 7.\nShe heard that Shirone had grown a bit bolder and even joked around with his classmates.\nWhy did you call me over?\nI saw your report card and noticed that youve been consistently growing. Im particularly happy that the subject I teach, chemistry, is your highest grade.\nHehe. Its still only by one point.\nIn Sienas point of view, that single point was enough to build up her pride.\nHonestly, I didnt expect him to last this long.\nNo matter how much of a genius one was, once one reached a certain point, their talents and weaknesses in certain fields would show.\nHowever, Shirone maintained an average of 45 points for all subjects.\nThat means Shirones limits are higher than I expected.\nSiena, who came to a conclusion, said.\nIf you continue like this, youll be able to make it to the upper-middle ranks starting next month. The academy will also start paying attention to your way of studying.\nAh, I wasnt trying to attract attention to myself.\nOf course, I know. Thats why I called you, to make a proposal.\nA proposal?\nDid you know that there is a practical evaluation every two months? After looking into it, there is a targeting exam at the end of this month. Do you know what that is?\nYes, I saw it while Amy was still in Class 4. Its a test where you hit a target within a certain amount of time. Amy in particular was very fast because shes a target type. It was amazing.\nShirones eyes were shining.\nSiena felt that his strong suit was that he was unconcerned with superiority and inferiority.\nThats right. Amy seems to have adjusted well to the Advanced class. You must be sad to be separated from your girlfriend.\nThe Advanced class and the Intermediate class were far apart, and they also had different curricula, so there were nearly no opportunities to meet.\nThey could go on a date on the weekends, but they werent actually dating, and Shirone didnt want to disturb her either.\nIts enough that I know shes working hard. I have to support her as her boyfriend.\nSiena smiled\nAt first, she was concerned, but if their relationship stayed like this, she would rather encourage it.\nIts rare to see a couple like you guys. Alrighty, lets get down to business. The reason I called you today is because of the practical evaluation. Besides teleportation, have you learned any other magic?\nNo. As you can see from my grades, I havent met the standard yet Oh! Thats right!\nShirone realized belatedly.\nI have to use active magic during the practical evaluation.\nThere was no need to insist on attack magic, but the only magic that Shirone could use was teleportation, which was a passive magic. Passive magics were magics that affected the caster.\nOn the other hand, active magics were magics that affected the world itself. There were various types, such as Fire, Windcutter, Healing, Ice Sword, Lightning Bold, and Atomic Bomb.\nWhat should I do? I have to know at least one active magic to be able to attack the targets, but I totally forgot about learning one because I was busy studying.\nNothing to worry about. Since youve mastered the Rainbow Drop, a simple active magic should be nothing.\nBut my average theory grade is 45 points. You said that the minimum in order to cast active magic is 60.\nUsually, it is. But you have something going for you Your knowledge that nearly reaches 100 points.\nYes?\nShirone blinked once and shouted.\nAH! The Photonization theory!\nThats right. There are also several different types of photons. Since youve studied enough theory, youll be able to apply that.\nRight! Thank you, Ms. Siena.\nAs your supervising instructor, its something I have to do. If you face any difficulties in the future, consult me anytime.\nOkay, then Ill consult you right now. What kind of active magic can I develop from the photonization theory?\nSiena smiled at the key question.\nHave you ever heard of photon output?\nI read it in a book. Is it the shooting of photons outward?\nIt was a phenomenon called photon emission.\nOf course, due to the nature of photons, shooting them outwards didnt mean something special would occur.\nIf one were lost in the mountains, it would be easier to cast lighting magic to light up the surroundings than to light the surroundings through photon emission.\nEven the theory of photonization, which was called the great discovery, varied in efficiency depending on how it was used.\nShirone asked.\nI can take the test itself, but is it really efficient to study for it? Wouldnt it be a waste of time?\nSienas thoughts were different.\nIn terms of the present, yes. However in the advanced magic society, for example, in the Ivory Tower, some view photon output as the future of mankind.\nShirone listened carefully.\nIt is often overlooked, but the really important thing is that there is no matter faster than light. Besides, collimation is easy to control. It is viewed that way because, due to the way photons work, it can lead to innovations in the field of information and communication in the future.\nAh, I see.\nThe future of photon output is bright. It wouldnt be a bad idea to master it in advance.\nShirone nodded.\nYes. Its fine as long as I dont waste any time. As you said, I will start practicing today.\nIn any case, the only magic he could learn immediately for the exam was photon emission.\nAfter the consultation, Shirone headed to the training grounds.\nThere was not much time left until the practical evaluation, so he was on a tight schedule.\nAlright, lets do this!\nShirone held out his hand and focused.\nMagical action.\nMagical action referred to a mage taking a special action or posture to strengthen his omnipotence.\nHere goes!\nNo light shot out.\nDarn!\nWhile his omniscience was perfect, he couldnt reach the omnipotence required for photon emission.\nTeleportation was easy though\nShirone was more inclined towards defensive and passive magics rather than offensive magics, which was what photon output was mainly used for.\nSwitching to an offensive type means I have to give up a lot of Spirit Zone area. Even so\nDoes that mean I cant cast photon output in its entirety?\nNo way. Even students with a smaller Spirit Zone than me can use simple active magic.\nSuddenly, Ethellas words regarding Spirit Zone strengthening came to Shirones mind.\nThere must be a special method. What could it be?\nShirone, who was thinking hard, noticed an inconsistency.\nSpirit Zone is the most sensitive state of mind. How can I strengthen it?\nOn his first day, questions mounted high in heaps.",

      "content": "Chapter 43\nThe next day.\nShirone headed to the training grounds early in the morning. There were an unusual amount of students already there.\nEveryone is thinking the same, I see.\nHe was more motivated than ever to start training in preparation for the practical evaluation.\nThe test subjects varied per class, but the class which Shirone belonged had targeting, a.k.a the evaluation called Speed Gun.\nUgh! I guess today Ill practice for Speed Gun until I die. Its the subject Im least confident in. Target types are lucky, theyll have the advantage.\nNot necessarily. The Target Form works best against a small number of targets, but during the evaluation, there will be a lot of them. Wouldnt it be better to convert to Offensive Form and explode them at random?\nThen youll get tired early. Still, its either Offensive Form or Target Form. No one would ever use the Deviate Form. How would they catch up with all the targets?\nThere are exceptions. I mean, look at Yiruki. Wont he use the Deviate form again?\nHaha! No way, unless hes an idiot. But aside from that, Im curious about Shirone. Hes strong in actual live practice. Is he going to find a breakthrough using the Defense Form?\nThough they were not top-rankers, Shirone and Yiruki were often mentioned.\nThe expectation was that they would show an exceptional performance at a decisive moment.\nThough, it was also not unreasonable to think that Yiruki would cause a disaster this time around.\nOn the other hand, Shirone wanted to cry.\nStrong in live practice? As if. He hadnt even successfully cast the Photon Output yet.\nUgh, what do I do? Im getting antsy.\nAt that moment, the other side of the training ground suddenly grew noisy.\nThe girls were the first to notice the sound of a dog barking. The boys, who belatedly noticed it as well, ran towards the noise.\nWhat the How did it get in?\nMust be a dog from the mountains. But whys it barking like that?\nAs people started gathering around it, the dog started getting defensive and growled. It bore its teeth.\nThen the students from Class 7 started throwing stones.\nHey! Get out of here! Youre making our days worse!\nThe upper class didnt even try to stop them.\nThey thought that since the dog was hostile to people, it was no different from a wild beast.\nConversely, Shirone, who had been listening carefully to the dogs howling, ran to the dog with a surprised expression.\nWait a minute! Stop throwing stones!\nMark moved quickly.\nHey, HEY! You guys are going too far! Your upperclassman is telling you to stop.\nWhile the students from Class 7 stood frozen, Shirone strode towards the dog.\nMark followed behind.\nIts dangerous. Its a wild dog.\nIt doesnt matter if they grew up in the wild, dogs dont typically bite people as an instinct. They actually rather run away than fight.\nBut its barking like that!\nThats probably\nThe dog growled, but it couldnt bear to attack, so it backed off.\nCapitalizing on this, Shirone looked straight into the dogs eyes and pushed it back into the woods.\nAs expected, a tiny puppy was lying in the grass.\nIt hurt its leg.\nHuh? Youre right. Guys, theres a puppy. A puppy.\nShirone stopped Mark.\nDont call them yet. If the dog feels that we might threaten the pup, it will attack.\nOh, I see. Hey! Dont come, dont come!\nInstead, can you find someone who can use Recovery magic? Someone from Class 5.\nHe thought it would be nice if Sharelle could help, but no matter how close he was, he couldnt call an upperclassman.\nMaria knows how to. Give me a minute, Ill bring her.\nAfter her probation ended, Maria, guided by Thadd, had a much brighter personality.\nOh my! How did it get hurt like this?\nIt looks like it was bitten because it got caught up in a territorial fight. Can you heal it?\nYes, I can. This small of an injury is easy.\nMaria healed the dog and the puppy with Recovery magic. The puppy, which regained its health, ran around in circles. The mother then stopped barking and took her pup back to the mountain.\nThats amazing. How did you know there was a puppy?\nHm? Haha! I lived in the mountains for a long time.\nShirone recalled when he was 11 years old. He had gone hunting with his father.\nThey were lucky that day. A red bear, which was known for its value as even the claws could be sold for money, was caught on a rope and was struggling. Vincent had hurriedly aimed his arrow at it, not giving it time to tear the rope.\nShirone waited behind anxiously. If they were to catch a red bear, they wouldnt have to worry about food for the time being.\nBut the arrow showed no sign of being released. Shirone turned his head in question, but Vincent had already retracted his bow and was preparing to leave.\nI couldnt be any more unlucky. Lets go back, Shirone.\nHuh? Why dont you catch it? Mom would surely love it.\nVincent squatted down and pointed to where the bear was being held.\nLook over there, Shirone.\nShirone looked carefully. It was a bear cub whimpering next to its captive mother.\nA hunter doesnt catch a mother with a cub. Even though they are animals, they love their young the same way we humans do.\nBut then were at a loss. There's amazing prey over there.\nVincent looked at Shirone with a warm gaze.\nJust as that bear has a cub, I have you too. As a parent, how can I just ignore that? Fighting to live is the same for everyone. It doesnt matter if youre a human or animal. But you shouldnt kill a parent in front of their child. It is an unwritten rule that applies to all living things.\nShirone couldnt express it in words, but he felt something get engraved into his heart.\nSomething that would never be forgotten even after a lifetime.\n* * *\n* * *\nThe students were moved by Shirones story.\nAh\nYour dads amazing.\nYeah. No wonder Shirone is so kind.\nAs Shirones classmates also joined in to say something, Yiruki appeared and decided to pour cold water on the warm atmosphere.\nThats a stupid theory. Hunters dont let go of their prey just because of that.\nEveryone turned their heads in discontent at Yirukis words, even the lowerclassmen.\nBut Yiruki kept calm.\nThe reason why hunters dont kill animals with babies present is so that the baby wont grow up to be aggressive towards humans. In zoology, this is called the imprinting effect. Once the parents become hostile to humans, their offspring inherit their nature, and it becomes increasingly difficult to hunt them. But if you kill the young, the population would be cut off.\nShirone choked up in tears. Of course, Yiruki was saying things without knowing anything, but his remark was an insult to his fathers sentiment.\nHow can you say that? Of course, there are hunters who may think that way, but most hunters release the beast out of compassion.\nHeart. Emotion. How they wanna package it is up to them. Im talking about reality. Unlike you, I dont delude people with foolish idealism.\nWhat?! Are you done talking?!\nShirone got up quickly and glared at Yiruki. This was their 2nd argument.\nThe student onlookers were dumbfounded. Shirone was not the type to fight anyone, while Yiruki didnt get along with anyone. When the two collided, the tensions soared multiple folds.\nWhat is this? Did something happen between those two before? It seems like this is a continuation of something.\nTheyre keeping each other in check. After all, those two are definitely among the candidates to be promoted next.\nShirone narrowed his eyes and glared. Yiruki, on the other hand, looked around and did something else. It was clear he did not want to fight.\nHey, hey! Why are you guys like this again? No wonder it was quiet. Since a teacher is coming, lets go back.\nThanks to Nade interfering and tearing the two apart, it didnt turn into a big fight, but Shirone was still displeased.\nHe couldnt understand Yirukis way of thinking. First, his researching of a power strong enough to blow up a whole city. Secondly, belittling the lives of animals. Shirone did not like Yirukis perspective on things.\nWhatever. Ill stop confronting him from now on.\nClass started.\nAs Ethella climbed up the mountain, The mouths of the students dropped due to her unusual appearance.\nWas it because it was the practical evaluation period? She was wearing a training suit with short sleeves. She also wore shorts that revealed her thighs for easier movement.\nMost shocking of all was that she was not wearing glasses.\nThe male students minds went blank at the sight of her. How could ones appearance change so much?\nYou guys all know that there is a special education starting from today onwards, right? The Speed Gun exam for Class 5 will be held first due to the practice ground circumstances. Please note that the time allocations will be divided by class starting tomorrow. In any case, todays class will begin after we watch the assistants demonstration. Samuel, this way.\nA tall, handsome blond man stood in front of the students. He seemed to be in his early 20s and had long hair stretching down to his waist, which was uncommon.\nThe teaching assistant standing before you is Samuel, who is preparing for his graduation from the Advanced class. His major is Incantation magic, and today he came to demonstrate some magic. It is related to strengthening your Spirit Zone as well, so pay attention.\nThe students gave a big round of applause, especially the female students.\nNice to meet you. It feels like it was just yesterday that I was in your shoes. Time sure does fly. Although Im not too skilled, Ill do my best in hopes that it will help with your education.\nAdvanced Class.\nShirones eyes sparkled.\nIt was an opportunity to see how good the students who were competing with Amy were.\nShouts of awe burst out as Samuel opened his Spirit Zone in the Image Zone.\nWow\nA Spirit Zone 42 meters in diameter was surrounding him.\nSamuel spoke.\nIncantation magic is used to strengthen magic through the power of words. First of all, lets try to cast Tornado with no incantation for comparison. Tornado.\nA powerful tornado was cast in a short moment. Samuel raised both his hands lightly as if to support it.\nF-Fast.\nThere were students in the Intermediate Classes who knew Tornado, but Samuels proficiency with it was on a whole other level.\nSamuel spoke with a kind smile.\nPlease remember the strength of the spell. This time, Im going to use Incantation magic to strengthen it. By using the will contained in the words, the mages mental gets stronger.\nSamuel recited a poem consisting of eight phrases.\nEarth of furor, I borrow thy power, so touch my hand. Looking down at the sky, the history of achievement, be captured in a moment. When the power of inanity is in the hands\nThe faces of the students got painted with boredom as they felt like they were now in a literature class.\nThough not long after, Samuel spoke, holding his hands up again.\nTornado.\nAs the tornado burst out with a tremendous explosion, the students couldnt help but hold their breath.\nThe wind was so condensed that Samuels figure looked hazy.\nThis is the power of Incantation. Words have a will of their own, and when savored, it strengthens the mind. Speak and ruminate. That is the basic system of Incantation magic.\nHaa.\nAs the frozen-stilled students let out a breath, Samuel spoke with a smile.\nNow lets get down to business.",

      "content": "Chapter 44\nThe students were stupefied.\nG-Get down to business?\nThey were bewildered because the power Samuel had shown just now was enough to really showcase the power of Incantation magic.\nEarth of furor.\nSamuel recited the same poem again.\nOne difference was that the speed at which he spoke became faster.\nI borrow thy power so touch my hand. Looking down at the sky, the history of achievement, be captured in a moment.\nIt was almost frightening how fast he sped up. His words were almost incomprehensible.\nThesacredlandoftheskyexistsinthyheart,andthewillofthemageistoextolandsingsongsofpraiseintheworld!\nAnd finally, a sound that could not be considered as language broke and spread out.\nSamuels face distorted terribly while the sound he was creating resembled that of a dolphins cry.\nThe speed of the incantation seemingly reached its limit.\nHe recited the phrases that took 2 minutes to complete in 4 seconds.\nHe cast the magic while clutching his chest.\nBOOOOM!\nA huge whirlwind with a mixture of dirt and dust soared through the sky.\nAAAHH!\nThe loud shouts of children from the lower classes were heard, and a strong wind swept past their seats.\nBy the time the dust disappeared, Samuel had a peaceful expression with a soft smile on his face.\nAfter the tinnitus disappeared from the ears of the students, Samuel explained calmly.\nThat, everyone, was the basis of Incantation magic. Its called Supersonic magic.\nIt is an indispensable skill in battle. Of course, its not just about speaking fast. It may have been simply a noise to you, but I ruminated over and over the full meaning of the phrases. I think the power of the whirlwind that every one of you has seen serves as proof of that.\nAs they were still in a daze, nobody replied back, but everyone agreed with Samuels words.\nIt was the same for Shirone.\nThe Power of Incantation\nThe last whirlwind that was 10 times more powerful than the first.\nIs this the level of the Advanced Class?\nNot to mention, he was the teaching assistant that Ethella chose, so he must have been in the top ranks in the Advanced class.\nBut regardless, he was still a student.\nThe thought that Amy was competing with such people made him nervous, but at the same time, something hot flared inside him.\nI'll definitely reach that position.\nThe other students seem to have felt the same way because their eyes looked slightly different from before.\nThis was the exact reason why Ethella called a teaching assistant.\nGood work, Samuel. The students should have picked up a few things. Thank you for following through despite the difficult request.\nNot at all, Ms. Ethella. Just call me up anytime, Ill be happy to help.\nCompared to the comfortable way the Intermediate class acted around Ethella, Samuel bowed his head politely.\nThat is the kind of world for mages.\nShirone realized anew who he was taking lessons from.\nOnce Samuel eventually graduated, he would be a non-certified Grade 10 mage. However, the instructor in front of him was a Grade 6 mage, and a state-certified one at that.\nHow strong is she, our teacher?\nThe other students must have registered this fact as well, as even after Samuel left, they were filled with reverence.\nOkay, everyone. Did you enjoy the demonstration of Incantation magic?\nYes!\nHearing the louder-than-usual reply, Ethella nodded, satisfied.\nThe reason why I decided to show you Incantation magic is because its closely related to the strengthening of your Spirit Zone that you will learn about today. Now, do you think you can answer this question? What is the best way to strengthen your thoughts?\nThe students responded unanimously.\nThrough words!\nCorrect. Because thoughts are made up of words. So in other words, what does this mean?\nClass 4 was the one who answered.\nYou can materialize your thoughts.\nYes, exactly that. Whatever you think, you can see it with your own eyes. Now, close your eyes and try. See if you can see your thoughts.\nThe students who actually tried realized what it felt like to see their thoughts.\nIf you can see it with your eyes, it means its real. Thats the main point of Incantation. Incantation mages materialize the words they speak.\nEthella raised her index finger and explained.\nThe basic system of Incantation magic is simple. Speak and ruminate. Speak and ruminate. They continue to amplify the meaning of the words this way and strengthen the magic.\nA student from Class 7 asked.\nMs. Ethella, then can we learn Incantation, too?\nEthella smiled.\nWould you like to?\nYes. That older brother just now was really cool.\nRight. Choosing a major is important. But unfortunately, since Incantation magic is a major, it will not be covered in Intermediate class.\nThen how do we strengthen our Spirit Zone? Werent we gonna do it through Incantation?\nAnd that is what I will explain starting now. Incantation is used to increase the power of certain magic. There are countless kinds of magic in the world, and there are also different languages to express that magic. However, the Spirit Zone purely operates through mentality, so theres no need for you to learn linguistic or supersonic techniques.\nEthella paused for a moment and entered the Image Zone.\nIn order to strengthen your Spirit Zone, a unique concentration method called the Sequence method is required. Raise your hand if you have ever counted from 1 to 100 either in your head or through your mouth.\nMost of the students raised their hands.\nGood. How about 1 through 1,000?\n* * *\n* * *\nThose who lowered their hands looked around.\nAll of the Class 4 students raised their hands, but only a few from the lower-level classes were seen.\nThe Sequence method is literally a technique that expands numbers. Contrary to language, numbers are symbols in the state of axiom. So it meshes well with the Spirit Zone.\nSo youre saying that counting increases concentration?\nThat is correct. Of course, you cant simply count numbers. That wont do anything. Essentially, its the same as Incantation. Speak and ruminate. However, In the case of the Sequence method, you have to\nthink\nand ruminate. The Sequence method will not work unless you focus on each and every number individually.\nExcept for the fact that language was replaced with numbers, it had a similar mechanism to Incantation magic.\nSo thats why we were shown a demonstration first.\nEthellas explanation continued.\nThe faster the number expands, the stronger the Spirit Zone becomes. In other words, all parts such as the probability of a magic being activated and its precision are increased. However, you do have to keep a few things in mind. The Sequence method is not omnipotent. The Spirit Zone can only really be enhanced through rigorous mental discipline. So in the future, dont rely too much on technical enhancements. That being said, I will now demonstrate the Sequence method myself.\nAfter the explanation, Ethella spread out her Spirit Zone but limited it to a diameter of about 10 meters for her demonstration.\nI will now perform the Sequence method. I will strengthen the currently visible Spirit Zone with only the Sequence method. Since this is not an Incantation, I will tell you the expansion of numbers in units and multiples of 10. Lets begin. One.\nAs soon as Ethella spoke the number, the Spirit Zone visibly grew.\n100.\n100? Did she just say 100?\nLike Incantation, one needed to accurately perceive and recognize each number in order for the Sequence method to be effective.\nEven so, counting to 100 in one second meant that the speed of her number expansion was insanely high.\n400.\nThe students eyes grew to the size of saucers.\nSuddenly, Ethella started to accelerate for it took her less and less time to pass an interval.\n1,000. 1,700. 2,400.\nShirone was absolutely stupefied.\nNo way.\nHow could a human being count that fast?\nIt did not even pass 10 seconds, but Ethella technically added 1+1 2,400 times while also ruminating on it.\nAs a result, the size of her Spirit Zone swelled into a sphere with a diameter of 30 meters.\nIt was only strengthened using the Sequence method.\nWhen the sequence reached 10,000, the Spirit Zone gradually got smaller in size.\nHuuu\nHer concentration which allowed her to count to 10,000 in one breath proved that she was worthy of her position as the youngest bishop of the Karsis Order.\nShes really amazing. How much do you have to train your mind to reach that level?\nThe students were shocked. Even Ethellas appearance seemed dim when compared to her abilities.\nDid you see? Depending on how quickly you perform the Sequence, the range of its enhancement increases. Since it is only a technique, if the Spirit Zone itself is insufficiently practiced, the method will also be inefficient. However, I think everyone here can use it effectively depending on the situation.\nShirone shouted Eureka.\nThats it!\nShirone found the easiest way for him to use active magic despite his convergent and defensive tendencies.\nTo strengthen the Spirit Zone using the Sequence method.\nEthella gave advice.\nThe basis of the Sequence method puts 1 to 1,000 as the standard. Until you get used to it, focus on shortening your reach to 1,000.\nAfter the class was over, the students scattered and started immersing themselves in the Sequence technique.\nAfter expanding the Sequence from 1 to 1,000, Shirone immediately checked his measured time.\nTook me 48 seconds.\nIt was an okay result considering it was his first try.\nMost of all, the best part was that he finished counting up to 1,000 without stopping once.\nIn fact, it was normal for first-timers to lose concentration halfway through.\nI have no problem with counting itself. Shall I expand the Sequence further? No, teacher told us to focus on shortening the time it takes us to reach 1,000.\nJudging from Ethellas personality, she mustve determined that her previous demonstration was enough for her current class.\nThe 10,000 mark was just a model. An example. That must mean theres a much higher level than that. Is it really possible through just counting numbers? If there is an actual special way\nAt that moment, a possibility came to Shirones mind.\nThe time fragmentation effect that he experienced while crossing the Bridge That Could Not Be Crossed.\nInsight. Just as you can count the number of leaves, you can count numbers, but also feel them at the same time. I can group individual numbers into units and process them at once.\nShirone did not know this, but what he thought of at that moment was the Concept of Modularity, which was the basic principle of Information magic.\nShirone immediately started putting it into practice.\nSet the module unit to 10, and process the 10 pieces of information contained in that number in an integrated way\n10. 20. 30\nAs he moved forward, savoring the gaps between the numbers using insight, he began to gain momentum.\n1,000!\nShirone had arrived at 1,000 much faster speed than before.\nShirone switched his Spirit Zone into Attack Form.\nPhoton Output!\nA strong feeling of something leaving was felt, and a ray of light shot straight towards the forest and stretched far.\nWhoa! What is that?!\nStrictly speaking, he shot a sphere of light, but in peoples eyes, it looked like a ray of light.\nShirone clenched his fist.\nYes! I did it!\nHis classmates talked about it amongst themselves.\nIt's a Photon Output. Is he preparing for the targeting exam?\nBut why go out of his way to learn that? Isnt it a particularly useless magic? Though maybe hes learning it to set foundations for Information magic?\nIt doesnt matter because the target in the Image Zone activates upon any kind of magic. It is also said that it can be removed by recovery magic. Besides, it may be advantageous for the exam. Thats honestly super fast, isnt it?\nThe students nodded.\nIt was safe to say it had no power, but it was ideal for hitting fast-moving targets.",

      "content": "Chapter 45\nDespite the commotion, Ethella turned her head.\nAs the students watched, flashes of light continued to shoot from Shirones hand.\nActive magic.\nThat meant that he had successfully strengthened his Spirit Zone.\nEthella approached Shirone.\nShirone, I see that youve prepared well.\nThank you. But in fact, this is the first time Ive succeeded.\nThe sequence method seems to have worked. Would you like to try it again? Ill watch.\nAlright.\nAs Shirone cast photon output. Ethella touched her lips and fell into thought.\nHmm.\nIt was not simply the Sequence.\nHe exceeded the level that can be strengthened with basic skills. Did he combine the modularization from the information department?\nWhether he did it while knowing or discovered it by accident, with Shirones insight, either was possible.\nOrganizing her thoughts, she made a suggestion.\nShirone, you havent tried hitting a target yet, have you? Would you like to try out the Image Zone?\nYes.\nThe students stopped what they were doing and gathered around to watch Shirone.\nHow effective will photon output be?\nNot sure. Its one of the fastest magics out there, but the accuracy of it depends on the mage.\nAfter checking the safety device, Ethella spoke.\nYou may begin.\nShirone nodded and flicked his finger.\nThe target jumped up and flew around quickly.\nThe thorns of the Attack form pierced out in all directions, and one of them caught the target.\nPhoton output.\nThe magic was cast without delay. A flash of light sped toward the target and turned it into ashes.\nWow.\nThe students were awed.\nWhile it may not actually be effective in real combat, the flashy lights overwhelmed the viewers.\nNot bad.\nThe targets turned to ashes left and right as Shirone fired a series of flashes.\nShirones performance really emphasized the advantage of photon output in regards to the Speed Gun Test.\nYes! I can do it with this!\nThe Sequence method already exceeded 1,500, and the count on the display board continued to rise.\nCurrently, Shirone had eliminated 172 targets.\nShirone had 20 seconds left. He could easily break through to 200 points, and with time to spare.\nAs expected, hes using modularity.\nEthella was finally certain.\nThe realization he had when he crossed the Bridge That Could Not Be Crossed continued to help him with the current exam.\nI was worried for nothing.\nShe originally thought it would be better to strengthen Shirones Spirit Zone through mental training rather than technical training because of his disposition.\nSurprisingly, there is quite a belligerent side to him.\nHis desire to obtain victory seemed to have spurred his thinking to become stronger and more fierce.\nA minute passed, and when the targeting program ended, Shirone let out one big breath.\nThe final total was 342 points, which was recorded on the electronic signboard. All gazes were pointed there.\n342 in one minute. But how did he not miss one? Should I just switch to photon output instead?\nDoes that look easy to you? Shirone mastered teleportation. Thats why hes at that level.\nMeanwhile, away from the group of students, Nade and Yiruki sat side by side and shared their opinions.\nAs expected of Shirone. Even though he specializes in defense, he is also good at offense, too.\nAs opposed to Nade, Yiruki was negative.\nI dont know. 342 points isnt all that great.\nStill, its a great score for his first time. Up until yesterday, he didnt even know how to output photons.\nThe number is not of importance. Theres a separate ability to grasp the main point. To have that kind of ability, that is whats actually great.\nNade was surprised.\nOh, what a surprise. For you to praise Shirone of all people.\nIm just acknowledging what should be acknowledged. Anyways, itll be a good experiment anyway. We will get to see who is higher up in this practical evaluation.\nWhat are you up to?\nInstead of answering, Yiruki headed to the Image Zone.\nMs. Ethella, I would like to do it too.\nYiruki, you?\nEthella looked uneasy.\nThere was that last incident as well\nWith Yirukis personality, Ethella didnt know what would happen if she were to allow him to demonstrate recklessly.\nIll just do a quick warm-up and come down. The safety device is on anyway.\nEthella was forced to say yes.\nIt was not fair to restrict a student who was eager to prepare for the exam.\nAll right. But keep in mind, dont make a scene.\nLeave it to me.\nWith Yirukis appearance, the students attention focused on him, and so did Shirones.\nHonestly, he was curious.\nIs the Savant Syndrome effective on the Sequence method?\nHe may be able to do complicated calculations, but counting numbers quickly was a whole different matter.\nWhile everyone had the same question, Yiruki cast the Deviate form of the Four Way Formation.\nEh? Is he using the Deviate form this time as well?\nThe smallest and most agile form out of the Four forms of the Four Way Formation, but due to that, there was little room to rely on synesthesia.\nTell me about it. I mean, were going to hit them using our naked eyes, so wouldnt it be better to use the Attack form?\nContrary to the skepticism, Yiruki actually reduced his Spirit Zone even smaller. He did so in order to speed things up. When the signal flared, the 60-second countdown was seen along with targets soaring in the air.\n* * *\n* * *\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\nThe Spirit Zone, which was reduced to 20 centimeters in diameter, moved as fast as a whip and hit the targets.\nWoah!\nSeeing the quick and accurate targeting, not only were the students surprised, but also Ethella.\nTo use the Deviate form. Its a pretty unique approach.\nThe count exceeded 100 points.\nSince Shirone went through the same procedure, he was able to gauge Yirukis skill.\nI see.\nIf the photon output offset the distance, the Deviate form was also activated immediately.\nThe downside is that you have to discern the target with your naked eyes. But Yiruki\nDid not need high dynamic visual acuity. With the help of the Savant Syndrome, he predicted where the targets would be in advance.\nYiruki was smiling.\nYou cant be surprised already, Shirone.\nIn the next moment, his Spirit Zone began to move at a speed that the eyes could not follow.\nHuh?\nThe faces of the students were stained with astonishment. The sound of exploding targets could be heard from all directions.\nPOWPOWPOWPOWPOW!\nSince the power of the Atomic bomb was minimized, it took little to no time for it to detonate.\nWhen the count reached 200 points, Shirone could tell what was going to happen without having to see the final results.\nThe score will be higher than mine.\nShirone was not bothered by it, but he was curious as to how Yiruki was strengthening his Spirit Zone.\nPerhaps modularization?\nNo.\nNade said.\nAlthough he was often caught in between the arguments of the two, he wasnt the type to hate pure competition.\nYiruki wants to beat you through his own method. Yiruki is not counting in the thousands.\nNot in thousands? Then?\nA million.\nShirones mind went blank. Was it possible to count to one million in a minute?\nOne minute passed by in an instant, and Yiruki came down after using up that minute to its fullest.\nThe final score was 548 points.\nIt was a score that far exceeded what Shirone had gotten.\nThats insane.\nSeeing Yiruki, who was seriously engaged in class for the first time, made the students murmur amongst themselves.\n548 points using the Deviate form? Is he really human?\nHe calculated the equations of motion for all the targets using his savant ability. Honestly, isnt that cheating?\nEthella was puzzled.\nHitting the target using the Deviate form is the result of coordinating between mathematical calculation and the usage of his Savant Syndrome. However\nThat alone did not explain how his Spirit Zone moved much faster than the targets.\nHow did he strengthen it?\nHer eyes twinkled as she pondered.\nNo way? That child?\nYiruki, who came down from the Image Zone, approached Shirone while looking at him inquisitively.\nHow was it? Worth watching, wasnt it?\nShirone admitted honestly.\nYeah, that was amazing. I never thought you could use the Deviate form in the way you just did.\nHmm, thats it? Well, thats disappointing.\nWhat?\nShirone frowned, but Yiruki couldnt care less and continued to talk.\nTo modularize numbers to speed up. I guess it was a method that utilized your strength.\nShirone winced.\nWant me to teach you how I strengthened it?\nAre you allowed to tell me so carelessly? Even though you seem to want to keep me in check?\nI dont care. Its not something you can just do by knowing.\nAs expected, Yiruki was skilled in getting under peoples skin.\nActually, its nothing big or amazing. While you speed up by expanding your units using modularization, I speed up by reducing the units through algebra.\nHuh? Algebra?\nShirones mouth gaped.\nSuch a way exists? No, hes right, what he performed was just algebra Albeit really quickly.\nYiruki wasnt lying when he said that knowing how to use the method did not equal to being able to use it.\nWith logarithms, even astronomical numbers can be expressed in a simple way. This time, I just tried it out for practice. After all, the real competition is the practical evaluation.\nShirone chewed on his lips.\nThrough the power of log, one could feel the numbers intuitively, no matter how big\nIm guessing even ten billion wouldnt make him sweat. After all, logarithm was created to easily calculate and express difficult expressions.\nTherefore, if it was applied to a simple number play like the Sequence method, the whole operation would become extremely complicated.\nBut he did it. He developed his own Sequence method using the Savant Syndrome.\nWhat was Yirukis limit?\nAmy Karmis, the members of the House of Ogent. Shirone had met many geniuses in his life, but it was his first time coming across someone with an extremely tilted pendulum of talent like Yiruki.\nWhat do you think? You still think you can beat me?\nIm not trying hard to beat anyone. If they try their best, it doesnt matter who wins.\nWhat a classic answer. Alright, well see when the time comes. Maybe I was wrong, maybe you arent\nthat\nguy. Maybe you never were to begin with.But next time, watch what you say. Its unpleasant to hear an idealist with no skills say what life is all about.\nShirone gritted his teeth\nWhat in the world is wrong with him?\nHe just wanted to say that everyones life was precious. But if even that was Idealism, at least according to Yiruki, then Shirone had no choice but to show him he was worthy of saying such things.\nFine! If you think that way, then lets compete. I will beat you for sure on this exam.\nHaha! Now youre talking. Though, the winner will still be me.\nYou!\nThe moment Shirone was about to go at him again, their classmates gathered around Yiruki.\nYou were amazing! How did you do it? Can you teach me, too?\nYou had such a skill all along! Why did you hide it? Why dont you join our research group? We might be able to finish our project within a month if you were to join.\nCompliments rained down, but not once did Yirukis expression change. Instead, he turned to Shirone.\nShirone, the insight you showed during the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was a sight to see. However\nHe gave an ominous smirk and turned away on his heel.\nMy calculation is faster than your insight.\nShirone gulped.\nHe had faced lots of competition ever since he entered the magic academy, but it was his first time against such a powerful opponent.\nNade patted Shirone on the back.\nCheer up. While this might sound bad, as a spectator, I cant help but find this competition exciting. Of course, I dont care who wins since you guys are both my friends.\nCompetition is what I want, too. But not this kind of competition. Yiruki just flat out hates me.\nWhat can we do? Thats the guy he is. But not just him. To make him go all out like that, you bastard? Youre something yourself too. You two are probably the only ones who have the potential to break the highest targeting record.\nHuh? Whats the score?\nLets see. From what I know, it should be 987?\nWhat? 987?\nShirone was astonished.\nAside from his score, even Yiruki, who used log, scored only 500 points.\nHow fast did one have to be to earn a score of 987?\nThats incredible. Who is it? They must have graduated already, right?\nEh? What are you talking about? How do you have no clue even though you guys are dating? The person who scored the highest was Amy.",

      "content": "Chapter 46\nA-Amy?\nDespite knowing that the Target form was her specialty and that it gave her an advantage during the exam, Shirone felt that the score of 987 points was out of this world.\nNade recalled and spoke.\nYou might not know, but during exams, our senior focuses so hard to the point she seems like a different person. Its no wonder she never lost her place as the rank 1 prior to entering the Advanced class. I mean, youre also not much different in that sense.\nShirone realized once again.\nHow many people of talent live in this world?\nBut on the other hand, it gave him courage.\nThats right, theres nothing that is absolute in this world. Like how Amy won using her own method, I will also win using my own method.\nNade advised.\nTheres no need for you to break the highest record, so relax. Before the record-breaking 987 score, I heard that the highest score was somewhere in the late 700s. Our senior achieved her highest record when she was in Class 4, not 5, so even more reason to take it easy.\nHmm.\nShirone thought.\nThen lets make my primary goal 700 points.\n3 weeks were left before D-day. Shirone had to think of a way to raise his score in that short period of time.\nI wont lose. Not in a million years.\nShirone clenched his fists.\n* * *\nThe only thing clouding his thoughts was the Sequence method.\nHe had to count faster than Yiruki, but he couldnt come up with a number.\nDamn it. How should I execute this exactly?\nNo matter how much he increased the set numbers using modularity, it was shabby compared to the unit compressive force of log.\nFirst, lets train.\nAt night, Shirone practiced Photon Output.\nThe speed at which the Sequence method reached the last number was much faster, but even so, he could only count to 10,000 in one minute.\nYiruki reached one million on the first day. I may have the upper hand in terms of stamina, but Yiruki is superior in terms of the speed at which he strengthens his Spirit Zone. If I do nothing about the gap between us, winning will not be possible.\nThere was the exam he had to think about as well.\nIf there were an unlimited number of targets, achieving 1,000 points wouldn't be too difficult, but there was a unique pattern.\nAt level 1, 10 targets appear. You have to take them all out in order to move on to level 2. Moreover, with each increase in level, theres an additional target that gets added.\nAt level 10, nineteen targets appeared all at once.\nTherefore, if one were to start off slow from the beginning and take too much time, one wouldnt be able to earn a high score.\nIf I miss a target even once, the delay could prove fatal. After all, the name of the game is Speed Gun.\n* * *\nShirone finished training around midnight.\nCurrently, Shirones daily routine looked something like this:\nHe would go to his dorm, sleep like the dead, wake up to take classes, train until midnight, and then repeat the process all over again.\nOther students either shared tips and tricks with each other or practiced the Sequence method while waiting in line for the Image Zone.\nWhen it was his turn, Shirone poured out everything he learned and trained without restraint.\nEvery time the thorns of the Attack Form made contact with a target, the beam of the Photon Output pierced the air.\nThe students gave him their full attention.\nIts getting faster and faster.\nAs Shirone continued to get used to active magic, eventually, he was able to hit the mark without even turning his body.\nA minute passed by in a blur for the students who watched the light show.\nThe final score was 567 points.\nShirone regained his confidence seeing as his score was higher than what Yiruki had gotten previously.\nGood. Its faster than before.\nThough, his performance lowered the self-esteem of his classmates.\nOver 200 points more than his last score! And all this In the span of a week?! What the hell is this?! Its an absolute violation of equity!\nThe speed of those light bullets are too fast. Once a target is sighted, it never misses, so leveling up is a piece of cake. Moreso, his linking has improved. He seems to be casting more than 4 times per second.\nSeeing Shirones performance has gotten me fired up!\nLets do this!\nAnd so, the students eagerly awaited their turn in the Image Zone.\n* * *\nI guess its my turn now?\nSince it was almost the end of the class, the line for the Image Zone dwindled, and as such, the aloof-looking Yiruki made his appearance.\nUntil now, he wasnt even practicing and was relaxing under the shade of a tree.\nThe corner of his mouth curved up and Shirone watched him activate the targeting program.\nAs soon as Yiruki released his Spirit Zone, he immediately switched to the Deviate Form. And this time, it was smaller than before.\nSounds of awe erupted from all around.\nWow\nShirones light was flashy, but Yirukis demonstration of speed excited the spectators as well.\nDone.\nAfter one minute was up, Yiruki didnt even look back to check his score as he walked away with hands clasped behind his back.\nHis final score was 568 points.\nA single point ahead of Shirones.\nThat was not a coincidence.\nEven after this incident, Shirones skills continued to improve, but Yiruki was always ahead by a single point.\nThe intention was clear.\nYiruki wins once again. As expected, I dont think Shirone can do it.\nIt was Yirukis strategy to drive Shirone into a corner. He wanted to make him despair. He wanted to make him feel like no matter how hard he tried, there was no way he'd win.\nI wont give up, no matter what!\nDespite Yiruki constantly one-upping him, Shirone continued to devote himself to the Sequence method.\nAs Shirone broke through and exceeded the multiples of 100, the performance of his Spirit Zone increased exponentially.\nIn his last practice before the exam, Shirone surpassed 700 points, a score difficult to achieve.\nStudents cheered for him.\nI cant believe the score Im seeing right now. It really IS possible to earn such a score.\nIf you dont pass level 10 in approximately 10 seconds, its impossible to get to the 700 mark. If so, how many do you have to knock down in a second?\nShirone made a fist.\nI did it. I earned 70 more points compared to my last real practice. Ive reached the primary goal I set.\nWith the exam day right ahead of him, Shirones concentration only increased.\nShirone came down the stairs while hiding his excitement. At the same time, Yiruki walked past him and said.\nCongrats. 700 is definitely an impressive score. Your growth rate is fast, almost to the point its scary.\nCause I dont want to lose to you.\nKekeke, I see. But you shouldnt let your guard down. The exam hasnt even started yet.\nBy the time Shirone reached the bottom of the stairs and turned around, Yiruki was already practicing for the Speed gun.\n* * *\n* * *\nThe students eyes widened.\nWow! It must take some serious skills to make the Spirit Zone that small.\nThe Deviate form was almost the size of a marble, and it was so fast that not even an afterimage was apparent.\nBAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!\nWith Yiruki in the center, it looked like the explosions were just happening on their own.\nBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!\nAnd just like that, a minute passed.\nSilence.\n701.\nHe beat the score Shirone tried so hard to reach by one point yet again.\nThe students shouted.\nAmazing! Yiruki still has the upper hand!\nThey were looking forward to the competition between Shirone and Yiruki.\nOne genius vs. another genius.\nSo far, Yiruki was winning.\nAgain with that one point difference?\nFor once, Shirone broke into a cold sweat.\nIf Yiruki had won using all his might, Shirone wouldnt have been so nervous.\nI dont know. Whats the highest point Yiruki can score?\nThe evaluation period started next week.\nClass 5 had the busiest schedule, so even with the weekends included, he only had three days left.\nI need to find a way.\nShirone left the training ground with an anxious heart.\n* * *\nCentral park, which was usually packed with students during the holidays, was empty due to the pressure of the exams.\nOn a quiet street where most shops were closed, Sharelle headed towards the fountain.\nAm I too early?\nShe was excluded from the Intermediate class evaluation because she had submitted the Advanced Class promotion application the day before yesterday.\nArriving at the fountain, a red-headed girl was sitting on a bench reading a book.\nSharelles face brightened.\nAmy!\nAmy, who had a haggard expression, heard her and closed the book she was reading and stood up.\nWow, youre so thin. The Advanced Class must be hard.\nAmy had become much thinner and was evidently lacking sleep as her face was pale. There were even not-so-concealed dark circles under her eyes.\nSoon, well look like twins. Anyways, welcome to hell. Here, are the files you asked for.\nAmy passed over the files related to the Advanced Class promotion.\nIt wasnt considered an expedient means because what she handed was information all Advanced students had access to.\nThanks. Lets sit down first. Wanna drink something?\nCoffee. Coffee is the only reason Im alive and awake.\nThey each bought a cup of coffee from an empty cafe and returned to the park.\nThey sat down on a bench.\nSharelle asked a question after looking through the files.\nHow is it? Is the promotion exam very difficult?\nHmm, should I say its hard? The level is high, thats for sure. However, it doesn't use the system where your score determines whether you fail or pass. Instead, its like checking what you can do Kind of? Thats why cramming is out of the picture. It wont help. Essentially, they examine the standard at which you can operate.\nYeah? That makes me more nervous.\nIts fine. Being at the top of Class 4 definitely means youre at the Advanced class level. The problem is what comes after.\nThe after\nSharelle, who was deep in thought, turned her head to look at Amy. She saw her looking up at the sky.\nShes changed.\nAlthough her appearance was downright bad, Sharelle could feel a distinctive aura unique to those from the Advanced Class.\nThe mental, physical, and technical parts of her all seem to have become stronger. I should get promoted quickly.\nAmy, who was sucking on an empty cup of iced coffee, opened her mouth.\nHows Shirone these days?\nHoho! I thought youd never ask. You guys seriously havent met up once? Havent you heard the rumors?\nDont know. I dont have the time, and both of our classes are strictly divided anyway. Though I did hear that Samuel visited as a teaching assistant. In any case, what are those rumors you mentioned?\nTheres something fun happening in Class 5.\nSomething fun?\nAs Amy faced her with the straw still in her mouth, Sharelle did what she did best. Blabber away.\nThe main point was that Shirone and Yiruki were having a showdown, with the Speed Gun exam as the backdrop.\nReducing the units through log. Thats quite fresh. Very Yiruki-like.\nSharelle was surprised.\nEh? You know Yiruki?\nOf course. We were classmates. Of course, I got promoted early, so we werent close. But hes that guy, the one with Savant Syndrome, right?\nHo? You do really know him. Have you talked? He doesnt seem very friendly.\nYeah, I did. When I freshly entered Class 5, he was the one who started the conversation.\nWhat? Does he perhaps like you? Oh my god. Then its a battle between two love rivals.\nKeep talking. Hes a bit weird, you know? He talks like hes dried up and numb from any sort of emotion. I think that whatever hes doing to Shirone right now, he was gonna do to me. After all, he immediately picked a fight with me. Though I couldnt be bothered, so after I stopped paying any attention to him, his interest towards me naturally dwindled.\nHmm, in other words, he is a genius hunter. What do we do? Shirone was unlucky to get caught.\nI dont think its to that extent. Its a barrier he has to cross either way. Doesnt matter if it's now or in the near future. But I agree, he will have quite a difficult time. Using log in Speed Gun will get Yiruki a pretty high score.\nSharelle glowered a bit.\nHow can you say that? Your boyfriend is standing at the edge of a cliff and needs some cheering up. What if Shirone loses?\nIts just an exam. They arent fighting. Losing is an inevitability, no need to go nuts\nAmy seemed unimpressed.\nSince everyone in the Advanced Class were stars, it did not matter who won or lost, but\nSharelle was still disappointed.\nYouve never lost before! So say something thatll cheer Shirone up! Ill personally deliver your message.\nNo need. Youll probably exaggerate whatever I say anyways. Plus, its not like its a promotion exam or anything of great importance this time. Its a practical evaluation, for heavens sake. Shirone is someone whos aiming to join the Advanced Class. Itll be a good experience for him.\nThen maybe share the secret to getting a high score in Speed Gun. You're the record holder, after all.\nAdvice, you say? Theres no advice I can give Shirone as he probably already knows what he needs to do. Im not like this because Im uninterested, its because Shirones really talented. You said he achieved 700 points. I only reached that high score because I specialize in the Target Form.\nThe one person who wished the two the best more than anyone else was heartbroken.\nThen what? Shirone still has a chance of winning, right? He has to win.\nAmy just nodded her head back and forth with the straw still in her mouth.\nYiruki Mercodine.\nThough she disliked his first impression, he was a formidable opponent.\nIt is quite tricky if we were to only look at his targeting. Thats why the Savant Syndrome is such a strong weapon. With the addition of logs, he is close to being a firm, resistant wall. In fact, hes nearly an unbreakable one. And not only that, you said hes serious this time around. If we competed in the Speed Gun test back when I was in Class 5, and if he was seriously determined to win\nWh-What?\nAmy, who was debating on the result, bore a frown and said.\nI would've probably lost.\nWhat?!\nAmy never gave up her seat as the rank #1 in the Intermediate class, so Sharelle couldnt help but be shocked.\nConsidering she was already in the Advanced Class, she may have been generous with her claim as everything was in the past, but it was still a pretty big statement nonetheless.\nSharelle looked like she was about to cry.\nWh-What? So what about our Shiro?",

      "content": "Chapter 47\nWith the practical evaluation one day away, Shirone meditated in his dorm room.\nI did everything I could.\nHe didnt have the time to devise a new special method for doing so would only hamper his ability to perform.\nSo instead, he explored the essence of the Sequence method.\nWhat is the Sequence method?\nStarting with the question that marked the beginning of everything\nWhy is it the Sequence method?\nHow is the Sequence method?\nHe pondered nonstop.\nShirone, who thought of so many questions it could fill up a field, closed his eyes.\nDont think Feel.\nJust like that, Shirone embarked on a journey in which he built up his knowledge of the Sequence method from the base while increasing his knowledge one step at a time.\nHe has no set goal or limit in regards to how long and how far he should count.\nI feel unrestrained. There is no incorrect path.\nHow long had he been at it?\nWhen he reached a point most humans never set foot in, Shirone had a sudden thought.\nAh\nWhen he reopened his eyes, the sun was there.\n24 hours had gone by, and yet Shirone didnt even feel an ounce of fatigue.\nHowever, a holy light that could not be described by any human emotions or words was fluttering in his eyes.\nWith a sorrowful expression, he asked in the direction of the ceiling.\nIs that so?\nNo one replied back, but Shirone felt like he had already received a response.\n* * *\nThere was still an hour left before the practical evaluation, but the training ground was swarming with participants.\nThe academy also paid great attention to this exams preparation.\nThe safety device was strengthened, and scoreboards to keep track of the scores were placed all over the place.\nAlthough today was for the Speed Gun exam, Class 7 and 6 attended without exception. They were hoping to impress their upperclassmen.\nOn the other hand, most of Class 4 were not present.\nOnly a few who took interest in Shirone and Yirukis contest bothered to take the time to watch.\nOf course, if someone had to name a person most recognized among them, it would be Sharelle, a prospective Advanced Class student.\nMark being Mark, ran up to her and said his hellos.\nSenior! Hello!\nHey. All the lowerclassmen seem to be present. Well, I used to be like that, too.\nThat hurts my feelings, senior. Im only here to cheer and celebrate senior Shirones victory today!\nOh! Good! Very good! Then let us fire up and cheer like crazy!\nThe two were able to take the best seats available.\nNeedless to say, wherever Sharelle passed by, the path always opened up by itself.\nAs predicted, the students interest was towards Shirone and Yirukis Speed Gun competition.\nUp until now, Yiruki has always had the upper hand, but there's a variable nobody can control. The practical exam is done by two people at the same time.\nThe reason why the academy chose to go for a competition layout was to push the students to achieve higher scores.\nIts similar to a race. If you have a competitor, you get a score higher than when you take it by yourself. But can that variable alone bridge the gap? Yiruki hasnt even tried his best yet.\nThat's why I find it dangerous. For me, the level of tension I feel during actual combat is different. If you set the difficulty of training too low, you may not reach your maximum potential in actual combat.\nEach of you, check your assigned group and wait for your turn. The exam will begin in 10 minutes.\nAs Ethella started talking, everyone went quiet.\nIn order to maximize their potential, students were partnered with opponents of similar records.\nIn addition, those with high records were placed on the second half of the exam. This was to ensure that those who were not as talented would not suffer any psychological blow before their turn to perform.\nAs such, both Shirone and Yiruki were allocated under group 20.\nAs expected.\nThe 10 minutes came to an end, and two people from group 1 walked towards the Image Zone.\nIts finally starting. Im nervous.\nThe Speed Gun was popular with the spectators due to its competitive nature.\nPerhaps the participants were aware of that as well, as even if they attained a new high score, they would return to their seats with an unsatisfied expression if they lost to their opponent.\nGood job. Next group, get ready.\nIt took about an hour to get through 10 groups and the highest score so far was 533.\nNade earned a score of 491, which was considered to be slightly above class average.\nAs the second half neared, the hearts of the spectators thumped faster, and their cheers got louder.\nThey knew as well.\nSoon.\nThe main event of the day was coming soon.\nNice job, group 19. Alright, the next group is the last\nWOOOOOO!\nEthellas voice got buried under the loud shouts.\nContrary to the excited students, Shirone and Yiruki didnt even bother glancing at each other.\nThey only stared straight ahead.\nMark, who saw Shirone, spoke.\nWow, upperclassman Shirone sure looks psyched up! However, wont it be hard for him this time around? I heard upperclassman Yiruki say he was falling behind.\nSharelle made an unhappy grunt.\nShirone is stronger in actual combat. Even during that teleportation exam, if I remember correctly, a certain someone said something similar and paid the price for it, correct?\nHaha Right\nMark let out an empty laugh and gave his cheek a scratch.\nShirone and Yiruki got into their place inside the Image Zone. Ethella went over the rules.\nYou have one minute. You begin as soon as the red light from the scoreboard flashes. The divisions are divided using Magic barriers, so work comfortably and feel free to think of it as an individual test. Also, a lot of your lowerclassmen are watching, so dont do anything embarrassing.\nAs if to save their energy, the two only nodded and moved away from each other.\nThe cheers quieted down, and the lowerclassmen held their breaths and kept their eyes wide open so as not to miss a single movement.\nBoth are holders of records over 700 points. They will start off strong in the beginning.\nShirone stared at the scoreboard indifferently.\nThough his heart was beating slightly faster than normal, he was in a state where he couldnt feel any nervousness.\nPerfect concentration.\nWe will begin in\nWhen the preliminary light on the scoreboard turned on, Shirone counted in his head.\n3 2 1\nThe moment the red light flashed, Shirone began his onslaught.\nBam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\nTen Photon outputs per second shot out in all directions, hitting the targets.\nYirukis Spirit Zone also moved like a bee, causing a train of explosions.\nBoth of them are so fast! As soon as they began, everything exploded!\nIn the midst of Marks excited shouts, in level 2 and level 3, the targets disappeared as soon as they appeared.\nThey were on equal grounds up to level 6, so Sharelle clenched her fist.\nNice! If Shirone keeps this up, he might actually win.\nThe two, who passed level 10 at about the same time, took a huge breath.\nThe real battle starts now.\nThe number of targets for level 11 was twenty.\n* * *\n* * *\nThey could not get rid of that many targets in a single breath, so the road up ahead would only become more complicated.\nThe current score was 239 points vs. 237 points, with Shirone ahead by a narrow margin.\nAs the level rose, the number of targets would also increase, so at this pace, they would definitely pass 700 points.\nGood! Im in my best condition. Even though Yiruki is trying his hardest, Im not getting pushed back.\nEven a single mistake was fatal. But thankfully, Shirones Photon output never missed its mark.\nThat was the same for Yiruki who was a savant.\nOh, so you wanna play?\nThe Spirit Zone of Yirruki, who was using the Sequence method of log, sped up.\n377 points vs. 377 points.\nAt the 30-second mark when Yiruki caught up, Shirone accelerated his Sequence method.\nFaster\nFASTER!\nShirone was in his absolute best condition ever.\nAs he continuously jumped over huge numbers, the world flashed left and right in a quick blink of an eye.\nThe students shouted.\nShirone is in the lead again by 4 points!\nYiruki was slowly being driven to the edge.\nUnlike the practice rounds, he was actually putting in effort this time around.\nStill, Im being pushed back? My calculation speed?\nHe couldnt understand.\nOnly three days ago, he was well ahead of the game. What kind of magic did Shirone conjure in that short period of time?\nShirone seized his consciousness desperately.\nRelease the limitations of modularization.\nIf he had been dealing with multiples of 100 before, now, he was doing whatever random calculations came to mind At least it seemed random. Shirone was relying on his intuition to give him numbers that would work.\n187, 293, 378, 423\nShirones concentration had reached an all-time high. He was on a tightrope where the Sequence method itself would collapse if even one number was not analyzed properly.\n469 points vs. 432 points.\nWhen Shirone suddenly propelled, all the students stood up and cried out.\nEven Ethella couldnt take her eyes off as she couldnt determine who would win either.\nYiruki saw through Shirones plan.\nHe broke the arithmetic routine. A kind of mental doping, I should say. He is thinking of absolutely winning .\nThe corner of his mouth tilted up.\nDo you know how long Ive waited for this?\nFor an opponent who would put in everything they had.\nIll face you, Shirone.\nTo take on his first, legit rival, Yiruki chose to walk on a tightrope as well.\nMy gambling is on a different level than yours.\nThe change happened instantly, and the students noticed it too.\nHey, whats going on?!\n542 points vs. 558 points.\nYirukis newfound speed managed to catch up with Shirones and not long after, completely surpass his.\nMark questioned.\nSenior Sharelle, how did this happen? Did upperclassman Shirone perhaps make a mista\nNo, Shirones speed is also increasing. Its just that Yirukis is speeding up at a faster rate.\nBut he gained 100 points in a heartbeat! Is it possible to suddenly increase 2 folds like that?\nSharelle pursed her lips.\nIt still didnt appear possible, but there was no other explanation.\nAlso, if it was actually feasible, the current situation would be perfectly explainable.\nThat guy He has two Spirit Zones.\nAs soon as Sharelle spoke those words, the lowerclassmen squinted their eyes to try and detect even a wisp of the 2nd alleged Spirit Zone.\nAlthough it was blurry, it seemed like there were two afterimages flying around at different angles.\nI-Its true!\nSharelles expression turned dark.\nI knew he was outstanding, but really, a double Spirit Zone?\nMental Partition, a unique characteristic of Deviant types.\nHowever, not every Deivate type could do it. Even if one were familiar with the Deivate form, only a chosen few could put this advanced skill into action.\nIts my first time seeing it. Currently, Yiruki is probably the only one who can do it in this entire academy, including the Advanced class. Above all, even though he split his mind into two\nHis speed did not drop.\nHe is carrying out two different Sequence methods at the same time. Is that even something a single human brain can do?\nYirukis performance proved that it was possible.\nTo process everything with mental arithmetic That is not a level that can be explained by the word talent Yiruki is more like a mutant.\nThe Savant Syndromes true power could be seen through the scoreboard.\n692 points vs. 845 points.\nThere was over a 100-point difference, and Yiruki was ahead in terms of level as well.\nIts over. The winner will be decided here.\nWhile most students were thinking Yiruki had won already, Shirone did not give up.\nMore. I have to tie up more numbers!\nThe amount of numbers Shirone was processing using modularity was not at an average of 1,000 or more.\n732 points vs. 911 points.\nShirone broke his personal highest score But Yiruki was far ahead.\nIt looked like he was going to break Amys record.\nThe students just sat there as if they had lost their souls.\nYiruki Hes out-of-this-world amazing. At this rate, hes going to write a new history for Class 5.\nMeanwhile, Shirone didnt stray away from his thoughts. There was only one thing on his mind.\nI cant reach it through arithmetic.\nHe had to go beyond.\nCan I do it?\nWas this really an ability humans were allowed to use?\nThere wasnt anyone who was going to answer those inquiries, but Shirone felt like he received just the answer he needed.\nIn order to transcend the number I have to\nREACH FOR INFINITY.\nPR Note: Prolly the worst cliffhanger yet no cap.",

      "content": "Chapter 48\nShirones calculations got faster.\nHowever, the place Shirone wanted to reach was a point that was impossible to attain using the Sequence method.\nA concept that went beyond units.\nInfinity.\nThe limit of modularization, which bundled hundreds and thousands, gradually disappeared\nEven further\nIt was as if all the numbers that existed in the world combined into a single point.\nBam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\nThe attention of the students focused back on Shirone when the speed at which his targets exploded skyrocketed.\nTwo flashes of lights appeared at the same time.\nSenior Shirone is also doubling! B-But isnt it already too late? They only have\nNo, its not double.\nSharelle couldnt believe the scene in front of her.\nThe number of flashes continued to double, and eventually they started colliding with each other.\nA shudder ran down Shirones back at the feeling of liberation.\nAh\nThe feeling was out of this world.\nAll the senses that made Shirone himself permeated into creation, even his ego seemed to disappear.\nThe flashes all around combined into one, and in the end, a huge curtain covered the area.\nThe targets didnt even have a chance to make an appearance before exploding.\nThe Speed Gun level began to continuously rise.\nShirone could not stop the tears from dripping down his face.\nAhhh\nAHHHHH\n!\nIt was being forgotten.\nHis own name. His existence. Everything that constituted him was fading away from the world.\nAs for Yiruki, he focused harder on himself.\nEeeeuukk!\nHe checked Shirones score and noticed that it was catching up to his quickly, but he didnt seem to care.\nNo matter how much Shirone sped up, he felt that he just had to run a bit faster to maintain the higher score.\nA savants calculation has no limits! Watch me calculate everything! Ill see to it that I reach the end of the numbers that exist in the world!\nYirukis double Spirit Zone flew around so fast that not even an afterimage was in sight.\nIll win! I can win! I have 1 second left! 0.9 second! 0.85 second! What kind of timer goes this\nFUCKING SLOW\n!!!!!\nBEEP!\nThe one minute that felt like an eternity was finally over.\nAs soon as the target holograms disappeared, Shirone and Yiruki fell on their asses at the same time.\nHaah Haah.\nCompared to Yiruki, who was gasping for air, Shirone had his head lowered. He was not moving an inch.\nHe had already lost consciousness.\nHooo\nYiruki checked his score.\n1,247 points.\nYiruki set an unprecedented record. He somehow managed to beat Amys highest record by 260 points.\nNot bad. Did I win? Why dont I hear anything? Whats Shirone doing?\nYiruki turned his head and saw that Shirones head was tilted to the point it was nearly touching his chest. He wasnt moving.\nShirone was still breathing, and he didnt seem dead, but at the same time, he didnt seem alive either. It was a strange feeling.\nWhat?\nYiruki checked out Shirones score.\n1,253 points.\nMark couldnt believe it and swung his head back and forth between Shirones and Yirukis scoreboard. Then he opened his mouth.\nS-Senior Shirone Senior Shirone\nShirone won!\nSharelle, who was hugging Mark while leaping around, ran to Shirone. And with her were the lowerclassmen, who were fighting to reach him first.\nHEUK!\nAnd as if he had just been resuscitated, Shirone gasped for air.\nHis mind, which had scattered after delving into the Infinite Realm, started combining back together along with the threads of his consciousness.\nUghh\nHe looked around to see Sharelle and a bunch of other students crowding around him.\nShirone, are you okay? Its me, Sharelle.\nHis memories had returned. And Shirone, who had finally regained his ego, gave a soft smile.\nYes. Im alright.\nThe moment he himself solidified that he was okay, the lowerclassmen and his classmates cheered, whistled, and applauded.\nYou were sooo amazing! Really, youre the best Shirone!\nWhile everyone was praising Shirone, nobody was around Yiruki.\nYiruki was deep in thought with an indifferent look when someone approached and placed their hand on his shoulder.\nIt was Nade.\nYou lost. But it was a great match.\nNot really, you dont compete to look good. You do it to win.\nHearing Yirukis response, the corner of Nades mouth went up, and he looked towards Shirone.\nHes an incredible guy.\nAnd considering he was his friend as well, his heart silently gave him a thumbs up.\nCongratulations, Shirone.\nUnlike the students who couldnt hide their excitement, Ethella had a serious expression.\nThe difference in their score was tiny, but the difference in their mental speed was huge.\nYiruki tried to reach the end of the number. To have gone beyond that?\nThere was the notion of infinity.\nThe greatest axiom that could never be reached by simply being pushed to the limit, far beyond the number.\nSome call such a thing god, and some others call it All Creation.\nHumans cannot become infinite. But They can reach it.\nThe emotions contained in these sentences were the sorrows that Shirone felt last night.\nHow long have you known?\nRealizing the finite barrier of numbers, Shirone spread his mind into the Infinite Realm.\nIndeed, humans could reach Infinity, but from then on They were no longer human\nWas he really planning to leave?\nMages referred to this phenomenon as the Immortal Function.\nAnd Ethella knew another name for this occurrence. A name that came from the monks.\nNirvana []\nIt was not a level that an ordinary person could reach\nBut it was also something that shouldnt be reached for in the first place.\nTears welled up in Ethellas eyes.\nNo, Shirone. Humans should not recklessly embrace infinity. No matter how glorious one may seem, no matter how brilliant one may seem, the moment you enter Nirvana, your existence\nWill crumble away and dissipate.\nOnly high monks, who realized the worlds impermanence through long asceticism, laid down everything and entered the world of Nirvana. But Shirone was still only a 17-year-old boy.\nHe had a bright future ahead. Infinity was a dangerous and futile venture.\nRight, seeing as how it ended with him only losing consciousness, it doesnt seem like he completed the journey. However, if he actually did enter Nirvana\nThen even Ethella didnt know what was next.\nThe only thing she knew was that she would have to live the rest of her life repenting for Shirone.\nUncharacteristically, for someone who won first place, Shirone was lost in thought and looked sad.\n* * *\n* * *\nEthella was sure it was no coincidence.\nShirone, you\nIm sorry, Ms. Ethella. I wanted to win. I wasnt sure how dangerous it was.\nSince when?\nI left for A very long journey.\nAll the emotions Shirone experienced were hidden in his words, similar to that of a zen riddle.\nDont worry, instructor. Because now I know. I wont make the same mistake.\nEthella knew he needed no advice.\nHe understood the situation and stopped himself, so Shirone deserved to make his own choices as well.\nAlright. Please, treasure yourself. This teacher loves and cares a lot for you.\nNot as a mage, but as a monk, Ethella was genuinely concerned about Shirones state.\nYes, Ill keep that in mind.\nSeeing the opportunity, the students rushed forward.\nI love you too, Ms. Ethella!\nSiena would have rained fire on them and scolded them, but Ethella patted each and every one of them on the head.\nI love all of you guys too. Now I should finish the exam.\nClass 5 gathered on the training ground.\nEveryone had done their best, so they harbored satisfied expressions.\nGood job. Its nice to end early on days when you have exams, right? Everyone has worked hard. All of you take a good rest and have fun training for next time. Thank you for your hard work.\nSince Ethella practiced monk etiquette, the students copied her. Half as a joke, and the other half as respect.\nThank you for your hard work, Ms. Ethella!\nEven after Ethella went down the mountain, the students could not leave because of their lingering emotions.\nShirone, Im so happy for you! Im sure Amy would be as well! No, wait Would she be angry since her record got broken? Eh, whatever! Its her own boyfriend who won! Hohoho!\nShirone showed signs of exhaustion while listening to Sharelle blabber away.\nI want to rest.\nAnd as if to answer his prayer, Yiruki approached, causing everyone to shut up.\nOho.\nThe students watched, excited.\nThey were curious as to how the haughty genius would dig at Shirone this time.\nContrary to their expectations, however, Yiruki did the exact opposite.\nI lost. Completely.\nNo, I dont think that way.\nAt times like these, you dont have to be humble. Especially when its a guy like me whos waving the white flag.\nI really dont think I won. This exam was evaluating targeting. However, the last magic I cast covered up the entire area.\nKeukeuk. Seriously, you really dont change. Just because you eliminated the targets all at once doesnt mean you didnt use targeting. That was still targeting, so dont feel iffy about it. You won.\nAfter a short pause, Shirones eyes hardened.\nThen admit it. Its not idealism. It is wrong to study a magic that is strong enough to destroy a city while not accounting for the humans contained within it.\nYeah, youre right. Sorry.\nHe admitted it so easily that he left Shirone rather puzzled.\nEven though his admission didnt fully satisfy Shirone, he knew Yiruki was a nerd who only pursued mathematical results.\n...Are you serious?\nShirone, you are misunderstanding. Explosion is not equivalent to violence. Violence is the will to hurt someone. Its up to the humans. Theres no will to an explosion. Its just something that has a much stronger energy than humans.\nBut it is us humans who wield that energy. We might not have it within us, be we can wield it.\nI agree. So this is how I define explosions. It is an uncontrollable energy. But you know, what if we are able to control the explosion? Explosions powerful enough to blow up cities can turn into a force for good. Imagine An energy that can feed and keep 100,000 people alive. In simpler terms, energy is also our life force. What would happen then?\nShirone blinked once.\nA new era will commence. If we could control such energy, people would fight less due to the abundance of resources. Many could have luxurious, care-free lives. Of course, I dont have such a noble belief. But if such a world is possible, shouldnt we at least try? Because my abilities are meant to be used to help push for such a future.\nUh\nShirones mind got all jumbled, but he heard Yirukis words clearly.\nYou should have just said it like that from the beginning then There wouldve been nothing to be offended about.\nYiruki smirked.\nYoure so Naive. Even if we can control the energy, if we cant control the humans that use it, it will only be a force that will lead the world to its downfall. But Shirone, Im going to do it. Im not stopping because Im afraid of that. Even if one of the victims ends up being me.\nWhat if it cant be controlled? What if such a situation occurs? Nobody can take responsibility.\nHaha! Thats right, but\nYiruki sat down and looked up at the sky.\nShould I just stop here, then? Play around and waste my time in Class 5? Then if staying here gets boring, maybe I just live my life as a dungeon digger or something? These kinds of thoughts have never left me. It might be better for a dangerous guy like to stay here. To never go out into the world.\nHis classmates were dumbfounded.\nDidnt that mean his only reason for staying in Class 5 was because he was afraid of his own talent?\nShirone was distraught.\nIdealism or realism? What side is this guy on?\nThats why\nYiruki reached out his hand and grabbed Shirone, pulling him into a standing position.\nFrom now on, Im your responsibility.\nHuh? Responsibility?\nI never thought Id lose to anyone in my life. So maybe youre the only one who can beat me. In the distant future, if my ways will cause tragedy, you prevent it. If I am too much of a risk, even if you kill me, I will never resent you.\nShirone was panicking.\nBut give me a little more ti\nYiruki interrupted.\nIf you dont do it, I cant take a step forward here. I will not move on. I will stay here.\nShirone stared Yiruki in the eye.\nThere was not an ounce of sarcasm, pretentiousness, or exaggeration. Only true sincerity.\nOkay.\nIf he had rejected Yiruki then and there, the future Yiruki himself had envisioned would have merely become an idealistic theory.\nI will definitely stop you. No. I will make sure you never make such a mistake.\nThe students looked blank.\nWhats up with them? Do they really think they can achieve such a feat? This is Class 5.\nTo make their dreams a reality, they would have to overcome countless barriers.\nBut unlike their other schoolmates, Nade was moved.\nHe gave a small shout.\nAaahh!! You guys are so cool! As expected of my friends! Nice, lets do our best!\nNade wrapped his arms around both of their necks, and Shirone and Yiruki smiled at each other.\nPerhaps He might actually be a pretty nice guy.\nWhile they both had similar thoughts, Shirone recalled his face-off with Yiruki.\nHes really strong.\nShirone felt that there was a possibility he might not be able to win next time, but he didnt care. Because he knew that he was the only one who could suppress Yiruki.\nI will definitely keep my promise.\nThe only thing that could stop something finite that was running at the speed of light was the great infinity.",

      "content": "Chapter 49\nShirone was floating in darkness.\nIt was a quiet and cold space where countless stars were scattered around.\nAn overwhelming world of stasis\nBut suddenly, the scenery in which time seemed to have stopped suddenly accelerated.\nThe stars began to lengthen into lines.\nIm being absorbed.\nIn the midst of the stars gathering towards one place, there were immeasurable spherical rocks and gasses.\nNO!\nSeeing the stars rush to each other, Shirone shuddered, but before that happened, the planets began to collapse first.\nIt was a phenomenon that ignored the law of physics.\nTime is flowing backwards.\nFollowing the stars, Shirones own physical body dissolved, and in the process, his consciousness also disappeared.\nBut I still exist.\nThis last remaining thing that constituted a human being. Shirone didnt know what that thing was.\nHe felt the world that was compressed into a dot.\nThe result of light, time, acceleration of gravity, and universal gravitation being tied and brought together was\nVibration.\nLight was vibrating.\nWhen he delved in deeper, the light became bubbles and then quickly popped.\nIt was as if the bubbles mirrored and repeated both creation and extinction.\nEverything was filled with light, and even the last thing that made up Shirone joined in.\nAhhhhh\nAn extreme sense of unity.\nAnd that feeling felt like an explosion.\nAHHH!\nShirone woke from his sleep with a shout. His clothing was drenched as sweat dripped down his face.\nHe looked around his quiet and moonlit room.\nAfter seeing the books regarding Photon output spread around messily on his desk, he managed to calm down.\nHoo Another nightmare.\nHe drank water from the pitcher and opened the window. The winds of the early summer cooled down his body.\nWhy is this happening every night? Whats happening to me?\nEver since he entered the Infinite Realm during the Speed Gun exam, Shirone had been plagued by the same dream every night.\nCome to think of it, his nightmare didnt seem that horrific, but each time he woke up from it, his shock was considerable.\nSomethings weird.\nAnxiety seeped in.\nAfter experiencing the thing called the Immortal Function, Shirone felt like everything that made him himself was out of sync.\nEeeuuuk\nDue to the chill, Shirone hugged his body.\nDisregarding the nightmare for now\nThe real problem was that the strange feeling followed him even in reality.\nHe didnt know what exactly was going on, but he felt like a particular sense of his became extremely sensitive.\nBut what exactly is it?\nIt wasnt like he could smell better, or had sharper sight, touch, or hearing.\nIts not the five senses. Its\nIt was as if he was equipped with a new sensory organ.\nNo way I can sense ghosts now Right?\nMusic coming from a piano was heard from the ceiling.\nAs Shirone turned around in surprise, he noticed dawn was already peeking through the horizon.\nShirone went to the bathroom with tired eyes.\nI dont feel like I rested.\nSince the Intermediate Class practical evaluation ended last week, normal classes would once again resume this week.\nThat might be better. If I train like crazy, I might be able to get rid of this strange feeling.\nWith his mind made up, he changed his clothes and left the dorm with a backpack slung on his shoulder.\n* * *\nThe academy atmosphere was peaceful.\nMost of the students who returned to being friends again after the competition were all talking about the Speed Gun exam.\nAfter the evaluation ended, it was normal for a single star to appear in each class, but this time was an exception.\nThis was because the Class 5 Speed Gun exam, which was held on the first day, left too big of an impact.\nIt was inevitable since not one, but two students achieved scores of over 1,200 points! Such a score was unprecedented in the history of the Intermediate class.\nHey! There goes Shirone!\nThey felt something different new from Shirone, who was heading to the Intermediate class building.\nThe rising star went from Amys boyfriend to a student who represented the academy.\n* * *\n* * *\nThat was why the upperclassmen from Class 4 would take the initiative to start up a conversation with him\nYou did well during the Speed Gun. Lets check up on each other now and then.\nYes, senior.\nThe reason why the upperclassmen-lowerclassmen relationships were strict was because getting promoted was difficult.\nIn that sense, it meant Amy had great foresight as she recognized Shirones talents early on.\nThe Class 6 students started to come up to Shirone after he finished talking with the upperclassmen.\nHello, upperclassman!\nSenior Shirone, Im your fan! Can I study with you as my role model?\nThey were in the class that was the most displeased about Shirones early promotion. It couldnt be helped since Class 6 was caught in the middle, as he jumped from Class 7 to 5, skipping over 6.\nHowever, they had no choice but to forget about the past and change their attitude since even their seniors from Class 4 considered Shirone as an Advanced-Class rival in the future.\nWhat is your plan after class today? Theres going to be a magic demonstration inning, would you like to come with?\nOur research group decided to visit during the holiday, lets go together. Ill be happy to be your partner.\nOnly after he managed to kindly decline their offers did Shirone finally arrive at Class 5.\nShirone! Shirone! Shirone! Shirone! Shirone!\nAs soon as he opened the classroom door, his classmates pulled him in by his neck.\nHe was kidnapped before he could even put his backpack down, and when he saw all his friends looking at him, he was left puzzled.\nWhy? Whats wrong?\nThe school semester is coming to an end. Join our research group. Its one that we Class 5 kids made ourselves. The topic for the performance evaluation is up to the taker to choose anyways. Its going to be fun, and moreover, you can save time. So join us.\nHmmm\nShirone had consistently declined all offers to join a group so far.\nDont be like that and think about it in a positive light. I heard you refused to join a research group because of your personal studies? There are quite a few students like you here, but we still have to take the performance evaluation. Thats why were making one temporarily. No discrimination. Well quickly finish the evaluation and disband. Then you can study in your spare time.\nAha! I see.\nIt was a good strategy.\nSince the subject for the performance evaluation was up to the taker, there wasnt a set criteria. That being said, joining an existing research group only to leave right after the performance evaluation was a bit rude.\nTherefore, their solution to this problem was to create a temporary research group.\nAt that moment, Nade came running.\nHey! What trick are you guys playing?! Shirone is off-limits. Hes mine!\nIn the midst of his friends staring at him like he was absurd, a friend who knew what was going on with Nade countered.\nThats ridiculous. I know what youre planning. You want to admit him into that weird research group, right? Shirone, you should never join it. Even if you dont end up joining our group, at least dont join his. During my entire time here, never have I ever heard of Nade taking the performance evaluation.\nThe Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group showed off a pretty long history and tradition, but they did not participate in many public activities.\nEh? Nade, you have a research group? Where is it?\nNade racked his brain and avoided the crisis with his unique secret technique that had so far brought him success in life.\nHoohoo, of course. You think the most popular person in the academy wont even have a research group? Anyways, you cant have Shirone, so Ill be taking him.\nWhen Nade pulled Shirone away, the student who proposed the idea to Shirone shouted loudly.\nShirone! You have to think carefully! Never go in there! And Nade, dont bother Shirone with his studies and just let him join a group where hes comfortable.\nHahahaha! Too late. We already crossed the forbidden line.\nWait! What does that\nThe door slammed with a bang, and with that, Shirone was cut off. The students left in the classroom had dazed expressions.\nWhat did he just say?\nThis is a problem. Nade, that bastard. Hes really thinking of bringing Shirone into that group. He shouldnt be swayed.\nNo, I think hes already swayed. And why the hell did they leave anyway? Its almost time for class.\n* * *\nShirone, who was now in the hallway, shook off Nades hand.\nWhat the heck! What in the world is the forbidden line?\nHaha! You are the only person who has seen the true nature of our Supernatural Psychic Research Group. That is the forbidden line you crossed.\nTrue nature of the research group? Theres nothing to see though.\nNade looked around and crouched down pulling Shirone along.\nFirst, sit down a bit.\nOkay, okay. Just stop pestering me.\nNade lowered his voice and said.\nIt means youre the only non-member student to have ever entered the research room. So you should never reveal it.\nNobody asks about it anyway.\nWhatever! We already dont have enough members. Moreover, there are talks going around that the management team is thinking about disbanding it. We have to keep a low profile, so dont even mention the word super in supernatural.\nAlright, alright. I had no intention of doing so anyways.\nShirone thought of it as a group on the brink of going under, but those who knew the real value of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group were trying hard to swallow it up. In fact, even the instructors were anxious to disband it.\nBy the way, Shirone, are you Really going to join that research group they made?\nI was contemplating. Why? Is there a reason not to?\nOf course. No matter how little discrimination there is in the performance evaluation, its your loss if you are in a research group with just random people. Besides, youre aiming to be the no.1 of the entire academy. A single point is important. Instead of clumsily joining a so-so group, I think itd be better for you to do it alone. Or join a really proper one.\nThere was a full score of people in Class 4 who were aiming for the Advanced Class, so even a one-point difference in the performance evaluation mattered.\nHmm But to take the performance evaluation by myself would take too long.\nShirone beat his brain thinking of a way to make it work.\nWhat if I join the Supernatural Psychic Research Group?\nYou?\nYeah. It looks like you guys dont participate much in outside activities, and both you and Yiruki have to take the performance evaluation anyways. I think itll be better to join yours than to go and ruin a totally normal research group.\nHaha! Thats true.\nNade didnt rebuke.\nThat was also why he couldnt readily recommend his group to Shirone.\nIt had been 45 years since the establishment of the Alpheas Magic Academy. Most students successfully graduated and left to explore the outside world, but in secretive places they did not know of, various people were doing all kinds of extraordinary things.\nThe Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group was one such secretive place.\nShirone asked again.\nWell, what I said earlier was a joke. What do you say? You, me, and Yiruki. Taking the performance evaluation together?\nAre you really okay with that? Its a plus for us if you join, but in all honesty, our research group isnt exactly normal. Though I cant go into details, it wont be like whatever youre hoping for.\nIt was obvious there were many secrets just by looking at Nade's attitude in the lecture room back there. However, regardless of interest, a group created just for grades wasnt appealing.\nThe thing is Its not just for the performance evaluation\nHm? What are you talking about?\nIve been feeling a bit strange lately. I was meaning to ask you guys, but maybe, supernatural psychic science can help explain some things too.",

      "content": "Chapter 50\nThe bell that indicated the start of class rang.\nHooo? If thats the case, Im the expert regarding those sorts of problems. Lets go to the research group together later.\nWheres Yiruki? I havent seen him.\nHes not coming today. Something along the line of his renewed passion not prepared to accept old, bland education. Anyways, hes sleeping like a log in the research group.\nHaha! Thats so Yiruki.\nYiruki declared that he would advance towards his dream after the confrontation with Shirone, but it seemed like his tendencies would not easily change.\nLets talk later. Class is about to start.\nSeeing the empty hallway, Shirone quickly made his way towards the lecture room.\nAfter diligently focusing on his studies for the day, he headed to the research group with Nade after his daily routine.\nShirone was amazed once again as he stood in front of the magic warehouse, Estas.\nIf the shape he saw last time was a colony-like structure, now there were seven towers scraping the sky.\nEven though its my second time seeing it, this building is really amazing.\nI mean, there are 89 buildings, so theres no end to the patterns. I hope Yirukis awake.\nAs much as the outside had changed, the interior was no different, but Nade walked all around the maze with no hesitation.\nIm curious, how do you find your way around? Even labeling would be of no use if the structure changes.\nHaha! We dont use such a one-dimensional method. Simple enough, we just memorize everything. A long time ago, an upperclassman who was part of this research group restored Estas blueprint.\nShirones eyes grew large.\nWhat? Of this complicated building? No, before that, why did he do that? It wasnt like he was going to build a new one.\nThough it was unproductive, Nade was still proud.\nThere, look at the ceiling over there. There are three dots. That means this is the 3rd Room. Then we look to see what the color of the iron door to the 3rd warehouse is. Its blue, right? Hence, this place becomes the Blue of Room 3.\nShirone looked to where Nade was pointing.\nThen, you count the number of cubes. Since there are four intersections, that means there are four cubes connected to the surrounding area. It gets important from here. X is used to represent the room numbers, Y is used to represent colors, but in number form, and Z is the number of cubes. Finally you plug in the variables into the equation.\nEquation?\nActually, the blueprint isnt the standard blueprint that youre thinking of. Its simply impossible to express this building that way, so this blueprint that Im talking about is really an equation. One that was made by analyzing Estas pattern. If you plug in the data, you will end up with a number with two decimal places. With that number, you can figure out where you are and where to go. In other words, theres no way well ever get lost inside Estas. Should I say its like a Master Key?\nMaster Key.\nShirone realized that the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group was nowhere close to being normal.\nEstas could change into different shapes an infinite number of times, and yet the seniors who established the equation managed to figure out its patterns.\nWhile Shirone felt it was slightly unnecessary, he couldnt understand the underlying reason behind it.\nBut doesnt calculating take a very long time? And all this just to get to the research lab?\nYou get used to it. Its learning through experience. By the time three months pass, you wont even need to substitute things into the equation. Youll know it by heart.\nEven now, Estas is still a unique structure because it only exists inside the Alpheas Magic Academy. According to the rumors, there was an ace savant amongst the first members of this research group. Even Yiruki said the equation was beautiful the moment he laid his eyes on it. Something along the lines of he didnt think he could design an equation simpler than this. Anyways, dont tell anyone about this. If the Master Key is leaked, there will be a big problem.\nCertainly maniacal.\nA place that contained unproductive and crazy-obsessed seniors from the first generation.\nAnd that place was the Supernatural Psychic Science Research group hidden deep inside the labyrinth known as Estas.\nThe two arrived at the lab.\nSimilar to before, the sign was tilted, and as soon as the door opened, clouds of dust rose and attacked them.\nBut this time, Shirone was prepared. He blocked his mouth and nose with his hand, thus avoiding managing to avoid what he felt was a catastrophe.\nYiruki, were here.\nYiruki, as usual, was writing complicated formulas on the blackboard. He smiled as soon as he saw Shirone.\nHey, Shirone. Whats up? I didnt think youd come back to such a shabby place.\nNade laughed as he recalled the past.\nHaha, seems like we were both wrong. He wants to join.\nOho?\nIt must have been a surprise because Yiruki put down his chalk and walked towards them.\nHow unexpected. This research group should have nothing to do with your personal studies.\nThe thing is, it doesnt seem like that anymore. Somethings been troubling me recently. Can I get some consulting?\nYiruki and Nade made eye contact. Yiruki smirked.\n* * *\n* * *\nThe genius who beat me has something hes concerned about. Hmm, I can already tell it must be a heck of a concern.\nNow that Shirone knew and understood Yirukis personality, he was not offended by his twisted words.\nSomething inside of me has changed. Ever since the Speed Gun exam, I have been having nightmares, and whenever I wake up, I feel kind of creeped out. No, I feel\nvery\ncreeped out. It feels like there is someone right next to me. Could this have any relation to either the supernatural or the psychic? Dont you guys know those things like the back of your hands?\nHis friends eyes shone.\nNade, the explorer of the supernatural, and Yiruki, the critic of the supernatural.\nThen youve come to the right place. First things first, sit here.\nNade dusted off the sofa and offered Shirone a seat, Shirone stared at the rising dust in disgust.\nI finally figured it out. The origin of the dust\nIt was chalk dust. It was evidently a by-product of Yirukis obsession with disproving the supernatural.\nDont dust it off, Ill just sit down. Please, dont do anything in this room But if you do, I beg of you, please clean up more regularly.\nNow, now! Dont fuss about mere fine dust! You are the first client of the research group, hurry up and tell us more about your problem!\nNade and Yiruki pulled up chairs and crossed their legs, acting like actual experts.\nShirone was speechless, but he was as desperate as a thirsty man searching for water.\nThe problem is, Ive been dreaming about this lately\nShirone explained what he saw in his dreams, as well as the strange feeling hes been getting from time to time.\nI have no clue what it is. Perhaps some kind of ghost entered my body? Or I dont know. Have you heard of anyone whos ever experienced something similar?\nSilence.\nShirone swallowed. Considering who he was talking to, he thought that they would say a joke to break the serious atmosphere.\nWh-Whats up? You guys are making me anxious. You are pulling a joke again, arent you?\nNade scratched his eyebrow with a stumped expression.\nMmm The thing is After hearing about what you said, it seems like it is quite like\nthat\n.\nWhat are you saying? Tell me in detail.\nThat sensation you said that you felt. The creepy one that sends shivers down your spine.\nYeah. It gets especially worse at dawn.\nIts not scientifically verified, but what youre experiencing is a phenomenon called the Mourning Sensation.\nMourning Sensation?\n200 years ago, a scholar conducted an experiment on a death row inmate. It was called Soul Electrolysis. Its a hypothesis that if a persons soul is made of matter, it can be decomposed using electricity. Heres how. The inmate was put in a sealed, electrically conductive metal box Then he let the electrical current flow. However, because it was so inhumane, the experiment was put to an end. Thanks to that, the death row inmate survived, but it was said that he was unconscious for a month. The problem starts there. When the inmate finally woke up, they knew everything that went on in the outside world.\nNo way. How is that possible?\nThats what was so surprising. The scholar put up a hypothesis about Soul Ionization. When the soul was electrolyzed, an electromagnetic force would be generated, causing the worlds information to be attracted and pulled into the inmate. Of course, the scholar was treated like a lunatic in academia. Besides, there were rumors that the criminal bribed the guards to get outside information just to push back his execution.\nI see, so there are experiments like that.\nAlthough orthodox scholars don't like to admit it, its still a hot topic in the psychic science community. Besides, even the Sance, which is a formal religious organization, recognizes the trance state. Therefore, I dont think Soul Ionization is some groundless, absurd theory. Anyways, the sensation the inmate felt, we call it the Mourning Sensation in this field.\nThinking he might be going through the same thing as the inmate, Shirone felt shivers run down his spine.\nOkay, its my turn now.\nYiruki took over the discussion.\nI have a question. You said you started feeling the Mourning Sensation after the Speed Gun? Your Photon Output was certainly different than usual. If its a secret, you dont have to reveal anything, but I think itll be helpful if we hear about it.\nShirone felt that Yiruki was right. They had to know the cause if they wanted to get anything done.\nWhat happened was\nShirone explained the process of reaching the Infinite Realm in detail.\nThe enlightenment he discovered during the Sequence method, and the fact that he transcended numbers under the pressure of the match.\nYiruki nodded his head. He had already heard about the concept from his father.\nIt's an Immortal Function.\nImmortal Function?\nI heard about it when I was young. Its the Absolute Function that can solve the worlds mysteries. I think thats very dangerous. Because everything is phenomenally the same as nothing.\nShirone realized anew how dangerous his attempt was as Yirukis words were somewhat similar to Ethellas.\nI only theorized and thought about it, but I didnt think itd actually work. Its something I dont want to experience again.\nYiruki laughed.\nWhat stupidity are you talking about? Achieving an Immortal Function is a dream come true for mathematicians. I accept it now. If you can beat me, you should be able to at least achieve an Immortal Function. Kekeke.\nYiruki, who thought of the Immortal Function as a simple talent, truly showcased why he was labeled an eccentric. However, it was that laid-back attitude that lowered Shirones anxiety level.\nWell anyways, Immortal Function you say? Hmm, that clears things up.\nReally? Did you figure something out?\nYiruki turned to the wall. It was as if he was writing formulas using his eyes.\nI dont know much about the Mourning Sensation since I dont major in psychics, but the nightmares youre having every day? I can kind of understand what it is and why you even dream of such a thing.\nShirone clenched his fist.\nTell me. Im prepared to hear anything.\nFirst of all, dreams distort and exaggerate memories. But your dream is probably projected exactly as your memory. This phenomenon is called psychological regression, and it follows the same principle as someone under hypnosis trying to remember clearly their past. Anyways, supposing your nightmares are of that kind, then\nThen?\nWhat you saw was probably the universe.\nTh-The Universe?\nShirone knew what the universe was. It was the unknown world outside of theirs.\nBut that was it. No one knew much else.\nFrom time immemorial to the present, dragons were the only species that officially went out into the universe.\n680 years ago, Saint Dragon Gramisch flew out of the continent and into the universe in the presence of representatives from each race.\nHowever, he eventually crashed to the ground in 13 hours. His body was in a state of disrepair.\nUnder the treaty, the representatives of each race split his body into pieces and returned to their respective territories, and the evidence obtained from said pieces later contributed greatly to the development of cosmology.\nThe thing in my dream Is the universe?",

      "content": "Chapter 51\nYou know how I major in computational physics? Looking at the size, speed, and shape of the space, the universe is the only thing I can think of that fits the bill. The numerical value is too large for it to be implemented on the continent.\nBut why am I dreaming about this stuff? Psychological regression means its my memory, but Ive never been to outer space.\nProbably not, but even if you didnt personally go to space, memories can still exist. According to Nade.\nMourning Sensation\nNade nodded his head.\nYeah. The death row inmate knew every nations situation, despite being in a coma due to the Soul Electrolysis experiment. That means he transcended space and time to gain that information. The Mourning Sensation is in a different field from psychic sciences materiality breakaway. If ones soul flies around like a pigeon, one wont be able to come across all the information about the world simultaneously. On the other hand, when ionization occurs electrically, a quantum phenomenon will occur. With that lies a possibility of transcending space and time.\nYiruki nodded in agreement.\nIn the microscopic world, things outside of our common sense occur. Observation and measurement cannot be done at the same, and even those are only probabilities. Its like plucking a guitar string and being unable to determine where it is at the moment. If by chance, the weight of the soul is lighter than that of electrons, it might be possible to feel the universe. Since its a world where there is no real correlation between time and distance.\nAfter putting together everything said by both Nade and Yiruki, Shirone could somewhat imagine it in his head.\nHmm, I think I know what the situation is now. Thanks. You guys are true members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\nHaha! This is nothing. Anyways, dont worry too much. It probably isnt some bizarre curse or anything like that. Lets look into areas related to the Immortal Function.\nAt that moment, Shirone made up his mind.\nOkay! Im going to join the Supernatural Psychic Research Group.\nNade found no reason to refuse. After all, there would be three members if Shirone joined. They would be registered as an official research group, and the subsidies that were cut off a year ago would start coming in again.\nYoure always welcome here, right, Yiruki?\nFor the development of this research group, Shirone is definitely a good recruit, but will the management team approve? There might be a lot of teachers who will oppose it due to our groups notoriety.\nLeave that to me. I just have to put the document in without them noticing. Now, lets get going!\nShirone, who was following his friends, looked back.\nThis is now my research group.\nIt was no different than a warehouse, but considering it would soon be his soon, he couldnt help but feel happy.\nIll have to plan a big clean-up day sometime.\nBang\n!\nThe iron door closed.\nIn the desolate laboratory where the lights were turned off, the dust particles coming from where Shirone sat silently rotated.\n* * *\nThe teacher's room was unusually busy.\nThe instructors who were finished with class usually drank tea or chatted while waiting for their next class, but right now, all of them were analyzing documents.\nThere were dozens of applications for membership.\nSiena, who had just finished her class, was surprised to see the piles of papers.\n\"Oh my, are they all membership applications? There are a lot this week.\"\n\"Hoho, it's almost the end of the semester. Its always like this around this time of the year. What a bunch of sneaky kids.\"\nAs the students could replace the performance evaluation with a presentation from the research group, it had become a recent trend for students who were not part of a group to temporarily join one at the end of the semester.\nThadd, who was assisting with the work, said.\nThe kids are only becoming sneakier and sneakier. It wasnt like this in the past, they used to be so passionate about their research group and the performance evaluation. I think students these days only focus on efficiency.\nHahaha! Its not what it used to be. Compared to 10 years ago, competition has become more fierce, so they must be experiencing a fair amount of stress. The reason for creating a temporary research group is probably to buy time for their personal studies.\nThats true, but I just think they are too obsessed with performance and grades. Theres a thing called school life romance, you know? They should learn to unwind.\nThe instructors who agreed with Thadd could only give bitter smiles.\nTheres one thats left out.\nHuh? Where did that come from? It seems like someone came in during class to turn it in secretly.\nHoho, they must have been in a hurry.\nSiena was curious to see which student was sneaky enough to do such a thing and scanned the paper.\nThis Says Shirone, right?\nAn instructor poked his head out to check.\nLooks like it. Shirone Arian. I thought he had no interest in joining a research group. I guess students left and right use all kinds of sneaky tricks, so theres no helping it.\nThadd frowned after seeing the application form that had been passed to him.\nI dont think so. This research group Isnt it pretty famous? This group already existed even when I was a student.\nShow me again.\n* * *\n* * *\nSiena checked the name of the research group Shirone joined.\nIt was a famous one indeed.\nSupernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\nHer head throbbed thinking back to the time when she fought with the people from this research group.\n\"Oh? Come to think of it\nDidn't most of the problem kids from the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group graduate last year?\nThang gave an empty laugh.\n\"I heard he did amazing during the Speed gun. Seems like they get along well. I really didnt think they would get along at all.\nSiena spoke with a pained expression.\n\"Yes. That is why it's a problem.\"\nIf Yiruki, who came second to none after Shirone, persuaded him, the honest and naive Shirone might have changed his mind.\nBut she couldn't believe Yiruki would do something like that.\nYiruki crosses the line too often. If by chance Shirone and Yiruki work together to do something, then there will be two big explosions. Let's cut off the bad line this time.\nSiena looked in the file to see who the president of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research group was.\nNade.\nThe two who were closest to Shirone. She now knew why Shirone had joined the group.\nThe instructor in charge of Nade\nShe found the person listed on the instructors list. And as soon as she read the name, she pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed.\nHaah Of all instructors.\n* * *\nOn a training ground located on the outskirts of the magic academy, Ethella sat crossed-legged. She was meditating.\nThe Karsis Order, which she was part of, was the best one in the kingdom. It had more than 1,000 monk apprentices alone.\nAnd though hundreds of children entered holding their parents hands, only a few whose talents were recognized became monks.\nAnd among those recognized, Ethella was a unique existence.\nShe became the youngest bishop, beating numerous high-ranking aristocrats and even royalty.\nOne could not earn the position of bishop just because of great talent.\nThe reason why Ethella caught the eyes of her predecessors was because of her nature as a natural truthseeker.\nBe the light and salt of the world.\nWith this mindset, she left her wealth and honor behind and became an instructor at the Alpheas Magic Academy.\nThank you for allowing the students to complete their education safely today.\nGratitude for nature that made me come true.\nHer sense of duty to share that gratitude with others was what made her, her.\nAt some point, Ethella suddenly opened her eyes wide.\n......\nShe felt a female walking towards the training ground through her Spirit Zone Synesthesia.\nTypically, it was not possible for someone to determine the gender of a person through the Spirit Zone, but Ethella, a Spirit Zone expert, could obtain information beyond what mages of her grade typically could.\nMage society called people like her Zoners.\nAssuming that an ordinary Spirit Zone was filled with oxygen, a Zoners Spirit Zone was filled with liquid.\nThe pressure of the medium was different, thus allowing Zoners to feel things through synesthesia much more accurately.\nEthella prepared tea to greet her guest and soon, the door to the training ground opened slowly.\nWelcome, Ms. Siena.\nAlthough she did come without any notice, Siena was not surprised to hear Ethella greet her. She knew how detailed a Zoners Spirit Zone could be.\nI see you were practicing asceticism. Am I bothering you?\nShe assumed as much, considering Ethella was wearing her asceticism garment.\nEthella shook her head as if to say she didnt mind.\nNo, no. I finished just now. Come in.\nThen, excuse me.\nSiena was unfamiliar with having to sit on the ground, even if there was a cushion, but she showed no sign of discomfort and received the tea with two hands from Ethella.\nShe had heard from somewhere that refraining from conversing during the first cup of tea was the etiquette of the Order, so she did not say a word until she emptied the bitter tea.\nThe daytime was long as it was summer, but she could already see the golden horizon from the sun setting outside.\nSiena, who wanted to start the conversation before dark, quickly finished up her hot tea.\nThe corner of Ethellas eyes crinkled.\nFor you to come all the way here It must not be a simple matter.\nYes. I have something to consult with you.\nI see. What is the matter?\nMs. Ethella, you are the instructor in charge of Nade, correct?\nYes, he is a bright student. His grades are in the high-mid ranks, and he has plenty of talent. Not to mention, he gets along with the other children as well.\nIf that is the case, then do you also know that hes the president of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group?\nOf course. Did he cause some sort of trouble?\nSiena pushed aggressively.\nIm planning on disbanding that research group. I came here to ask for approval from his instructor as I feel it is only proper to do so.\nEthella savored her tea and smiled.\nShe was deep in thought for a while, but eventually, she finally opened her mouth to speak.\nIf that is what Ms. Siena desires, then Im sure its for the betterment of the student. However, this time around at least, I must hear the reason behind your decision.\nMany incidents and accidents stem from the Supernatural Psychic Research Group. It was a group that gained notoriety even before I took office. Of course, theyve also made great achievements, so the academy has let them slide more than a few times. But things have changed. I looked through the documents and found out that they have not made a single official presentation in the last three years. And not only have that, they even continuously show bad behavior.\nHowever, as you said Ms. Siena, Doesnt their notoriety stem from actions committed a long time ago? The current president is Nade. Cant you watch over them a little longer? The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group is one of the oldest research groups in Alpheas Magic School. It has generations of history. I know that Garold Mikeah, the president of the Thormia Magic Association, came from that group.\nSiena expected this kind of response, so she took out her hidden card.\nShirone submitted an application for membership today.\n......\nThat closed Ethellas mouth.",

      "content": "Chapter 52\nYou know Yirukis a member, right? All three of them are students that the academy keeps an eye on in one way or another. Although we cant interfere with who hangs out with who, the research group is not a club. Many students are absorbed in the performance evaluation, but if Shirone, at this time, joins a research group simply because he is close with them, he will fall behind.\nThadd enjoyed the idea of a school life romance, but Siena thought differently.\nWhat year is he living in? Students are so bright these days. Times have changed.\nEthella covered her mouth to hide her laugh.\nYou havent changed. Well, its true that the three of them are promising prospects in the eyes of the academy. If his grades fall, the academy will be at a loss too.\nSiena didnt deny it.\nI do not think theres anything wrong with trying to get talented students to grow and advance forward. Thats what I think education is for, after all.\nYes, I fully understand.\nEthella smiled and nodded her head, making Siena regret her earlier remarks.\nShes such a good-natured person.\nShe could see why students liked her.\nEthellas view of education was the complete opposite. Never favor or force someone. Siena felt that such an approach would only make the students fall behind. However, looking at the results, the kids under her care were by no means inferior to Sienas.\nAm I being selfish? I have no intention of ruining the fun of their school life But what will be the future of the students if they end up wasting their talent?\nSiena let out a sigh.\nI don't know. Im not sure why children who have such great potential are going down a different path. I also dont know why Shirone applied for such a place.\nEthella silently looked down at her cup as she was lost in thought.\nShe was the only one who knew about Shirones Nirvana.\nThe reason why she didnt report such a matter to the academy was because doing so recklessly could flip Shirones life 180 degrees.\nIt is Shirones realm. Its his Sigh, I had hoped that he would be able to make his own decisions for as long as possible, but it seems like\nSiena was his instructor, and she seemed to genuinely care about Shirone, so Ethella felt like talking about it would not be a bad idea.\nBy any chance, has Shirone been acting strange lately?\nSiena blinked.\nIm not sure, but I suppose every now and then, yes. Though, I imagine its all because hes hanging out with them. He probably even only applied to join the research group because Nade and Yiruki persuaded him to.\nPerhaps, there is another reason.\nWhat does that\nIm sorry for not telling you this before, but the reason for Shirones strangeness has something to do with the Speed Gun exam.\"\nEthella told her the story of Shirone entering Nirvana during the exam.\nSienas face turned pale.\nAre you sure? Thats an Immortal Function.\nSiena was shocked. After all, it was a peak state.\nThough, that didnt mean Shirone had reached the highest peak of that state.\nIn terms of the state alone, there were recorded cases of street beggars realizing deeper degrees than mages. It was too dangerous of a concept for Shirone, who was only a student, to control.\nWhy did you not notify me of this sooner? This is an extremely serious problem.\nEthella believed there was no such thing as big problems or small problems. Thats why she handed the reins over to Shirone, as she believed the difficulty of a problem was dependent on who was undertaking it.\nShirone already knows. Nirvana is the highest quality of realization that even I have never experienced. When it comes to Nirvana, I thought there was no room for anyone to intervene.\nI understand how you feel. We cant force others to do something we dont know about. But what if there is an Overflow? Then there will be no turning back.\nOverflows occurred when a certain talent was awakened at a mentally underdeveloped age.\nIn fact, some even say that the younger you experience it, the more of a genius you are. But Siena felt that those sayings were nothing more than irresponsible remarks made by gossipers.\nSiena experienced Overflow at the young age of 9.\nAt the time, the world reflected in her eyes was not all rainbows and unicorns. In fact, she was filled with even more curiosity, as the more she knew, the bigger her Why? got.\nEventually, her mind bore a mysterious monster that ate at her psyche.\nIt was unbearably frightening, so she locked all her doors and dwelled in darkness.\nDespite the continuous attention given by the Olifer Academy, her condition showed no signs of improving.\nSiena remembered the darkness she had resided in for a year Though she also remembered very clearly the single ray of light that cracked through the darkness like a miracle.\nA voice that sounded like it came from a boy rang out.\nSiena, lets get out of here.\nSiena could even see the gleam of the boys golden hair from a crack in the doorway.\nIf that mysterious man had not reached out his hand at that time, Siena would not be here.\nMs. Ethella.\nSiena said as she came back from her flashback.\nI suffered from Overflow as a child. Im sure you did as well?\nIt mustve sounded like a silly question.\nThe average age at which mages reached Certified Grade 6 was 28 years old.\n* * *\n* * *\nSiena and Ethella were both 26 years old, and they both reached certified Grade 6 six years ago.\nConsidering it took an average of 10 years to rise from Grade 6 to Grade 5, they ranked near the top among Grade 6 mages.\nYes, I experienced it when I was seven years old. Thats why I entered the Karsis Order. But I was lucky to meet nice people. Thanks to them, I was able to get out of it with no problem.\nTwo years earlier than Siena. But it was nothing to be jealous about.\nIt must have been hard.\nThe younger you were, the bigger the fear Overflow generated.\nIt was scary. If I hadnt entered the Order, I probably wouldnt have been able to live normally.\nIt was only possible because the Karsis Order was where the worlds best truth-seekers gathered.\nBut why are you leaving Shirone alone? I know hes a smart kid, but were talking about the Immortal Function. His mind must have been affected. In fact, hes probably still experiencing problems.\nThere is nobody who can help Shirone. Only those who have experienced the Immortal Function can understand it. It would be different if he asked for help, but if we do things carelessly and too hastily, we might negatively affect his mind. We have no choice but to watch for now.\nSiena was frustrated.\nThen what if something irreversible happens? If theres a sudden change in Shirones mind, then that means its too late. No one can be responsible.\nEthella placed down her cup and spoke.\nI dont teach students just to be responsible. I believe that Shirone will overcome it well.\nBut\nBut.\nEthellas eyes hardened.\nIf worst comes to worst, Im prepared to atone for the rest of my life.\nSiena closed her mouth.\nThinking that maybe what she lacked was resolution, Siena clasped her hands together.\nI understand what you mean.\n* * *\nThe Supernatural Psychic Science Research Groups H.Q.\nAs the iron door opened, Nade and Shirone walked through the thick clouds of dust.\nPooh, Pooh!\nShirone fanned his hand in front of his face to fight against the dust while Nade did not care and plopped down on the sofa.\nYiruki was playing chess.\nHe was alternating between white and black. His hand moved with no hesitation.\nWhen the game ended, he lined up the horses again to start the next round.\nYoure here? How was today?\nEh, so-so. Nothing interesting happened.\nShirone sighed at the sight of his friends.\nYiruki skipped classes every day and played chess while the only thing Nade did after coming to the research group was sleep.\nYiruki, you skipped todays afternoon classes, right? What are you going to do if you get suspended?\nIts fine. I just need to raise my exam scores enough to offset my attendance.\nIt was a cheeky answer, but Shirone couldnt refute because ultimately, Yiruki was right.\nCurrently, Yiruki was holding out in Class 5 with only his scores from STEM, as his grades in all the humanities subjects was zero. This meant that Yiruki was throwing away an easy 20-point increase to his final grade.\nEven so, isnt this too much? This is my first time seeing kids in Class 5 who don't study.\nAnyways, they knew how they were doing, so Shirone didnt do anything about it.\nIn fact, Shirone felt stupid as he was ranked below them.\nI guess I joined this research group pointlessly.\nYo, whatre you saying? What did we do?\nYou call it a research group, but we dont do any academic activities, we just play and hang out And yet, your grades are still better than mine. I feel more anxious because Im hanging out with geniuses like you guys.\nYiruki swerved his head and stared at Shirone with a blank face\n__\nLook whos talking. Is that supposed to be a funny joke? Cause if so, Im sorry, but it didnt do its job. I dont know if youve forgotten already, but you were the one who dumped a bucket full of humiliation on me.\nI know, right? Hes so modest to the extent that I smell a whiff of arrogance. I want to wring his neck right now.\nNo, Im serious. Starting today, Im going to decrease the time I spend in the research group. You guys arent going to do the performance evaluation anyway, right? Id rather use that time to study than sit here and watch you guys roll around in all this\ndust\n.\nMy\nNade smacked his lips.\nShirone was such a model student that if he didnt get to study at least a bit every hour, he would have an uneasy expression as if he had stepped on dog poop.\nThen why dont you study here instead?\nHuh? Here?\nYeah. We feel a bit bad for you, too. We want to play with you, but we feel like were disturbing you. Not a bad idea, is it? Maybe well be motivated and do something, too.\nHmm\nHe didnt think the studying would go well, but if it could stimulate his friends, why not?\nNade, who proposed all these ideas, laid down yet again on the sofa limply and yawned.\nWhat now? Im really bored.\nShirone was taking out a book when he heard that, and a vein popped out from his temple. However, he tried to punch down that anger knowing that today wasnt the end of it. This was nothing compared to the difficulties he knew he would face in the near future while studying here, so Shirone took no heed and began studying.\nYiruki, who was now on his 34th round of chess, spoke while busily moving his pawn and bishop.\nIf you have nothing to do, just read a picture book. I got one for this month. Its inside the safe.\nOho, really?\nNade quickly rose up and dug through the trash pile under the table as if to dig a tunnel.\nPicture book? Is it some kind of famous painting collection?\nNade was kind of bothering Shirone as he was wiggling around under him. But since Shirone was also interested in art, he let Nade off the hook. For now.\nAfter slipping out from the garbage pile, Nade crawled out from under the table and waved a book in the air.\nHAHAHA! The latest release of the picture book!\nEh?\nShirones eyes grew into two circles.\nThe cover was far from being a book related to famous paintings. Actually, it was not at all what he imagined it to be. The background color was red, and on top of that, there was a picture of a vulgar woman on the cover. The title of the book was Female Body Research Group. It was written along the sewing line.\nWhat on earth is that strange book?\nOh right, you dont know about this, do you? This right here is a picture book. A secret magazine circulated by the Shadow Research Group. It is popular among male students because it mainly has female illustrations, but it is also a source of gossip. In fact, a few months ago, some of the academys confidential files were published.\nConfidential? How is that possible?\nIt either means there is an infiltrator on the teachers side, or that the research groups ability to gain information is beyond imagination Though, its probably the latter. The Shadow Research Group has an extreme dislike for instructor interference.\nYiruki added.\nShould I say its unproductive amusement for humans that have nothing to do? The academy periodically confiscates publications, but its a branch organization, so they cant capture the main figure. I dont even know who the president is. However, the common opinion is that the leader of the Shadow Research Group is in the Advanced class.\nAdvanced Class How does this even make sense?\nIndeed, that person was on a completely different level compared to Yiruki and Nades effort to kill time.",

      "content": "Chapter 53\nWhen Shirone turned the cover, there was an article written along with an illustration of a female student he believed to be from the Advanced class.\nThe magazine mainly consisted of trivial stories and incidents, but that was the off-putting part. Someone had put in the work to find all of these things out.\nWow.\nThe most shocking thing was the illustrators drawing skills. It was as if the drawings were real.\nIs this really done by one person?\nEvery time Shirone turned a page, he awed in amazement.\nWhy make gossip magazines? With their skill, they could have been a renowned painter.\nThen he saw a familiar figure that made him stop turning the page.\nHuh?\nIt was Amy Karmis.\nOf course, she wasnt drawn any worse than the others, but what caught Shirones eye was her daily routine.\nThe things she did during break and who she ate with, everything was written in detail.\nShirone couldnt find his name.\nThey really have nothing to do.\nShirone felt strange hearing about her daily life in detail through someone elses writing.\nNade read his mind.\nWhat are you so angry about? She ate with her classmates. She can choose to eat with other male students from the Advanced Class, no?\nYiruki cackled.\nCant you tell just from Shiros personality? I dont think theyre even dating. Hey, be honest with me. You guys havent even held hands yet, right?\nShirone threw the book he was holding.\nHmph, mind your own business. Anyways, stop looking into stuff like this. Lets please do something productive. Were still a research group. How can we be like this all day?\nRealizing that studying with them was out of the picture, Shirone decided to find something he could do with his friends.\nIf so, why dont we check out Nades invention? The list of patents of Nade the Wiz.\nNade leaped to his feet.\nRight! There was that. Alright, Shirone. You will be really surprised, so look forward to it.\nNade crawled back under the table. Shirone bent down, curious to see what was inside the garbage dump, and was surprised to see a safe concealed among the trash.\nTada!\nNade took something out, but nothing was visible to Shirone.\nWhat?\nThen, when Nade waved his arm, Shirone felt like the area around his hand was wavering based on a certain boundary.\nNo way!\nHaha! Yeah! Its an invisibility cloak!\nAn object that refracted light with electrical power and created an illusion that made it seem as if light passed through it.\nYou really made it? This?\nElectric magic was often just used for or associated with lighting or electric attacks, but in reality, that field of magic was divided into many more branches and series.\nOne of them was the illusion branch that dealt with virtual vision. Nade created a magic weapon that had the same effect as the Invisibility magic that caused the transparency effect.\nThough it wasnt his original invention, being able to produce the invisible cloak required the ability of an incumbent professional.\nMy dream is to become a magic engineer. Of course, compared to those expensive invisibility cloaks out in the market, this is nothing. The material is low quality, and not to mention the charging ability is insufficient. It only lasts an hour. But still, not bad, right?\nNade put on the cloak. His figure disappeared\nThe quality of the invisibility cloak depended on the refractive index of light, and if it fell below 95%, it could not be considered invisible anymore. So even a 1% difference was the criterion for determining its technological prowess.\nCurrently, Nades item was not 99%, which was the industrys best, but it had a high enough refractive index of light to be called transparent.\nWhen Nade moved, a blurred boundary could be detected.\nHowever, when he was standing still, the boundary was almost nonexistent\nShirone suddenly thought of something.\nYou know, if you dumped that effort into studying, Im sure youd get much better grades.\nHaha! Probably, but Im happier when I make magic tools. Hold on, I have more stuff.\nNade pulled something out from the safe again.\nA miniature electric-powered carriage and holographic vision that made 2-D drawings into 3-D were also completed.\nThere were also flashbangs and smoke bombs that were Yirukis idea, but they were not unique enough to be on Nades patent list.\nAnd if you press this button\nShirone carefully observed Nade who blabbered on and on about his works. It was his first time seeing him so enthusiastic.\nHes not wasting his talent.\nIt was true that they were problematic kids, but Nade and Yiruki had expertise ahead of any of their peers.\nThe rotational speed per second for this carriages power plant is Huh?\nNade, who was so engrossed in explaining, felt the room suddenly shake and looked up at the ceiling.\nThe vibrations became worse, and when the horses stationed on top of the chessboard fell down, Yiruki went out to the hallway after having a realization.\nDamn it! Teacher! Teacher incoming! Get those things! Clean it up!\nWhat? Whats happening?\nThere wasn't any time to explain.\nNade hid the picture book as if he had done this a thousand times and just rammed the smoke bombs and the uncertified funds for the research group into the safe.\nFinally, after all the items that violated the academy rules were disposed of, Nade snatched Shirone and sat him on the sofa.\nSit here! Were in for questioning!\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Estas engine system began to operate.\nA red warning light flashed in the hallway. It announced that the research group would soon be summoned to the first floor.\nTeachers coming? Then why are we sitting down like this? Arent you going to greet them?\nNade sat Shirone back down.\nNever mind that! Just act as if nothing happened. Everythings normal. We werent doing anything, okay? If we get caught with things like the picture book or the smoke bomb, things wont end with a simple probation.\nHuh? O-Okay.\nHearing the word probation, Shirones heart sank, but before he knew it, he calmed down.\nNade was tongue-tied at the insane switch speed, but at least one of his worries went away.\nShirone wont make a mistake I hope. The only thing left is to see which of the instructors will come in\nAfter a final inspection of the room, Nade took a deep breath and sat on the sofa, crossing his legs.\nHah! Come at us.\nThe eyes of the trio hardened.\n* * *\n* * *\nSo annoying.\nSiena massaged her head which was wracked with a painful headache.\nIt took 3 minutes to move Estas warehouse to the first floor. It was more than enough time to not only clean up the area and hide any against-the-rule items, but also to make a run for it.\nIn the past, some instructors tried to infiltrate the laboratory without operating the engine system. However, all they did was lose their way and wander around for over an hour without being able to catch a glimpse of the laboratory. On the other hand, the members freely went in and out of the laboratory. It was natural for the instructors to get angry.\nThese shrewd weasels.\nShe could somewhat make a guess of how they did it.\nThere must be an equation.\nEstas was built as a magic warehouse, but the manufacturing company along with the design layout were not disclosed.\nShe just found it absurd that a student 20 years ago had solved it and used it as a cover-up technique for the research group.\nSiena folded her arms across her chest and tapped her feet against the ground until Estas form was completed.\nThe more I think about it, the more it annoys me. Why the heck is there a research group in this place? What am I supposed to do with these kids?\nThat was why the Shadow Research Group was a problem.\nIf they were a simple delinquent circle like the Black Magician, they would have been easily controlled by the instructors, but the intellectual power of those hidden in the shadows were already outside of the academys palm.\nPR/N: Victims of Black Magician would beg to differ.\nAnd now, just by looking at the members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group, Black Magician would be seen as a joke.\nThis is a ticking bomb. Considering their talents, if they decide to do something together, itd definitely be huge. The problem is if an accident occurs It could lead to the biggest accident in this academys history.\nThe research group had very unique members.\nNade was average during class time, but he showed off his agility and nimbleness like no other while focusing on research-group related projects.\nYiruki. A troublemaker of Class 5. He was born with the Savant Syndrome.\nNow, the star student of the academy, Shirone, had squeezed his way in between those two.\nNo matter how hard she tried to imagine them together, she couldnt. So how were they able to get along so well together?\nWas one talent attracting another? Well, I guess if its Nade and Yiruki, they could happily get along. But\nThe problem was that Shirone was in a dangerous state.\nShe had to prevent him, who awakened the Immortal Function, from falling into Overflow.\nEthella said he could overcome it himself, but there was always that one-in-a-million chance of something going wrong. It was better to be safe than sorry.\nAnd if that one-in-a-million chance became a reality, then Shirones life would forever be changed.\nWhile deep in thought, Estas stopped.\nWithout waiting a second more, Siena entered the warehouse and glared at the sign written Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group. Then she slammed open the door.\nCough! Cough!\nThrough the crazy amount of dust, she saw three hazy figures. Shirone and his friends were sitting down.\nAs expected, they were smiling without showing any sign of surprise.\nOf course, to Siena, this was a familiar sight.\nThe only difference was that all the little devils that she had conflicts with graduated, and a new member was there.\nHow come kids change into this whenever they join this research group? Seems even Shirone is not immune\nNormally, Shirone would have greeted her with a smile, but right now he had the perfect poker face. She understood a little, but to say she wasnt disappointed in the slightest would be a lie.\nNext to Nade, who had an overconfident expression and sat with crossed legs, was Yiruki, who had his back flat against the chair like a delinquent.\nHmph.\nSiena approached them with a snort. The atmosphere was enough to make any normal instructor walk right out the door exactly how they entered.\nNot even gonna greet your instructor?\nNade gave a sniff.\nGuess we were too engrossed in our discussion and missed you there. Welcome.\nNades relaxed appearance as the president was a complete shift from his usual quiet attitude in class.\nThe students research group, which was an autonomous organization, was very wary of instructor interference. Thanks to that wariness, however, they were able to rise to their current position as an axle of the magic academy community.\nHmph. Yeah? All right. Youre trying to say you guys are a research group, arent you? Fine, be that way. But today will mark the last page of your research group.\nApproval had already been given by the Instructors Committee.\nNade questioned.\nAnyways, whats the big issue of the day? Ive been keeping a low profile these days.\nAn official notice regarding your research group has been given. I came to tell you directly. Isnt that what instructors should do?\nThen please sit.\nNade wiped the seat. His attitude showed no hint of a guilty conscience.\nThank you. While youre at it, why not provide a cup of tea?\nYou know, I would love to, but I dont think youd trust the tea wed give you.\nSiena laughed.\nShe guessed that there was no cold water, let alone tea, in such a shabby warehouse.\nPerhaps she didnt hate these kids as much as the previous ones because they had such a witty way of talking.\nAlright. You successfully made me slightly nervous. Ill get straight to the point. The Instructors Committee has decided. I would like for you guys to vacate this laboratory within a month.\nWHAT?!\nAll three pairs of eyes popped open.",

      "content": "Chapter 54\nReturn our laboratory? Why all of a sudden?\nNades shoulder curved inwards as he asked.\nThe corners of Sienas mouth curved up.\nThe management team reviewed documents and found out that you operated the group without meeting the required number of members this semester. The academy has already cut off the subsidy, so Id appreciate it if you clean things up within a month.\nWait a minute! We have Shirone now! 3 members is the minimum requirement for a research group to be recognized.\nBut what did you guys do? What activities did you participate in? If you want to save your research group, you have to produce some kind of research accomplishment or results within a month, which is the due date. Of course, I dont know what kind of research you can do in the field of the supernatural.\nIts not mandatory for a research group to do a presentation. And were not the only research groups, there are many other ones like us too!\nThis ones a special case. Since your research group is located inside Estas, there are a lot of inconveniences in operation, thats one thing. Second thing, the Supernatural Psychic Science Reserach Group in particular has made no achievement except for earning notoriety. The one-month time was only given to you because Ms. Ethella requested it. You should be grateful.\nShirone was totally dumbfounded.\nHe had just entered the research group, only for it to soon be disbanded.\nBut if you guys are really desperate, there is one way to save the research group.\nNade asked with no hesitation.\nWhats that? What do we need to do?\nWithdraw Shirone from the research group. Then Ill overlook this group at least until next semester.\nWhaaaaat?!\nAs expected, Nade blew up.\nNo way! Its not like we forced him to join, we three are friends who always stick together in the academy. Why are you trying to tear us apart?\nYiruki added to what Nade said.\nIf its because I miss class, dont worry teacher. We all are masters when it comes to studying, it is just that we have our own methods of doing so.\nShirone couldnt sit still and just listen.\nI feel the same. I know this research group is notorious, along with the fact that Yiruki and Nade do not diligently attend class. However, even these two pour in an absurd amount of effort into their fields of study. Theyre not wasting their time. So please, be lenient.\nNade held on to a string of hope knowing that Siena particularly treasured Shirone.\nHowever, Sienas mind was set.\nIm not changing my mind. Above all, Shirone, this is a decision made for you.\nA decision made for me? I thought I was working hard.\nShirone, what have you been going through lately?\nShirones heart sank while Nade and Yiruki looked anywhere else but at them.\nSiena knew from their reaction.\nAs expected, he had told his friends about everything.\nYou guys are really\nSiena sighed\nEspecially you, Yiruki. You know that Shirone is in danger of facing Overflow, so why didnt you tell the instructor?\nIt was Shirones first time hearing that term.\nYiruki, what is Overflow?\nIts just Its not a big deal. Its a phenomenon that happens to geniuses at young ages. I experienced it when I was eight.\nSiena was not satisfied with his explanation.\nIf you go into Overflow for a long period of time, your mind may collapse. I heard about the Immortal Function from Ms. Ethella. If we miss the timing, you will fall into a state where recovery is impossible.\nHmm\nShirone thought.\nEven now, the nightmares persisted every night, and he still suffered from the Mourning Sensation. He was worried he would go crazy at some point which made Sienas explanation credible.\nShirone asked Yiruki again.\nH-How was it? For you?\nHmm, there really wasnt much to it. Well, it was a bit scary. When I told my father about it, he said that it was normal for a bastard like me and that I was supposed to live like that for the rest of my life.\nSiena let out a dry chuckle.\nThat was the only thing he had to say to his son who was living in fear.\nHow absurd.\nHowever, considering who Yirukis father was, it was mildly understandable. Anyways, it was true that his father played a part in Yirukis eccentric personality.\nSiena asked Nade.\nWhat are your thoughts?\nHuh? Me? Hahaha, I dont know. I dont know what Overflow feels like.\nSiena sighed. She was hoping Shirone would change his mind after hearing about the experiences of his friends.\nOkay. Whatever it may be, Shirone will leave the research group. And for the time being, he will have consultations with me. If you guys care about your friend, just accept it. The most important thing right now is Shirones mental state.\nNade had a sad expression.\nIsnt that just the academys decision? I, the president of his research group, dont agree.\nSienas eyes hardened.\nIf you think thats loyalty, its not, Nade. You dont know how scary Overflow is, Im sure Yiruki understands.\n* * *\n* * *\nNo. I think its weird, too. Shirone will handle whatever happens. Im glad you worry, but I dont know why you would worry to this extent.\nHis words sounded cold, but this was why they were friends.\nThe fact that Shirone, the main person involved, was not upset by his words proved that their way of thinking was based on the same rationality.\nSo youre saying its okay for Shirone to go crazy?\nI mean, that aint the worst outcome. But rather than that, I think Shirone can overcome it. Isnt it something he has to face sooner or later if he wants to become the best?\nNade took the baton.\nI agree. Sometimes, I think you are too partial to Shirone. We dont really care, but Shirone himself might be feeling quite pressured. Sometimes, I even wonder if you see Shirone as a man.\nSiena did not back down.\nIf you think that way, lets leave it that way. With that, I can be in charge of Shirone now, right?\nEven an instructor could not arbitrarily withdraw a student from a research group unless they broke a rule.\nIn this instance, the decision made by the president of the research group was more important than the management committee, so she had to get Nades approval somehow.\nStop trying to push it through unreasonable means. Is it right for an instructor to see their own student as a potential love interest?\nYou were the one who brought it up first, not me. As long as there is a male and a female, isnt there a possibility?\nNades anger percentage increased at Sienas strategy of twisting the facts despite knowing what was true.\nFine. Then you see me as a male too, right?\nNo. Not in a million years.\n...What are you doing right now?\nNade stood up with an absurd expression.\nYou know what youre saying is inconsistent, right? First, you say there is a possibility, but the next second, you change your words.\nProbability depends on probability. I like nice and honest men. If you dont understand what that means, Ill simplify it. There is a 0% chance of me seeing you as a man since youre acting like a kleptocrat.\nTeacher, can I get wounded by what you just said?\nNo, you cant. Listen carefully. Dont think of trapping me this way. I dont see a student as anything more than a student, but even if you think differently, I dont care. Shirone needs constant surveillance. You guys are the ones insisting on having things go your way.\nNade went speechless and was replaced by Yiruki.\nI know what you are concerned about, but if he cant overcome Overflow, then thats just his limit. Its not like hes gonna die. Shouldnt trusting Shirone be the first thing we do?\nNot gonna die? Were talking about Immortal Function here. There is no guarantee that the worst wont happen.\nThats right. However, in our current situation, where nothing is definite, I think you are overly worried. Thats not attention, its obsession.\nObsession?\nSiena froze.\nThe reason why she couldnt immediately refute was because she knew.\nObsession.\nSiena, lets get out of here.\nOverflow was the incident that left trails of scars and regrets she would never forget.\nIn exchange for reaching out his hand and saving her, the boy lost his light forever.\nPutting together the opinions of my instructor and friends, I think it is something that I have to decide on.\nShirone opened his mouth to talk.\nTo be honest, I wavered after hearing Ms. Siena. Im scared. The nightmares I have every night The possibility that my mind might collapse.\nPulling away from her past thoughts, Siena said.\nThats why you should\nHowever, another part of me is happy.\nWhat Im experiencing now doesnt happen to just anyone. Every time I have a nightmare, Im afraid, but in a corner of my heart, I want to maintain this a little while longer. Maybe there is a secret that hasnt been discovered yet. Something I can find.\nWhat if something goes wrong?\nThat doesnt mean Ill go around cursing and blaming anyone. I dont want to run with my tail tucked between my legs just because Im scared. I will pull it off by analyzing and exploring my situation to the end. I will definitely overcome it.\nSiena was staring straight into Shirones eyes. He was honest. She realized he meant it and dropped her head.\nYou are really alike.\nThe person who had pulled her out of the darkness and into the light had said the same thing.\nSiena, you gotta stare properly. Closing your eyes wont change anything.\nGo away, brother! You dont know anything!\nAt the time, If she had harbored the same level of courage as Shirone, wouldnt that terrible accident have been avoided?\nOkay.\nSiena fixed her expression and pushed up her glasses.\nI understand your thoughts. I respect Shirones opinion and wont place his withdrawal as the condition.\nNo, before that, when will you ever plan on respecting the presidents opinion? Hm? Im the president. The present president of this group.\nHohoho, I dont think you have the leisure to joke around. One month from now. If you fail to produce research results the academy approves of, you will return your lab, and the Supernatural Psychic Research Society will be disbanded. Even though there were a lot of incidents, didnt this research group produce many graduates? That proud achievement may end with your generation.\nNade's face turned sickly pale.\nNow that I think about it\nIt wouldnt end with a simple disbanding.\nThe generations of troublemakers from the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group broke the academys expectations and were currently occupying various key positions in the mage society.\nIn particular, Garold Mikeah, the current president of the Magic Association, was their pride.\nHow could they face those figures if the research group ended in their generation?",

      "content": "Chapter 55\nHow can you do this to us so suddenly? And disbanding a research group doesnt happen with the snap of a finger, you know?\nThats right, but wouldnt the result of the research presentation clear things up? If it turns out to be a mess to the extent your laboratory is confiscated, Im sure the Management Committee will think differently. Of course, Ill be the one to propose the idea.\nNade shouted.\nTeacher!\nYou want to go back to base one? Isnt this a much better proposition than placing Shirones withdrawal as the condition?\nEukk\nNade held his head.\nEven though they were given a month, the fact that the faculty wanted to disband the research group could not be ignored.\nThe Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group had never done an official presentation, even in the past. How could they logically explain ghosts or gods? They didnt even know if those things existed.\nDriven to a corner, Nade chose to throw all his pride and honor away and clung to Siena.\nMs. Siena! Please, give us a chance. Is there any other option other than the presentation? I know that this research groups existence alone is significant. We are the only research group that can strike a blow at the mage society that only believes in logic.\nSo Im telling you to please do\nsomething\nspecial. Weve been lax with you so far. Now it's your turn to prove yourselves. This has already been mentioned to the Instructors Committee, so I hope you guys make the right decision.\nAs Siena stood up abruptly, the three followed suit.\nMs. Siena! Wai\nThe iron door closed with a bang, and with that Shirone and his friends plopped down on the sofa.\nTheir minds were blank as if they had woken up from a dream.\nWere doomed.\nClank. Clank.\nEstas engine system started to return the laboratory to its original position.\n* * *\nA peaceful holiday.\nShirone typically stayed in the library, even on his days off, but today he was holding a drink and looking forward in a daze.\nIt was the same for Yiruki and Nade, who were both sitting next to him, sandwiching him.\nHey, what time is it?\nDont know. I know its not night though.\nWow. Amazing. Didnt know we had a genius sitting next to us.\nThen silence.\nShirone sighed. Then two others sighed shortly after.\nShirone, who could not handle it, leaped up and shouted.\nWhat are we gonna do about our research group? Shouldnt we be using this time to at least come up with a topic to present?\nYiruki spoke.\nYeah, lets think. What research project would be approved by the academy?\nNade shook his head.\nFrom what I know, the research group has never done a presentation. Ever. We have done unique, unusual things, but theres no way the academy will acknowledge that as official anyways.\nThey didnt know how to get supernatural psychic science acknowledged as a legitimate field of study.\nThe three were in a daze.\nThey turned their heads back and forth to follow the movements of students passing by, but their heads were actually blank.\nHey guys, look at her.\nNade was pointing at the beauty who was heading to the front gate.\nShe had a trench coat on and wore heels. She had purple hair that fluttered down to her waist.\nLooking through a biological viewpoint, those are some good designs. Who is sge?\nIs she an Advanced Class senior? Kids our age dont typically wear that kind of stuff.\nWhile his friends continued chatting, Shirone squinted his eyes to have a better look at the woman. She looked familiar.\nWait Isnt that Ms. Siena?\nWhat? Ms. Siena?\nYiruki and Nade stared at her.\nIt certainly was. Her hair was neatly tied up, and she wore no glasses, but it was no doubt Siena Olifer.\nWow, how can a person change so much?\nI know, right? Shes a completely different person with makeup on. But Shirone, you have a good eye for girls.\nThe reason why Shirone recognized Siena was because he had seen her with untied hair before.\nBut Shirone knew better than to expose the fact that she had visited him late at night to his friends.\nHaha! I just have good eyesight.\nWhere is she going? She even has makeup on. Maybe shes attending an important meeting.\nYiruki tapped his chin and said.\nAccording to Ms. Sienas daily schedule provided by the Female Body Research Group, she is off duty today. She has no events both inside and outside the academy. Now, that only leaves one possibility Shes going on a date.\nDate? No way. You know Ms. Sienas personality.\nStill, Im sure shes at least seeing someone. Shes 26. The pressure her family must be putting on her Its probably no joke. And her seeing someone isnt going to lower the value of the Olifers name or anything.\nHmm, is that so\nNade was rubbing his chin when his friends eyes suddenly shined.\nShould we follow her?\nThen what? What are we gonna do after?\nTheres nothing to do, anyway. Nothing will come from us sitting here wracking our brains for something. And be honest, you guys are curious too right? Its our day off anyways, so we just have to be back before the sun sets.\nYiruki was skeptical.\nCan we follow without being caught? Shes a Grade 6 mage. Her eyes alone are not comparable to the average humans eyes. And dont even get me started with her Spirit Zone. Well get caught real quick.\nThen lets do this. Yiruki, you track down teacher while Shirone takes over as the middle man. Keep track of her while I stop by the lab.\nShirone saw through Nades plan.\nInvisibility cloak?\nExactly. If we follow with the invisibility cloak, even teacher wont notice. What do you think?\n* * *\n* * *\nYiruki finally showed interest.\nTailing a certified Grade 6 mage. Sounds fun. Ill leave now. Shirone, you pick up Nade in the middle.\nNot even waiting for a reply, Yiruki got moving towards the front gate while Shirone let out a sigh.\nSeriously, they excel in execution\nNade got ready to set off.\nThen, Ill leave this up to you Shirone. You have the most important role. You can regulate the movement and distance, right?\nSince the direction of the city was divided into artificial structures called roads, you could determine the approximate location by checking the Points. The Point was used to locate the middle confluence site.\nShirone could do nothing but nod.\nEven in this situation, he didnt like that he had already finished the calculations in his head.\nAlright, alright. You have to come quickly, though. You cant take more than 10 minutes.\nHaha! As expected of Shirone! I believe you!\nWhile Nade left for the research lab, Shirone followed behind Yiruki for seven minutes. Then he quickly returned to the front gate, picked up Nade, and ran for five minutes along the road he had memorized. Yiruki greeted them once they had caught up.\nNade asked immediately.\nWheres Ms. Siena?\nShe turned right at the bakery, so she must be heading to the commoners district. We should be able to catch up.\nCommoners district?\nIt was a different route than what they had expected, but the important thing was to go wherever Siena went.\nThey were on the move when Nade asked.\nWhy the commoners district? Dates are usually done in the aristocratic district. Is she meeting a commoner?\nWho knows? But theres something else thats strange. Shes too on guard. She was constantly paying attention to her surroundings. Good thing I was watching through the corners of my eyes, otherwise, I would have been caught.\nThings are getting exciting! Perhaps shes earning under-the-table money through prohibited items like us?\nShirone just stared blankly at Nade as if he couldn't lose any more brain cells.\nTeacher doesnt do things like that.\nTsk! Whatever. We can protect the research group if we discover such scenes.\nYiruki pointed to Siena who was far away.\nFound her. That was close.\nThe three wore invisibility cloaks in the commoners district.\nThe road was crowded with people who came to do early business. This made it easier for them to tail Siena.\nThe place Siena arrived at was a two-story house.\nThe three poked their heads out the corner of a building and watched to see who would open the door.\nAs soon as Siena started looking around, the three heads quickly disappeared from the corner of the building.\nShe is so cautious. Whose house is it for her to be like that? Its just a normal home.\nWhen the three gave in to their curiosity and pulled out their heads once again, a blond man opened the door and came out.\nHe awkwardly gave Siena a hug and led her inside the house.\nThe door closed behind them, and Shirone and his friends stared at it for a good ten seconds.\nIts a man. Right, guys? That was a man, right?\nYeah. But isnt it weird? That means they're dating, but why be so cautious?\nIs it because hes a commoner? Shes from the House of Olifer. Disapprovals must be no joke.\nShirone had a different opinion.\nThey didnt seem like a couple to me. What should I say? There was an underlying awkwardness?\nAfter hearing that, Yiruki and Nade were somewhat convinced what Shirone said was true.\nIn the midst of them just standing there, Nade made a suggestion.\nShould we go in and check?\nWhat?! But its a strangers house.\nI just smell something suspicious. As you said, theres no reason for Ms. Siena to be so vigilant. Theres no one in the academy who knows about this. Even that tenacious Female Body Research Group has no articles about this. That must mean she was very discreet.\nThey would have given up if it werent for the invisibility cloaks.\nSo what are you planning?\nWe could enter using the underground warehouse. Even if we get caught, I mean, what's the worst thing that could happen? And plus, its Ms. Siena who went in, so technically hes not a random stranger to us, her students.\nReally?\nWe cant just give up here. Our research group is on the line here. We need to grasp any string of hope. Wait here. Im the president, so Ill be responsible for us if we get caught.\nArriving at the entrance to the underground warehouse, Nade examined the iron door.\nShirone asked a question when Nade took out a gadget the size of a wine opener from his pocket.\nWhat is that?\nYiruki answered instead.\nNades patent-pending invention, the Master Key. It pressurizes the internal system of locks. It can capture the springs of the lock up to a hundredth of a centimeter. Unless the lock was created using a master artisans bearing method, the key can unlock pretty much anything. The bearing method is a type of lock in which the ball is caught in the housing of the lock. So even a little bit of excessive force causes the ball to slide and\nDone.\nNade unlocked the lock before Yiruki could finish his explanation. He opened the door, and the smell of vegetables made its way into their noses.\nIts a food storehouse. I can go through here.\nWhen Nade climbed the ladder, Shirone followed him and said.\nWait. I cant send you alone. Well go with.\nIf Shirone couldnt stop Nade, then the least he could do was try to make sure they wouldnt get caught.\nThe last one to enter was Yiruki, who closed the iron door behind them.\nDuring that time, Nade observed the atmosphere.\nIts quiet. Lets head up.\nThe three had their invisibility cloaks on and the only thing remaining was their three heads that floated in midair.\nPR/N: Essentially, Imagine an old-school cloak. They cant hide their faces as theyd have no way to see, hence why there are floating heads.\nA floor with an integrated living room and kitchen appeared. A furnace was installed in the center.\nAs they climbed up the wooden stairs and arrived on the second floor, they heard talking from the room right around the corner.\nShirone quietly tiptoed near the door with his friends and leaned his ear against it.\nHe heard Sienas voice.\nWhat are you doing? Hurry up.\nSurprised, Shirone and Nade made a fuss using their facial muscles. Yiruki put his finger against his lips and looked at them.\nA moment later, a males voice was heard.\nWait. Im not ready. First, take off your clothes.\nWhen is your wife coming back?\nShe went grocery shopping at the market. Todays the third day of the month, so itll take over 2 hours.\nNade was attacked with another round of shock.\nNo, he looked more appalled than shocked.\nWhat??? Wh-What is going on?!\nShirone had the same thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 56\nNo way. How could this be? Ms. Siena, the symbol of integrity, is?\nThe shock was great as they trusted her character.\nNade tried hard to think positively.\nYeah, no. This will benefit us. We can save our research group with this. We have an excuse to make a deal\nThen, they heard Sienas voice.\nNot wearing it today?\nI just have this feeling. Raise your lower back a little more.\nLike this?\nYes. And your legs slightly this way. Yes, that's good.\nShirone and his friends faces flushed red.\nIt was common knowledge that adults expressed their affection This way. But this was an affair.\nI cant let this be.\nNade bit his lips, and when he turned back to look at his friends, they nodded their heads as if to agree.\nThen Ill begin.\nAs soon as they heard the males voice, Nade, whose eyes were on fire, turned the doorknob and barged through.\nMs. Siena! Were so disappointed!\nShirone and Yiruki followed behind, with one of each eye shut closed.\nThere was silence.\nShirone slowly turned his head and looked, beginning with the corner of the room, and he was surprised to see what he saw.\nEh?\nHe saw Siena sitting upright on the bed, while a large canvas was standing on the other side.\nHuh? HUUUH???\nShirones companions could only open and close their mouths repeatedly.\nThe same thought crossed their minds.\nWere in deep shit now.\nThey werent the only ones surprised.\nWhat? How did you guys?\nNothing could be more embarrassing than running into your students while in a personal situation.\nDont tell me You guys followed me?\nYes? No, thats not Well, what happened was we were just sitting in the park, you know? Then you passed by us real suddenly. So\nThat means you did tail me!!!\nEEEEK! Im sorry!\nShirone and his partners in crime closed their eyes tightly.\nKnowing Sienas personality, things wouldnt end with just a harsh scolding.\nHowever, contrary to their expectations, no burning meteors or snow the size of baseballs fell on them.\nWhen the three slowly opened their eyes, they saw Siena lost in thought.\nHow did they follow me?\nShe had kept her guard up to the fullest on her way here.\nShe had not entered the Spirit Zone, but her ability to perceive was not sloppy enough not to catch a few students shadowing her.\nShe was sure that the answers she was looking for would be behind the students.\nWhat are you hiding? Give it here.\nNade had a fearful look on his face and violently shook his head.\nBut with one murderous look from Siena, Nade quickly held out the cloak he was hiding with an expression as if someone had kicked his puppy.\nThough, his wit remained until the very end, so he didnt forget to turn the cloak inside-out.\nWhat is this?\nShe saw a dirty cloak and wrinkled her face. But soon after, she saw what it truly was.\nThis was because the arm holding the cloak seemed to disappear the moment she turned the cloak right-side out.\nWhen she wrapped it around her waist like a skirt, her lower body disappeared.\nInvisibility cloak?\nSiena finally realized the whole story and glared at Nade as if she wanted to swallow him whole.\nNade, is this also one of the items you patented?\nYes.\nAnd you really made it yourself?\nB-But I didnt put it out on the black market! I have a conscience!\nHaaah\nThe students flinched the moment Siena sighed.\nHowever, she no longer nagged at them.\nConsidering she was a Grade 6 mage, she blamed her own lack of skill for not catching on.\nIf you knew you were going to get caught, why did you come inside this room? And what did you mean by disappointed?\nShirone said with a slight tremble in his voice.\nAt first, we tailed you for fun, but when we saw you hugging a man, we followed you in. And the conversation led to what we believed was an affair, so we just\nWhat? An affair?\nSienas face turned red.\nThey had never seen her so flustered\nWhat do you mean affair! Me? An affair?! How could you have such a thought?!\nNade snapped back.\n* * *\n* * *\nHow could we not! Each word of that conversation was very suspicious! And who is he, anyway?\nNade pointed to the man who was still hidden behind the canvas.\nThe chair the mysterious man sat on made a squeak.\nAre you talking about me?\nA voice warm enough to soften a heart was heard.\nA moment later, his face was revealed. The three mischievous students froze.\nHe was a handsome man in his late 20s. He had long blond hair that stretched down to his waist.\nBut what really surprised them was not his looks, it was the worn-out cloth wrapped around his eyes.\nThis person\nHe was a blind artist.\nAs soon as Shirone realized that, the Mourning Sensation that was being a bother hit him with great intensity.\nHeuk!!\nHis hairs were raised to their ends, and his bones felt like they were freezing all over.\nWhen he clasped his hand that was shaking by the wrist, Nade thought Shirone was scared, so he just patted Shirone on the back.\nDont worry too much. She wont kill us. Ill take the responsibility.\nEh? No, thats not it\nShirone gradually regained a relaxed expression.\nIt was an extreme chill that could not be compared to the usual that he experienced, but it also disappeared really quickly.\nSiena, please stop and forgive them. I dont know the circumstances, but it looks like they are your students.\nWhat are you saying? That makes me want to forgive them less. The tailing I can let go, but they broke into someone elses house. Gosh, they only know bad things.\nThe man smiled kindly.\nBut theyre your students. Their teacher was inside, so they mustve thought it would be okay if they got caught.\nIt was as if he had read Nades mind.\nThats right. Thats really why we did it. Shirone doesnt lie, so you can ask him. We would never have broken in if it was a strangers house. Its not like were petty thieves.\nShirone also nodded his head.\nYes. Nade really told me that. Thats definitely what he said.\nSiena held her head with troubled thoughts.\nThey probably werent lying, but she almost found those big, innocent eyes giving her the look despicable.\nThey even used an invisibility cloak to tail me? They are very shrewd indeed\nDespite the situation, the man only smiled.\nMore than anything else, he was happy to meet with Sienas students.\nI am Armin. Siena and I are like brother and sister. I studied at the Olifer Academy.\nNade grasped tightly onto the hand Armin put out.\nAha, I see. Im sorry for our brainless misunderstanding. And Im also sorry for visiting without any notice.\nSiena exclaimed.\nWhat visit?! Its a break-in!\nHehe. Thats why Im apologizing. To be honest, I feel happy that the misunderstanding about you has been resolved.\nSiena placed her hands on her hips and snorted\nFirst, have a seat and continue your conversation. Ill prepare tea.\nArmin caught on quickly and left the room.\nHe surprised Shirones group again when he walked out of the door with a precise gait even though he couldnt see.\nMs. Siena, who in the world is that? Are you guys really just brother and sister?\nBrother Armin is an alumnus. He was also the greatest talent in the history of the Olifer Academy. Though as you can see, he is an artist now.\nHe sounds like an incredible person. Im not sure if I can ask you this, but what happened to his eyes?\nSienas face darkened.\nNade felt he had asked an unnecessary question.\nFortunately, however, her expression soon relaxed and she spoke calmly.\nTo save me. That is why he lost his eyes.\nTo save you?\nAt the age of nine, I experienced Overflow. I was studying the theory of energy absorption when one day, I received an enlightenment that cant be put into words.\nSiena gave a bitter, tight-lipped smile.\nThe person to save me was Brother Armin. He used to say to me Dont turn away from your fears. Turning your head away from it wont change anything. Do you know how old he was back then? He was 11 years old, just two years older than me.\nSaving Siena from Overflow at that young age was an indication of how talented he was.\nDid you overcome Overflow with Mr. Armins help?\nNo. I was not that strong of a child. I was a proud little kid who received special treatment just because she was born into the Olifer family. At the time, I didnt like my brother because he always habitually said to face fear head-on. I didnt want to do that. It was scary. I couldnt help but close my eyes. I thought he was pretending to know me even though he didnt. I was really ignorant then.\nShirone could not image Siena, a certified Grade 6 mage, crying in fear.\nI used to avoid Brother Armin by going out to the mountains, fields, and river sides. He would always find me, but whenever that happened, I would run away. One day, while continuing with the strange game of tag The incident occurred.\nShe still remembered that day clearly.\nIt was the rainy season, and it had been pouring for several days nonstop. Even under such weather, I was wandering by the riverside. There wouldnt have been a problem if not for the dam collapsing at that exact moment. An enormous amount of water swept through the lowlands. It was a flood that sank half of the village.\nSiena started reminiscing.\nThe young Siena, who was swept away by the water current, could not even scream for help.\nShe struggled for her life. That was what helped her stay alive. But when she came up to the surface, she saw a completely different scene from what she had known before.\nThe pieces of buildings and livestock were being washed away from the upper stream. Jagged trees that were broken were floating downstream.\nThis was the first time she ever feared death.\nHelp me. Someone, please!\nHer body was quickly swept away. Land seemed so far away, and the usual streamlet where she used to pick up pebbles transformed into a large torrent 25 meters wide.\nThe color of the water was dark. So dark, it was almost black.\nThe current flowing downstream rapidly formed a whirlpool as it collided against rocks and boulders.\nHelp me! Someone, please help me!\nDespite studying under the esteemed name of Olifer, all she could do was scream for help endlessly.\nSiena!\nShe pushed up her head with all her might as if she had heard a revelation from god.\nArmin was waiting on top of a tree branch that was dangerously bent at an angle.\nBrother! Brother!\nYour hand! Give me your hand!\nSiena stretched out her arms desperately.\nHowever, due to a sudden rocky current, she became submerged.\nSiena!\nArmin flung his body and dived head first.\nA few seconds later, he came up with Siena in his arms.\nSiena! Hang in there! We have to get out of here!\nS-Save me! Help!\nArmin managed to escape the whirlpool zone by a hairs width, but after looking around, he couldnt help but be disheartened.\nThe only thing awaiting them was a hellish torrent.",

      "content": "Chapter 57\nOh no.\nArmin was only 11 years old at the time, so he could only expand his Spirit Zone and avoid obstacles.\nSiena! Open your eyes! You cant lose your mind!\nBrother! S-save!\nSiena could not calm down.\nIt was impossible for the two young kids to cross the river with their physical abilities.\nArmin realized he had to do it alone.\nWe just have to get to the Delphons region like this. It becomes a delta from there, so the volume of water will decrease. At the speed were going now, we will be there in about 20 minutes.\n20 minutes was too long.\nCould he hold out from the rapid currents with a semiconscious Siena?\nHow stupid.\nOf course, he had to do it. He had no choice but to do it.\nHis view was dimming. He was starting to see scenery that was distorted strangely.\nThey approached countless life-threatening objects.\nArmin twisted his body with all his might.\nHe did not let his eyes stray away from the sight in front of him, even as muddy water pained his eyes, his body slammed against rocks, and broken trees tore his skin.\nAlmost there.\nHe felt Sienas tiny hand pinch his waist.\nHe felt extremely pressured knowing that a fragile life depended on him. But because of that, a greater sense of duty awakened in his mind.\nHe saw their destination lower down the stream.\nHowever, there was no path. Trees that broke towards the river were brutally blocking their way to the delta.\nSiena, listen up. We have to pass under those trees. I will press you down, so you have to hold your breath for as long as you can. Swim as fast and as far as possible, okay?\nBrother! Im scared! I cant do it!\nYou can do it! You have to!\nAs they passed between two whirlpools, the speed of the current doubled.\nIn the unexpected situation, Armin grit his teeth.\nWith only his head and neck above the water, all the debris as a result of the flood came at him like a behemoth.\nHe was trying to stay afloat so hard to the point he could feel a cramp coming to attack his legs.\nSharp objects scratched Armins body as they passed by him. He was bleeding profusely.\nHis body temperature began to fall even faster. He was slowly losing consciousness.\nFinally, they arrived at the tree that was blocking their way.\nSiena! Here we go!\nArmin calculated the distance and waited for the perfect timing.\nRight as they were about to collide, he pressed down Sienas shoulders.\nNow!\nSienas scream was drowned by the water. And Armin, who was barely holding on to his consciousness, noticed that the sharp base of a wet tree was getting bigger and bigger.\nEven with that danger, he concentrated all his nerves on the hand that was pushing Siena under.\nIt wasnt until Siena got under enough trees that his hand went slack.\nGood job, Sie\nCRASH!\nAt the same time as Armin smiled faintly, his face smashed into the tree\nDespite knowing he could lose everything, he still did not close his eyes.\nBROTHERRRR!\nHe heard the sound of Sienas voice fading down the stream.\n* * *\n...Thats what happened.\nShirone and his friends were at a loss for words.\nI was rescued by the villagers after being safely washed away to the Delphons region. There werent any hurdles after I passed the woody area. Later, Brother Armin was also found. He was unconscious. People from the academy were mobilized to treat him, but the diagnosis was permanent eye damage. After the incident, Brother lost his eyesight.\nI see So thats what happened.\nHe personally taught me how to overcome fear. Thanks to him, I overcame Overflow But the price for doing so was his light. He went from being the greatest genius in the history of the academy to It ended just like that.\nShirones heart felt heavy.\nFor a human to lose their vision It was no exaggeration to say it was like losing almost everything.\nOne couldnt read books, and learning magic was bound to be more difficult and restrictive. He could tell how disappointed and distressed Armin must have been.\nI recently found out that my brother came here three years ago. He told me hes developing a style of painting that involves drawing light. Thats why I volunteered to be his model.\nWe didnt even know that Im sorry.\nArmin brought in refreshments just as the atmosphere was about to get dark.\nDid I interrupt? Its rare for Siena to talk about her past like this.\nBrother.\nFirst, heres the tea. Its not the best, but it is my wifes secret recipe, so I think you will find it to your liking.\nOh, thank you.\nShirone and the others politely took the tea.\nArmin returned to his canvas and offered some seats behind it.\nThen first things first, I will have to continue my work, so could my visitors wait here?\nYes, of course.\nThe three held their teacups and wobbled over.\nSeeing Siena return to her position on the bed, Nade cautiously asked.\nUm What did you mean by Not wearing it today? If its like a nude, well be happy to get ou\nHaha! Even though I cant see, I would never ask my sister to do that. Siena, can you bring that thing out?\nSiena took a foil coat out of the closet. It was hard to even look at it because of how much light it reflected.\nThats very bright.\nI cannot accurately see objects using the Spirit Zone alone, so I cover a person or an object with a luminous body so that I can feel the light. In that sense, the foil coat is a very useful tool.\nI see But wow To draw by feeling light.\nIn return for losing my eyes, I am able to draw things other artists cannot. However, today is the last time I will be drawing Siena. A good sponsor has appeared, so I have to move out in a few days. That is why I didnt want her to wear the coat. I wanted to draw the natural feel of her without the coat discoloring her beauty.\nSienas cheeks warmed.\nYoure so What nonsense.\n* * *\n* * *\nHaha! So what? Youre still a 9-year-old child in my head.\nOkay, okay. Just draw it quickly. After Mrs. Keria comes back, you wont be able to work.\nShirone and his companions fingers and toes squirmed at the subtle and warm, yet awkward atmosphere they felt.\nIt was clear that they were like brothers and sisters, but the same blood did not flow through them.\nMaybe the reason why Siena reacted more extremely at the mention of the affair was because she still had lingering feelings for Armin.\nAlright, Ill begin. Im just drawing what comes to me, so its going to end earlier than usual.\nAs Siena took a modest posture, Armin picked up the charcoal and began to draw the outline.\nWhen Sienas appearance gradually became more concrete, the party of three could only admire.\nWow, so fast.\nShhh.\nYiruki warned\nBeing unable to see was a fatal drawback for an artist, so Armin would require more concentration than the usual artist.\nOf course, there was that plausible thought, but Shirone found something odd.\nThats weird. Very weird.\nEven without the luminescence, Armin was accurately capturing even the smallest of details of Siena.\nHow is this possible? Does that mean his Spirit Zone is that precise? But even so\nIncreasing the density and specific gravity of the Spirit Zone may enable precise descriptions through synesthesia. However, Shirone couldnt understand how even the feelings from Sienas expression were captured in the drawing.\nThe art became more detailed, and Siena was wearing a smile that could not be seen at the academy.\nAmrin perfectly embodied her smile using bread like an eraser.\nShirone was almost certain.\nI see. This is impossible.\nOne of the most difficult parts of portraits was the corner of the mouth. This was because even a very subtle change in angle completely changes the feeling of the art.\nUm, Mr. Armin.\n...?\nAs Armin smiled and turned his head slightly, Shirone thought for a moment whether he could ask such a question.\nIf he was wrong, his question would be extremely impolite.\nPerhaps, does Mr. Armin\nHowever, without asking, nothing could be known, so Shirone mustered up the courage.\nCan you see?\nStill wearing that smile of his, Armins hand froze midair.\nHe put down the charcoal and twisted his body.\nYes, I can see.\nShirone was at a loss for words.\nDid he really mean that he could see with his eyes? But why didnt Ms. Siena know of this?\nYou must be curious. Why dont I just show you myself.\nWith his body facing Shirone, Armin untied the piece of cloth wrapped around his eyes.\nThere were numerous scars around his wrapped eyes.\nIm positive he was hurt, but how can he see? No, he had his eyes covered in the first place. And yet\nAt that moment, Armin slowly lifted his eyelids and Shirone felt his heart stop.\nThere were no pupils. It wasnt quite a substitute, but the empty socket where the eye should be was filled with light.\nN-Nade, can you see that?\nShirone slapped Nades leg in a hurry.\nHowever, when he hit Nade, he felt as if he had hit a hard metal instead.\nShirone turned his head and looked at his friends. He jumped to his feet in horror.\nNo way! How?!\nNade was frozen stiff. Not even his eyelids were moving.\nEven Yiruki, who was resting his chin on his hand, and Siena, who was sitting on the bed with a smile. They were motionless like wax dolls.\nArmin approached from behind Shirone, who was in a panicked state.\nIt has been a long time since a guest visited my room.\nIs this?\nYes, its a spell called Stop.\nThe bewildered look returned to Shirones face.\nStop was a spell that only mages who could handle super-light speed could cast, and throughout the entirety of history, only a select few were known to have reached such a level.\nIn short, Shirone was experiencing the absolute realm of Time magic.\nHave a seat. Lets relax and talk since we have plenty of time.\nHa Haha.\nShirone gave an awkward laugh.\nIf time had actually stopped, then plenty of time was an understatement.\nActually, Ive been quite nervous for a while now because I didnt know when you would notice.\nHow did you know I would notice?\nArmin pointed to the light in his eye socket.\nThe organ called the eye takes in light and reconstructs it into visual information. But I, who is without eyes, feel the world through light itself. And its quite a horrific experience. What I see is completely different from how ordinary people perceive the form of objects.\nSo it is the ideal version of sight, then. No interpretation or reconstruction.\nThe human senses were not true and infallible. After all, the human senses could be fooled.\nIll reintroduce myself. I am Armin of the Eye of Light. Those who know me refer to me as the Mage of Eternal Cintana.\nEternal Cintana.\nAs soon as he heard those words, Shirone realized why Armin used the expression room.\nHow How long have you been in this room?\nTime does not flow here, so I cannot answer that. However, if you convert it to the number of thoughts, it should be around 120 years.\nShirone couldnt imagine how strong a genius mage who contemplated and ruminated for 120 years was.\nBut when you were young, Mr. Armin\nYes, it was an unfortunate accident. I left Olifer Academy and wandered aimlessly around the world for 15 years. A pitch black world without even a single ray of light",

      "content": "Chapter 58\nArmin recalled the time.\nIn the midst of darkness, space is not defined. As space disappeared, so did time. Then I came to the realization that the existence of me already broke away from the concept of time. That is the secret to the omnipotence of using the Stop spell.\nShirones heart thumped loudly after hearing the key factor to succeeding with the Stop spell that countless mages had failed to conquer.\nBut Is it okay to tell me something important like this?\nYes, its all right. Ive only told you so that I can help you understand, but the bottom of it is actually quite complicated.\nOf course it is.\nAnd Stop isnt a particularly transcendent spell. It can only be performed within the radius of the Spirit Zone, and its biggest limitation is that it cannot affect the world.\nArmin looked back at Siena.\nShes a good sister, and a soft-hearted child. Dont you think so, Shirone?\nHaha! Im not so sure about the soft part, but one thing thats certain is shes really strong. She is a certified Grade 6.\nYes. She is indeed a certified Grade 6 mage. But time has stopped. As such, can we harm the powerful Siena?\nAh.\nShirone turned to his friends.\nNo matter how it was looked at, they were beyond physical force boundaries.\nWhen time stops, energy cannot move. Its impossible to exchange force.\nYes. The incident itself cannot flow. Lets say we draw the sequence of explosions on pieces of paper. What if we dont have a next page? The explosion is kept frozen on the last page.\nArmin smiled.\nThat is the essence of Stop magic. Time and space are inseparable. It is the same for acceleration and gravity. The mages omnipotence senses the super-light speed within the Spirit Zone of the Stop magic. We have talked for a bit right now, but in reality, less than 0.1 seconds have passed. Relatively speaking, we are moving at the speed of light while having a conversation.\nSpeed of light.\nShirone looked back at Nade again.\nSo thats why we cant interfere with Nade since our current mass is zero.\nA matter with mass could not reach the super-light speed.\nWith omniscience, yes. Thats how it is. Of course, as this is magic, it would have to be combined with omnipotence. It is the mystery of time and space that takes place within the Spirit Zone.\nWhy\nShirone suddenly had a question.\nWhy are you telling me this?.\nIt is because of that doubt, Shirone.\nArmin pulled the strip of cloth tightly around his eyes again.\nYou asked how I knew you would notice, right? It is simple. It is because I experienced the same thing you experienced. We both know each other.\nBy the same experience, you mean\nYes. The Immortal Function.\nShirones heart thumped widely.\nThere was a person in front of him who experienced the Immortal Function, something no one was able to help with. And he was the greatest time mage, no less.\nThe Immortal Function is the realization of the whole. Since the whole is also one, the wavelengths between you and me resonate. That thing is called the Mourning Sensation. Just as you feel from me Shirone, I also feel from you.\n...What is the Immortal Function?\nYou can say it is the gateway to infinity, and you, Shirone, opened that gate. In the mage society, these people are called Unlockers.\nShirone, who was thinking for a moment, looked up.\nWhat will happen to me?\nIt will be all right. If Shirone still values the world, there is nothing to worry about. However Did you feel your ego being scattered when you opened Immortal Function?\nYes, I did! I really thought I was going to disappear.\nIf you had decided to let it, then it wouldve happened. As the Spirit Zone expands to infinity, the mind ceases to exist. It is important for Unlockers to hold that spot. If the mind expands, the power increases, but if you go beyond the point of self-control your ego will be lost in the midst of the uncontrollable sense of freedom. Be sure to bear this in mind. If that happens, there is no turning back.\nShirone gulped loudly.\nAlso, Unlockers always have to keep in mind the size of their Spirit Zone, in other words, their limit. Do not think you have no limit. Limits exist because we are beings that will eventually die.\nShirone mused over his words and asked.\nBut other than that, there is another issue. Every night, I see the universe in my dreams. The Mourning Sensation I felt when I met you keeps on coming back without rest. And its not like there were any other Unlockers around.\nArmin eased Shirone with a smile.\nThat is also a natural step. When the door to the Immortal Function was opened, you reached the realm of infinity. You were the entirety of the universe for a brief moment. There, you became aware of something outside of sensation, cognition, and intellect. But your ego is in shock because it cannot interpret what that something is. Once you become aware of what that something is, the feeling will disappear.\nHow do I become aware of what that is?\nIt will come naturally. I do not know when that time will come. It could be quick, but it could take a lifetime. Do not worry. You already have it, Shirone. It is just in a state that cant be named.\nBut\nArmin was reminded of his past self as he watched Shirone worry.\nFine, Ill give you a hint. Whatever you become aware of, whatever you realize, it will have something to do with the Gauge Symmetry.\nGauge Symmetry?\nHumans think that they themselves are living in a perfectly symmetrical world. As a matter of fact, of course we do. Is there anyone who thinks that having two arms is abnormal, and instead it is normal to have three? Having two arms does not mean that it is absolutely normal, but that is the direction of our existence. However, the universe we are living in is unknown. We do not know the norms of the universe. Perhaps, we humans may never even be able to understand it with our human senses, but\nIt seems that I reached that unknown. Through something that cannot be named under any of our human senses.\nArmin patted Shirone on the head. Sienas student was indeed an outstanding talent.\nThat is why you have no need to worry. Im not saying to do nothing, but in the end, you merely existing will bring out the identity of the Mourning Sensation. Everything will become clear. You will be able to understand me then.\nShirone nodded his head bravely.\nHis thoughts were in disarray, but he knew todays event would be a huge turning point for his future.\nThank you so much. If I didnt meet you, I would have fallen into Overflow like Ms. Siena said. We actually had a small argument a while back. Now, I feel sorry.\nArmin surmised what had happened.\nPlease do understand. She must have been very anxious as she experienced those things in her childhood. In fact, she isnt a child whos at all cold and stubborn. Youll understand when you experience it.\nOf course. I know since I always receive her help. She is a really good person.\n* * *\n* * *\n...Is that so?\nArmin looked back at the canvas with a relieved smile.\nLets slowly leave the room. If I keep the time field for too long, I will lose my concentration and may not be able to finish the drawing before my wife returns. I really want to complete it.\nOh, come to think of it, you said today was your last day, right?\nYes. I may have grandiose nicknames, but I am an artist first and foremost. I plan to pack everything up and leave as soon as possible. I wont be able to see Siena for a while.\nRather, why dont you reveal\nArmin shook his head.\nSiena is still feeling guilty about it. And though I havent given up on magic, it does not mean the two eyes Ive lost have come back. Besides, Im already wedded. I want to help Siena live her life.\nHe did not want to see his precious sister, who he cared for more than his life, tied to the past.\nOkay, then Ill keep it a secret too. Thank you so much for today.\nI also enjoyed today, Shirone.\nArmin sat in front of the canvas once again, and Shirone returned to his seat.\nTime started to flow again.\nHe heard Nade and Yiruki breathing, and the brightness in Sienas smile had returned.\nShirone felt like he just woke up from a dream. He still couldnt believe he had a conversation with Armin.\nTime passed by in a blur, and Armin showed Siena the finished artwork.\nHow is it? Did it come out well?\nYes, its pretty.\nThank you for all this time. It was an honor to draw you.\nYou speak as if were strangers\nA flash of sadness passed by Sienas eyes. Then, when she heard the sound of footsteps downstairs, she stood up in surprise and started to leave without even saying a proper goodbye.\nIs his wife already home?\nShe arrived faster than usual, but Siena didnt have the time to think deeply about it.\nThen Ill be on my way. You guys as well, come on.\nWatching Siena leave as if she was running away, Shirone and his friends couldnt help but be upset.\nTo be frightened just because Armins wife was coming was tantamount to revealing her true feelings.\nJust as Siena was about to grab the doorknob, the door opened. Armins wifes face poked through the crack.\nHoney, are you drawing?\nContrary to the expectation that Armins wife would be as calm as he was, she was a bubbly woman in her early 20s.\nShe looked surprised when she made eye contact with Siena.\nOh, Ms. Siena? Right! Today was the day you were coming.\nHello, Ms. Keira. Its been a long time.\nIt indeed has Why is it so hard to see your face? Perhaps you are avoiding me on purpose? Hohoho!\nSiena tried to hold on to her currently dizzying mind.\nAh, Im done working with my brother. I was just about to head out.\nYoure already here, no need to leave so hurriedly. Have dinner with us.\nI appreciate it, but I have plans\nHmm Somethings suspicious. Honey, did you do anything weird with Ms. Siena while I was away?\nKeira, watch what youre saying.\nArmin shot back with a cold tone, but Keira just shrugged it off.\nAs for Siena, her face was flushed red. She left the room while putting on her coat quickly. One of her arms was still outside of the coat.\nShirone and the other two glimpsed at Keira then followed after Siena.\nWhether she was tactless or simply daring, Keira smiled with her eyes and waved her hand.\nBye, kids\nOf course, there wasn't any response back, and Keira tilted her head at their cold attitude.\nOh my, did I do something wrong? Whats wrong with their expressions? Honey, you really didnt do anything weird, did you?\nStop with your jokes and come down. I want to at least say goodbye properly.\nHmph. When it comes to your sister, you cant do anything.\nArmin technically ran down the stairs.\nIm sorry Siena. Shes a bit unruly.\nIts okay. I dont know when well meet again, so write me letters. And dont forget to take care of yourself.\nAlright, you work hard, too. Still, seeing as how you are getting along well with your students, I feel relieved. To be honest, I was skeptical about you being a teacher. Hahaha!\nSiena smirked.\nArmin was the only one who could treat her like a child. After all, he was the only one who knew her during her immature days.\nShirone watched their touching moment.\nNow he could see why Siena decided to become an instructor, why she was so obsessed with Overflow, and why she tended to stay away from men.\nThen Im really leaving. Take care.\nIll contact you when things are set. Shirone, Nade, Yiruki. Do your best. Ill keep an ear out so I can listen to the day I hear your names associated with greatness.\nYes, and Im sorry again for today.\nShirone and his friends expressed their sincerest gratitude. If it werent for Armins consideration, things wouldnt have ended this peacefully.\nArmin watched until the end as the figures of Siena and her student disappeared into the distance.\nBehind him, Keira was leaning against the door with her arms folded.\nShe spoke with a hard expression on her face.\nArmin, snap out of it. We dont know what will happen if those above see you this emotionally immersed.\nArmin turned around and glowered.\nThey lived under the guise of a married couple for the past three years, but she really was a woman he found off-putting.\nI feel whatever I want to feel. Its up to me and not to you. You just care about your reports. Are you done with the investigation?\nWent flawlessly. Theres nothing more to see in Creas. We have to get to Calvera in 15 days, after all. Though, Im sure it wont be an issue for Armin of the Eye of Light, right?\nThere is no need to talk more than necessary. Ill keep my promise.\nKeira could not relax.\nShe didnt doubt his skills. She was just wary of Armin because he wasnt someone you could let your guard down against.\nYou didnt tell Siena, did you?\nIt was a natural suspicion for someone who could stop time, but Armin kept his mouth shut.\nKeira continued after hearing no response.\nI dont want to harm you. Hell, its not like I can do anything to the Eternal Cintana. But even so, youre only human. The moment you betray the organization, everyone you love will experience hell. That includes Siena Olifer.\nIt was a terrifying threat, and Keiras organization had more than enough strength, power, and brutality to be able to do so.\nArmin was going to protect Siena no matter what.\nIn that sense, he was lucky to meet Shirone. Although he couldnt stand by her side, it was reassuring to know that she had an Unlocker with a great personality by her side.\nNo need to worry.\nArmin smiled as he remembered Shirones face.\nSiena does not know anything.",

      "content": "Chapter 59\nDuring their journey back to the academy from Armins house, the three troublemakers were worried.\nThe atmosphere back at the house was good, but they were afraid Sienas mood would change.\nWhilst continuing to walk on eggshells, they glanced at Siena from the corner of their eyes, she was just walking without saying anything, and her eyes were glued to the ground.\nShirones heart felt heavy seeing her down.\nHad it not been for the childhood accident, they could have developed a good relationship.\nHowever, she did not want to blame Armin for suddenly getting married because she knew he had left her alone in order to help her relieve herself of the guilt.\nNade grumbled.\nTsk. I really cant understand the relationship between a man and a woman.\nYou cant. Its not like everything in the world flows the way you want it to flow. It just happens.\nI honestly dont want to see her like that. Id rather her be angry at us like at the academy.\nNade walked faster to catch up to Siena.\nTeacher.\nHm, huh?\nWere hungry. Please buy us a meal since were already outside.\nShe looked at him with an expression of absurdity.\nGetting disciplined would not even be enough considering what they did, and yet the young man was asking her for a meal, no less.\nYou Are you serious? You still have an appetite in this situation?\nWho cares? A mans gotta eat to live. Even if I go back to get disciplined, Ill have to fill my stomach up first.\nShirone cut in.\nYes, Ms. Siena. Lets eat before we return. Im hungry.\nYiruki decided to pitch in.\nIf so, then I have a suggestion. Lets go to the aristocratic district first. Its close to the academy, and I know a very delicious and expensive restaurant.\nSiena didnt even have the will to get annoyed.\nAlthough her students attitude was a little dubious, she also vaguely guessed why they were doing this.\nBesides, she didnt want to go to the academy in this mood, either.\nNot to mention, she was off duty today.\nAlright, alright. You guys must be very tired after the stunt you pulled off, so let's eat. However, be prepared when we head back to the academy.\nHehe! Yes, maam!\nNade winked back at the other two.\nHis primary goal was to lift up Sienas mood, but if their teachers anger subsided in the meantime, then that would be icing on the cake.\nArriving in the aristocratic district, Yiruki took them to a brightly lit restaurant.\nShirones mouth opened wide in front of the six-story building.\nYhe entrance was very unusual. The pillars supporting the balcony were carved entirely from white ivory, and statues representing divinities from fantasies were guarding the left and right sides.\nGold Cupid.\nThat was the name of the restaurant\nIt was a top-notch restaurant where all the food was premium.\nWow! I havent been here either. Today is just getting better and better. Shirone, lets go in quick.\nHuh? Well\nShirone turned to Siena.\nAs expected, she was staring at the sign with hollow eyes and cheeks.\nIt was the most expensive restaurant in the neighborhood, so it was understandable, but above all, there was no way one would choose a restaurant like this unless they had the intention of swindling their instructor.\nSiena sighed.\nYes, lets eat here.\nOHOOO! As expected of our teacher! So generous! Her wallet must be really out of the ordinary!\nYiruki joined Nades flattery.\nHow foolish. You shouldn't evaluate our teachers generosity with just this. If you are a certified Grade 6 mage, you can come and go to a restaurant like this as if its your own kitchen at home. Isnt that right, teacher?\nNevermind that, just get in there quickly. We have to eat and go straight to the academy, okay?\nIt was Shirones first time in a restaurant dedicated to aristocrats, so he was surprised by the interior, which was much larger than he imagined from the outside.\nThe tables were set up sparsely enough to be considered a waste of space. And one side of the bar was decorated with colorful crystals.\nOf course, all the guests were aristocrats, and it was clear from their accessories that they were retainers of Creas.\nShirone! This way!\nShirone, who was watching everything in fascination, headed to the table.\nNade and Yiruki also looked around from time to time, but they didnt look intimidated by the extravagance.\nA staff member took their order. He was a cheesy guy with an interesting hairstyle. Shirone and his friends noticed how he would keep turning his gaze towards Siena, which they felt quite unpleasant about.\nNo matter how eye-catching a woman was, a man should not blatantly commit such rudeness when she was accompanied by people. It was obvious he took Sienas companions lightly seeing that they were students.\nWelcome. Thank you for visiting Gold Cupid. Since such a beautiful person has come, Im not quite sure what to do.\nNades lips jutted out.\nTsk, wasnt this a top-notch restaurant? Whats wrong with the service? Hes totally treating us like kids\nWith that in mind, he looked through the menu.\nHe was doing a mental calculation to order the most expensive food to prove him wrong.\nWhen Nade ordered a course meal, Yiruki also ordered another course meal without much thought.\nShirone, on the other hand, was struggling. There wasnt a single item he knew.\nHow would Shirone know if braised Olaris was meat, fish, or a monsters tongue?\nStill, he ordered the same thing as Nade because he didnt want to be left out. Yirukis menu just made him too anxious.\nThe face of the staff member hardened seeing the series of VIP-only menus being placed.\nThe first thought that came to his mind was if they could even afford it.\nAll their items were premium, in fact, their highest-price dishes were triple the cost of their lowest-price dishes. If they were ignorant students who were ignorant of their own actions, it might lead to a situation where they would have to pay twelve times the expected price.\nThe staff member gave anxious eyes to Siena, but she was also busy choosing her own menu.\nId like the Dasco course, please. And a bottle of Limunes.\n* * *\n* * *\nSiena didnt drink often, but on days she felt gloomy, she would drink cognac.\nLimunes was a vanilla-scented drink that was popular among women.\nOh? Teacher, you drink?\nWhy? Can I not? You guys pick locks of other peoples houses, but I cant even drink?\nNade immediately tucked his tail.\nHaha, thats true. Oh, you are off duty today, right?\nThe staff member butted in.\nThen Well have those ready for you soon.\nShirones friends smirked at the employee who couldnt say anything more than that.\nBut soon after, all four of them realized that they had ordered course meals. The images of the price tags floated inside their heads, but Siena didnt seem to care much.\nRight. She is a certified Grade 6 mage.\nA certified Grade 6s income could be placed in the top 10% of the aristocratic society.\nFurthermore, she worked at the Alpheas Magic Academy, one of the top five prestigious academies in the kingdom, so without even accounting for her being an Olifer, she could pretty much live a grandiose life.\nCome to think of it, our teacher, shes really successful.\nOf course, Siena was someone who pursued her dream, not money. However, Shirone, the son of a mountaineer, knew better than anyone how hard it was to live that kind of life.\nDue to the course meal multiplying to four, plates of food kept being placed on their table with no rest.\nCustomers who were sitting at other tables glanced with wide eyes.\nHowever, Shirone and his friends did not care. They were just bent on tasting each others food.\nIt was said that nobles valued keeping up appearances, but such a thing was nonexistent between friends.\nAs their stomachs began to reach their limits, the flying forks and knives returned to their original positions.\nSince they had finished eating, the trio started talking about magic.\nIt was Sienas first time hearing her students everyday conversations, so she listened with interest.\nThe laughter did not leave their table, and the depressing atmosphere was gone. Nades strategy worked.\nHehehe. Teacher, this unworthy student of yours will pour a drink for his respected master.\nHmph. Do you think Ill let you off the hook? Im simply not saying anything since this is a place to eat. Be prepared when we go back.\nSure, sure. Youre absolutely right. Here, take it.\nNades affable personality made the atmosphere even lighter.\nSiena didnt seem to hate it. She took the alcohol she was given.\nShirone asked, worried because it was a strong drink.\nMs. Siena, havent you had enough? I think youre drinking too much.\nThis much? Its fine.\nCertainly, for sure. Shes a certified Grade 6 mage. She wont just lose to some alcohol.\nSiena caught on. She laughed at Nades search for an opening and sneered.\nHow dare you. Trying so desperately. But its okay. Im not so easily intoxicated.\nShe took the strong liquor straight in.\n* * *\nAn hour later.\nHey! Hey, you! You, Im talking to you, Nade!\nYes, maam.\nSiena was leaning against the clear-out table with her arm. Her face was red, and she was flailing her hand in the air.\nWithin an hour, the bottle was emptied, and Sienas eyes were losing their focus.\nShirone and his friends looked at each other, nervous.\nWhat should we do? Our teachers drunk.\n..............Mm, yes\nSienas head dropped while she was mumbling something in an incoherent and small voice.\nNade caught her in a hurry as she was about to fall off from her chair.\nTeacher, are you okay? Lets start heading back.\nYou troublemaker!\nSiena raised her hand to pinch Nades cheek. She pulled it relentlessly. His face was stretched, pulled, and squished, but Nade couldnt push her hand away.\nOUUCH! It hurts!\nIm telling you to listen and be obedient! I want to become a good teacher like Ms. Ethella, you know? So please stop straying into weird things and study, for the love of god!\nOkay, okay! I get it, Teacher! It really hurts!\nAnd Shirone, Yiruki.\nYes, maam.\nShirone and Yiruki straightened their backs and took a more proper stance.\nThe same goes for you two as well. If you decide to slack off simply because you believe in your talent, I wont forgive you. I dont care if you think Im a bad teacher. Im not going to forgive you.\nNobody thinks youre bad. So please, can you please get a grip?\nHoooh. Yes, I know. Why did I buy it and suffer like this? Mm.\nSienas eyes closed halfway, and she buried her face in her arm that was resting on the table.\nNade was taken aback.\nTeacher, snap out of it! Teacher? We havent even paid yet!\nIm gonna sleep.\nNade slowly looked back at his friends with a blank face at the sound of her breathing slowing down. This time, they couldnt do anything about it.\nAs they were struggling to overcome this difficulty, two men watching from the table across approached.\nOh, my. This lady must be very drunk. Let me help. Shall we get a carriage ready?\nHe was a neat-looking young man, and behind him, a handsome man was smiling deftly.\nThe eyes of Shirone and his companions grew cold at the same time.\nBeing wary of their surroundings had become a habit for the trio. From the moment they entered the restaurant, they had seen the two men pointing to Siena and having rude conversations.\nOf course, the three didnt think they would actually approach them.\nThese bastards\nNade really didnt want to cause any more trouble today, so he pressed down his anger and shook Siena.\nTeacher? Teacher, wake up.\nHuh?\nSiena leapt to her feet. She looked around, and soon, her unfixed gaze regained its focus.\nIs it time already? I can still drink some more.",

      "content": "Chapter 60\nThe man cut in quickly.\nAh, you were an educator. Nice to meet you. My name is Silvar Cosine. My father is a deputy director of Creas. With all due respect, I fell in love at first sight. I would be very honored to have a chance to court you.\nShirone, along with his friends, were bewildered.\nThat is the worst kind of self introduction I have ever heard. Whos going to fall for that?\nHowever, it probably was a natural procedure in the aristocratic society.\nSiena didnt respond much. She just rested her forehead on her hand and sighed.\nAlthough she didnt show on the outside, Sienas heart felt like it was burning in hells fire.\nHer heart sank every time she imagined Keiras gaze.\nShe must hate me. I shouldnt have gone there. No, I shouldnt have contacted him from the beginning.\nOf course, the memories she had were those of when they were children, so she didnt feel a sense of betrayal from Armin even when he appeared with Keira.\nHowever, it would be a lie to say that she didnt have any hope. The feeling of what it would be like when they met again.\nThe feeling of her heart racing and the thought of wanting to go back in time never left her.\nBut Is this love? I havent wanted anyone since the incident that day.\nSilvar continued.\nExcuse me, I introduced myself too grandly. Im sorry. I guess I had a strong desire to look good because I met a woman I didnt want to let go. Please, forgive me for my rudeness.\nIts fine. Im tired, so please go away.\nSiena was actually really tired.\nOf course, for a certified Grade 6 mage to forcibility break out from their drunken state wasnt anything difficult, but Siena still needed the effects of the alcohol right now. She wanted it.\nShe wanted to forget everything. If she could, Siena wanted to wash away her memories with even more alcohol.\nMmm.\nWhen Siena, who had entrusted her mind to intoxication, faltered, Silvar hurriedly supported her.\nLeaving a woman alone is not chivalry. I will guide you to the carriage.\nNade glared.\nWhat are you doing right now? Dont you dare touch our teacher without permission.\nThere must be some kind of misunderstandingIm trying to help her. You guys can go your merry ways now. Ill call a carriage.\nDespite Nades dissuasion, when Silvar moved to stand Siena up, Shirone grabbed him by the wrist.\nSilvars face distorted. He decided to deal with the situation the fastest way.\nWho told you you can just grasp an adults wrist like that? You better let go while Im telling you nicely.\nShirone didnt back down.\nShe said shes fine. Please leave. We will take our teacher.\nYou take a persons word for a joke, dont you? I saw earlier that you guys were the ones making her drink that whole bottle. Will you come to your senses after all three of you are expelled from whatever academy you hail from?\nYiruki scoffed.\nYou are the one who needs to come to their senses the most out of everyone here. Since your fathers a deputy director, you should be more careful with keeping up your appearance. If you continue to act like this, who will lose more out of this situation if it gets spread. You or us?\nSilvar hardened his eyes.\nWhat did you just say?\nAh, your title! Im pretty sure there was a formal title for the son of a deputy director.\nYou mannerless bastard!\nSilvar turned his drunkenness into anger and grabbed Yiruki by the collar. However, as a tingling shock spread through his side, his hand lost its strength.\nHe gasped, cradling his wounded side. He stepped back.\nWh-What was that?\nNade was holding electricity\nYoure going too far. Were only holding back because were outside of the academy. If you want, we can also go somewhere where there are no people.\nSilvars companion spoke out.\nHey Those guys Theyre magic academy students.\nMagic academy? Alpheas Magic Academy?\nSilvars expression grew dark.\nThe magic academy itself was different from a normal aristocratic academy. Furthermore, the Alpheas Magic Academy was one of the five most prestigious academies where only the best aristocrats gathered.\nDamn it! For them to be students of that academy. Its an academy run and sanctioned by the nation, so even my father cant pull his strings.\nSeeing the wheels turning inside Silvars head, Yiruki read his thoughts. He rolled his eyes and approached him with a snort.\nSo, youre going to kick us out of the academy?\nAh, no. The thing is\nIm Yiruki Mercodine. I dont care what you do, but come to the academy if you have a problem. You can find me there.\nM-Mercodine\nSilvar snapped out from his drunken state. It didnt matter if Creas was a province or a capital. This was because among the nobles of the kingdom of Thromia, there was no one who did not know of the surname Mercodine.\nThey were the most intelligent and educated family in the kingdom, a first-class aristocratic House. Their place as the head of the Kings Commission, an advisory body to the king, had never once been taken away for hundreds of years.\n* * *\n* * *\nYiruki looked bitter as he saw Silvars flustered state.\nOnes family was everything to aristocrats.\nNevertheless, the reason for threatening Silvar using a method he hated was to protect Siena.\nHe didnt hold a position high enough to pull strings, but he could deal some damage by using the fact that Siena was an instructor.\nThough, there was no way that a mere noble could match her, a past student of the Olifer Academy.\nThe handsome guys companion tugged Silvar by his sleeve.\nLets go, Silvar. Hey, Silvar.\nSilvar wanted to retaliate, but he left the restaurant with his mouth shut.\nEven after they disappeared from their sight, Nade couldnt calm his anger.\nGosh, the atmosphere is ruined. You know what they say, you dont know anything just by looking at the restaurant signs. Lets not come back ever again.\nShirone spoke.\nYeah. Anyway, lets get out of here. Its getting dark. Teacher, are you alright? Lets head back now.\nMm.\nSiena, who was still drunk, stood up with the help of her students.\nThough she was lighty annoyed by the ruined atmosphere, she was already in a terrible mood before then. Seeing how her students stood by her firmly to protect her, she thought that she had made a good choice in becoming an instructor.\nSiena paid for the meal without hesitation and left through the while still unsteady on her feet.\nMoonlight was pouring down from the sky devoid of clouds.\nHaah.\nSiena let out a breath. She felt strangely good.\nIt was probably because of the alcohol, but maybe she took a new leap today? She felt that she would be able to live her life not under the shadow and influence of Armin, but on her own.\nBut it was most likely the alcohol doing the thinking for her.\nAh, I feel good. Today is nice.\nAs if possessed by the moonlight, Siena looked up at the sky and gave a tiny twirl.\nThe jaws of the three leaving the restaurant dropped.\nUnder the moonlight, she was so beautiful. The way her trench coat made a circle like an umbrella enhanced her beauty.\nShirone and the other two stared with interest.\nShe dances when shes drunk. So that's how shes like. How unexpected.\nYo Cant this be a scoop?\nYiruki stroked his chin at Nades words.\nHmm, you mean we should make a trade with this? A card to prevent the dispersion of our research group.\nSiena, who had been in conflict with their Research Group for many years, wouldnt be able to dismiss it with a sneer.\nI think it can be done if we put it together properly. And although its kind of foul, its not like its a huge secret But wont she be embarrassed if she recalls the moment? I want to live the rest of my life, you know.\nShirone was lost in thought when the sight in front of him gave him a near heart attack.\nHey, guys! Look!\nSiena was stumbling around in the same place when her foot got tangled. Her center balance was about to tilt.\nThe three jumped into action at the sight of their teacher about to fall flat on the floor.\nGo! GO! Grab her!\nShirone quickly supported her back while Nade and Yiruki grabbed onto her arms from both sides.\nTeacher, wake up. You have to be sober so that we can go back to the academy.\nMmm. Dizzy.\nShe had emptied a bottle of cognac in an hour and twirled at least a dozen times.\nThis isn't going to work. Hey Shirone, piggyback her\nWhat? Why me?\nShirone complained.\nCause youre the strongest among us.\nHaa\nShirone couldnt deny it.\nAll three were low on energy because they could not sleep and eat the day before because of magic training.\nAt least Shirone was better than his friends because he used to climb trees and mountains when he was young.\nGuess I have no choice. Okay, then put Ms. Siena on my back.\nDont make it so obvious that you hate this. Do you think the opportunity to piggyback our teacher comes everyday? Im rather jealous.\nWhen Shirone looked at Nade, he saw him giving him a big smile that was far from envious.\nTsk. Cant make it any more obvious.\nThe group left the aristocratic district and the number of people they came across decreased noticeably.\nI just noticed, but Ms. Siena is surprisingly small. She feels quite petite on my back. I thought she had a similar height as me.\nThats a psychological factor. Teachers usually look bigger than they actually are.\nReally? But at the same time, shes also surprisingly heavy. Its slowly becoming harder.\nYiruki cackled.\nOf course. She is a human being. Women are all made up of bones, muscle, and flesh, too. You didnt seriously think shed weigh as light as a feather, right?\nAlthough he never thought that, he had somewhat expected her to be light.\nHowever, he had never held a womans hand, let alone carried them on his back, so Shirone was a bit nervous.\nHmph, I know that much. But Im seriously tired. I wont be able to reach the academy at this point.\nWhat about using magic? You know, Air magic.\nShes still our teacher, isnt that a little\nShirone, who couldnt even accomplish this seemingly simple task, complained.\nWhat the heck is this? Theres three men, but the other two cant even carry a single woman. I shouldve just learned swordsmanship. My friend would have been able to carry her on his back.\nThe friend Shirone mentioned was none other than Rian.\nNade and Yiruki didnt know who the friend was, but they looked ashamed of their poor physicality.\nHowever, Siena was really heavier than they thought, and for those who only knew how to read books, they didnt have much muscle mass.\nWhat can we do? The only exercise I do is breathing, but Im confident in using my brain.\nYiruki snapped his finger.\nThen we should use our brain. Swordsmen have Schema. We should learn that right now. Shirone, what do you say?\nHow does that make any sense? How will we do that all of a sudden?\nBut we can try. In my case, I succeeded in the Spirit Zone in one try. You guys didnt?\nNade spoke.\nMe too. After I got the hang of it, I got it to work right away. What about you, Shirone?\nShirone, who was still struggling with Siena, raised his head.\nHuh? Oh, yeah, I succeeded in a single try, too. Actually, I didnt even know it was the Spirit Zone at the time.\nIt sounded absurd to the other two.\nYou entered the Spirit Zone without knowing it was the Spirit Zone?\nYiruki cackled.\nKekeke. Thats so like you. Anyhow, nothing is impossible. Isnt the basic principle the same for both anyway? Schema.\nAfter a minute of thought, Yirukis word made sense. It would be their loss to assume without even trying.\nThen shall we? Should we seriously try it? In fact, my arms are stiff and are ready to fall off.",

      "content": "Chapter 61\nNade encouraged Shirone.\nTry it, try it. From what I heard, its like projecting a body image while in a state of having no self. After that\nI know what it is. Give me a minute. Let me concentrate.\nShirone closed his eyes and felt the sensation of his body while his friends kept their mouths shut.\nNo self right before entering the Spirit Zone Then awaken the entire bodys senses with insight while projecting the body image!\nEeuk Eeeeuukk! Oh no Its getting harder!\nYiruki tried to hold back his laughter and said.\nYou simpleton, you think itll actually work? The Spirit Zone and Schema are polar opposites.\nPUHAHAHAHAHA!\nNade couldnt hold back his laughter.\nShirone looked back with lasers coming out from his eyes.\nYou-! Fine, Im not doing this! Switch!\nEventually, the three decided to take turns carrying Siena on their back.\nHowever, Nade didnt last half the distance of Shirones while Yiruki couldnt even take over ten steps.\nVery soon, it was back to Shirones turn. He carried Siena on his back with trembling arms and gave them a ridiculous look.\nHey, dont we look so pathetic right now?\nShirone. Its rude to say something that you should just store inside your brain. No need to lower our self-esteem more than you need to.\nAt the end of Nades words, the three all shut up.\nBy the time they neared the academy, Shirone suddenly spoke.\nHey, why dont we Just stop doing that.\nWhat do you mean by that? What are you talking about?\nYou know, the deal with Ms. Siena about what happened today.\nHmm\nTo be honest, Nade also had a guilty conscience. However, it wasnt like they could just give up. Their research group was at stake.\nBut theres no other particular way. Did you come up with a plan to protect the research group?\nNo, but this is a whole different thing. Today must have been a very sad day for Ms. Siena. I dont know the details, but I feel that it is.\nAfter seeing things from their teachers point-of-view, their expressions became solemn.\nSaying your farewells to a precious loved one who sacrificed their eyes for you wouldnt just end with a bottle of alcohol.\nYeah, I know. I really do. But for me, the research group is important. I dont know about you guys, but I inherited this position directly from the former president. The fact that the research group is getting disbanded because of me\nYiruki also agreed.\nI understand your position. The decision is yours. We are only members.\nNade sighed.\nI wouldnt be like this if it were anything else. Quite frankly, Ms. Siena is a hard type to deal with. She doesnt have any weaknesses. She has a tough personality, shes meticulous with student management. Shes even telling Shirone to leave since shes worried about Overflow. We have to play a little dirty to win against someone so guarded on all sides.\nThese little rascals\nSiena, who was listening while hanging on Shirones back, choked up.\nWhen she was drunk and spinning in circles, she had been out of it, but now she was almost fully herself.\nShirone spoke.\nWhy our teacher chose the path she did, why shes so obsessed with Overflow Shes like that because she doesnt want us to walk the same path she did.\nTsk! I know at least that much. Shes actually one of the people I really respect.\nNade stopped talking there, but he couldnt turn blind eye to Shirone and Yirukis stares.\nOkay! Fine! Whatever! Well say today is invalid! Lets cover up everything that happened to Teacher. I guess well just have to think more about our research group tomorrow, ueah?\nYiruki nodded.\nI have no complaints. Were the villains, anyway. In fact, I owe Ms. Siena in many ways, and even though she often speaks coldly, she always sides with the students at crucial moments.\nShirone then spoke.\nThen its decided. No matter what difficulties we face in the future, never reveal what happened today. It has nothing to do with our research group.\nAlright!\nThey were rather at ease when the final decision was made. Shirone and his friends continued their way with light steps.\nNo one knew that Siena was awake.\nThey saw the front gate of the magic academy.\nA half-dead Shirone found a guard standing with a torch and stopped walking. It has not past midnight yet so the night shift still hasn't gone home.\nWhat should we do? If we go in like this, a strange rumor might spread by tomorrow. Not to mention, we left without permission.\nThen we have no choice. From here on, lets use magic. Ill float Ms. Siena, so hold her up for a second.\nOkay, let me first put her down, Yiruki, help.\nThe moment Shirone touched the ground with his knees, the weight on his back disappeared.\nWhen he looked back in surprise, Shirone saw Siena standing straight. Even her eyes were clear.\nT-Teacher?\n* * *\n* * *\nShirone collapsed onto the ground.\nIf she could walk, why trouble him and make him suffer up till this point?\nNade asked.\nAre you really okay?\nOf course. Did you think Id get drunk with that tiny amount?\nBut why?\nI treated you all to an expensive meal. You didnt actually think the day would end with me buying you boys course meals and we all happily return, right?\nTo be honest, it was only a while ago that she became sober.\nNo matter how amazing a mage was, they couldnt evaporate the alcohol that had already made its way into the blood.\nAnyway, follow me. If you want to enter quietly, that is.\nAs Siena walked toward the front gate, Shirones party followed as if possessed by ghost.\nThe guard recognized her face and greeted her with wide yet sleepy eyes.\nOh! Why hello, Ms. Siena.\nYes, thank you for your hard work.\nDid you Go out with these students?\nYes I did. I brought them out for a field trip.\nAh, I see. Thank you for your effort. I hope you have a good night.\nAccording to the academys regulations, students were prohibited from entering the academy late at night unless they were with an instructor. Then there was nothing wrong with that.\nNevertheless, Shirones group rushed past the academy gate. They were nervous that the guard would suddenly call them from behind and stop them.\nWhen they got to Central Park with no complications, Siena turned around to glare at the three.\nYou guys.\nHeek!\nShirone felt it on his skin.\nI will let todays matter go.\n...Pardon?\nIm saying that Ill keep it a secret between us. I wont report it to the academy and I wont tell anybody about it. Ill also give you one month to come up with something. Thats the best deal I can give you guys.\n...\nCome up with a way to convince the academy within a month. Whether you hold a presentation or somehow bring in a ghost, it is up to you. If you are really proud of your research group, fight. Even if you have to go against the academy in order to prove it. Thats the way I teach and love my students.\nHer students got emotional.\nThey couldnt believe Siena was telling them this.\nWhat a relief.\nNade clenched his fist.\nOkay! Look forward to it. Our research group will definitely prove its worth. Youll be so surprised youll fall off your chair!\nYiruki assisted.\nIts been a while since Ive properly stretched my brain.\nSiena smiled bitterly as she watched her students regain their confidence.\nWhile it was true that anxiety made its way into her heart when she saw their enthusiasm skyrocket, she was also looking forward to seeing what kind of great incident they would cause this time.\nHohoho. Do your best, my students.\n* * *\nShirone visited the research group later than usual. He found Yiruki and Nade lying on the sofa.\nHey.\nDid you sleep well last night?\nDont know. Did I even sleep? What about you guys?\nThe same. What are we going to do now? Even though we had a meeting all night yesterday, we couldnt come up with any good ideas.\nShirone sat on an empty sofa and spoke.\nWe have to make a decision today. Lets try to find a solution.\nAnd how are we going to do that? Supernatural psychic science is not a phenomenon we can see. Humans dont believe what they cant see.\nTired of even talking, they all stared blankly at the wall.\nTheir minds felt as white as the wall.\nNot long after, Shirones eyes returned to focus.\nHow about we change our train of thought?\nNade and Yiruki sat up.\nThey didnt know what Shirone would say, but he was taking a different route from before.\nHow?\nOur dilemma is this: There is no way to show what is invisible.\nYeah, thats the gist.\nWhat I am saying is, theres no need for us to try and show something that is invisible. Thats why were stuck. We are thinking about the next thing without solving this problem first. In essence, I think we should look for a method in which we dont have to show anything at all.\nYiruki stroked his chin.\nSo youre saying that we dont have to verify something that cant be verified.\nYes. The reason why I joined this research group isnt because you guys proved something to me. Wouldnt it be the same for the others?\nThe corner of Nades lips tugged up.\nYes, we had Shirones case. Verification was not necessary from the beginning. Rather, on the contrary\nWe have to make them believe what they cant see, right? Like Shirone.\nSomething struck Nades mind.\nFeeling a plausible idea coming on, Nade hugged Shirone.\nShirone, come here! You saved our research group! You can take my first kiss!\nGross! Go away!\nWhile the two were wrestling, Yiruki was deep in thought.\nThe real hard part had just begun.\nThen what should we do? Our direction is set, but we still have to present something. We cant exactly tell the professors to imagine.\nNade went back to his seat. Shirone also patted down his disheveled hair.\nLets think about what were going to show our audience.\nThe three students put their heads together and discussed.\nOnce the strand was formed, ideas and endless thoughts came to mind.\nThe main point was to present something that would make people believe in the invisible.\nShould we do something auditory? Its easy to design.\nIts efficient, but not effective. We have to think about the academys acknowledgment.\nThen its definitely visual. If possible, auditory as well. We just pour everything we can and present it.\nVisual and auditory. Then what should we visualize? Should we focus on presenting things as supernatural occurences or psychic occurences?\nIts hard to empathize with the supernatural. It doesnt reach a personal level. I think psychic would be better.\nNade raised his hand.\nI vote for psychic, too. There are countless psychic phenomena. Which one do we go for?\nShirone sopoke.\nI think ghosts are good. Since its a highly individualized concept, I think it would be easy to propagate.\nMmm But isnt ghost-related stuff considered childish?\nNade was worried, but Yiruki voted for Shirones opinion.\nThat just means if we succeed in presenting it, wed have accomplished something great.\nShirone said.\nIts about introducing supernatural and psychic sciences to aspiring mages. However, if we use this factor well, I think it could be a point for us.\nNade raised his head.\nDo you have something in mind?\nLets set up a thinking trap. For example",

      "content": "Chapter 62\nShirone explained by drawing on a piece of paper.\nWhen no replies returned after hearing what he had to say, Shirone lost his confidence and hurriedly added.\nOther than this method, various traps can be installed as well. For example, if you use keywords\nYiruki shook his head.\nNo, itll be fine. Its not only good, but those are necessary elements.\nNade agreed.\nYeah. This is quite subtle. Youre using the presentation as a tool.\nAs the structure was established, the three began to plan detailed operations.\nThe only problem is this. How do we present a ghost?\nThe technical part was up to Nade.\nHe rose from the sofa and cast Lightning Shadow which created another Nade made up of electricity.\nWe can make a ghost shape like this. But no one will be deceived by an unmoving ghost. That is the part Im worried about.\nYiruki nodded.\nWe can think from there. How can we make the afterimage move?\nThis is what came to mind right now. Quickly linking together Lightning Shadow\nAs Nade moved, the afterimage was taken in each frame of Nades movement, giving the impression of walking.\nI see. So youre saying we can use optical illusion to make it look real.\nRight. However, magic has its limits. Moreover, I cant increase the number of individuals at my level.\nShirone asked.\nWhat if we were to use a mechanical device?\nEasier said than done. Even if we do make a device, there is a mountain pile of stuff to consider. The biggest problem is, what if people arent fooled even after we implemented the movements? If we really want to make them believe, we need it to be responsive to external stimuli.\nYiruki racked his brain for a while and said.\nHow about Predicting peoples reactions ahead of time?\nPredicting their reaction?\nWe will adopt the Complex System Theory. We analyze the public's behavioral patterns and program them. Its a way to create the illusion that were actually getting feedback. Problem is thats its a huge amount of information. We need a medium and control system to deliver the information.\nHmm. Transmitting information. There certainly are limits to my electric ability. Then Ah!\nNade turned to Shirone.\nPhoton Output! We have Shirones photon output!\nAha! With photon output\nShirone thought there was a possibility. It was a magic he learned to take the Targeting exam, but in the magic society, the research on transmitting information through photon output was in full swing.\nNow its sorted then. Nade will create a hologram device. I will make the program that will go into the device, and it will be Shirones photon output that will send my program to the device. It probably requires a huge output, can you do it?\nI have to. Its a one in a million opportunity.\nThey finally saw a ray of light in the darkness. Nade was thrilled just to have hope for something he thought was impossible.\nWe can do it. We can protect our research group. Of course, assuming there will be no accidents.\nThe academy will be in a fuss if we succeed, right?\nMore than that, actually. I think the academy will be in an uproar. Ill bet my money on that. Besides, I think itll be so much fun. Kekeke. Im already looking forward to the teachers reactions.\nYiruki and Nade turned to look at each other and gave an evil smirk. With the existence of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group on the line, an unprecedented event in the history of the magic academy was occur.\n* * *\nShirone spent his time increasing the effectiveness of his photon output. The key was to increase the strength of the output while increasing the retention time. Weightless photons could not inflict any physical force, meaning it could not be used as attack magic. However, this time around, that characteristic turned out to be an advantage. This was because Shirone could go and train in any storage room in Estas.\nShirone put out his two hands. He concentrated and cast Photon Output.\nAs the beam of light started to create a circle on the wall, Shirone began to push himself.\nIf he couldnt hold out like this for 10 minutes, then there was no point in attempting to increase the output.\nAlthough the level of difficulty exceeded that of Class 5, it was the same for Nades hologram device and Yirukis Complex System Equation.\nI have to succeed. I\nShirone clenched his teeth and held out.\nAfter three minutes, he began to lose consciousness.\nHe was able to withstand a minute while casting a single photon output during the Speed Gun exam, so his current progress showed remarkable growth compared to then.\nHeuk! Heuk!\nThe result of 10 days of training was a record of 3 minutes and 20 seconds.\nShirone had to increase it to 10 minutes within the next 20 days.\nAfter measuring the new record, he always had to rest for 20 minutes because he was carrying out a training that could be life threatening if recovery was neglected.\nShirone was taking a break when he heard a noise from the warehouse beyond the wall. Nade seemed to have started welding.\nWhen Shirone entered the store room next door to figure out the situation, he saw Nade buried in mechanical parts.\nYo, Shirone. Hows the output time?\nSo-so. I increased it by about 20 seconds. What about you?\nAs you can see, Im still working on the engine.\nCan you make it in time?\nIts not like I have a choice. Dont worry. Prototyping usually takes time since its hard to correct errors once I start the production process. Thats why I have to be meticulous right now.\nAlright. By the way, what about the thing Yiruki talked about?\nOh, that? I got it yesterday. This one.\nNade threw a hose-like string at Shirones feet.\nThe outer material was made of rubber, and a transparent, membrane-like quartz filled the inside.\nIt was an item that Yiruki specially requested from his father, the head of the Kings Commission.\nOptical fiber.\nAccording to Yiruki, 300 holographic devices had to be set up in the academy.\nHowever, it was impossible for Shirone to cast photon output to all the devices by himself.\nIn the beginning, Nades first solution was to use a mirror.\n* * *\n* * *\nIt was a method of transmitting the photon output to the mechanical device using the lights property of total reflection.\nBut the problem was that there were too many places where the light had to be bent. So Nade thought what if there were a lot more mirrors? What if they attached mirrors to a small hose so light could bend?\nWhen Nade proudly proposed his idea, his eyes brimmed with excitement. This was because if this idea worked, they could commercialize it. They could sit high up on a pile of money.\nHowever, Yiruki broke the news to them.\nYiruki received a letter from his father every month. It contained several pieces of information regarding the mage society. A letter from a few months ago wrote that the same kind of item Nade had thought of had already been introduced.\nIt was named the Optical fiber.\nNades disappointment could not be put into words because even the Ivory Tower, which was at the cutting edge of magic, had only recently started to make developments in the field.\nHowever, after receiving and analyzing the optical fiber, his disappointment disappeared. At his current level, he could never make such an item that required sophisticated engineering techniques.\nBut his idea was the same as the Ivory Towers. Nade is amazing, too.\nShirone scrutinized the optical fiber. He couldnt tell what was so great about it with his bare eyes alone.\nHe really managed to acquire it.\nNade, who finished welding, stood up with red eyes.\nPerformance is not guaranteed. Lets start with a demonstration. Theres something I converted into a tester.\nNade handed over the optical fiber to Shirone, which was equipped with transparent beads.\nWhat should I do with this?\nKeep holding and testing the photon output. Ill calculate the efficiency, so try it right now. But you really have to give it your all because measuring the maximum is important.\nShirone checked the time and found out that his break was over, so he hurriedly grabbed the crystal ball.\nWhen he cast Photon Output, a light source formed on top of his hand, and the beads shone pale.\nThat light traveled through the optical fiber to the device Nade created which caused the needle in the instrument panel to shake.\nNade, who was watching the numbers in the panel until Shirones output limit of three minutes passed, sighed and said in a sullen voice.\nYiruki was right. This is still in its very early development. Well, I guess I shouldnt complain and be ungrateful. We should still be thankful for this alone.\nIs it that bad?\nIt is only 18% efficient. That means 82% of the amount of light you sent was lost.\n82%...\nShirone was so very disappointed as soon as he heard the percentage.\nIt was hard enough for him to hold out 10 minutes, so the device having only 18% efficiency meant that he had to increase his output by 5 times to reach the desired value.\nCan you do it, Shirone? If you cant raise it, we will not succeed. Machines cannot compensate for a high output energy of magic.\nShirone's head bobbed.\nIll try. Im sure Ill be able to after practice.\nYou can really do it?\nYes. Dont worry. Ill do my best. Then Ill leave to practice some more.\nNade face scrunched up, and his eyes welled up in tears.\nReally? Youre really going to it? No taking back.\nYes, I said I will!\nShirone spoke with confidence, but only his eyes were smiling.\n* * *\nHaah! Haah!\nShirone was on the ground, his body spread out. He was gasping for air.\nTraining Photon Output for over half a day was affecting his mind as well as his physical body.\nThe time he just achieved was 3 minutes and 20 seconds.\nNothing changed much compared to the record measured in the morning.\nHowever, he was now able to reach 3 minutes and 20 seconds despite his drainged mental strength, so he could still say there was some improvement.\nConsidering he fell to 2 minutes and 34 seconds an hour ago, he did pretty well for the last-minute effort.\nEven so, it's far from enough. How can I achieve 10 minutes?\nFor all he knew, it might have been impossible.\nPhoton Output consumed mental power much faster than single-shot active magic, if he continuously cast and maintained it. Ten minutes in that state was only possible in the professional world.\nHooh, I dont know. Ill recover first and try again tomorrow.\nNade entered the store room.\nShirone, are you done?\nYeah. I cant do it anymore today, even if I die. I need to rest first.\nIm dying of exhaustion after watching spark after spark for hours. Its past midnight. Lets head back to Yiruki.\nHas it already been that long?\nAfter some short calculation, Shirone realized he had been practicing photon output for more than seven hours. It was a life-threatening amount of training.\nIf the academy found out about it, they would definitely ban him from training.\nUrgh.\nShirone groaned as he lifted himself up from the ground with much difficulty.\nShirone wasnt the only one who looked like an undead creature of the night. Nades eyes were sunken, and his face was blotchy red from the exposure to light for a long time.\nWhen they returned to the research group, Yiruki was playing with a pen while viewing the academy from a birds-eye view.\nHe was doing this to organize the behavioral patterns into an equation while considering the variables that could occur on the day of the operation.\nNade understood.\nLike Shirone and Nade, Yiruki also seemed to have never moved from his seat ever since he sat on it.\nWhat do you think, Yiruki? Hows the math going?\nYiruki didnt even look up from his notebook.\nI can manage to make it on time, so lay down your worries.\nNades heart ached as his greed seemed to only harm his friends bodies.\nIn the end, the existence of the research group was one of the things the president had to be responsible for.\nYiruki, you dont have to overdo it. In fact, calculating all the behavioral patterns of all students\nI can do it. I said I can do it. Dont talk to me. Im busy right now.\nWith that, Yiruki shut his mouth.\nHe was writing formulas in his notebook at an alarming rate.",

      "content": "Chapter 63\nYiruki\nObsession and joy close to madness.\nShirone felt chills.\nEveryone had forgotten about sleeping for several days. They were all immersed in their work.\nWhen calculated, their average time spent asleep daily seemed to be only about an hour and 40 minutes.\nEven on days Shirone would study real hard, the amount of workload did not compare.\nStrangely, however, he did not feel as tired as before. It was as if his pain had been numbed.\nNormally, they forget work and act all lazy, but when they actually decide to set their mind on something, they get really hung up on it almost to the point that its scary.\nNade, are you tired right now?\nNope, not at all. Actually, am I? I dont know. Im still up, so I guess not.\nMe too. Yiruki is working too, so lets make a script first. We have to decide what to write on the poster as well. It will take time to make and design these tiny things.\nOh, should we? Then lets put up the poster first tomorrow.\nWould that be okay though? We are not even at the stage of predicting the workload yet.\nWell have to take the risk. Its better to announce things as soon as possible. I dont want to make it obvious that were trying to hurry things up. Since were fighting a psychological war, shouldnt we take this into account?\nYoure right. Then Ill make whatever we have to write on the poster, you think about the design.\nThe two laid paper on the table and started making their poster.\nIt was late at night, but their minds were still clear.\n* * *\nThe next day.\nTowards the end of lunch time, a poster for a presentation of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group was posted on the notice board.\nMost of the students were puzzled.\nEven the name of the research group was unfamiliar to them because the group had not engaged in official activities.\nIn particular, the poster was so absurd it made them laugh.\nIn the poster was a picture of the magic academy that was altered so that it looked dark and gloomy. It looked like a circus poster.\nSupernatural Psychic Science Research Groups Surprise Presentation!\nShocking revelation! Those who wish to know of the secrets of the soul, gather at the 7th Lecture Hall.\nPsychic Science? What is that? Are they talking about stuff like ghosts?\nI guess they really have nothing to do. Who the heck are these stupid kids in this research group?\nA girl pointed to the bottom of the poster.\nHey guys, look at this.\nThe students who confirmed the list of members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group were shocked to the core.\nIts our upperclassman, Shirone! How did this happen?! Is there someone with the same name in the academy?!\nAs if. Its really our upperclassman Shirone. Theres also our other upperclassmen Yiruki and Nade.\nBut thats it? Just three? Are they doing this for the performance evaluation? Even so, this is too much.\nWhile one half of the students were still in a doubt, the other half simply found it funny.\nWhen is the presentation? Should we give it a go?\nBecause its Senior Shirone, Im curious.. Are they really going to reveal the secrets of the soul?\nKekeke! Well know when we get there. Anyway, it sounds fun.\nEither way, the students didnt take it seriously. To them, it was like going to a theatrical performance rather than an academic performance.\nOn the other hand, those working in the dark, similar to the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group, viewed the situation seriously.\nThey gathered away from the public eyes and whispered.\n- How did this happen? A presentation from the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group?\n- According to our spy, it seems that Ms. Siena and they were at odds with each other. They must be going toe-to-toe with each other, but can they really do anything? Theyre not the previous Super Psychic Group that we knew of. The glory days are over.\n- We cant be certain. Yiruki is a savant and Nades skills shouldnt be taken lightly, either. Shirone, the new member, was also the reason Black Magician disbanded. I dont think its gonna end this easily.\n- Kekeke, Black Magician. They were just low-class kids. Anyway, lets wait and see. If the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group disappears, there will be an all-out war in regards to the second owner of Estas.\n- It wont be easy. The Female Body Research Group has been eyeing it for a long time. The economic research group Golden Wheel is also preparing to open the black market. Must be a good opportunity to make a killing.\n- Hmph, our Doll Collection Research Group isnt so bad, either. I swear on my lovely Poco. Estas upper level is ours.\nThe upper level of Estas.\nTheir eyes gleamed as they recalled the secret place that was only talked about in legends.\nThose who knew the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group and those who did not know of it all had different stories, but everyone expected the presentation to be an absolute success.\nAs for the party that was actually preparing for the presentation, they had no time to pay attention to miscellaneous things.\nOnly one thought kept bothering them.\nWhy was there only 24 hours in a day?\nIf each day was about 200 hours long, or at least 48 hours long, they could achieve better results.\nOf course, they werent stupid enough to waste time on such delusions, so they split the load so they could work as effectively as possible.\nNade, who succeeded in developing the prototype of the hologram device, held a demonstration in front of Shirone and Yiruki.\nIt was a hemispherical lens made of glass. Output terminals extended in all directions and were connected to an auxiliary device.\nWhile Yiruki was busy setting up the program, Shirone fiddled with the crystal marble on the optical fiber.\nNade spoke.\nEverythings set. Shirone, lets start.\nWill it be okay? I havent perfected my Photon Output yet.\nIts the same for us. We need to test it first so that we can find out what we need to improve.\nOkay.\nWith a crystal ball in each hand, Shirone gave everything he had.\nElectricity was being generated inside the hemispherical lens, and a translucent human figure made its appearance.\n* * *\n* * *\nAlthough the figure was not completely human-looking due to the limits of the technology and electricity, Nade thought this inaccurate depiction was actually better. This was because students imagination of ghosts would be something like this.\nSo this is a hologram.\nThe ghost was a soldier in ancient armor. Its face was dirty, and its bones could be seen in places the armor did not cover.\nFirst of all, the frame looks okay. Yiruki, its your turn.\nYiruki activated the controller.\nThere were only eight buttons, but since combination was possible, various patterns could be expressed. Each time a button was pressed, the soldiers hologram performed various actions.\nYiruki watched the soldier walk about the room with a satisfied expression.\nFirst, there is no problem with the program. We can continue like this. All thats left is Shirone. Are you really going to be okay? On the day of the presentation, the number of devices will increase dramatically.\nShirone, who tried it himself, was also worried.\nPower generation was covered with Nades electricity, but the problem was transmitting information. Operating even a single hologram device tired Shirone out.\nIll do my best. Still, my retention time is increasing, so there is still hope. Now, Nade will be mass producing, right? And are you done, Yiruki?\nNo, I also have a lot of things to improve on. If I take psychological changes into consideration, it would take a year to analyze. Still Considering our simpler goal, I should be able to make it on time.\nNade nodded his head.\nOkay, great. Sadly, we have no time for rehearsals. So with the time we have left, lets continue focusing on our respective duties.\nIn order to reinforce his mind, Shirone thought of many possible solutions. But eventually, Shirone came to a definitive conclusion.\nPush my mind to the limit.\nPhysical training focused on damaging pre-existing muscle fibers in order to make them stronger. If someone were to take only a few hours of rest like Shirone, their body would break within a month.\nHowever, the mind differed from the body. It had the elasticity to withstand high stress.\nFor Shirone, whose mental strength was extremely strong already, there was no greater way than this.\nI can do it.\nPushing his mind to the brink of destruction. It was the only solution to reach their impossible goal.\nMore! I have to beat my mind more!\nThe size of the light source reflected on the wall was gradually getting bigger.\n* * *\nThe day before the presentation.\nThe storeroom where Shirone was training was bathed in blinding light from photon output.\nShirone had his eyes tightly closed. Blood was dripping from Shirones lips.\nHe tried to hold out, but his body swayed left and right. His two legs wobbled, struggling to hold up the weight.\nIf he kept on going like this, he could go crazy.\nEUK AARGHHHH\nShirone poured out the tiny amount of mental energy he had left.\nThe next moment, the flash disappeared.\nTHUD!\nHEUK! HEUK!\nShirone was gasping for air, but he still had to check his record. Shirone crawled on his knees to press the button on the watch.\n10 minutes and 32 seconds.\nHaaah\nHe successfully maintained Photon Output for more than 10 minutes.\nHis Spirit Zone had rapidly grown in strength, and the power behind his specialty magic also exceeded the level of Class 5.\nThe iron door opened, and Nade, who Shirone had not seen for days, came in.\nConsidering he had to walk around the academy in an invisibility cloak, his complexion was much worse than before.\nIts midnight, Shirone. Lets do a rehearsal.\nNade knew how high Shirone set his goal, so he purposely did not ask for results.\nThen Shirone, who was breathing hard, threw the watch at him.\nNades eyes widened after seeing the recorded time.\nYou Did you really make it?\nShirone held a thumbs up and gave a tired smile.\nGoal achieved. Lets give them a show to remember.\n* * *\n7th Lecture Hall, Alpheas Magic Academy.\nThe presentation was at 5 PM, but many students were already gathered in front of the lecture hall.\nAs rumors spread and more continued to be produced, the presentation caught many peoples attention.\nSharelle admired the line.\nWow, there are a lot of people. Its also my first time hearing of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group, but as expected, celebrities are different.\nSharelle was promoted to the Advanced class after the Speed gun, so she didnt have the chance to hear about the research group.\nAmy found it unexpected, too.\nIt was amazing that a research group with only three members from Class 5 could attract so many people.\nThey did create a lot of ruckus. Anyways, it seems like their performance is a success.\nI didnt think Shirone and Yiruki would become friends. They were at each other's throat, yet now they cant even live without each other.\nWhile the two stood in line, students from the Intermediate classes murmured amongst themselves.\nStudents from the Advanced classes had come to visit.\nJust looking at the Class 3 badge on their collar alone was awe-inspiring.\nWow, its Senior Amy. Even the Advanced class is going to attend this lame presentation?\nYou idiot, she is Senior Shirones girlfriend. And Senior Sharelle always hangs with Senior Amy. Theyve been like that even since their time in the Intermediate Classes.\nWell yeah, but What about the seniors over there?\nThe Students eyes gathered toward the place someone pointed to.\nAmy and Sharelle also looked back and was surprised.\nOh my? Amy, look there. Kaden is here.\nKaden from Class 2 had his hands inside his pocket.\nAround him were a number of talented people from Class 2 who were well known. amongst them were Richard of Alchemy, Electric Monster Lycon, Hershey of Sonar, and so on.",

      "content": "Chapter 64\nHowever, even Class 2 upperclassmen were only supporting roles compared to the man who just joined the line.\nA beautiful man dressed up in ready-made clothes with hair neatly pulled back stood there, smiling.\nHe was Fermi Ardino of Class 1.\nOnce more people noticed he was there, the sound of talking diminished.\nSharelle also whispered with a serious look.\nIts understandable that we are here, but isnt it strange that people from Class 2, not to mention Fermi, are attending?\nTheyre not here because of Shirone. What do you think the upperclassmen who just arrived have in common?\nHmm, I dont know, hard to get close to?\nExactly. Those guys Theyre probably members of groups that work in the shadows. Similar to Black Magician. Though they are on a whole nother level compared to them.\nAh, thats right. I heard the research group that Shirone joined is quite notorious. However, I really didnt expect Fermi to come. I dont know about the others, but I know hes really popular. Hes even kind.\nI find that even worse. I feel like hes always up to something. Anyways, lets just ignore them. Theres no such thing as upperclassmen or lowerclassmen in the Advanced class.\nThe 30 students in the Advanced Class were all equal competitors.\nEach year, 10 Advanced Class students would graduate, and classes were organized according to exam scores. Therefore, the current classmates were those who did not make the top 10 in last years graduation exam.\nThe reason why they couldnt just be regarded as failed-to-pass students was because they were at the top of the pyramid. The higher one went up the pyramid, the smaller the difference in skill. If you were a Class 1 student, there was little to no difference in terms of skill to categorize who was more superior or inferior.\nIn addition to basic skills, there were numerous variables such as their condition on that particular day, the existence or nonexistence of strategy, compatibility, concentration, choice, etc. That was what determined who got to graduate.\nThe students were absolutely shocked that the Rank 1 of the magic academy had come to watch a Class 5 presentation.\nAs word of Fermis appearance started to spread, by the time the presentation was about to start, there were more students than there were seats.\nFinally, the door to the lecture hall opened and the students rushed in.\nThe first row was for the instructors, while the students filled up the seats in the order they came in.\nAmy had arrived early, so she got to sit close to the stage next to Sharelle.\nWhat in the world are they going to show us for it to be this big of a deal.\nNo matter how hard she thought about it, it was strange for it to cause this ruckus.\nNot only were there outstanding talents from the Advanced class, but also the number one\nThis isnt a simple presentation.\nIn the midst of the tense atmosphere, Amy waited for Shirone to come out.\nThe lights in the hall went out.\nA single spotlight descended into the dark room\nThe spotlight moved across the stage holding everyones attention. It captured the boy standing in the center, then returned.\nGood evening, everyone. Thank you for coming to watch the presentation presented by the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group. I am Nade, the president of the research group. Today, we would like to demonstrate the subject of the soul. Lets begin the presentation.\nThe spotlight went out and the sound of applause died down.\nThe stage brightened like the beginning of dawn, and the scenery of a gloomy mountain began to show itself against the curtain behind the stage.\nThe children have prepared a lot.\nAlpheas smiled contentedly.\nThere was only one reason why he visited. He was too curious to miss out on this event.\nOn the other hand, Siena was not too impressed.\nIt was a nice strategy to use a hologram device, but if the substance of the presentation itself was poor in quality, everything was in vain.\nNade spoke at the edge of the stage.\n520 years ago at this exact location, before the Alpheas Magic Academy was established, there was a small Hwajeonmin Village. It was a period when people who lost their country to a devastating war of conquest wandered aimlessly. Today, we would like to tell you the story of a woman who came here to this Hwajeonmin Village to escape the war.\nAs the stage brightened, Yiruki, who was dressed up as a soldier, appeared while dragging one of his legs.\nGeeeuurggghh, H-Hungry.\nThe eyes of the students who were listening very seriously a second ago widened. They soon burst into laughter.\nPUHAHA! What is that?!\nWhat does he mean Geeeuurggghh? What kind of play is this?!\nNade continued the narration.\nIt was the same for most of the soldiers who wished to escape the war. However, they were not alive. They were hungry ghosts who wandered the world, possessed by evil spirits. They entered the Hwajeonmin Village after smelling raw flesh.\nAfter the explanation, Nade, who changed his clothes off-stage, appeared as the main male character while Yiruki attracted the audiences attention from the side.\nOh, my dear Ollia! Why is someone from a noble lineage like you suffering in these mountains? If I could, I would sell my soul to restore your glory, but its a pity I cant do that.\nThe vocalization was quite worth listening to, but the students who came here thinking it would be a presentation were really puzzled to find out it was a play.\nMoreover, when Shirone, dressed as a woman from the other side, came out on stage, everyone was stunned.\n* * *\n* * *\nNoah, Noah!\nWAHAHAHAHA!\nAll the students could not hold back their laughter.\nShirone really looked like a woman. He had tied his waist tightly to emphasize his waistline, and it looked like he was stuffing something to accentuate his chest.\nA-Amy.\nSharelle slowly looked at Amy with a complicated mind to find Amy also had an absurd expression.\nNade and Shirone communicated the situation through conversations.\nIt was just a simple story.\nNoah and Ollia, who were both of noble lineage, promised to marry each other when they were kids, but the war left their families in ruin. That was why they eventually came to Hwajeonmin Village to continue their love.\nI missed you Ollia, my love, my everything. I love you with all my heart.\nI love you too, Noah.\nThe eyes of the students, who were watching with half-enthusiastic expressions, shone with curiosity for a moment. This was because the two actors were hugging and staring at each other.\nAnyone could guess what would happen next.\nKiss scene. Its definitely a kiss scene.\nSharelles leg bounced up and down as she made a fuss.\nOh my, theyre gonna do it? Actually?! Oh no!\nThe audience focused this time out of pure curiosity about whether they would really kiss.\nOllia.\nNoah.\nThe tension soared the moment they started to come closer.\nAAAHHHHH!\nSuddenly, Yiruki appeared behind Nade and bit down on his neck, knocking him down.\nKYAAAAAAA!\nThe students jumped when the scream rang out from the sound system.\nThat scared me.\nNobody expected Yiruki to appear. This was because it was impossible to produce this kind of production with only the stage equipment.\nShirone wrote the script aiming for this point. He thought he could surprise the people by using the invisibility cloak. As the tension escalated, the audience gradually moved to sit on the edge of their seats.\nYiruki, who knocked down Nade, pretended to dig into his flesh. Bone-crushing, flesh-chewing sounds were emitted from the sound system.\nNo! Noah! NOAH!\nWhen the flesh-eating ghost disappeared, Ollia held the dead body of Noah in her arms and cried out in anguish.\nThe lights went out, and a womans outcry was heard.\nAAHHHHHHHH!!! I wont forgive you! Ill kill them all! Ill turn you guys into ghosts, too!\nThe voice of the woman echoing in the dark sent shivers down the students spines.\nWhen the sound of the woman cursing ended, the spotlight shone once again on Nade, who came back as the narrator.\nIt was approximately six months ago that we heard No, when we excavated this story. It was thanks to an old diary we found while researching the history of the magic academy.\nNade pulled out a single notebook.\nIt was supposedly a 520-year-old notebook that was buried underground.\nOf course, it was something they made in a hurry a few days ago.\nOur members who study psychic science immediately launched an investigation and we learned a shocking secret. It is the fact that the ghosts of that time still roam this academy.\nDing. Ding. Ding.\nThe sound system started ringing a bell which sounded familiar to the students. It indicated midnight.\nEvery night at 12 a.m., hungry ghosts roam places devoid of light. So we thought, this could be the evidence to prove the existence of souls.\nThe students frowned.\nEven though theyd been attending the academy for several years, they had never seen a suspicious person, let alone a ghost.\nOf course, we know. Youve never seen one before. However, according to the study of Supernatural Psychic Science, souls have properties that can only be seen by those who wish to see them. A special kind of mental frequency has to be met. This is why we decided to hold this presentation. Now that you know the story of souls, your frequency is set right. Now you too will be able to witness ghosts wandering the place believed to be the destination for the soul of the dead.\nNade gave a wink and made a final comment.\nOf course, only if youre lucky. This ends the presentation given by the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\nThere was only silence after Nade left. Instead of applause, there was only a bleak atmosphere.\nWhat? What is he saying?\nThe students were filled with betrayal and despondency.\nThey said it was a presentation to prove the existence of the soul, but all they did was dress up as ghosts.\nAs expected, this was just a joke. I thought they would show something amazing.\nWe are the fools to have expected something. Lets be honest, how could they prove the existence of ghosts? Weve been completely deceived.\nClass 4 joined in.\nThere were lots of talks about Shirone and Yiruki, but in reality, they arent much of anything. Hey, lets leave. I wasted my time here.\nVoices of disappointment could be heard all around the hall.\nThe students were reluctant to even have a break time and instead spent that time studying. So they were extremely regretful to waste their time watching a false presentation.\nMark and Maria came down while other students began leaving the lecture hall.\nIt was to see Amy and Sharelle.\nHello, Seniors!\nYes, its been a while.\nHow did you like the presentation?\nMark seemed to have found it absurd.\nIt was especially more difficult for him to accept todays presentation because he knew of Shirones level of genius.\nBut Amy didnt have anything to say either.\nNo excuses, no pretext to try and justify the situation. What they saw was everything, and this was the end of the presentation.\nSharelle stood up for Shirone.\nIm sure they originally prepared something, but maybe something went awry. Didnt have enough time, or something. Right, Amy?\nIts true this is a whole failure. Anyway, I should have known from the moment I heard that he was hanging out with strange kids. Lets leave.\nSharelle grumbled at Amys cold attitude.\nHow can you be so indifferent to your boyfriend?\nHaha! Thats Senior Amys charm. Shirone is probably the one most upset out of everyone here.\nMark had a point. Sharelle followed behind Amy.\nNow the only ones left were the instructors.\nThey honestly had no clue what to write on the evaluation sheet.\nSiena was especially shocked.\nWhy in the world did they give this kind of presentation\nShe couldnt believe they held such a childish presentation in the presence of the headmaster no less.\nA headache was already pounding her head as she thought of ways to cover up this situation.",

Dont stress over it.\nIll make sure to give them a warning.\nAlpheas raised his hand as if to say it was okay and walked toward the door. And just before leaving through the door, he turned and looked at the empty stage.\nHidden behind his beard, the corner of his lips rose.\nIf things ended with just this, Im sure you wouldnt have even started the whole thing. Am I right, Shirone?\n* * *\nRegardless of the audiences reaction, Shirones group rushed to the research group room.\nGood. We passed step 1 with no incident! The real show starts now.\nThey bought into it, right?\nYeah. I could tell just from their eyes.\nContrary to students expectations, the presentation ended blandly, but that didnt matter to Shirones group.\nThe presentation was only a way for them to convey keywords. What they truly aimed for with the presentation was to plant a seed of small doubt in the audiences mind.\nNade arrived at the lab and started undressing.\nShirone, its up to you from now on. Youre literally the engine of this operation.\nOkay. Let me meditate for a little bit.\nNade and Yirukis results were visible, but in Shirones case, there were many variables that came into play. He had no choice but to simply believe in himself, recalling the past month of training.\nThey had six hours left.\nIn order to reach the best condition, Shirone started the Sequence method.\nOne, two, three\nHis friends left him alone so that they wouldn't bother him.\nAs aspiring mages, they knew what it meant to maintain Photon Output for more than 10 minutes.\nThey still had things left to do.\nYiruki had to set up the hologram control device while Nade had to overhaul the central device that transmitted photon signals.\nAnd with that, midnight approached.\nSitting in the dark laboratory where no one was present was Shirone. He slowly opened his eyes.\nAfter five hours of the Sequence method, his mind was comparable to a well-honed sword.\nThe door opened.\nIts time.\nNade said.\nShirone remained motionless for a long time.\nThen he suddenly stood up and left the lab after Nade like a gladiator heading into the Colosseum.\nThe central device was installed in the path of the sewage system that ran under the park.\nThick optical fibers came up to the ground, where they were again dispersed into hundreds of strands through multi-adapters and spread throughout the academy.\nThere were about 300 holographic devices spread throughout the academy.\nShirone admired Nades tenacity, but he also felt bad for him as he could feel the amount of pressure that must have been on his shoulders.\nHe had achieved his goal, but it was his first time trying it out for real. No one knew if unexpected variables would come into play.\nWith ten minutes left until midnight, Shirone walked in front of the huge central device.\nIt was ten times bigger than the prototype and looked like a monster with several legs.\nShirone grabbed the output terminal that looked like a crystal ball and waited while Yiruki checked the time.\nHe could not be too fast, nor too slow. It was important to start right at midnight.\n5 minutes left. Lets begin.\nShirone took a deep breath.\nHis eyes calmed, and even his face was devoid of any expression.\nNow.\nWith Yirukis signal, Shirones Sequence method sped up at a tremendous rate.\nPhoton Output!\nYiruki and Nades eyes widened as light exploded from both hands.\nThey knew Shirone had achieved his goal, but it was their first time seeing him in action.\nMore! Stronger!\nWhen Shirone reached his highest output, Nade ran to the device and checked the transfer efficiency.\nHis eyes were as wide as saucers.\nT-This\nYiruki asked frustratedly.\nWhy? Whats the percentage?\n17.\nWhat?\nThat was low. Much lower than what they had expected.\nNade didnt know where it went wrong, but he didnt have time to look into it. If they couldnt do it now, it was over.\nShirone had a hunch from the start.\nToo big. The radius is too wide.\n* * *\n* * *\nThe moment he cast Photon Output, it felt like he was pouring water into a bottomless pot.\nThere is no way the calculations were wrong. The only possibility is that theres something wrong with the products stability.\nChecking a products stability required cutting-edge technology, and that was something the current Nade could not create.\nOf course, there was no way the Kings Committee was fooled. It was just that optical fiber was still a material that was being researched and developed. It was not even commercially available yet.\nEeuuuk!\nShirone gave it his all, but the output efficiency stayed stagnant at 17%.\nYiruki shook his head.\nIts a failure.\nEven if he operated the device in this state, the hologram would break and shatter like glass.\nThree minutes later, Nade gave a sad smile.\nAlthough they failed, he was proud of Shirone for reaching an impossible goal with great effort.\nNade blamed the whole situation on his ignorance and incompetence, for he was unable to discern the defects in the optical fiber.\nShirone, thats enough. We did well. So lets stop here.\nShirone did not reply.\nTo be honest, he was overwhelmed with anger and frustration.\nThis was a project the three of them had worked on together. They gave it their all for weeks, so how could all their work up to this point be for nothing? How could it end just like this? Shirone couldnt let that happen. He was not going to admit defeat.\nI want to win. I want to succeed.\nShirone clenched his eyes shut.\nBecause he had yet to pour everything into it.\nThe light that illuminated from his hand began to gradually swell and cover his whole body.\nN-No way.\nNade read Shirones thoughts.\nImmortal Function.\nShirone had ended up crossing into the forbidden realm once again, despite knowing doing so could end with him losing everything.\nShirone! Stop! Dont do it!\nNade and Yiruki both rushed in to stop him, but Shirones mind, which was heading towards Nirvana, was not damaged by moderate physical impact.\nThe light that was growing in size swallowed his body and lit up the sewer.\nThe more the light brightened and grew, the more Shirone faded.\nWorried that Shirone was going to disappear, Nade exclaimed.\nShirone! Please, stop! We cant lose you! We can always give up the research group, so please stop!\nN-Nade\nLets stop! End it right now!\nThe corners of Shirones lips crept up softly.\nIm not running away.\nThen, as Shirone closed his eyes gently, a huge light exploded and filled the inside of the tunnel.\nHis mind spread to infinity, and with that, everything that constituted him began to fade.\nIll continue straight like this.\nThis was also what Armin taught him.\nThe countless fragments of knowledge that he had acquired from the realm of infinity had been transformed into an esoteric monster.\nA monster called mystery.\nIt may have only been a personal image, something his mind constructed, but it still inflicted fear beyond imagination in him.\nThe monster chewed and swallowed Shirone. In the midst of feeling like he was dissolving into pieces, his memories scattered. Life so far was just as meaningless as it was 100 million years ago.\nNo. I have to remember.\nWho he was, and where he lived.\nThe moment he lost his ego, he would never be able to return from the infinite realm.\nHEEUUK!\nShirone held out for dear life.\nIf Shirone had done this back during the Speed Gun exam, he would have already given up.\nJust a little more\nBut the Shirone of today was better. His mind was stronger.\nThe Immortal Function strengthened a person, but it was also a poison that destroyed a person. Shirone was walking on a tightrope. If he made a single mistake, everything that he was would go down the drain.\nShirone opened his eyes when most of his memories evaporated and the will to live disappeared.\nThis is exactly the place!\nThe Spirit Zone that swelled endlessly returned to its original size at a frightening pace. In contrast, the Photon Output was increasing in power dramatically.\nThen Shirone cried out.\nOutput!\nShirone, are you okay? Are you unscathed?\nCheck the output first!\nNade jumped and looked back at the instrument panel.\nOutput efficiency at 22%.\nThe efficiency that wasnt moving an inch earlier was rising.\nIts working! Its going up, Shirone!\nArrgghh!\nShirone, who overcame the mental pain with pure will, injected more powerful light into the crystal ball.\nOutput efficiency at 36%!\nShirones Spirit Zone trembled terribly.\nEven with his excellent durability, the enormous mental power flooding from the infinite realm was almost too much for him to handle.\nAAAHHHHHHHH!\nOutput efficiency at 59%.\nThe cold-hearted Yiruki couldnt hide his excitement.\nShiro! A little more!\nThe shaking of the needle in the instrument seemed to reflect Shirones current mentality.\nIts difficult to stay focused!\nShirone bit his lips and transformed his Spirit Zone into the Defensive Form. As his frame became entangled, a cracking sound could be heard.\nCRACK! CRACK! CRACK!\nThe longer Shirone held out, the stronger the light exponentially became.\nOutput efficiency at 87%.\nEEEUUUUGGHHH!\nHis mind trembled, and his brain shook.\nOnly now did Shirone truly realize just how amazing of a mage Armin was. Incorporating the concept of infinity into one's mind was more overwhelming than entering Nirvana. One could lose their life under the weight of the powerful force.\nARRGHH!\nAs soon as Shirone squeezed out the last bit of will he had in him, the lamp of the core lit up red.\nOutput efficiency at 100%.\nNade shuddered.\nHow absurd\nAll right! Yiruki, start it!\nYiruki, who was watching in fascination, hurriedly pressed the button of the remote control device.\nThe light that climbed up the optical fiber spread to hundreds of strands on the ground, wrapping around the academy like a huge spider.\nDing. Ding. Ding.\nThe sound of the bell that indicated midnight was heard.\n* * *\nMaria was studying at the lodging when she stretched after hearing the bell.\nIts already 12 oclock. Time really flies.\nThen, she remembered the presentation and froze in her stretching position.\nFrequency of souls Midnight.\nShe shook her head.\nGosh, what am I thinking? Even if its Senior Shirone How could a ghost\nThe more she tried to erase her mind from such thoughts, the more she couldnt help but be bothered. She even imagined the ghost from the presentation.\nHaaa What, useless thoughts.\nShirone knew that if they planted the key points into the minds of the spectators, the rest wouldnt be too hard.\nIf the frequency of our soul is set right, we can see ghosts from then on? Then that means from today, Ill be able to\nShe couldnt stop thinking about it, so she headed towards the window to try and forget about it.\nAnd from where she stood, Maria saw someone walking in the air.\nHer heart stopped working for a minute.\nTh-That Thats\nThen her heart started to accelerate.\nWhat was outside of Marias window was an old corpse with half of its face rotten.\nHer chin wobbled when the body missing an eye turned its head and opened its mouth wide as if it was about to scream something out.\nKYYYAAAAAAAAAAAA!\nShe let out a deafening scream, but nobody heard it.\nBecause the same kind of scream was emanating from room to room down the hallway.",

      "content": "Chapter 66\nThe flower vase hit the wall and shattered to pieces.\nAmy, who had thrown the vase, was against the opposite wall.\nWh-What the hell?\nThe moment the midnight bell rang, a real ghost appeared.\nWas this what Nade called the resonance effect?\nAt first, she thought she was hallucinating, but whatever was reflecting on the window was real.\nGuuuhhhhhhh\nHearing the gravelly voice, Amy turned on her heels and slammed open the door.\nNumerous girls were screaming at the top of their lungs, running through the hallway.\nAmy was appalled. Dozens of ghosts were chasing them from behind while their jaws clattered with each step.\nAmy! Save me! Im seeing ghosts! What should I do?!\nSharelle came running with a pale face, and a sense of reality rushed into Amy.\nShe had never believed in ghosts. However, it was the nature of humans to refuse to enter a cemetery alone even if they didnt believe in them.\nUURRGGGHHHH\nAmid the wave of crowds, Amy also began running out of the building.\n* * *\nGrrrrrrr.\nIn a quiet training ground at the entrance of a mountain, a strange noise broke the silence.\nEthella came out from her meditation.\nWhen she stood up and turned around, a hideous, transparent figure was walking towards her.\nThe word ghost quickly entered her mind, but she didnt feel any particular emotion from the ghost. She could tell because she was a truth-seeker fighting against the evils of the world.\nWhen the ghost came to stand right in front of her face, Ethella squinted her eyes and leaned forward to have a better look.\nThen, the ghost stared at her as well and tilted its head.\nIt was a moment of truth to prove how well Yirukis equation predicted the opponent.\nThe ghost threatened again.\nGRRRR!\nGRRRR?\nOut of innocent curiosity, Ethella raised her hand and tried to press the soldiers nose.\nHowever, the result was expected. Her hand penetrated and came out the back of the soldiers head.\n* * *\nHaah! Haah!\nInside the ice domain where even steam froze solid, Siena breathed heavily, covering herself.\nThe moment she opened the bathroom door, what stood in front of her was a white-as-a-sheet face that was looking at her through a window.\nThe first thing that came to her mind was pervert, so Siena flew back a little and froze the steam coming out from the bathroom.\nAfter she created the ice curtain to hide from the assumed pervert, she took a moment to gather her thoughts.\nShe peeked through the long rope-like frozen steam and what she clearly saw was a corpse with a decomposed face.\nWhat in the world?\nOf course, she remembered the frequency of souls she had heard in the presentation.\nWas what Nade said true? No, that cant be.\nHowever, she couldnt deny it with confidence because she couldnt explain what she was seeing.\nGaaaahhhhhh.\nAs soon as the ghost opened its mouth, Siena instinctively froze the window.\nSiena regained her composure when she confirmed that it was still moving behind the frost.\nHow dare you\nShe covered herself with a gown from inside the bathroom and walked to the window to open it.\nAs expected, no harm was done to the soldier, and it continued making uncanny expressions.\nShe went outside to inspect the building. She found a spherical device that was emitting a dim light.\nShe let out a sigh and returned to her room to take off her gown.\nHooh.\nThe remaining water droplets on her body froze with a crackling sound, and ice particles that glistened like diamonds spread all around her.\nBefore she knew it, no water was left on her body.\nThese good-for-nothing kids!\nCold energy escaped Sienas eyes.\n* * *\nAs of midnight, the Alpheas Magic Academy was in a state of terror.\nLights could be seen turning on through the countless windows of the dormitory as students rushed out of their rooms.\nIt was the same kind of situation everywhere else.\nThe program was designed to predict human reactions with its dozens of patterns. Rhe students ran recklessly along the road without even knowing that they had been deceived.\nSave me!!!\nGhost! Ghosts appeared!\nThe mob mentality from the crowd affected the students psychologically.\nBut even then, it would be difficult to predict all human behaviors, so what Yiruki wanted was not a detailed response, but something that would induce the crowd as a whole.\nThe holograms seemed to be chasing people without purpose, but if one observed from a birds-eye point-of-view, it was actually used to rally the crowd into one place.\nEventually, almost all of the 400 students gathered in front of the central building where the lights were turned off.\nStudents trapped between people and buildings realized that there was no place to escape anymore.\nChildren from the lower-leveled classes wailed and cried out for their mothers, while students from Intermediate class prepared to fight.\nHere they come! Do something!\nAAAHHHHH! Come at us! Bring it on, you beasts!\nGRAAAHH!\nEveryones faces turned pale as the army of corpses charged at them with swords.\n* * *\n* * *\nBoth the crying students and those trying to stand guard had no choice but to feel chills rush through their blood.\nEeuuuuk!\nThe students chins wobbled, but then a light spread through the soldiers' bodies. The bodies soared into the sky as hundreds of light rays.\nWh-What?\nPerhaps, they were ascending to the afterlife?\nThe young children were praying when the sound of applause was heard from the central building behind them.\nClap. Clap. Clap.\nAll 400 people stared up at the rooftop at the same time to see Shirone, Yiruki, and Nade standing over them.\nThank you to all those who have attended our presentation.\nWhile the students still had difficulty grasping the situation, the instructors finally arrived.\nAll faculty members in charge of the Beginner classes, Intermediate classes, and Advanced classes were gathered.\nSiena stomped her way through the crowd.\nYou guys! Come down here, right now! What in the world are you doing?! You turned the academy into a mess!\nNade winked and said.\nAh, Ms. Siena. What a beautiful evening we have today, dont you think?\nWhat beautiful evening, huh?! Hurry up and come down! If I personally go up there, I might accidentally kill you, so come down here! Now!\nBut first things first, its still our presentation. Ill put an end to it first and then go.\nPresentation? What kind of presentation occurred in the middle of the night?\nStudents understood what was happening.\nWhat? So all this was their doing? That means it was all fake!\nWe were fooled! Damn it!\nThere were still many who were puzzled, but the students who grasped the situation criticized Shirones group by pointing fingers.\nYou crooks! How dare you Class 5 kids fool us? This is not a presentation!\nThose guys should get zeros on the performance evaluation. You guys are done for! There are no ghosts in the world, yet they dare go scamming us with such things.\nDespite all the cursing and criticisms, Shirones group had a relaxed smile.\nEventually, Nade raised his hand and calmed them down.\nThe Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group has proven to you the existence of ghosts through our presentation. Yet, you guys still dont believe in the existence of the soul.\nOf course not! You created these nonexistent ghosts and thought you could get recognized? You guys are going to fail!\nThats right! This was just a bad prank! Anyone can deceive people this way! Even I\nThe students of Class 4 stopped talking.\nSoon, students from other classes turned to their side and murmured as if they had just realized it too.\nBy the way, how did they do it? Do you know?\nNo, I dont have a clue. They really looked like ghosts. Besides, they fooled the entire academy.\nThis wasnt just a bad prank.\nAnother thing that was surprising was the hundreds of holograms. How they moved all of those around the academy was still a mystery.\nThose bastards, what the hell did they do?\nSiena closed her eyes and frowned as the crowd broke out into confusion.\nTo be honest, she also didnt know the exact way they pulled this through.\nThey could have made the holograms. Sure, they could also program it to move. However, to cover the whole academy, they had to operate each one flawlessly. But to also lure 400 people into one place in such a situation Thats impossible. No, whats more impossible than that is?\nEven if luck was on their side, how did Shirones group transmit the information?\nHohoho, I think we lost this time around.\nWhen the instructors turned around to look, they saw Alpheas, who was looking at the rooftop with a laugh.\nSiena shook her head.\nHeadmaster, this isnt something to be taken lightly. I dont know what those children did, but unauthorized installation of devices in the academy facility\nHo? You mean even you dont know Ms. Siena?\nCurrently, Alpheas was interested not in the fact that an academy rule had been broken, but in the technological prowess of Shirones group.\nAlpheas himself would not have been able to guess that an information communication skill was involved in this strategy if he wasnt also a major in Light magic.\nEven so\nWas it possible at a students level?\nIt was probably a huge gamble for the three as well.\nHe wanted to applaud them for their wonderful success.\nSiena admitted frankly.\nYes. Although its embarrassing to admit, I don't really know how they did it. But just because we dont know the mechanism doesnt mean theyve convinced the instructors.\nHoho, youve mistaken. Thats not what I meant by we lost.\nYes? Then\nAlpheas looked up and saved his breath.\nLets just watch for now. I dont think the presentation is over yet.\nThe students were also burning with curiosity to find out the tricks Shirones group used.\nThe front of the building turned into a large-scale forum, but the more they shared their opinion, the more mysterious it got.\nThe students from Class 4 found this whole situation especially unpleasant.\nNot only were they fooled by tricks created by their lowerclassmen, but they also couldnt even grasp how they did the whole thing. Their pride took a hit.\nHmph! Whatever method they used, it must be something absurd and laughable. The point is your presentation is rubbish! Youre saying you will prove ghosts exist? Dont make me laugh!\nAt someones angry voice, Class 4 students agreed.\nYeah! We cant accept such a method! That wasnt psychic science, it was just a show!\nNade heard that and stepped in.\nDo none of you still believe in the soul?\nOf course not! Soul? That was just a kind of Phantom magic. I'm saying its not real.\nThen I will ask you this. If you really thought so, then why are you here?\nBecause! Huh?\nSilence enveloped the area.\nAmong the hundreds of students, not one could go against what Nade said.\nIf they didnt believe in the existence of souls, why did they run away?\nThe answer was simple. Somewhere deep in their mind, there was a belief in the soul.\nNade continued.\nWhat you are feeling right now is the essence of Supernatural Psychic Science. Humans live their whole lives with questions about the unknown. They are curious. If you simply dont need to know just because it hasnt been verified, then why should intelligence exist? I think this is why the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group should be in Alpheas Magic Academy, the birthplace of intelligence.\nThe students said no words.\nIt wasnt real ghosts that appeared today, but so what?\nThe important thing was that everyone here thought the things they saw were ghosts. Reals ones.\nIf one went about it that way, then that meant someone had to try and uncover the truth.\nThe students approached this presentation seriously for the first time.\nThe reason for learning was to find out what you didnt know yet. In the end, intelligence was an unknown, and psychic and magic were not so different from one another.\nThat marks the end of the presentation of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group. Once again, I would like to thank you for participating until late at night.\nShirones group bowed.\nThe crowd was quiet, and no one spoke.",

All chapters from the old translator up until Ch. 66 have also been uploaded on the website. I've gone through and fixed a lot of things in those 66 chapters as well so that consistency remains. I hope to do at least 5ch/week on this novel. I hope you will all enjoy reading them from this amateur translator. Thank you alll and enjoy reading!\n---\nHowever, moments later, the students began to burst into laughter, feeling an inexplicable sense of exhilaration rising in their hearts.\n\"Hahaha! This is a real masterpiece! Yes, you guys did it!\"\n\"Right! To be honest, I've always been interested in this kind of thing! Please organize more fun presentations in the future!\"\n\"I haven't sweated like this in a long time. You guys won! You're the best!\"\nThe teachers were perplexed by the students' sudden change in attitude, but Shirone had anticipated this. Every rational human being harbors curiosity about the essence of things.\nWhere do we come from and where are we going?\nPerhaps, that is the most important question for humans. And that was exactly why the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group needed to exist.\nAlpheas nodded in satisfaction.\n\"Showing the unseen without making it visible. Indeed, there was such a method. The children have done admirably.\"\n\"Principal, does that mean you intend to keep the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group active?\"\n\"Hmm. That's not for me to decide alone. Well, what do you say? If anyone has any objections to the students' arguments, speak now.\"\nNone of the teachers stepped forward. Even Siena had to keep her mouth shut this time.\nTo be honest, it felt like she had been squarely hit by her students. The existence of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group was a necessity. The hundreds of students gathered here were proof of that.\nThadd raised an objection.\n\"But what if we find violations of the school rules? Wouldn't there be considerable backlash? It feels uneasy to approve the research group as it is.\"\nAmong the teachers, there were quite a few like Siena who had confirmed illegal entry into forbidden areas. As more people pointed out the same issue, an impromptu teachers' meeting was convened.\nSiena was the first to voice her opinion.\n\"It's true the students broke the rules. However, I believe this is separate from the issue of whether the research group should continue to exist.\"\nThe teachers, who had been leading the charge to disband the group just moments ago, looked puzzled at her defense.\nBut Siena thought this was enough. It was their promise to the students. Shirone and his group had met their demands, and all she had to do now was acknowledge their achievement.\nApart from the teachers' discussion, members of the Shadow Research Group were secretly conversing in a secluded part of the park.\n\"They say even a rotten tree can bear fruit. It's not over yet. The graduates left behind quite bold successors, didn't they?\"\n\"There's no need for a war. The influence of the Psychic Group will continue for a while. Our Ant Language Research Group won't intervene.\"\n\"Hmph! They're just Class Five. They may climb up to the Advanced Class eventually, but by then, I won't be in this school anymore.\"\n\"Isn't it too early to declare that? If you fail this year, you might end up competing with them next year.\"\n\"What? Are you saying I'm running away from those kids in fear?\"\n\"Let's stop it. It's funny for us, who never cross paths, to be doing this. If you want to challenge them, go ahead. Of course, our Hide-and-Seek Research Group won't participate.\"\n\"Say all you want, but you'll be watching their every move. You guys would dive into muck to hide, wouldn't you?\"\n\"Enough of this. We're only tarnishing the reputation of our research groups by gathering like this. Let's leave it here.\"\nThe leaders of the school's underworld agreed to this and headed towards the Advanced Class building. Siena's brows furrowed as she spotted them moving together.\n'Ugh, those pathetic ones.'\nSeeing their faces was now unbearable. They had tormented her endlessly, passing from the lower classes to the Advanced Class.\nYet, they were untouchable due to their mischievously hidden talents, granted by the heavens.\n'How many such kids are in this school? This is all because of these ridiculous research groups.'\nFrom seniors to juniors, then those juniors becoming seniors themselves, passing on their ingenious tricks. How could a teacher compete with that?\nThat was why Siena had wanted to disband the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group - not out of hatred for Nade and his group, but to cut off the root of evil.\n'But in the end, this is how it turned out.'\nSighing, Siena pushed through the crowd and shouted towards Shirone and his group standing on the rooftop.\n\"I'm announcing the result of the teachers' meeting.\"\nThe applause and cheers of the students subsided.\n\"The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group was set to be disbanded soon. There had been no official activity for a year, and the membership was lacking. However, following today's presentation and discussions among\nmost teachers and Principal Alpheas, it has been decided to continue the research group, represented by Nade and two others, for the time being. However......\"\nSiena hesitated, then burst out in frustration. No matter how many times she thought about it, it was infuriating. She pointed angrily and shouted.\n\"You three are on house arrest for a week! A suspension, you idiots!\"\nHahahaha!\nThe students burst into laughter, clutching their stomachs. The idea to prove the existence of the research group was brilliant, but they were guilty of installing unauthorized equipment in the school.\nShirone, Nade, and Yiruki gaped in disbelief, then looked at each other. Slowly, the corners of their mouths turned up, and their eyes sparkled with joy.\n\"We did it! We succeeded!\"\n\"Hahaha! We've saved the research group!\"\nTheir attitude was one of complete disregard for the suspension. Watching her students hugging each other in excitement, Siena was dumbfounded.\nYet, the students had no regrets. They had given their all, and the result filled them with genuine happiness.\n\"Haha! Hey, congratulations! Keep up the good work!\"\n\"Where's the research room? I'll visit sometimes!\"\nStudents offered their congratulations. Among them were Shirone's avid followers, Mark and Sharelle.\n\"Aaaaaah! Shirone, you're incredible! I knew from the start it wouldn't end like this! You're always one, no, two steps ahead of me!\"\n\"That's right. Who knew the existence of the research group depended on this presentation? Anyway, you did a great job again, didn't you, Amy?\"\nAmy, who should have been the happiest at this moment, was unexpectedly sulking.\n\"What's so great about getting suspended? Why do such foolish things? We need to study hard and get to the Advanced Class as soon as possible.\"\nSharelle looked fondly at Amy, who was clumsy in expressing her feelings. She knew Amy wanted to be in the Advanced Class with Shirone, living the school life together.\n\"But isn't it cool? Of course, I couldn't do it myself, but everyone thinks about it at least once. Wanting to surprise the world.\"\nSharelle looked enviously at Shirone.\nShirone, receiving cheers from the students, smiled brightly, without a trace of worry on his face.\nA longing emotion filled Amy's eyes. She knew better than anyone that she wanted to be beside Shirone right now.\nBut she shook her head, as if denying her feelings.\n'Right, there's no time for this if I want to graduate. I will never look up to you.'\nShe wanted to be with Shirone, to climb to great heights and laugh the happiest laugh in the world. Suppressing these thoughts, Amy turned away.\n'So... hurry up and catch up, you idiot.'\n* * *\n4:00 AM.\nWith the night staff having left and all students and teachers asleep, it was a deep, quiet night.\nShirone and his group lay in the grass of the central park, where the historic presentation had taken place, gazing at the stars.\nThe cheers of the children and the bustling noise had faded away, but their echoes seemed to linger in their ears.\nNade spoke in a hoarse voice, \"We finally did it, all of us.\"\n\"Yeah, but I feel a bit sorry for Shirone. It's his first time facing this, isn't it?\" said another.\nShirone chuckled. It didn't bother him at all.\n\"But it was fun, wasn't it? So much fun.\"\n\"Absolutely, it was the best. Will we ever experience a day like today again? The cheers of the people still haven't left me.\"\n\"We three combined our strengths, that's how it should be. Anyway, we've made new history at Alpheas Magic Academy.\"\nShirone sat up energetically.\n\"Besides, it's not all bad. We've gained a lot. The level of photon output has increased tremendously due to this presentation. I think it will even work in the graduation class.\"\n\"I feel the same. I gained knowledge of fiber optics, and above all, experienced the mass production process alone. Honestly, it was a tremendous learning experience. All thanks to you guys.\"\n\"Same here. I've gained a lot by applying the behavior patterns of 400 people in practice. If Shirone hadn't brought in the Immortal Function, it would have been impossible.\"\n\"What are you talking about? You're the amazing one. Without the behavioral equations of Servant Syndrome, the students would never have been deceived.\"\n\"If we're talking about hard work, Nade did a lot too. He installed hundreds of mechanical devices without a single error. That focus is really something.\"\nCaught up in their excitement, Shirone and his friends suddenly fell silent, realizing something. A chilly wind passed briefly. Nade, who had gotten up, lay back down and said,\n\"Let's stop. What's the point of praising each other?\"\n\"Right. We shouldn't become frogs in a well. It's natural to enjoy our achievements, but we must not become complacent.\"\nShirone gazed at the stars shining like they were about to spill from the sky.\n\"I want to climb higher. I need to become the brightest star.\"\nYiruki shared the same sentiment.\n\"It seems we've done everything we can by lounging around. It's about time to climb up. To the graduation class.\"\nNade tumbled and sprang up.\n\"Alright! Let's set a new goal! To move up classes as quickly as possible! And to graduate at the same time! Let's have fun even after entering society!\"\nShirone and Yiruki nodded in agreement.\n\"Good. Let's keep running until then.\"\n\"Ha ha ha. I feel motivated for the first time in a while!\"\nThe three of them brought their hands together and cheered.\nSomeday they would become the greatest magicians. With that determination, they gazed up at the night sky, their eyes twinkling like stars.\nThe brightest, solitary star.\nThe North Star was looking down at them.\n* * *\nUpon returning to the dormitory, Shirone immediately collapsed into sleep. It was regrettable to receive a week's suspension, but the mental and physical exhaustion was too overwhelming to dwell on it.\nA day passed just like that.\nThe sound of the morning piano and the sun high in the sky had nothing to do with Shirone, who was suspended.\n\"Hey. Shirone. Shirone.\"\nStirred by someone shaking him, Shirone frowned and opened his eyes. The blurry figures of two people flickered before him, revealing the smiling faces of Nade and Yiruki.\n\"Ugh. What?\"\n\"You're amazing. Still sleeping?\"\n\"I don't know. I'm tired. Please leave.\"\n\"Come on, get up. We can't attend classes anyway. Let's go have fun.\"\n\"Fun?\"\n\"Yiruki knows a casino where they give free drinks and there are lots of pretty girls. Let's go make the most of it, now that it's come to this.\"\nShirone lost interest the moment he heard 'casino.'\n\"Aren't you guys tired? I'm dead tired.\"\n\"We've slept all day too. You've been sleeping for 27 hours now. Come on, let's just go for 3 days. With Yiruki's Savant Syndrome, making money will be a breeze.\"\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 68: At the Summit (1)\nShirone knew that those who claimed to be experts often ended up getting fleeced at such places, down to their underwear. Of course, with Yiruki's Savant Syndrome abilities, he would be unmatched in probability calculations, but there's a reason why people call it gambling. Probability is just that, probability; to win in gambling, one needs the instinct of a gambler who can sense the tide of victory. Shirone could clearly envision Yiruki slowly winning money and then losing it all in one go.\n\"I'm not going. You guys go. I don't do gambling.\"\n\"You don't have to gamble. There are pretty girls there who serve drinks and massage your shoulders, you really don't want to go?\"\nHearing this made Shirone even less inclined to go.\n\"Ah, sorry. I'm just really tired. I need to keep sleeping. Have fun.\"\nOnce the word 'sorry' came out of Shirone's mouth, there was no turning back. After all, he was the one who had accumulated the most fatigue in preparing for this presentation. Both Nade and Yiruki lacked sleep as well, but their tasks were divided into physical and intellectual labor.\nIn contrast, Shirone, who had to increase the level of photon output, had undergone intense training that exhausted both body and mind for a month. Plus, at the last minute, he entered the Infinite Realm and exhausted his mental strength, so it was natural for him to feel physically and mentally drained.\n\"Alright, we get it. Rest well. Anyway, we're going, just so you know.\"\n\"Yeah. Win big and buy me something delicious.\"\n\"Ha ha ha! Don't worry! When you wake up, we'll have magically become rich.\"\nAs the door closed, Shirone buried his face back into the bed.\n'All this fuss for being rich already...'\nShirone fell back into a deep sleep.\n* * *\nThat night.\n\"Huuh... Huh.\"\nShirone tossed and turned in his bed, sweating coldly. The nightmare that hadn't visited him when he fell asleep like fainting was now resurfacing as he got enough sleep.\n\"Huuh...\"\nShirone grimaced and shook his head left and right. In the vast universe, humans were nothing. That intense sense of emptiness wrapped around Shirone as a powerful shock.\nAgain, the nightmare was being sucked into a single point. Time flowed backward, reaching the beginning of the universe. Light appeared, and that light, flickering like a thread, then turned into bubbles, filling Shirone's vision. It was only light. And the next moment, a powerful explosion occurred in the empty space of nothingness.\n\"Huooooh!\"\nShirone sat up, his eyes wide open, still fixated on the afterimages in his memory. Only when he felt the dampness of his sweat-soaked pajamas did he slowly turn his head towards the window.\nChirping sounds of birds indicated morning.\n\"Phew. Just when I thought it was passing.\"\nHe had a nightmare, yet again. A strange sensation enveloped his entire body, making him shiver.\nBut Shirone was no longer afraid.\nHe had heard the cause from Armin and had managed to escape from the Infinite Realm with his own will on the day of the presentation.\nAs he gained some control over his power, Shirone calmly observed the phenomena happening to him.\n'The universe I see in my dreams. That's clearly a scene representing the beginning of the universe. And then, the Gauge Symmetry.'\nAlthough lacking logical information, he felt a sense of clarity. Perhaps it was a process of organizing information in the subconscious. Reminded of Armin, who had said he would come to realize it on his own, Shirone felt calm, and the sense of mourning disappeared.\nShirone went to the bathroom. He felt quite good, having slept deeply for what could have been several days. While brushing his teeth, he remembered that Yiruki and Nade seemed to have stopped by.\n'Was it a dream? Or did they really go?'\nThe faces of the two, saying they would hit the jackpot at the casino, faintly crossed his mind.\n'I should have gone with them. What do I do now, alone?'\nAs he finished brushing his teeth and left the bathroom, Shirone suddenly stopped, looking back at the bed. Small dust particles floating above the bed were rotating. The window was closed, so it wasn't due to air circulation.\nForgetting he was still brushing his teeth, Shirone ran over. Looking closely, the particles were indeed moving. He reached his hand towards the center of the rotation, feeling nothing at first, but then a strong sense of mourning hit him.\n\"Huooooh!\"\nShirone bent over, spitting out the toothpaste foam.\nWhat could it be?\nIt felt like touching a nerve where a tooth had been extracted, a sensation of confirming something he knew but didn't have a name for.\n'This is it! Something I know but don't have a name for. But what is it?'\nShirone waved his hands frantically in the air, but the strange sensation didn't return. Calming down, he went back to the bathroom, showered in hot water, and came out, still pondering the recent phenomenon.\n'It's not wind, not air pressure, not temperature. But how can dust move like that?'\nIt wasn't just floating; it was moving in a pattern driven by some force.\nAfter over an hour of deep thought, Shirone, feeling frustrated, changed his clothes and went outside. It was the middle of class time, so no students were around.\nFeeling unfamiliar emotions, Shirone walked towards the main gate. He had a week of suspension, so he was free to do whatever he wanted for the next four days. Now that the die was cast, Shirone decided to use this time as a rest period after the intense training.\n'But where to go?'\nThe first place that came to mind was his home. The desire to see his parents grew strong as he thought of them.\n'No, that's nonsense.'\nIt would take half a day by carriage, but there was no reason to go. He couldn't just show up at home saying, \"Mom, Dad, I got suspended.\"\nAnd visiting the Ogent house without Rian and Reina there would only be awkward.\n\"Ah, right!\"\nShirone suddenly realized his destination and snapped his fingers.\nThe bookstore it was.\nThough the school library was overflowing with books, purchasing them from a bookstore had always been a dream of Shirone's. Smiling at the memory of being overjoyed by an old book his father had bought him in his childhood, he recalled the desire to own more books.\nNow, thanks to the allowance Temuran sent him every month, he could afford it. Buying books in the commoner's area meant he could fill a basket with just a little spending.\n'It's the first time Im buying my own book.'\nWhile borrowing from the library wasn't bad, Shirone, a book lover, had a strong sense of possession.\nWith his decision made, he quickened his pace, passing the noble district and entering the commoners area. The streets he often visited with his father's cart in his childhood remained unchanged. Entering the bookstore with a confident stride, the owner recognized him as the child who used to spend hours gazing inside.\n\"Welcome... oh my, isn't this Shirone?\"\n\"Hello, ma'am.\"\n\"Look how much youve grown. I thought your father had left the city since he hadnt visited in a while. He always bought a book whenever he came.\"\n\"He won't be coming anymore. Thats why Im buying them myself.\"\n\"That's good. You still love books, I see. Feel free to browse.\"\n\"Sure, Ill take a look around.\"\nShirone walked around the store with a content smile. Regardless of content, well-kept books were expensive. In Creas, a city with a large population, bookstores did well despite few commoners being literate.\nAlthough academic books were less common than popular novels, Shirone realized that the library at Alpheas Magic Academy housed much more advanced texts. Settling for a novel with a magician as the protagonist, he picked a clean, new copy and paid with gold. New books were expensive, but Shirone, having enough money, didn't mind.\n\"Buying something this pricey? Are you running an errand for someone?\"\n\"No, it's actually the first book Im buying myself. I wanted a clean one.\"\n\"Thats admirable. Not many spend money on books. Read it well and get smart. A clever head won't make your future wife suffer.\"\nUnaware Shirone attended a prestigious magic academy, the bookstore owner proudly gave a speech. Shirone listened happily, leaving with his book.\n'This is my book.'\nThe thrill of owning a book not borrowed or used by others made his heart race.\n\"Hey, isn't that Shirone?\"\nHearing his name, Shirone turned to see a group of kids around a cart. Recognizing them, his eyes widened.\n\"Altor? Martin? And Lumina too?\"\nThey were friends from the village he used to play in as a child.\n\"Wow, it really is Shirone!\"\nThe kids, mostly his age, swarmed around him. Altor, the leader, had grown enormously, while Martin, always small, was closer to Shirone's size.\nAltor draped an arm over Shirone's shoulder.\n\"You! What's been going on? You havent visited in years. Vincent only said you were living in the city.\"\n\"Ha ha, sorry. Thats how its been.\"\nShirone was as happy to see them, despite the rough greeting. Martin, with protruding front teeth, exclaimed in awe.\n\"Wow, you look like a noble.\"\n\"Do I? I hadnt noticed.\"\nShirone was surprised. Unknowingly, he had acquired the air of nobility. Lumina, the only girl in the group, chimed in.\n\"Shirone always looked noble. Anyway, glad you're doing well.\"\n\"Thanks, Lumina. Youve become pretty.\"\nLumina blushed. Shirone remembered her as a freckled, chubby child, but now she was a slender girl with clear skin.\nAltor laughed.\n\"Shirone, still good with words! But seriously, how did this noisy girl get pretty?\"\n\"Shut up! What right do you have to judge me?\"\nLumina's unusual outburst embarrassed Altor.\n\"It was just a joke...\"\n\"Enough. I dont want to talk to you.\"\n\"Fine! I'm embarrassed to be seen with a girl like you anyway!\"\nShirone's heart warmed, watching them bicker like old times a typical day for the village kids.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 69: At the Summit (2)\nSo, what have you been up to, Shirone? What are you doing in the city? Working at a store or something?\nUh? No, actually\nShirone decided to tell them the truth. He knew his father kept it a secret, but he couldnt be harsh enough to lie when asked directly.\nIm actually attending a magic academy.\nWhat?!\nThe children all widened their eyes in shock and yelled out.\nIt was unbelievable. They knew Shirone was extraordinary since childhood, but the son of a lumberjack attending a magic academy was unheard of.\nHow did that happen? Is it true?\nShirone was surprised by their reaction, more than he expected. To calm them down, he lightly joked.\nHa ha. I just got lucky. I worked as a librarian in a noble's house, and fortunately, they liked me and helped me get in.\nHearing this, the children became even more dumbfounded.\nNo matter how much he worked as a librarian, it was unheard of for a noble to go that far for a commoner. Those unaware of the hardships Shirone went through to reach this point couldnt understand.\nWow, thats amazing. So, youre learning magic now?\nWow! Magic! Can you use magic? Can you show us?\nAs the children clamored excitedly, Shirone had to sweat it out to calm them down.\nWell Im still in the lower classes, so Im not that good yet. Besides, using magic outside of school is against the rules.\nAltor looked at Shirone skeptically. It was hard to believe. Shirones fine appearance and character had always been awe-inspiring to the children. But the reason Altor could be the leader was his physical strength, which was most important to commoners.\nBut now, Shirone was a student at a magic academy, a place thought to be only for the highest nobles, while Altor was still just a villager.\nIf youre at the magic academy, why are you here? Shouldnt you be busy studying?\nOh, thats because I just took a break. Had a tough exam a few days ago and needed some rest.\nThis time, he had no choice but to lie. Saying he was suspended would eventually reach his fathers ears. Even if it was for a good reason, his parents would be disappointed.\nMost of the children seemed to believe him. Having never attended a school, they easily accepted the idea of getting a vacation.\nLumina grabbed the hem of Shirones clothes and asked,\nHow long is your break?\nUm, about three days?\nReally? Are you going home then?\nHa ha, no. The term is almost ending, so Ill go home then. My parents must be busy too.\nThey would be. If its only three days, your break would end just traveling there and back.\nThe children, sharing similar family backgrounds, knew too well how busy a life of farming was.\nMartin asked,\nSo, have you decided where to go? Where will you sleep?\nUm Actually, I havent really decided yet.\nLumina exclaimed excitedly,\nReally? Then come with us. You used to stay over often back in the day.\nShirone was tempted by the offer. Going back to the academy meant being confined to his dorm with nothing much to do, being suspended. He didnt want to spend the night alone in a place without any acquaintances either.\nWould it be alright if I join?\nHo ho ho! What are you talking about? We still gather at each other's houses and sleep over every other day.\nShirone remembered too. They were used to communal living, being friends, siblings, lovers, and family to each other.\nAlright, then. Id like to see the uncles again after so long.\nAlright! Lets go! The goods are sold, so we can leave now! Lets have a big round of beer!\nAltor wrapped his arm around Shirones head and walked him to the cart. Shirone yelped in pain under Altors much stronger grip.\nOuch! That hurts.\nHa ha ha! Are you still that weak? A great magician needs strength too.\nShirone knew Altors behavior was his way of reestablishing his position as the leader. Understanding their lifestyle, Shirone didnt mind. He had grown up among them, knowing their ways.\nAltor lifted Shirone onto the cart with ease. It was almost impossible for an average person to lift a grown man, but Altor had grown into a giant since their childhood. As Shirone stared at him in amazement, Altor patted his head and laughed.\nGood to see you, Shirone! Lets drink until our noses are crooked tonight!\n* * *\nRiding the cart into the village, Shirone was filled with nostalgia at the familiar scenery. Green sprouts were rising in the fields along the ridges, and smoke curled up from the chimneys of the houses lined along the mountain ridges. The farmers working the fields shouted as they saw the cart approaching.\nMartin! Youre back now?\nYes, Uncle! And Shirone came with us!\nWhat? Shirone? Wheres Vincent?\nVincent didnt come. But Uncle, do you know? Shirone is attending a magic academy now!\nWhat? Hes eating at a school?\nNo, not eating! Hes attending a magic academy!\nHa ha ha! Thats nonsense.\nMartin fell silent, and the uncle returned to his work. Altor understood his reaction. Even he found it hard to believe, how could someone who had only known a life of farming?\nLumina pouted.\nWhy dont they believe us? Shirone, dont worry. Ill spread the word later.\nHa ha. Theres no need for that.\nAltor spoke up.\nMr. Vincent didn't say anything either. Better keep quiet and not meddle in this.\nAs the leader of the village children, Altor understood the dangers of words. If Shirone was lying, it could put Vincent in a tough spot.\nIf Vincent stops trading with us, it could impact our family too.\nAfter storing the cart in the communal warehouse, Altor led the children to the only place in the village that sold alcohol. It was a simple establishment with a dirt floor and a few tables, run by the wife of a herbalist as a side job.\nWere here, ma'am.\nWelcome, Altor. Oh, is that Shirone?\nIve been well, maam.\nLook at you. I heard Vincent was working in the city, did you meet him there? Anyway, good to see you.\nThe children familiarly pushed three tables together, with Altor taking the head seat and placing an order.\nA beer each to start, and the usual for snacks, please.\nShirone felt a generation gap. These children, who couldnt even touch alcohol before, now sat crossed-legged, comfortably downing beers. In comparison, the children at the magic academy still seemed so young.\nSo, Shirone, do you drink?\nUh? No, I havent really tried it.\nWhat? Youre still a kid then. Don't you even have facial hair yet? Ha ha ha!\nThe children burst into laughter at Altors joke, though Lumina seemed serious.\nWhy say that to a friend you havent seen in a while? Always so crude.\nHer defense of Shirone made Altor blush slightly.\nWell its always been that way.\nHe knew Lumina had liked Shirone since they were children. But now, they were not kids anymore. Strength was admired, and Altor believed he, the future village chief, should be Luminas match. Yet, his displeasure quickly faded into the merriment of the occasion. Shirone, too, enjoyed the reunion. Even the beer, his first taste, unexpectedly suited his palate, and the lively atmosphere continued.\nDo you remember when big sis Hauran chased after you, Shirone?\nHey, why bring that up now? Stop it!\nA bit tipsy, Shirone waved his hands to stop Martin.\nWhats the harm? Its all in the past. Besides, Hauran sister got married last year. Shes not even here.\nOh, is that so? Thats a relief then.\nThe children laughed and thumped the table at Shirones comment. Lumina, taking advantage of the mood, clung to Shirone.\nSo, whats your type, Shirone?\nUh? Well, I havent really thought about that.\nAltor was irked by Luminas flirting but couldnt intervene, so he deliberately turned to Shirone.\nShirone, you really go to a magic academy? Can you do at least a simple spell?\nWell, you see, I started learning magic late, so Im behind the other kids. Magic itself is quite a difficult subject. Im not entirely incapable, but its forbidden by school rules\nMagic wasnt just physical force. It was a powerful authority that drew the forces of nature through human spirit. Shirones main skill, Photon Output, might not be physically powerful, but he knew it would instill fear and awe in the childrens hearts. He didnt want to spoil the mood by showing off magic.\nMartin, chewing on some jerky, asked,\nSo if its that hard, can you end up not becoming a mage?\nOf course. In fact, more people fail to become mages than succeed.\nReally? Then what will you do for money if you cant become a mage?\nUh? How to\nShirone hadnt seriously considered the possibility of failing to become a mage.\nNoticing Shirone's hesitation, the children looked puzzled.\nSo who pays for your school fees? Do the nobles cover that too?\nYes. For now, Im receiving support.\nTheir eyes widened in awe.\nWow! Really? How much do they give you? Have you saved up? How will you marry? Have you ever dated a noble? Have you been to those places with lots of women? Nobles frequent those, right?\nUh... Not everyone goes there\nAltor's expression soured as the children's enthusiastic questions continued. It almost seemed like Shirone was the leader now.\nIn the village, hierarchy wasn't just about overpowering the weak. If a strong leader didnt maintain control, people would become greedy for more. Social isolation meant disharmony could lead to the group's collapse. Designating a leader from a young age prepared them for village responsibilities.\nAltor spoke in a somewhat indifferent tone.\nEnough with the questions. Are you all that envious of Shirones life?\nOf course. He gets money from nobles.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 70: At the Summit (3)\nEven so, if you can't become a mage, it's all for nothing, right, Shirone?\nUh? Oh, of course.\nRelying on someone elses money means you're entrusting your life to others. Its fine if you succeed, but if you fail, youre left with nothing. You shouldnt do that, Shirone. Think about your parents. Even if you study magic, you should have a way to make a living. Do you plan to rely on your parents forever? And its not like youre physically strong enough for labor.\nWhether he became a mage or not, Shirone had knowledge to fall back on for employment. There would be many whod call upon him, as long as he put aside his pride, being a commoner. But Shirone had never considered the possibility of failure.\nHow could he have overlooked it? Was it an oversight? Arrogance? What life would he lead if he failed to become a mage?\nHe felt uneasy. Everyone could fail, and Shirone was no exception. The practical questions from the village children sent a chill through his heart.\nAs the mood dampened, Altor suggested a game, partly to reclaim his authority as the leader.\nLet's lighten up. Hey, Shirone, how about an arm wrestling match?\nWith me?\nYeah. You used to be surprisingly tough. Lets see if you still have it in you.\nThe children excitedly banged on the table, egging them on.\nYeah! A warrior versus a mage! The battle of the century!\nAs the atmosphere heated up, Shirone set aside his gloom and smiled. Arm wrestling with someone who could lift an adult? It was absurd, but he couldnt resist the challenge.\nHow about we bet on the drink?\nAltor, with his thick forearm, challenged Shirone, who, despite being disadvantaged, couldnt back down from the wager.\nFine, lets do this. But no holding back.\nOf course.\nAs they clasped hands, Shirone felt like he was gripping a rock. He could easily win with Photonic Magic, but it was just a fun thought.\nMartin volunteered to referee.\nReady Go!\nShirone exerted all his strength, but Altors power was overwhelming. Shirone's arm was pushed over, and he tumbled under the table, nursing his elbow. It wasnt just strength; it was monstrous.\nOw, that really hurt.\nWow! Altor wins! Shirone is a mage and he got floored in one go?\nMagic and arm wrestling had nothing to do with each other, but to the children, the title mage carried significant weight.\nOf course! Altor once hunted a bear!\nRegaining his authority, Altor laughed heartily.\nHaha, Shirone, you've really weakened. This turned out to be an unfair bet. I'll pay for the drinks.\nLumina approached Shirone, her eyes filled with concern.\nAre you okay, Shirone? Altor can be so rough.\nShe understood why Altor acted harshly, being part of the village. But Shirone, accustomed to the life of a lumberjack, wasn't upset.\nIm fine. But Altor has really gotten strong.\nAs Shirone stood, his purse of gold coins fell, spilling shiny coins. The children's eyes widened.\nWhoa, real gold coins!\nFive of them?\nThey gathered around in awe. It was rare even for adults in the village to use gold coins.\nYou have a lot of money. Why carry five gold coins?\nShirone sheepishly collected the coins.\nIn case I found a book I really wanted. Books are expensive.\nThe children knew Shirone loved books. When he visited with Vincent, he always carried one.\nSo, can you spend this freely? You must buy whatever you want, right?\nShirone hesitated. He'd never frivolously spent money, especially since it was given by others. But seeing the children's shock at the amount, he chose his words carefully.\nI rarely need to spend. School keeps me so busy I often skip meals.\nEven so, you can afford the drinks. You lost the bet.\nOh, right.\nShirone clearly heard Altors offer to pay, but refusing now would offend him. Altor wasnt ignorant and let the flow go naturally.\nOkay, Ill pay. It was a bet, after all.\nThe children cheered.\nGreat! Well use the gold coins, right? Shirone, can you give me the money now? Ive never handled gold before.\nIll do the paying. Ive always wanted to!\nNo, I will!\nSuddenly, Shirone had become the leader. Lumina watched Altor, whose face showed his hurt pride.\nYet he didnt explode, sharing Lumina's understanding. She knew Shirone hadnt changed a bit. He was still the kind boy who always put others first.\nStop it, all of you! Youre acting like kids over one gold coin! Lets change the subject.\nLumina's reprimand made everyone return to their seats. Shirone was grateful for her intervention.\nQuick-witted Martin changed the topic.\nDid you hear? It showed up in the back mountains again yesterday.\nYeah, I heard. If this continues, there wont be any wild animals left. How long will it keep preying?\nIt must be a pregnant cow bear. They eat twice as much.\nCow bears, especially the females carrying cubs, were notoriously voracious, a headache for hunters.\nShirone, experienced in hunting, expressed interest.\nA cow bear in this area? Arent they usually behind the mountain range? Thats a real problem.\nExactly. My dad is a hunter, and these days, he keeps coming back empty-handed. With the wildlife nearly wiped out, theres not much he can do.\nWhy dont we all band together and hunt it? The cow bear isnt particularly aggressive. Five people should be enough, right?\nPeople are scarce these days due to the logging season. Everyones busy with logging, so no ones available to help. But, judging from its roaming range, it seems unlikely that it would give birth here. If we wait a week, things should return to normal.\nThat must be tough for your father.\nAltors eyes sparkled with an idea.\nHey, Bredd. What if we caught that cow bear?\nWhat? Us? Isnt that dangerous?\nWhat are you saying? Ive hunted the notorious red bears till I got bored of it. A mere cow bear is nothing to me.\nAltor saw this hunt as a chance to regain his tarnished honor. His strength and hunting skills were his edge over Shirone, almost like a divine opportunity.\nHey, what do you say? Let's help out Bredd.\nSure, Id appreciate it.\nFailing to bring meat meant their families would starve. The children, knowing Bredds predicament, couldnt ignore it. After all, Altor had once hunted the most ferocious of bears, the red bear.\nGreat! Lets hunt the cow bear tomorrow!\nYesss! The blood's boiling! Bredd, dont worry! Ill shoot an arrow right in the bears head!\nIdiot! You think you can do it? We just need to dig traps and leave the rest to Altor.\nDeparture at dawn tomorrow! Shirone, youre coming too, right?\nAltors eyes gleamed with expectation. He needed Shirone to reassert his leadership. Shirone, sensing this, nodded in agreement.\nOkay. Ive learned some things from my father, so I can do my part.\nExcellent! Then, cheers!\nTheir beer mugs clinked in the air, foaming over with excitement.\n* * *\nThe next dawn.\nShirone got up at the crack of dawn to prepare for the hunt.\nWhile the others would bring specialized tools, basic equipment was everyone's responsibility.\nHe packed his backpack with a rope coiled to avoid tangling, checked his bow and arrows, and gathered cloth and glue for torches, nails, and a hammer. He also packed extra arrowheads and, for emergencies, dried rations and a whistle.\nLifting the backpack, its familiar weight felt reassuring.\nShirone, still a man of action, opened the door to find the other kids already gathered outside, fully equipped.\nHey, Shirone. Youre late. Get moving. Haha.\nShirone chuckled sheepishly. Clearly, those actively engaged in the field were on another level.\nHaha, sorry. Im a bit out of practice.\nLets go. We need to be back before sunset.\nAltor led the way, with Shirone and Lumina in the middle group, and Martin covering the rear.\nReaching the cow bears territory by sunrise, Lumina started cooking breakfast - a corn soup with melted sheep cheese and bread. Shirone hungrily dipped his hard bread into the soup, swallowing it down.\nDelicious. Luminas cooking never disappoints.\nHehe, Lumina blushed.\nShirone noticed the children had matured. Even Lumina, usually quick to bicker, had changed for the better. He felt relieved seeing his friends doing well.\nLet's move. The bear seems to be higher up, Altor announced.\nInspecting claw marks on the trees, Martin commented on the severity of the damage.\nLook at this. The tree's almost split. The bear must be incredibly strong.\nAltor examined the claw marks closely.\nHmm. Not too big. Shouldnt be a problem.\nBut isnt it dangerous?\nBears are known for their strength. They're faster than you think. But cow bears are relatively slow. We have enough people to handle it.\nShirone examined the claw marks, feeling something off.\nStrange. Doesnt seem like sheer strength. More like something fast and sharp slashed it...\nAltor pulled out his bow, readying an arrow.\nLet's start here. We'll set traps further up.\nFollowing Altor, the kids moved skillfully, a testament to their daily life in the wilds.\nShirone activated his Spirit Zone, extending his senses. Although his range was less than a seasoned hunter, his uneasy feeling warranted caution.\nAs they neared the summit, a disturbing sensation hit Shirone. He stopped, trying to identify it. Altor turned, annoyed.\nShirone, whats wrong? Were not setting traps here.\nAltor. Somethings not right.\nI dont feel anything.\nAltor dismissed Shirones concern. But Shirone, convinced, wandered off, with Altor reluctantly following. Unilateral actions in the mountains could endanger everyone.\nShirone, if youre going to act like this, just go back dow... Ugh!\nAltor stopped, horrified by the scene ahead. Shirone was speechless, nausea overwhelming him.\nWhat is this...?\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 71: At the Summit (4)\nThe wild animals were tragically torn apart, hanging on the tree branches like laundry. Among them were ferocious carnivores.\nThe children who arrived later covered their mouths in shock. Not screaming was all they could manage.\n\"Ah, A-Altor. What happened? Did a c-cow bear really do this?\"\nMartin's voice trembled, and Lumina, unable to bear the sight, turned her head away, eyes tightly shut. Shirone made a quick decision.\n\"Let's go down. This doesn't seem like something we can handle.\"\n\"No, let's go a bit further. We need to find out what's happening.\"\n\"Altor! This is serious!\"\n\"That's why we're going! If this thing is in the mountains, all the animals will flee! We'll starve!\"\n\"But it's too dangerous. Let's go down to the city and report this.\"\n\"Report? Have you gone mad hanging out with nobles? Who will care about us mountain folk?\"\n\"Idiot, that's what I'm saying! This isn't a trivial incident to be ignored. Look at those animals. Dont you see how dangerous our situation is?\"\nMartin intervened.\n\"Shi-Shirone. Altor. Look there.\"\nThe bushes rustled and crackled. Shirone and Altor readied their arrows, aiming in the direction of the noise.\nRustle. Rustle.\nThe leaves' movements heightened the tension. Each child drew their weapons, waiting for the mysterious entity to appear. When the creature responsible for the carnage showed itself, Shirone and Altors arrows pointed far above their original target.\n\"This can't be...\"\nEven the brave Altor's voice trembled with fear.\n\"Grrrr.\"\nA monster resembling a wolf over two meters tall, with inflated chest muscles and slender waist, stood before them. Its arms, stretching down to its knees with hook-like claws as long as a human's little finger, supported its body on cat-like long feet.\nMartin barely managed to speak.\n\"It's a monster.\"\nMonsters, unlike animals, evolved from a completely different ancestral creature. This meant their animal-like traits weren't enough to fully analyze them. They were stronger, more agile, and even intelligent compared to regular animals.\n'A bipedal wolf... an Ulk.'\nShirone recalled what he had read. Ulks, lacking language skills, could express hundreds of emotions through sounds and had social structures due to their communal living. Being balanced in strength and agility, hunters feared them, especially in groups.\n'But why here? This area isn't known for monsters.'\nThe only explanation Shirone could think of was that these Ulks, having lost a tribal war, migrated here. His theory seemed right, seeing the wounds and blood on the Ulk's fur.\nThe Ulk, unable to contain its fury, howled. But the monster's anger wasn't as simplistic as a beast's instinct. Indifferent to its prey, it dashed towards the children, flaunting its speed.\nThe children scattered, their faces pale with terror. Only Lumina, paralyzed by fear, stood frozen.\n\"Lumina! Run!\"\n\"Ah... Ah...\"\nShirone extended his hand towards the Ulk, combining the omnipotence and omniscience of Photon Output. But Lumina was beyond the reach of his Spirit Zone.\n'Ah! I can't reach her.'\nShirone switched to Target Form in his Four-Way Formation, finally capturing the Ulk in his empathic senses.\n'Photon Output!'\nLight flashed, striking the Ulk in the eyes. Blinded by the sudden glare, the Ulk cried out.\n\"We did it! Shirone took it down!\"\nThe children, impressed by the impact of the light, assumed the Ulk's face had been smashed. But knowing photon output had no physical force, Shirone rushed towards the Ulk, shouting.\n\"Lumina! Run now! There's no time!\"\nLumina hastily moved, but her legs, stiff with fear, failed her, and she collapsed. Realizing Shirone's magic lacked lethal power, the children grew anxious.\n\"What do we do? It's just shooting light.\"\n\"Grrr!\"\nThe Ulk, recovering its vision, lunged at Lumina. Its hook-like claws snagged her hair tie, unraveling her hair. At that moment, Shirone teleported, taking to the sky with the Ulk.\n\"Shirone! No!\"\n\"Grrr!\"\nEach time the Ulk struggled, Shirone repeated the teleportation. Although risky, it was necessary to keep the Ulk's attention.\n'What do I do? How do I handle this?'\nFalling wouldn't kill the Ulk. Photonized, Shirone had no mass, meaning no fall damage. But fighting the Ulk in mid-air was impossible.\n'I need mass...'\nSuddenly, Shirone felt an intense sensation, unlike anything he'd experienced. It was a profound mourning sensation, a culmination of fragmented thoughts and deep realizations. The world's beginning, gauge symmetry, a swirling vortex above a bed these weren't just physical forces, but the power of existence breaking symmetry.\nThe discord between omniscience and omnipotence was resolved. Shirone understood, the missing fragment was gravity.\nWith omniscience achieved, the omnipotence that haunted him in nightmares precisely interlocked. Shirone converted the Ulk into photons and hurled it downwards.\n\"Grrr...!\"\nBefore its scream ended, the Ulk collided with the ground, bouncing off. Shirone landed gracefully, staring down at the defeated Ulk.\nIt was an instant kill. The Ulk suffered bone-shattering impact because the light was heavy.\n\"Phew\"\nMaterial doesn't inherently have mass; another element imparts it before vanishing.\nAn unknown particle beyond human observation.\nThat was the omniscience Shirone realized in the Infinite Realm, explaining the broken gauge symmetry.\n\"Done. I've finally figured it out.\"\nShirone clenched his fists, overwhelmed with emotion and tears.\nSuddenly, screams from the cliff's top reached him. Shirone regained his composure, looking up.\n\"No...\"\nHe remembered Ulks were social. Even if defeated in tribal wars, it was unlikely for one to roam alone.\n\"No good!\"\nTeleporting up, Shirone reached the summit, only to freeze. Dozens of Ulks surrounded them, the entire tribe on the move.\n'I underestimated their social nature.'\nThe children's fearful murmurs filled the air.\n\"What do we do? We're all going to die.\"\n\"I'm not even married yet. I don't want to die like this.\"\nShirone didn't want to die either. And now, he had at least a minimal weapon against the Ulks.\n\"It's okay, kids. I'll try something.\"\n\"Don't. Just run. You can escape with magic.\"\n\"It's okay. It's not against the rules now.\"\nShirone approached the Ulk pack.\n\"Shirone! It's dangerous!\"\nIgnoring Altor's call, he just replayed his recent epiphany, fixating on the Ulks.\nThe silver-furred chieftain Ulk snorted disdainfully, and its right-hand Ulk lunged.\n\"Grrr!\"\nShirone concentrated photons in his palm.\n'More... More...'\nThe light in his hand turned blindingly white. As the Ulk closed in, Shirone focused on altering the photons' properties. Amid escalating screams, he launched the compressed light into the Ulk's abdomen. The photon sphere pressed against the Ulk, then shot out as a golden beam.\n\"Grrr!\"\nThe Ulk howled, flying away, colliding with others, and tumbling down the mountain.\nThe children were astounded.\n\"Did you see that? That huge monster flew dozens of meters!\"\n\"How did he do that? Is that magic?\"\nThe chieftain Ulk pulled back its nose, recognizing Shirone's ability.\n\"Ma... ge...\"\nThe Ulks' eyes locked on Shirone. But his focus was solely on the chieftain.\nHe felt confident of victory.\nThe mass within the photons, though minuscule, carried enough force at near-light speed to exceed expectations. This was Shirone's unique unlocker magic...\nThe Photon Cannon.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Dream On (1)\nPhoton Cannon.\nThe mass contained within the photons was minimal, but the impact of the photon output's rapid speed was not something a mere monster could withstand.\nThe eyes of the Ulk chieftain blazed. Having battled humans numerous times, he knew how dangerous a mage could be.\nIts over! It looks scared! Shirone did it!\nMartin shouted. However, Altor's thoughts differed. They were not facing a mere beast but a monster. Although possessing intelligence, the beastly nature of these creatures was not to be underestimated.\nEven so, it wont end here. Even if Shirone is strong, he is still human. Predators that hunt in packs dont retreat just because of one or two casualties.\nAs Altor analyzed, the Ulk chieftain had no intention of retreating. The destructive power of a mage might be fearsome, but the collective aggression of a group did not fear a single individual.\nGrrrr, die\nCraaaaw!\nThe Ulk's ferocious roar shook heaven and earth.\nI can do this. As long as I stay focused, I can win.\nShirone teleported into the air and bombarded the ground with Photon Cannon. Bursts of light struck like hailstones. Even if the Ulks werent hit directly, the shockwaves from the ground impacted them.\nYet, the Ulk's ferocity was not diminished. Known as the kings of the forest when in groups, even ogres would yield to their combativeness.\nIgnoring the losses of their kin, each Ulk lunged at Shirone, swinging their claws. Shirone quickly landed on the ground. There, seven Ulks were awaiting their chance.\nShirone transformed his Spirit Zone into the Attack Form of the Four Way Formation. As soon as the thorns of the Spirit Zone touched an Ulk, a barrage of Photon Cannons was fired. Intense flashes blinded the eyes, and the Ulks hit by the photons were flung back to where they came from.\nWow, that's incredible Shirone.\nThe children were astounded. A human fighting equally against dozens of Ulks was like a tale of heroes thought to be mere exaggeration. But witnessing Shirones battle made any story seem believable.\nHa, ha.\nShirones breathing grew heavy. Each barrage of Photon Cannon felt like his consciousness would fly away. Maintaining photon output for more than 10 minutes was challenging due to the mental strength required but Photon Cannon was a fusion magic combining both light and mass.\nJust as a human cannot focus on two things simultaneously, a mage can usually cast only one magic at a time. Except for special cases like Yiruki with Savant Syndrome, even high-ranking mages can cast only one magic at a time, usually combining two or three attributes to maximize the effect of a single magic.\nHence, pure magic specialists are rare in the professional world. Most combine two or even three attributes to enhance a single magic's effect, like Sienas Ice Tornado or Thadds Fire Sun.\nFusion magic maximizes momentary efficiency but requires high mental strength. Shirone felt exhausted from repeatedly casting such demanding magic.\nThis is bad. I dont have many shots left. It seems impossible to take them all down.\nUlks, unlike street thugs, can sense their preys emotions. If they sense even a hint of fatigue, they will ruthlessly tear apart their prey.\nIndeed, the Ulk chieftain, having lost a third of his kin, still displayed hostility.\nShirone desperately intensified his Photon Cannon. A cluster of photons buried in the belly of the leading Ulk.\nCraaaaaw!\nThe bulky body skidded across the ground but, unlike before, it didnt fall and resisted the impact. Shirone felt a shock. He hadnt expected the power to drop so drastically.\nRealizing Shirone's fatigue, the Ulk chieftain ordered a full assault.\nCraaaw! Craaaw! Craaaw!\nThe Ulks, sensing victory, rushed forward.\nIn this situation\nShirones only option was the Immortal Function.\nBut could he endure it?\nCasting fusion magic in the Infinite Realm was different from merely using photon output. If he cast it in the Infinite Realm, the repercussions were unpredictable.\nGrrrrr!\nAs he opened the Immortal Function, immense pressure filled Shirones mind. It felt as if his head might explode.\nAaaaah!\nHe steeled his mind and opened his consciousness. As his self loosened, immense power surged in.\nThe Spirit Zone exploded intensely as it filled with light. The mass wave pushed the Ulks away, scattering golden fragments.\nHolding a sphere of light in his palm, Shirone thrust it forward with all his might. The Photon Cannon, a blazing white light, devastated the area. Repeatedly unleashing barrages like a broom sweeping the Ulks away.\nHowever, he couldnt maintain this state forever. If the Infinite Realm was a sea, Shirones mind was a stream. The Immortal Function was a barrier blocking between them. He was using ocean water through a hole in the barrier, but if it continued, the barrier would collapse.\nSince the mental energy required varies with each magic, a mage chooses the most cost-effective magic for the situation.\nOverpowered magic, offering disproportionately high effectiveness for its cost, included the Time Magic Stop, Invisibility Magic Invisiblerity, Alchemy Magic Injection, and Healing Magic Heal of Almighty.\nWhat about Photon Cannon?\nShirone considered it close to overpowered.\nIts excellent attack speed, the combination of single and continuous fire, and even the ability to form a beam met all the requirements for an offensive magic.\nHowever, the Photon Cannon was very draining. Continuously casting it like now could lead to a terrible consequence.\nIf I cast any more, Ill die!!\nShirone stopped casting Photon Cannon. The area was covered in dust, making it impossible to see even an inch ahead.\nAs the wind swept away the dust, the children were shocked by the scene. The area hit by Photon Cannon was utterly devastated.\nUlks were buried in the ground, looking chewed up, and those who fled were too terrified to mourn their dead kin.\nShirone realized the power of Photon Cannon. Nothing was left where the light had passed.\nSuch an effect left even the caster in awe; how devastating was it for those on the receiving end? The Ulk chieftain, stricken with fear, had to accept reality.\nThis mage cannot be defeated.\nGrrr, we go. Let us go.\nCurrently, Shirone was so exhausted that casting any magic was impossible. However, he stood firm till the end.\nDont come here again. If you enter these mountains one more time, it wont end like this.\nThe Ulk chieftain conveyed his subservient emotions in broken human language.\nNot come. Strong mage\nGo.\nAs Shirone waved his hand, the Ulk chieftain was the first to leave. The other Ulks also retreated into the forest without hesitation, following their chieftain.\nOnly after the Ulks disappeared did Shirone, relieved from the tension, stagger and collapse with his eyes closed.\nShirone! Shirone!\nShh! Be quiet. They might come back.\nAltor cautioned the children, and they quickly covered their mouths.\nAltor looked over Shirone again. Seeing him sleeping soundly, he couldnt help but chuckle.\nThe children of Huajeonmin Village had grown up over time, but Shirone seemed to remain the same as in his younger days.\nThey say mages don't age.\nInitially, Altor thought Shirone was just another common child of a lumberjack. A picked-up child. Shirone didnt resemble Vincent at all, which might have been why Altor looked down on him even more.\nBut it was a misconception. Perhaps Shirone wasnt the ugly duckling in the fairy tale?\nA human entirely different in nature from lumberjacks.\nAltor lifted Shirone effortlessly, feeling no pride despite his physical strength.\nHe now understood that he could never lift the weight of intelligence contained in Shirone's light body.\nLets go down. The hunting time is over.\nHuh!\nWaking up, Shirone abruptly sat up.\nHe was in someone's house.\nTouching the back of the sofa and looking around, he noticed a cozy floor. The warmth from the hearth and the sound of cooking in the L-shaped kitchen reached his ears.\nHuh? Shirone's awake. Lumina, Shirone is up!\nMartin shouted, and noisy sounds came from the kitchen. Soon, Lumina peeked out from behind the wall with a flushed face.\nWhere is this?\nShirone then remembered. It was Lumina's house, where he often stayed with his father when he was young.\nChildren rushed down from upstairs. They hadn't gone home and stayed by Shirone's side, still in their hunting attire.\nShirone, are you okay?\nAltor asked worriedly. As soon as they arrived home, they checked Shirone's condition, but there seemed to be no abnormalities. However, they were ignorant about magic, so there could be unseen issues.\nShirone conducted a few tests to check if there was anything wrong with his head. His memory was intact, and his mind seemed okay.\nIm fine. Seems like I just collapsed from fatigue.\nPhew, thats a relief. We thought something bad had happened to you.\nShirone felt sorry for causing unnecessary worry. Of course, the children thought the opposite.\nHaving slept soundly for a long time, I feel refreshed. It seems like my fatigue is finally going away.\nHe had slept for a long time in the dormitory, but the fatigue didnt really go away. However, now he felt genuinely good. The persistent feeling of foreboding was gone.\n'I was confident I would overcome it. But now that it's gone, I realize how much I've been enduring all this time. Armin was right. The sensation returned as soon as I mastered Photon Cannon. I didn't even have a nightmare.'\nA rumbling came from his stomach. It was hunger he hadnt felt in a long time. The savory smell wafting from the kitchen contributed to stimulating his appetite.\nShirone, licking his lips, asked Lumina.\nWhat are you making?\nPork stew. Mom bought some meat.\nLuminas mother came out of the kitchen with a ladle in hand.\nShirone, hello! Its been a long time.\nHello, ma'am. Sorry to trouble you because of me.\nHaha, dont say that. You dont know how much my daughter has been waiting for you.\nLuminas face turned bright red. Suddenly, her eyes grew sad, and she bowed her head.\nAltor understood her feelings. Like him, the children must have realized it too.\nShirone cannot be our leader. He wasnt a child of Huajeonmin Village, nor a lumberjacks son.\nShirone was a mage.\nAs the mood darkened, Altor shouted loudly to lighten the atmosphere.\nHey, hey! Im hungry. Lets eat first.\nYay! Meat after a long time! Meat! Meat!\nLuminas mother brought a large pot to the table. The stew, brimming with pork, was bubbling over its brim.\nLuminas family had only four members, but as it was common in Huajeonmin Village to gather in one house for meals, there was plenty of cutlery.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Dream On (2)\nAs about ten children took their seats at the table, Lumina's mother generously served the boiled pork.\nShirone felt a bit awkward. Preparing such a meal must have cost a considerable amount of money. Paying for it wasn't the issue, but it was a peculiar situation nonetheless.\nSensing Shirone's concern, Altor spoke up.\n\"Don't worry. We can sell the monster's hide for a good price. We'll start working on it tomorrow. Of course, we'll need your permission first.\"\n\"Me? No, of course, you should. Ah, and the monsters were Ulks. Their claws and fangs can fetch a good price, I've heard.\"\nShirone was sure to give permission. Besides, knowing the monster's name was a bonus.\nIn this world, knowledge equated to money.\nWithout knowing its name, taking it to market risked being underpaid. The effort of skinning could end up costing more than the profit.\n\"Well, thanks. Not just for the Ulk, but without you, our village would've had to relocate.\"\nFor generations, living off the land and selling forest yields was their way of life. Losing their home would've been a disaster. In that sense, Shirone was a hero to the village.\n\"It's fine. This place is precious to me too.\"\nShirone truly felt that way. The children had stayed instead of going to the mountains to collect the Ulk, even though the meat would spoil.\nThough not wealthy, their way of life, tough and filled with more blushes than nobles, taught them how to live together, which Shirone appreciated.\nMartin, chewing on the meat, suggested, \"Too bad your hard-earned vacation turned out this way. Want to come to the mountain tomorrow? We'll sell everything - the hide, claws, and all - and use that money to have fun.\"\nThe children of Huajeonmin Village never missed a chance to play, but Shirone regretfully declined. He was eager to analyze his recent enlightenment.\n\"No, I'm well-rested. Thanks to you, my fatigue is gone too. Time to study hard. I'll head back to school tomorrow morning.\"\nAfter dinner, the children returned to their homes. The night was still young, but they had work to do - preparing equipment, checking carts, and more.\nShirone climbed a hill to look down at Huajeonmin Village. The children, carrying torches, prepared for the next day's work, joking and laughing together. A gentle smile graced Shirone's face.\n\"Shirone, you're here?\"\n\"Altor, how did you find me?\"\n\"Just felt like you'd be here. What are you thinking about? You didn't even notice me coming.\"\n\"Just the old days. Playing tag here with Dad in those fields.\"\n\"True. But you spent more time reading books. Well, probably because of us.\"\n\"No, I just really liked books...\"\nAltor laughed heartily.\n\"No need to be polite. We all knew. Kids have always looked up to you. I was jealous too, and I owe you an apology for many things.\"\n\"No, I was the weird one. Maybe I was just scared to meet people. It was a confusing time.\"\nIn Huajeonmin Village, Shirone was the pride of his parents, never causing trouble. But since discovering magic at twelve, he was constantly tormented with doubts and struggles.\nAltor nodded, understanding. Seeing Shirone's magic today made things clear. The boy he thought was naive and bookish was, in fact, fighting harder than anyone else.\n\"Sorry, Shirone.\"\n\"For what?\"\n\"For last night at the bar. I overstepped. Everyone has their limits, and I misjudged. Don't take it to heart.\"\nShirone recalled Altor's sharp words from the night before. They hadn't hurt him. It was a burden he had to bear for choosing magic.\n\"I don't think like that. I've never considered how blessed and lucky I am. How fortunate.\"\n\"No, Shirone. You worked hard. That's why people help you.\"\n\"But still, it's the truth. What you said is my reality, and I have to live with it.\"\nAltor smiled sadly. People like Shirone, who could criticize themselves so objectively, were rare in Huajeonmin Village.\n\"Mages are amazing.\"\nAltor couldn't comprehend mages' thought processes. But that's probably why the world revered them so.\nShirone and Altor looked down at the village, silent, but their eyes fixed on the same place.\nThe following morning, only the children remained as the adults had already started their day's work at the crack of dawn.\nAfter having breakfast at Lumina's house, Shirone left for the day. The children saw him off, each carrying tools to dismantle the Ulk.\nShirone realized anew the weight of his own path in life, seeing their never-resting daily lives.\n\"Take care, Shirone. Study hard and become a mage,\" Altor offered his hand for a handshake. The other children also crowded around Shirone, bidding their farewells.\n\"Shirone, will you visit again?\"\n\"Tell us more stories about the magic academy when you come next time.\"\n\"Ha-ha! Sure. I'll come after this semester ends. Take care, everyone.\"\nAfter bidding farewell to the children, Shirone turned to Lumina. Despite the cheerful atmosphere, her face was the only one clouded with sadness.\nShirone vaguely understood Lumina's affection for him. But what could he do? Matters of the heart are not something one can control with their mind.\n\"Lumina, thanks for the delicious meals. You'll cook for me again, right?\"\nOnly then did Lumina show a smile. It was a resigned smile, knowing that wishing for more would be greedy.\n\"Of course! Just make sure you visit often. Don't pretend you don't know me just because you become a mage.\"\n\"Sure. I'll definitely come back.\"\nWalking down the hill of Hwajeonmin Village, Shirone suddenly turned back and shouted to the children still standing there.\n\"Take care, everyone! Stay healthy!\"\nAs Shirone walked further away, Lumina finally let her head drop weakly. It was sadder to realize that she could no longer harbor feelings for him.\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" Altor touched Lumina's shoulder, concerned. Lumina couldn't hold back her tears any longer. Altor felt a pang of guilt, knowing her feelings for Shirone from childhood but not realizing how serious they were.\n\"Damn, if you're so upset, you should have at least said something. Want me to beat him up and bring him back?\"\n\"No, it's okay. Shirone isn't gone.\"\nLumina wiped her tears with both hands and lifted her head. Suddenly, a bright smile appeared on her face.\n\"Shirone is chasing his dream.\"\nLumina prayed to the gods of the mountains and forests.\nMay his path be filled with warm light.\nAs Shirone headed back to the school, he pondered over the questions Hwajeonmin Village had thrown at him.\nHow far can I go?\nBeing a guest at the Ogent family, studying with the students at the magic school, didn't mean he had achieved anything.\nHe must continuously strive and progress without hesitation. He was attending school with the support of the Ogent family, studying advanced magic due to his parents' sacrifices.\nIs this the right path?\nIf he fails, can he easily accept it and live as he did before?\nArriving at the school, Shirone headed straight to the research club. He didn't feel like entering his dormitory, feeling troubled.\nI wonder if the others are having fun? Hopefully, they haven't lost too much...\nBy now, Yiruki and Nade should be excitedly betting in the casino. He hoped they hadn't gambled away their house deeds.\nEntering the warehouse where the research group was, Shirone stopped at the door, hearing voices.\nOh?\nOpening the door, he found Yiruki and Nade arguing on the sofa. The debate was so heated that Yiruki was unusually excited.\nYou idiot! A perpetual motion machine is absolutely impossible!\nWhy are you so narrow-minded? Im not talking about infinite power, but a second-type perpetual machine!\nThats against the law of entropy!\nWhat about this then? What is this Ive made?\nNade pointed at a wind-up toy car on the table. To call it a car was a stretch; it was more of a wheeled metal box.\nUh, guys\nNade turned to Shirone, holding up the toy car.\nShirone! You be the judge. I made this. After winding up like this and placing it on the ground...\nThe car moved in a circular motion, but the wind-up didnt unwind.\nYiruki glared furiously.\nHey, Shirone! Dont be fooled. Thats a complete scam!\nWhats a scam? Youve been waiting to see when it stops, and now youre arguing with me!\nThe perpetual motion machine! Its impossible to prove with just 1-2 hours of movement! Your machine is just highly efficient, thats all! The wind-up is ridiculously tight!\nSo what? It's miniature. If it's bigger, it can be 100 times more efficient!\nHow big will you make it? As big as the sky? Its more efficient to feed a horse!\nAll we need is to show the possibility! Technology always evolves towards being more compact!\nTheoryless technology eventually collapses!\nWho cares about theory! Just make it and use it!\nBoth the mathematician and the engineer had valid points. Shirone blinked, observing the car.\nSeeing them heatedly argue over a seemingly useless toy car, Shirone suddenly felt his earlier troubles fly away.\nAh... I see.\nSomeday, this wind-up car, through the research of many scholars, will earn a reputable name. Someone will then use it to create new knowledge.\nHow arrogant to think I am the only one who can do something. It wasnt because I was exceptional that I got here.\nIf my father hadnt bought me books, if I hadnt entered the Ogent family, if there hadnt been a teleportation test, if I hadnt met Yiruki and Nade...\nShirone wouldn't be as he is now.\nA series of improbable coincidences led Shirone here.\nThank you for letting me be here.\nLost in his thoughts, Shirone quickly regained his smile and asked his friends.\nSo, what happened with the casino?\nNade, who was head-to-head with Yiruki, turned with a frustrated expression.\nHow? Got cleaned out in one day. We were just one bet away from hitting the jackpot.\nThats why I said it would be a spade. 57% chance.\nFunny! I lost big time listening to you! 57%? Thats just a game of chance!\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Dream On (3)\nYou should have kept pushing! Dont you know that the more trials you run, the less the error becomes?\nBut we needed bullets for that! Following your strategy, we could have ended up staking even the house deed!\nSee, thats the point! Nothing in this world can be infinitely consumed! Energy is no exception!\nWhy are you bringing that up now?\nHahaha!\nShirone burst into laughter. Everyone striving towards their dreams is united in purpose. Thus, success and failure are merely secondary.\nEven if the world points fingers, calling it a pointless endeavor, or mocks them as idealists unable to support a family, humanity has progressed to this point precisely because someone chose to take on those challenges.\nIt's okay if its not me. Even if I become just a stepping stone for someone else, I don't mind.\nShirone stopped worrying. He felt thankful for all the luck that had shaped him, deciding to keep moving towards his dreams.\nYiruki, puzzled, asked, Shirone, why have you been grinning like that since a while ago? Did you eat something weird?\nShirone shook his head without answering, reaffirming his determination as he walked.\nIm back, guys.\nTwo days were left until the suspension was lifted.\nNade and Yiruki arrived at the 4th training field early at dawn, waiting for Shirone.\nIt was early, but bright due to summer, and both yawned continuously, eyes fixed on the entrance.\nRubbing his sleepy face, Nade complained, Ah, whats this? Calling us out so early.\nDidnt he say he had something to show us?\nWhats there to show all of a sudden? Weve already seen enough to be overwhelmed.\nMaybe he tattooed his wee...\nPuhahaha!\nImagining what Yiruki said, Nade burst into laughter. Meanwhile, Shirone entered the training field.\nAh, you were already here. But why is Nade like that?\nDunno. Maybe because hes a pervert.\nPuhahaha! Tattoo! A tattoo there! Puhahaha!\nAnxious, Shirone didnt ask. It must be some silly joke they were sharing.\nAnyway, let's start. Im eager to show you.\nWhat are you showing? A tattoo? Puhahaha!\nYiruki spoke with a look of disdain, Stop it. Its not funny anymore. But why did you call us here? What do you want to show?\nJust wait. Ill show you right now.\nShirone walked to the center of the training field and extended his hand towards the rock mountain.\nWhats this? Photon Output? Did you increase its output?\nShirone executed the Photon Canon. A white flash swiftly passed before Nade and Yirukis eyes.\nBoom!\nWith a dull roar, the rock exploded.\nNade and Yiruki, who had been nonchalant moments ago, were now wide-eyed, jaws dropped.\nThe impact area on the rock was flattened. They ran over to inspect the aftermath.\nWha-whats this? Magic? Or real magic?\nThats odd. To embody impact in light. I know photon types cant be fused, but what happened here, Shirone?\nProud, Shirone explained, This is my new weapon, not Photon Output but Photon Canon.\nPhoton Canon, huh? Sounds plausible. But how does it work?\nWell it's a bit long to explain.\nWhen Shirone hesitated, Nade rushed over, shaking his shoulder with an incredulous expression.\nHurry up and tell me! How did you do it? Imbuing physical force into light, thats absolutely impossible!\nNade, with his affinity to electricity and light, understood the gravity of Shirones achievement.\nIll tell you. But... would you mind coming somewhere with me?\nShirones group entered a restaurant in the noble district. As they filled up on seafood pasta, Shirone narrated how he discovered Photon Canon.\nThe story spanned from the swirling dust above his bed, the incident of throwing Ulk off the cliff, to the moment he realized the principle of Photon Canon.\nEven without mentioning Armin, Photon Canon was entirely Shirones original concept, making it easy to explain.\nNade and Yiruki listened intently, forgetting to eat their pasta.\nAfter an hour-long explanation, absorbed in thought, Yiruki put down his fork and said, Gauge symmetry, Ive heard about it from my father. It boils down to this: there exists a separate particle that transmits mass, right? And youve managed to control it.\nShirone realized anew how extraordinary Yirukis father must be. To teach his son about gauge symmetry, a cutting-edge theory in magic society, was impressive for the leader of the Thunder Dragons.\nNade added, In short, the product of Immortal Function is mass. And with Photon Canon, youve also rid yourself of the Mourning Sensation.\nYeah. I dont have nightmares anymore either.\nYiruki and Nade sank into contemplation. Particles that transmit mass to matter - Shirones realization was monumental.\nEspecially, Photon Canon was a magic unique to Shirone. No one else could perform Omnipotence with two particles, and without experiencing the Infinite Realm directly, even mastering Omniscience wouldnt suffice.\nIts incredible, Shirone. This might be more significant than we can imagine. If you patent this, you could sit on a gold mine right away!\nNades mind was already brimming with inventions that could be realized using Shirones theory.\nThats why I want to ask you for a favor. Would you accompany me to the library?\nThe library?\nI cant enter the school library during suspension. Thats why I want to visit the nobles library. I want to further research Photon Canon. But I cant get in, so I need you guys to take me.\nThats fine. It will be beneficial for us too. But why cant you go in alone?\nCommoners are not allowed to enter the noble library. He could use the school library once his suspension was lifted, but after his experience in the Firefield Village, he realized denying his identity changed nothing. He wanted to be honest with his friends at least.\nThe truth is, Im not a noble.\nNade, who was munching on pasta, stopped and stared blankly. Yiruki also looked at Shirone in shock.\nIm a commoner. I was abandoned in a stable when I was young and was raised by my current parents. My father is a simple lumberjack.\nEntering the magical world late, who would have thought he was a commoner, especially abandoned by his birth parents? This revelation did not match the untroubled demeanor Shirone always carried.\nIm sorry I didnt tell you until now. Ill accept any criticism. But I didnt want to hide it anymore.\nNade and Yiruki looked at each other, their eyes conveying mutual understanding.\nYiruki was the first to speak, It's a shocking revelation. But honestly, it doesnt change much. Youre still Shirone.\nI feel the same. If we had known from the start, maybe, but hearing it now changes nothing. The times weve shared together arent just going to disappear.\nShirone had hoped his friends would understand, but it was only a personal expectation. Receiving their acceptance, he felt deeply moved.\nYiruki chuckled, bowing his head, So, thats why it was a special admission. You learned magic late because you werent a noble. Talent doesnt come with ones birth status. Youre truly remarkable.\nThanks. I appreciate you saying that.\nSeeing Shirones emotional reaction, Nade waved his hands dismissively.\nHey, hey. No need to be so serious. I'm actually glad. We became friends without any preconceptions. If we had known earlier, we wouldnt have experienced events like the recent research presentation.\nYiruki, deciding to change the topic, stood up from the table, Alright, lets head to the library. I was bored to death anyway. Lets ignite our academic fervor!\nShirone and Nade stood up, joining in with enthusiasm.\nGreat!\nIn the capital Bashuka of the Kingdom of Thormia.\nIn the Jijeon mountain range encircling the royal castle, a dungeon 70 meters underground, completed a century ago, lay hidden. Known as the Labyrinth of Darkness, it was once the hideout of the archmage Viltor Arcane who once dominated the world.\nArcane, someone who excelled in dark magic, frequently clashed with various nations until he mysteriously vanished 40 years ago after a certain incident.\nAt that time, Arcanes mage rank was an unofficial third grade.\nUpon reaching or exceeding third grade, one is bestowed with the title of an archmage, regardless of official or unofficial status.\nA mages grade is determined by their achievements and renown, managed through a special scoring system by the Magic Association.\nFor example, achieving 1,000 points from achievements and fame is required to ascend from 10th to 9th grade. To rise from 4th to 3rd grade, a staggering 280 million points are necessary.\nThis means a third-grade mage has accumulated achievements and renown beyond ordinary comprehension.\nA Grade-A dangerous dungeon eradication earns 500 achievement points, and a royal summon to meet the king earns 100 fame points. Considering these, one can guess how much Arcane stirred the world.\n40 years ago, at the age of 89, Arcane reached the rank of an unofficial third-grade mage. His score at the time was 100 million points for achievements and 180 million for fame.\nHis fame surpassed his achievements because he was a troublemaker who turned the continent upside down.\nBanned experiments were just the start; he formed dark organizations, spawning anarchists, causing national upheavals.\nPeople over seventy tremble at the mention of Arcane, a testament to his infamy, which is clear even without mentioning the 280 million points.\nPhew.\nWithin a crystal tube filled with green liquid, Arcane opened his eyes. Bare and wrinkled, his 149-year-old body was a testament to his age.\nFinally finally, its complete, the essence of darkness.\nIt was the dark power he had gathered for 40 years. Arcane planned to absorb it to reclaim his past glory.\nHumans age and die because their cells reach a replication limit. But Arcane suppressed cell division using a life support system.\nGlancing at the crystal on his desk, initially diamond-like but now turned pitch black, he had accumulated the dark power with daily Injection Magic.\nAlpheas, wait for me! I will repay this humiliation.\nAfter suffering a critical injury from a young Alpheas, Arcanes magic power rapidly declined.\nBut surviving on revenge, Arcane was about to regain his past power and rise once again as an archmage.\nAs the green liquid in the life support device drained, Arcanes frail body bent. He looked old enough to be encased in the tube.\nThe front of the crystal tube opened, and Arcane crawled out, gasping for air.\nCanis! Arin! Are you there?\nTwo young-looking children entered, their demeanor somber, likely due to their dark magic training.\nDid you call for us, Master?\nClothes. Bring me my clothes.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 75: The Return of the ArchMage (1)\nCanis brought over a pale green robe. Despite Arin's gaze, Arcane changed into his clothes without hesitation.\nLeaning on the table for support, Arcane managed to take a few steps and finally caught his breath after sitting down.\nPhew, I finally feel alive again.\nAre you alright, Master? Canis asked, concerned. The contrast between his pale skin and the dark circles under his eyes showed his identity as a dark mage without saying a word.\nSuch fascinating eyes. Thats why I chose him as my apprentice.\nOn the other hand, Arcane wasnt particularly fond of Arin. Despite her apparent talent, evident from her black hair and eyes, she seemed too timid and lacked discernment.\nHer pretty face showed no trace of malice, and her large, expressive eyes revealed her emotions too easily.\nSeeing her shaking pupils ever since she saw the old man's naked body, Arcane clicked his tongue in annoyance.\nTsk, tsk, what use is such a frail girl? If not for being Canis's close friend, I wouldn't have bothered with her.\nIt was seven years ago.\nDespite using the life support device, Arcane, impaired in mobility, mustered his last strength to enter the capital city of Bashuka.\nAs expected of the largest city in the Thormia Kingdom, the streets were affluent and splendid. However, the underside of this luminosity was a continuation of the miserable lives of those abandoned by the city.\nThe slum of Radum.\nTrue to the extreme polarization of the capital, the residents of Radum led even more wretched lives compared to beggars in other cities.\nTheir only means of obtaining food in this forsaken place was rummaging through trash bins. Even this was fiercely competitive, leading to murders over a fishbone.\nArcane found Canis and Arin in this hellhole.\nIn Radum, where everyday life was a battlefield, ten-year-old Canis had managed to survive along with Arin by becoming ruthless.\nCanis's eyes burned with resentment towards the world.\nArcane liked that look. He took them to his dungeon and taught them dark magic.\nMy judgment was right. That one is a true gem.\nArcane, refusing the support of Canis, stood up. He did not want to show weakness on the day he was escaping the clutches of aging.\nWatch closely, the grandeur of dark magic.\nHolding the black crystal, Arcane closed his eyes. Despite his trembling hands due to weakness, his face radiated undeniable excitement.\nKaah!\nWith a forceful yell, the crystal softened and wrapped around Arcane like a stream of water. Then, dispersing like dark clouds, it enveloped his entire body.\nKaaaaah!\nArcane let out a monstrous scream. Absorbing the power he had accumulated over 40 years in one go, an ordinary person would have lost their mind by now.\nThe concept of dark magic involves absorption and assimilation.\nArcane regained his past strength by assimilating the dark power he had absorbed into the crystal with his own darkness.\nUooooh!\nThe shadow beneath Arcane flared up like flames, then detached from his body, scattering like fragments.\nAfter some time had passed, Canis and Arin slowly opened their eyes. Not a trace of Arcane's previous frailty could be seen.\nHis appearance hadn't become younger or his back straighter, but his complexion was now rosy, and his eyes brimmed with vitality.\nFeeling the overwhelming aura of their rejuvenated master, Canis trembled with emotion.\nIs this Master Arcane's true form? I had heard rumors, but this is truly remarkable.\nPleased with himself, Arcane grinned. He had regained the strength he had before Alpheas dealt him a crippling blow.\nLet's go. From today, Arcane's history will be rewritten.\nWaiting 40 years for this day, Arcane left the dungeon without taking a moment to relish his newfound power.\nThe guards couldn't move their bodies. When Arcane waved his hand, the guards, despite their will, turned against each other, thrusting their spears at their comrades.\n\"Ah! Are you crazy? Its dangerous!\"\n\"I don't know! I'm not doing this!\"\nArin's face turned pale. Born with different eyes from others, she unfilteredly absorbed the terror of the guards.\n\"Canis, Master never said he would come to such a place.\"\nCanis was equally perplexed. However, his trust in Arcane remained unshaken.\n\"There must be some reason. Let's just follow for now.\"\nArcane effortlessly breached the battlefield and headed towards the building. The shadow that had connected him to the guards snapped, and the fighting men foamed at the mouth and collapsed.\nDark magic's signature trait is mind control.\nDarkness merges with other darkness. This characteristic is exploited to infiltrate others' shadows to control their bodies and thoughts.\nAt first glance, the nature of dark magic seems overpowering.\nBut the reason it's considered a minor branch lies in one major flaw - its vulnerability to light.\nDuring the day when the sun is up, darkness can only exist as a mere shadow. Moreover, more mental power is needed to cast dark magic under bright light.\nOf course, the prowess of a dark mage maximizes at night, but even that advantage has been diminishing with the popularization of the theory of photonization developed by the genius Kergos.\nIn magic schools across the continent, students specializing in dark magic are almost nonexistent, reflecting the disdain for the dark arts in the magical community.\nHowever, Canis knew that Arcane had perfectly overcome the shortcomings of dark magic. The supreme essence he had realized was wholly imparted to Canis.\n'I must trust Master. He has given me everything.'\nBreaking into the prison, Arcane handled additional guards in the hallway before entering the cell block A-3, where the prisoners were detained. Sensing the incident, the prisoners banged on their bars with their food containers.\n\"Hey! Whoever you are, let us out!\"\n\"Look here! Open this damned door! I'll make it worth your while! Or I can kill someone for you, if you prefer!\"\nArcane slowly extended his hands. The bleak environment of the prison was an ideal stage for him to showcase the extent of his dark magic.\n\"The Might of Darkness.\"\nShadows cast along the corridor morphed into hand shapes and popped out in 3D. Hundreds of these hands gripped the bars and tugged, twisting the metal. As the prisoners backed against the wall in fear, the bars along the corridor were successively ripped off.\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\nThe Might of Darkness was a spell that manipulated shadows absorbed from surrounding energy as if they were limbs. A single shadow could barely lift a pebble, but hundreds working in unison displayed enough strength to easily uproot prison bars.\nAs the doors opened and time passed, the prisoners gingerly emerged, heavy iron balls attached to their ankles.\n\"Whats this? Are you a mage? Quite extraordinary.\"\n\"Anyway, thanks. Let's introduce ourselves. I'm the Night Cat Crown, known in these parts.\"\nArcane, sensing the pitiful aura of the prisoners, frowned in disgust. Inferno used to be different 40 years ago, filled with the most heinous criminals. How had it degenerated to this?\n'Times really have changed. Does it mean living standards have improved?'\nAccording to Arcane, as civilization advances, the quality of criminals declines. More con artists with clever schemes emerge, and the truly evil infiltrate society.\n\"Pathetic fools. Do criminals do self-introductions now? Just because the bars are gone, do you think you can leave this place?\"\n\"Whats with this old man? Gone senile? You know who I am?\"\nThe prisoners boasted in numbers. Just because they shared a prison didn't mean they were allies.\n\"Listen up, fools. If you don't have the confidence to take me down, stay in your cell. Disobey me, and you'll suffer the pain of broken bones.\"\nThe prisoners burst into laughter.\n\"Hahaha! Whats this old guy on about? Came all this way and now you think we'll just go back?\"\n\"Let's trample him! Time to leave this wretched prison!\"\nIn their excitement of regaining freedom, the prisoners charged without heed. But soon, they realized they were still shackled at the ankles.\n\"Ah? What! Damn it!\"\nThe prisoners began to panic. Arcane, watching their pathetic state, snorted.\nA true criminal either has the skills or the brains. But these were just parasites, feasting off the prison's food.\n\"The Might of Darkness.\"\n\"Ah, what is this?\"\nThe hands that had torn off the bars now wrapped around the prisoners and pulled them into the darkness. Like being buried in a giant gel, their eyes, noses, and mouths disappeared under the black veil.\nAfter a while, the sound of breaking bones was heard.\n\"Ugh, ugh!\"\n\"Arrrgh!\"\nThe prisoners, unable to scream with their mouths sealed, could only groan.\nHearing the eerie sounds, Arin shivered and said to Canis, \"Do we really need to go to such lengths for revenge?\"\n\"Arin, questioning the Master is like doubting ourselves.\"\n\"But still...\"\n\"Forgot what happened in Radum? Worse things happened there. And these prisoners are no different from those who tormented us in Radum.\"\n\"But we promised to forget everything that happened in Radum. To be happy from now on.\"\n\"Its not over yet. We can't find happiness until Master's grudge is settled.\"\nAs the darkness dissipated, the prisoners lay twisted in agony.\nArcane, looking down on them with contempt, muttered, \"Weaklings. Was this a waste of time? Or will the other blocks be any better?\"\nThere were 320 criminals in Inferno. Perhaps this block was particularly full of lowlifes.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 76: The Return of the ArchMage (2)\nClank, clank.\nWhile mulling over these thoughts, the sound of chains echoed from a cell at the end of the corridor. A man resembling a wolf appeared, catching the interest of the archmage.\nHe was different from those who rushed out of their cells without a thought. Moreover, the man was restrained not only with shackles but also handcuffs, which the archmage found appealing.\nStill one more left, eh? Did you hide your presence? Your Schema is quite impressive.\nThe man, after glancing at the fallen prisoners, let out a resigned laugh.\nHeh, unbelievable. Do you know where you are? This is Inferno, the western prison. Planning a rebellion, are you?\nRebellion? Sounds like fun. Will you join?\nThe man nonchalantly shrugged.\nIf it gets me out, why not?\nYou must have heard, even if you didn't see. There's no freedom unless you can defeat me.\nThe man sighed, lifting his arms constrained by handcuffs to scratch his head. His eyes, peeking through his forearms, shone sharply as he suddenly leaped forward.\nHis jump, overcoming the weight of the iron balls due to his impressive Schema, resulted in a direct hit to the archmages face with the iron ball.\n\"Master!\"\nBoom!\nLanding with a surprised expression, the man bent his knees. Making such a sound from hitting a person was unexpected.\n\"Annoying magic.\"\nThe archmage remained unfazed. The side of his face hit by the iron ball was covered in a dark shadow, thanks to his Dark Skin magic that maximized the absorption of impact with dark magic.\n\"Not bad. You pass.\"\nThe archmage cast the Might of Darkness. Shadows rising from the ground gripped the man's shackles and handcuffs.\n\"Don't move. You might lose limbs.\"\nBefore the man could reply, the shadows formed into blades and spun rapidly, cutting off the chains without harming his skin. This was the essence of dark magic limitless shape-shifting and delicate manipulation.\n\"Freedom suits you. Follow me. There's work to be done.\"\n\"Whats this about? I never said Id join.\"\nThe man's smiling lips twitched slightly.\nHe knew the extent of his opponent's strength. But being dragged along like a cow would defeat the purpose of his escape.\n\"Money moves you, doesn't it? Help me, and you'll earn a fortune.\"\nMages being wealthy was common knowledge.\nMoreover, the man was someone who would do anything for money, so there was no reason to decline.\n\"Heh, big money, huh? If the amount is mediocre, Ill quit halfway.\"\nWith that, the man followed the archmage out of the prison. And thus, Inferno had one escapee.\nShirone's group rented an inn after gathering and organizing materials from the library. Two days of intense discussion helped them grasp the concept of the Photon Cannon.\n\"Why does mass exist?\"\nWithout mass, nothing changes. A world where today is the same as yesterday isn't necessarily bad, is it?\nYet, mass existed from the beginning. As if the world was meant to be filled with new events.\n\"Mass isnt weight. Weight is the force acting in the direction of gravity. Theres no direction in space. So, what is mass? Cohesion? But that doesnt seem to fully explain it.\"\nNade asked,\n\"Then what do you think it is?\"\nThe feeling was clear, but not distinct.\n\"Existence.\"\n\"Eh?\"\n\"The proof that it exists in this space. Maybe thats what mass is?\"\nLife is a code unique to living beings. Maybe mass is the true proof of existence for the entire universe.\n\"Hmm, sounds plausible. Like the will or breath of the creator.\"\nInspired by Nade's words, Yiruki snapped his fingers.\n\"Particle of God.\"\n\"Eh? What?\"\n\"The Particle of God. Isnt it good? Let's call the particle discovered by Shirone the Particle of God.\"\n\"Oh, not bad. Shirone, what do you think?\"\nShirone nodded repeatedly. It felt as if the term wasn't just made up by Yiruki, but rather it perfectly fit what he sensed.\n\"I like it. And this is important.\"\n\"Right. A mage's omnipotence is connected to feelings. Its best to use a name that resonates with you.\"\nIn that sense, the Particle of God was an excellent choice.\nAs the discussion wound down, Yiruki flopped onto the bed, tired from a day of studying.\n\"Phew, let's finish the analysis and return to school tomorrow. With classes resuming the day after, lets be mentally prepared. Surely you havent forgotten the promise?\"\nNade joined in,\n\"Of course. Climbing to class four this semester. We'll study like crazy now. Worst case, Shirone might graduate before us.\"\nThat might be possible.\nWhat started as a joke was now a serious possibility on their faces.\nShirone could graduate first, given the significance of discovering the Particle of God.\n\"Shirone, you dont plan to stay another year after graduating, do you?\"\n\"Ha! What are you saying? In the current situation, Im the most likely to break the promise. At least you guys are in the top ranks.\"\nThough Shirones comment wasnt wrong, the pace of his growth was enough to cause alarm. A student who didn't even know the Four-Way Formation six months ago was now contemplating graduation.\n\"Ill study some more before sleeping.\"\n\"What? Then, me too!\"\nAs Yiruki got up to study, Nade also took a spot at the table to begin.\nEven if the world ends tomorrow, they'd rather study and play. Seeing his friends burning with scholarly passion, Shirone was touched.\n'I've made good friends.'\nShirone was the last to open a book.\nThe Kingdom's Educational and Academic Association of Teachers.\nThe academic conference organized by the Association brought together professionals from all fields related to society and culture, including magic and swordsmanship schools, various religious orders, academic institutions, the Alchemy Foundation, and the elite group of 99 Artists. It was a venue where they all gathered to present visions for the kingdom.\nThadd attended as a representative of the Alpheas Magic Academy. The ongoing discussion on the pros and cons of rote education was driving him insane.\n\"Darn it. Don't these people ever sleep? Let's just go home.\"\nHe had reluctantly attended due to a draw but despised it thoroughly. Having been a notorious troublemaker since his school days, Thadd believed education had nothing to do with him, whether it was formal or informal.\nThe only consolation was the presence of attractive female teachers. Particularly, a woman sitting at the opposite round table caught his eye, with her wavy blue hair and playful nature evident even in formal attire.\n\"She's quite something. Reina Ogent, was it?\"\nA musician affiliated with the prestigious group of 99 Artists and a disciple of the Melodist Merhen, she attended as a guest artist.\nThe conference ended at 7 PM.\nAs the evening party hosted by the Association began, the heat of the discussions disappeared like a lie. Participants mingled, sipping wine and networking with peers from various fields.\nAround Reina, particularly, were high-profile individuals, even recognizable to those indifferent to the Association.\n\"Poor beauty, always surrounded,\" Thadd thought as he waited for his turn to speak with her, overhearing their mostly authoritative or mischievous conversations.\nReina responded kindly to everyone with a friendly smile, which surprised Thadd. Her cheerful nature seemed at odds with the infamous reputation of the 99 Artists.\nArt is a skill of handling emotions and thus wields influence over the public that even the powerful can't ignore.\nMany artists, given the critical nature of art, were stubborn, but Reina appeared to be an exception, pleasantly mingling with people from all walks of life.\n\"If only Siena could be half as approachable as her.\"\nWhile sipping wine with these thoughts, Reina, having finished her conversation, approached Thadd.\n\"Hello, Mr. Thadd.\"\n\"Oh, yes! Wait, do you know me?\"\n\"Of course. You're a teacher at the Alpheas Magic Academy. The Ogent family's main house is in Creas.\"\n\"Oh, right. I forgot about that. Nice to meet you.\"\nTheir shared hometown brought a familiar warmth to their conversation, and they talked for a long time. As Thadd had guessed, Reina was lively and fun.\n\"How is Shirone doing?\"\n\"Shirone? How do you know... Oh, right.\"\nRecalling Shirones test, where he had written the Ogent family as his guardian, Thadd remembered.\n\"Shirone was a guest of the Ogent family. Indeed, a noble family with a keen eye for talent. He's doing well, although he recently got into a bit of trouble.\"\n\"Trouble? What kind of trouble?\"\nReinas wide-eyed reaction made Thadd regret his words. Learning that a student sponsored by the Ogent family was under suspension could bruise her pride.\n\"Ahaha! Nothing serious. Hes just such an outstanding student that even minor things get blown out of proportion.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\"\nReina sighed in relief. From Thadd's description, she could imagine Shirone's life.\n\"It's good to hear he's doing well. Does he have many friends?\"\n\"Absolutely. Popular with both boys and girls. Sometimes I even get jealous. Hahaha!\"\n\"Really? Then, maybe...\"\nReina paused, about to ask if he had a girlfriend, but shook her head. It was a legitimate question for a patron, but the inquirer in her heart wasn't just using the patron's name.\n\"Something on your mind?\"\n\"No, its just good to know he's well.\"\n\"Haha! Dont worry. I may be biased, but Alpheas is a prestigious school. You can trust us with his care.\"\n\"Huhu, right. I was overstepping, sorry.\"\n\"No, not at all. In fact, I've been presumptuous. How about joining me on a trip to Creas? I'm leaving in the morning. I'd love to treat you to lunch.\"\nReina politely declined with a hint of regret.\n\"Sorry, I have a concert schedule and need to return to Bashuka.\"\n\"Oh, thats unfortunate...\"\nThadd couldn't hide his disappointment. Usually, he'd let go easily, but she was a rare find.\n\"Cant help it. But I'd love to see your concert. Could you let me know the schedule? I'll come to Bashuka.\"\n\"My, I'm flattered. Actually, I was worried. With the recent unrest in the capital, I feared many seats might be empty.\"\n\"Unrest in Bashuka?\"\n\"An attack by a dark mage at Inferno, freeing a B-class fugitive. The capital is almost under martial law now.\"\n\"A dark... mage?\"\nThadd's brow furrowed. It could be just another news story, but upon reflection, it was a rare occurrence.\nDark mages were scarce in modern times. And why attack Inferno, just for a B-class fugitive?\nDark mage, Inferno, B-class fugitive.\nA scene from history flashed through Thadd's mind.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 77: The Return of the ArchMage (3)\nCan we get more details about the situation?\nThe incident happened a week ago. The escapee's name is Lucas, a former deputy head of the Parrot Thieves' Guild. The leader of the guild is still wanted.\nBesides the escapee, do we know anything about the person who attacked Inferno?\nWell, I only heard rumors. They say it was an old man with snow-white hair. I think there were two accomplices. They used dark magic to free the prisoners. What was it called again... something of darkness...\nMight of Darkness?\nYes, that's it! You really are a teacher from a magic academy.\nAlthough Reina complimented him, Thadd didnt hear it. His mind was occupied with thoughts of a senior dark mage attacking Inferno using an advanced technique like Might of Darkness.\nCould it be?\nThadd suddenly looked up.\nExcuse me, I must go now.\nHuh? Oh, okay.\nHis polite departure was almost instinctual. Thadd's eyes no longer saw the party or the beautiful women around him.\nDamn it! Of all times, when Im away!\nThe breakout was a week ago. Even traveling non-stop from Bashuka, he could have already reached Creas with time to spare.\nA carriage! I need a carriage!\nExiting the estate, Thadd hopped into the first carriage he saw in line. He opened the driver's window and shouted.\nTo Creas, as fast as possible!\nS-sir, all these carriages are booked for high-ranking officials. We cannot take passengers not on the list\nThese were carriages meant for high-ranking officials, unlikely to be swayed by a regular sum.\nThadd rummaged through his belongings and pulled out all his money.\nHere! Take it. Will you go or not?\nThe coachman, after counting the scattered gold coins, immediately changed his expression and prepared for departure.\nWe'll get there as quickly as possible. Shall we drive through the night?\nNo need for rest or sleep! Just go as fast as you can!\nThe sound of horse hooves rhythmically beat against the night air.\nDamn it! I hope I'm not too late.\nLeaning back, Thadd pressed his forehead. He wished he could leap through space, but in unfamiliar territory, the risk was too high, even for him.\nHelplessness brought back his composure. As he pieced the situation together, questions arose.\nWhat could be the purpose behind his return to the world?\nThadd had never met him or seen his face. But the dreadful connection he had heard from Alpheas remained vivid in his memory.\nViltor Arcane\nHis eyes ablaze, he stared straight ahead.\n* * *\nJust past 4 AM, Canis's group entered the training grounds halfway up the mountain at Alpheas Magic Academy.\nThough they had never attended a magic academy, being disciples of an archmage, they recognized the quality of the facilities.\nA frivolous voice broke the silence.\nWow, this place is well-built. Like it's lined with gold. I wonder how much the land is worth?\nCanis frowned and turned away. Lucas, a B-grade wanted criminal and a member of the Parrot Thieves' Guild, was carrying twin swords engraved with a parrot, lazily slung over his shoulder.\nKeep it down. Guards might be patrolling.\nWhat are you worried about? We'll just kill them or bury them.\nCanis grew more irritated. Although following the master's orders, he found nothing likable about this man.\nYou're misunderstanding something. You're hired by us. If you cause any trouble, I won't let you off easily.\nHeh, the young ones are so bold these days. They even talk back to adults.\nLucas flopped down in the training field. As he was no longer interfering with the plan, Canis suppressed his anger.\nThe most important thing is the master's revenge. I'll have to tolerate him, no matter how unpleasant.\nBy the way, why are we waiting here? We'll eventually have to go down to the academy.\nArin expressed her disgust.\nMaster is about to cast a spell. It's a wide-area magic, so we'll be in danger if we're within its range. You're welcome to go down first if you're confident.\nLucas shrugged. He certainly didnt want to face Arcane's magic.\nHeh, dont be so angry, little lady. You look cuter when you're not mad.\nHmph, what others look like is none of my business.\nThen how about dating this old man? I can teach you something even more exciting than magic.\nAs Arin, blushing, was about to scream, Canis cut in.Quiet. It's starting.\nTheir gazes turned skyward. Arcane was floating in the center of the moon, casting Fly magic.\nFly, a fusion magic from the Air category, combines Press and Blow. First, it forms a solid air pressure using Press magic, then generates lift with Blow magic. Though classified as overpowered due to the merit of flight, it requires delicate sensation due to constantly changing winds.\nAs darkness gathered and obscured the moon, Arcane, concentrating, opened his eyes wide. Combining omniscience and omnipotence, he spread his arms wide and cast his life's masterpiece, Abyss Nova.\nThere was no thunderous noise or violent aftermath, but the sight of dark energy enveloping the academy was magnificent.\nAs the effects of Abyss Nova spread beyond the academy and dissipated, revealing the moon and brightening the surroundings, Arcane sighed deeply.\nArcane gasped for breath. Even for an archmage like him, the massive spell Abyss Nova consumed almost 90% of his mental energy.\n'It will be hard to recover from this for a while.'\nHe changed direction and headed towards the mountain. Maintaining the Fly magic was difficult, but his anger grew stronger.\n'With Abyss Nova spread, no one can stop me now. Besides, havent I prepared my disciples for such situations?'\nHahaha, wait for me, Alpheas. I will make you taste the humiliation you gave me 40 years ago.\nAs the dark night passed, the first light of dawn began to rise in the eastern mountainside.\nIt was the last day of their suspension. After studying till dawn at the inn, Shirone and his friends woke up well past morning. They bathed after teasing each other about their disheveled appearances.\nHaving returned the books to the library, they entered the academy just as lunchtime ended. The campus was quiet, with only a few janitors sweeping the stone paths.\nThat's it, our last day of 'vacation'.\nVacation? Since when is suspension a vacation?\nStill, we had fun, right? Whats next?\nAs Shirone turned towards the dormitory, he said, \"First, I need to clean my room. Classes start tomorrow, so I should tidy up today.\"\nYou're always so meticulous. Alright, then. We'll be in the research group, so come over if you get bored.\nSure. See you later.\nAfter parting with his friends, Shirone returned to his room. It was a mess since he hadnt been able to tidy it up during the presentation preparation period. He rolled up his sleeves and started cleaning, finishing by arranging his textbooks in order on the shelf.\nA week-long suspension that came without warning.\nHowever, it was a time of significant learning, perhaps even more than what he had learned at the academy so far.\n'Finally, regular classes again. I can't wait for tomorrow.'\nIt was natural that he was behind in his studies, and he planned to focus on classes, even if it meant reducing his research group activities.\n'Nade and Yiruki must be thinking the same.'\nTheir eyes burned with a zeal for learning at the inn. The clear goal of advancing to Class Four before the semester's end had inspired them.\nAlpheas Magic Academy sets the promotion criteria at the end of each semester based on midterm grades, with a cut-off line of at least 80% in every subject. It was a daunting standard - not an average of 80%, but 80% or more in each subject.\nWhile it was a challenging target, it was a solid policy from the academy. Before specializing, students were expected to have well-rounded knowledge in all areas.\nThus, graduates from the magic academy were well-equipped to use basic magic from each category, which was why they were favored in the magic society.\nNot all active mages graduated from magic academies. Some were disciples of mages, achieved enlightenment on their own, or learned magic through darker routes. Their strengths lay in practical experience and combat-ready magic, but they often lacked a deeper understanding of magic and had limited potential compared to academy graduates.\nWhether to hire academy graduates depended on the nature of the job, but they generally had an advantage in employment. The 80% standard set by the academy reflected the contemporary societal context.\nHah. So, in my case, I need to raise my average by at least 30 points.\nRegardless of his recent insights, this was still an academy. To advance, he needed a score above 80 in every subject.\nUsing the core of knowledge he had could make it possible. Moreover, the knowledge gained from preparing for the presentation and studying the Particle of God could significantly boost his score.\nYet, even considering these factors, the probability of advancing seemed to be around 30%.\nIsn't that impressive, though? A 30% chance of advancing to Class Four in just six months.\nShirone thought positively. It was a chance worth taking. The thought of being left behind in Class Five while his friends advanced was unbearable.\nAdvancing to Class Four would also open the possibility of applying for the advanced class. That would mean keeping his promise to Amy.\nAh! Right, Amy!\nHe hadnt seen her since the presentation. In his excitement back then, he hadnt even thought to look for her.\nI was too thoughtless. Amy was always a supportive friend during challenging times.\nDetermined to be there for her this time, Shirone left his room with a playful twinkle in his eye.\nHehe! Shell be so surprised!\n* * *\nShirone, carrying two cups of coffee, headed towards the advanced class. One was for Amy, and the other for Sharelle. Memories of running coffee errands for Amy made him smile wryly.\nBack then, I thought the world was ending.\nIt was an ironic relationship. Who would have thought the troublesome girl he met in an alley at twelve would become a friend?\nHe climbed the hill to the advanced class. The massive structure, known as the Steel Gate, loomed at the entrance. It looked even larger up close than from a distance.\nThis is the pinnacle of the magic academy.\nWalking under the structure symbolizing the spirit of a mage, Shirone felt a solemn reverence.\nAs the sixth period ended, the students of the advanced class began to emerge. Shirone spotted Amy and Sharelle chatting at the main entrance and shouted, Amy! Amy!\nThe students turned their heads, but Amy and Sharelle didnt seem to hear and continued their conversation. Seizing the opportunity for a prank, Shirone quietly approached from behind and presented the coffee right in front of Amy.\nTa-da! A surprise gift!\nAmys eyes widened in surprise. Shirone grinned and offered a cup to Sharelle as well.\nHere, for you too, senior. Enjoy!\nSharelle tilted her head in confusion. Amy blinked a few times, then scrunched up her face and asked, Whats this? Who are you? Why are you giving us coffee?\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 78: The Uninvited Guest of the Darkness (1)\nShirone thought Amy was just playing along with the joke.\n\"Sorry for startling you. I wanted to surprise you, so I didn't tell you I was coming. How are the classes in the advanced class?\"\nAmy showed a look of caution. When Shirone tried to come closer, she quickly hit his arm, sending the two cups of coffee flying.\nShirone stood with a dumbfounded expression. This reaction was too serious to be considered a joke. Amy's face too had turned red in genuine anger.\n\"Who are you to do this? And why are you speaking informally to me while calling Sharelle 'senior'?\"\nSharelle also seemed annoyed.\n\"You're not from the advanced class, right? Even if you're interested, this kind of approach is not right, don't you think? And you should use honorifics when speaking to seniors. What is this? Not even a playboy behaves like this.\"\nShirone was completely taken aback. Amy and Sharelle were acting as if they didn't know him at all.\n\"Senior Sharelle, it's me, Shirone. Don't you remember me? Amy, do you really not recognize me? Are you just joking?\"\n\"How would I know you? If you're a student, please focus on your studies. Can't you differentiate between appropriate times and places? Do I look that easy?\"\nAmy grabbed Shirone's collar, truly irritated. She thought she would be free from annoying boys in the advanced class, but to have one follow her here...\n'Just when it was getting quiet, it started again. This is all because of that guy. Hanging out with weird kids and causing trouble...'\nAs Amy was muttering to herself, she paused.\n'Wait? That guy? Who is that?'\nShe felt like some male figure was involved in the reason why those bothersome male students had backed off, but she couldn't remember who.\nShirone, still gripped by the collar, felt like his heart had been pierced. There was no warmth in Amy's eyes.\n\"No... This can't be happening.\"\nShirone shook off Amy's hand gripping his collar.\n\"No! Don't lie!\"\n\"Ouch.\"\nAmy winced, holding her wrist in pain, but Shirone shouted as if he hated even the sight of her.\n\"Why are you pretending not to know me! What did I do wrong? If you don't like me, just say it! It's unfair to treat me like this!\"\n\"You! Get out of here!\"\nSharelle pushed Shirone away. Unable to resist Sharelle, Shirone stumbled and fell.\n\"Why are you making life difficult for my friend? And that too, in front of a senior! Which class are you from? Do you really want to be scolded?\"\nShirone looked up at her with a face that seemed to have lost everything.\n'Senior Sharelle...'\nAmy's inseparable friend. Always among the top with excellent skills, yet a girl who would cry over romance novels. Shirone remembered it all. Her supportive presence during his difficult challenges.\nBut now, she seemed like a completely different person. Her eyes burned with hostility, and her tightly pursed lips were filled with animosity.\nShirone shook his head. It wasn't that he couldn't believe it; he didn't want to. Such a thing was impossible.\n\"No! It's a lie!\"\nShirone rushed away, feeling like he would go insane if he stayed any longer.\n\"Don't ever come back! If you mess around like this again, I'll tell the teacher!\"\nSharelle made a horn with her hands to amplify her voice. Still seething with anger, she turned to Amy.\n\"Ugh, what's with that guy? He looks innocent but is so persistent. Oh, Amy, are you okay?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, I'm fine.\"\nAmy, who had been lost in thought, quickly snapped back to reality. However, the feeling of unease remained. She felt an odd sense of longing as she watched Shirone leave.\n\"Who is he, really? He acts like he knows me.\"\n\"It's probably just some crazy act. There are a lot of kids like that these days. They aim high without any shame.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"Well, Im going to head in. Hey, I was looking forward to catching up with you after so long, but that weird kid ruined our break.\"\nEven though they were in the same advanced class, their different majors made it hard to find time to catch up.\nAfter Sharelle entered the classroom, Amy followed. But as she stepped into the entrance, she looked back towards where Shirone had run off.\n\"......\"\nShe stood there until the bell rang for the end of the break.\n'Why are they doing this! What's the reason?'\nShirone ran frantically. As he arrived at the advanced class building, the bell for class rang, and students started entering their classrooms.\n\"Mark! Mark!\"\nMark, who was chatting with Maria, turned around. Shirone rushed to him and asked desperately.\n\"Mark! You know me, right? Who am I! Tell me quickly!\"\nMark looked perplexed, glancing at Maria. But even Maria shrugged, indicating she didnt know.\n\"Um... who are you?\"\nShirone's heart started racing uncontrollably. He couldn't comprehend what was happening to him.\n\"It's me. Shirone! Class Five! We took the teleportation test together, remember? You really don't know?\"\nMark frowned. However, he couldnt argue with the mention of Class Five and politely bowed.\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.\"\n\"That's not it! Why are you treating me like this!\"\nWhat did they want him to do? He wanted to retaliate, but the presence of others held him back.\n\"You students, classes have started, why arent you in your rooms?\"\nSiena was walking down the corridor. Shirone, feeling like he had found a savior, rushed to her.\n\"Teacher! It's me, Shirone!\"\nSiena, being a certified 6th-grade mage, would surely remember him. But her response was cruelly dismissive.\n\"Shirone? There's no student by that name in the class. Who are you?\"\n\"Teacher, don't you remember me? I'm Shirone.\"\nSiena tried to recall but found the name and face unfamiliar.\n\"It seems there's some mistake. I haven't heard of any new students. Are you really from our academy?\"\nMark and Maria's gazes turned sharp. Suddenly viewed as suspicious, Shirone felt a surge of fear.\n\"I-I'm sorry! I made a mistake!\"\n\"Hey! Stop right there!\"\nIgnoring Siena's call, Shirone fled desperately. He now had a dreadful suspicion of what had happened.\nEveryone had forgotten him.\n\"Sob, sob...\"\nHe felt like a lost child, utterly vulnerable. Everything in the world seemed frightening.\nEntering Estas, Shirone wandered aimlessly before finally reaching the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\n'My friends should be fine. They have to be, right?'\nHadn't they been joking around just hours ago? Even if the whole world forgot him, they should remember.\nEntering the room, he saw Nade and Yiruki chatting, who then looked at him in surprise.\n\"Nade, Yiruki, it's me. Shirone.\"\nHis friends simply blinked, not responding. Shirone's emotions crumbled.\n\"Why aren't you saying anything? You remember me, right? You haven't forgotten me?\"\nNade looked at Yiruki, then approached Shirone, scratching his head.\n\"Um... who are you?\"\nTears welled up in Shirone's eyes.\n\"Don't you really know me? We were together until just now. We studied together yesterday and the day before!\"\n\"Sorry, but we don't know you. Are you spying for another research group? Stop causing trouble and leave.\"\nYiruki suddenly exclaimed.\n\"Wait! Maybe that's possible. How did you find Estas? Speak up! Who are you?\"\n\"You, you guys...\"\nShirone's lower lip quivered. Unable to hold back tears, he broke down.\n\"Pfft...\"\nNade let out a snicker, then burst into laughter.\n\"Hahaha! Did you see that face? This is a masterpiece!\"\n\"Saw it! Saw it! He looked so scared, saying 'you, you guys...' Hahaha! Shirone, what did you plan to make us laugh?\"\nNade, holding his aching stomach, chuckled.\n\"Hehehe, hehehehe! Ah, this is killing me! Why would you do this... Hahaha!\"\nShirone was baffled, unable to grasp the situation.\n\"What, do you remember me?\"\n\"What nonsense? Did you have a nightmare or something? Your facial expression is hilarious! Hahaha!\"\nShirone felt utterly deflated. The heavy burden in his heart seemed to have finally rolled away.\n\"Hey, you should have said something! Why pretend not to know me?\"\n\"We were just joking around because your expression was too funny when you came in. You were like, 'It's me, Shirone.'\"\nNade mimicked Shirone, and Yiruki again fell to the floor laughing. Shirone, drained of energy to protest, sat down and covered his face with his hands.\n\"Whew, I thought I was going to die of fear.\"\n\"Sit down. What happened?\"\nSitting on the sofa, Shirone eagerly explained everything. At first, the others snickered, but when he mentioned Siena, they turned serious.\n\"Hmm, even Siena doesn't remember? It's hard to believe she would joke about this.\"\nNade was incredulous.\n\"Is that really possible?\"\n\"If it's a mental type of magic, it's possible. Though it's doubtful that someone could manipulate the memories of the entire academy.\"\n\"It's possible. I experienced it firsthand.\"\nYiruki calmed Shirone.\n\"Alright, calm down. We believe you. People have lost their memory of you.\"\nNade added.\n\"But we remember you. Maybe this is a clue to the situation?\"\n\"I think so too. The reason we remember Shirone might be that we've been away from the academy for two days. What happened while we were gone?\"\nThe group pondered. Could someone have manipulated the minds of the entire academy, including teachers, in their absence? It was a hard-to-believe assumption.\n\"A supernatural phenomenon, perhaps? There have been similar historical cases.\"\nYiruki was skeptical.\n\"Well, I think those cases are also related to magic. Anyway, if that's the case, how do we explain not losing our memory?\"\n\"Maybe because we were in Estas. We've been here since we parted with Shirone.\"\nShirone asked.\n\"What does Estas have to do with this?\"\n\"Estas has always been rumored to have mysterious powers.\nIt's just speculation, but we should consider all possibilities since our safety is involved.\"\nYiruki remarked.\n\"In other words, we might also lose our memories.\"\n\"It's a possibility we can't guarantee.\"\nSilence fell. The thought of losing memories was as troubling as being forgotten.\nNade bravely spoke up.\n\"Still... we should go out and see, right?\"\n\"Right, hiding won't solve anything.\"\nThe friends agreed, but Shirone, who had just faced a terrifying ordeal, wasn't enthusiastic.\n\"What if you guys forget me too? I might really go crazy then.\"\n\"Let's do this. We'll leave a mark beforehand. Even if we lose our memory, we can avoid the worst-case scenario.\"\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 79: The Uninvited Guest of the Darkness (2)\nNade picked up a pen and wrote something on his palm. His friends did the same, etching the words carefully.\n- I have lost my memory. Those who know the keyword can be trusted. The keyword is Polaris.\nSatisfied, Shirone and his group examined their palms. With this mark, even if they lost their memories, they would be able to cooperate.\n\"Alright, that should do it. Let's go out now.\"\nRegaining his confidence, Shirone exited Estas the Magic Warehouse.\nStudents were wandering the campus as classes ended. Looking around calmly, Shirone noticed several oddities. Normally, students would move in groups, but now they were all walking individually. More strangely, their movements seemed aimless and disorganized.\n\"Guys, look at those people\"\n\"I know. I feel it too. They're just wandering without a purpose.\"\nNade spotted Gabe, a classmate from Class Five.\n\"Hey, Gabe! Where are you heading?\"\nGabe approached them but responded as if meeting strangers for the first time.\n\"Who are you?\"\nNade was puzzled but quickly shifted his focus to the more pressing matter.\n\"Never mind that. Where are you going?\"\n\"Where am I going?\"\nNade, frustrated, pressed further.\n\"Youve been walking continuously. Where's your destination?\"\n\"My destination?\"\nGabe looked down at his legs as if realizing something. Suddenly, he looked around, bewildered.\n\"Where is this? What's my name?\"\nPanic-stricken, Gabe grasped at his head. Nade cautiously stepped back, ready for any sudden outburst. Thankfully, Gabe didn't become aggressive, only increasingly distressed.\n\"What's this noise? Why do I keep hearing these strange sounds!\"\nAs he shouted, his speech began to distort, eventually becoming incomprehensible.\nShirone's eyes shook with shock, realizing Gabe's condition. Yiruki, still unaware of the true nature of the sounds, listened intently.\n\"What noise? Are you hearing hallucinations?\"\nShirone, with a trembling voice, clarified.\n\"No, he's hearing his own voice.\"\n\"His own voice?\"\n\"He's lost the meaning of language. He's speaking habitually but without understanding. Naturally, its terrifying for him.\"\nGabe had completely lost his language structure, now sounding almost primal.\nShirone's group felt a chill. The speed of Gabe's mental degradation indicated that memories were fading rapidly.\nAs time passed, Gabe's voice subsided, his eyes lost their spark, and he eventually lost motor skills. Simultaneously, everyone on the streets froze.\nA haunting silence enveloped the Magic Academy, with everyone standing still like wax figures, devoid of movement.\n\"What on earth is happening?\"\n\"Anyway, we're unaffected. Although it's not something to be optimistic about, it does give us some room for further investigation.\"\nShirone examined the people around him. It felt like the world had stopped, similar to Armin's Stop Magic, but time was certainly moving. The occasional blinking of the people indicated they were not frozen.\n\"Their thoughts... have stopped.\"\nIf it were a kind of magic, it was more dangerous than Stop. It could pose a threat to others. In this state, even a child could harm everyone here.\nThe trio ventured further, conducting a few experiments. They tickled a junior, who burst into laughter, but soon returned to a rigid expression once they stopped. Threatening looks caused eyelids to flicker, proving that their nervous system was still active.\n\"Interesting. Only thoughts have halted. This could indicate physical limits. But why do this? What's the purpose?\"\n\"Before that, we need to find out who's responsible for this. Let's look around a bit more.\"\nShirone's group headed north to check if the seniors and teachers of the Advanced Class were in the same state.\nReaching the uphill path, they saw students from the Advanced Class streaming out of the Steel Gate arch.\nShirone's group hid in the bushes.\nThe movement of the Advanced Class students amidst the general immobility was reason enough for caution.\nAmong the crowd, they spotted unfamiliar facesa boy and girl around Shirone's age and a man, out of place with dual swords, clearly not belonging to the Magic Academy.\nLucas whistled nonchalantly, joking around.\n\"Wow, I've seen some dire scenes in my life, but this is a first. They've all turned into zombies, haven't they?\"\nAbyss Nova was a spell that blocked the memories of those exposed to it within 24 hours. Without memory, thinking became impossible, rendering it akin to a spell of petrification. The sequence of memory blockage started with the most recent and significant memories.\nIt was Arin's task to lead those whose memories had been blocked. Specialized in mental magic, she had led the Advanced Class students to the courtyard where Shirone's group had encountered Gabe.\n'Shadow of Capture.'\nThere, she cast another spell. Her shadow undulated like tentacles, threading through the shadows of the people around her.\nThis unique form, not present in the Four Way Formation, was a standard for mental mages known as the 'tentacle form.'\nThe tentacle form allowed for a finer and more flexible control of the Spirit Zone, compared to the Four Way Formation. However, it took considerably longer, requiring at least 20 minutes to pass through the shadows of all the Advanced Class students.\nWhile Arin worked, Lucas passed time by eyeing the female students. Their noble status evident in their pale skin and delicate fragrance. His snake-like gaze settled on a girl who caught his fancy.\n\"Look at this one.\"\nEven in her memory-lost state, the girl's eyes were clear. Her retro-styled hair, with red highlights, partially covered one eye, but her beauty was unmatched among the students.\n\"She looks feisty. I like wild women.\"\nJust as Lucas's hand reached out to Amy, Canis grabbed his shoulder, spinning him around.\n\"Lucas, stop it. Maintain some dignity.\"\n\"What? You're lecturing me now?\"\n\"Any foolish behavior will not be tolerated.\"\nLucas laughed derisively. Was the Parrot Thieves' Guild's reputation so diminished?\n\"What's the harm in having a bit of fun? I heard it's all for revenge anyway.\"\n\"This is revenge to reclaim our master's dignity. I will not tolerate vile acts.\"\n\"And what will you do if I don't comply? Fight here?\"\n\"I'll terminate the contract.\"\nLucas scoffed, stepping back. He knew all too well the risks of revealing aggression in the Spirit Zone.\n\"Fine. I won't do anything to miss out on my pay.\"\n\"Remember, if you interfere again, I won't hold back.\"\n\"Such fuss over a bit of fun. Where's our master anyway?\"\n\"Master is preparing something important. We're to handle this simple matter ourselves.\"\nArcane was currently hidden, recovering the mental energy expended casting Abyss Nova. Canis, however, chose to keep this information hidden.\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\nLucas turned away, his eyes briefly flaring with intensity.\n'He must be resting somewhere.'\nLucas understood the concept of equivalent exchange in magic. A spell that blocked the memories of hundreds was not something an ordinary mage could cast. Even an archmage would be significantly weakened for a while.\n'This charade won't last, kid. I won't miss this entertaining opportunity.'\nAs Arin finished her task, the Advanced Class and Advanced Class students began to move en masse. Shirone's group emerged from their hiding only after the crowd had dispersed. It seemed the intruders intended to take the entire school somewhere.\n\"Who are those people?\"\n\"No time to ponder. They might not do anything for a while, but once they reach their destination, anything could happen. And the teachers are captive too.\"\nShirone remarked.\n\"The magic that the girl cast looked like dark magic. Could this situation be their doing?\"\n\"It's unlikely. Such a large-scale spell requires an enormous Spirit Zone. Two are too young, and the third, armed, is likely not a mage.\"\n\"A third party involved, then?\"\n\"It seems so. Let's focus on tracking them. If danger arises, we can intervene.\"\n\"Controlling the Magic Academy... Madness, especially with dark magic...\"\nWith an ominous sense, Shirone's group followed the trail of the unwelcome visitors.\nEthella, dressed as she was the day before, remained in the training hall, motionless in meditation. Her eyebrows twitched, and her face contorted in agony. Clenching her teeth, her body shook violently.\nThe entire building vibrated with her, dust raining down. Suddenly, her eyes snapped open, and she fell forward, gasping for air.\n\"What was that?\"\nShe couldn't pinpoint it, but it was a form of dark magic that infiltrated the mind to block memories. Its malicious nature pushed Ethella's vigilance to the extreme. Had it not been for the Karsis Order's laws, she too would have lost her memories.\n'Dark magic in the academy?'\nChecking the time, she realized it was well past class hours.\n'I've been trapped by the evil spirit for over 12 hours?'\nConsidering Ethella's supreme mental fortitude, it was an incredibly powerful spell. What puzzled her more was that no one had come to check on her.\nShe wasn't the only target.\nWith this realization, Ethella rushed out of the hall without even changing her clothes.\nA flash streaked across the sky above the Magic Academy, then plummeted to the ground like a magnet. A man landed without a sound.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 80: The Uninvited Guest of the Darkness (3)\n\"Darn! Am I too late?\"\nRiding a carriage all night, Thadd arrived in Creas and immediately used Spatial Warp to reach the main gate. As expected, the guards were standing still, showing no reaction.\nIt was dark magic.\nAnd of an incredibly high level.\n'I need to find the headmaster first.'\nThadd turned towards the teachers' quarters. But before he could take ten steps, the distinctive sound of Spatial Warp echoed from the sky.\nAlert, Thadd entered his Spirit Zone at the same moment Ethella descended in a flash of light.\n\"Teacher Ethella! What's the situation?\"\nThadd, just back from a trip, seemed to know about the situation at the academy and questioned Ethella, who was surprised but quickly got to the point due to the urgency.\n\"It seems like dark magic. Everyone, students and teachers alike, have lost their memories.\"\nThough he had anticipated it, Thadd was astounded when faced with reality. It was madness to attack Alpheas Magic Academy, one of the five prestigious institutions of the kingdom.\n\"We don't have time. Please tell me the situation.\"\n\"From my Spirit Zone search, it seems all the students are climbing the mountain. It looks like they're heading towards The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed. There are three people leading them, and three others are tailing them. Among the teachers... it seems I'm the only one who managed to escape.\"\nEthella, a bishop of the Karsis Order, couldn't have been dominated by Arcane's dark magic. Thadd was relieved at least for that and explained what he knew.\n\"Let me brief you quickly. The perpetrator of this incident is Viltor Arcane, an archmage who caused chaos in the world 40 years ago.\"\n\"I've heard of him. But why would such a person target the magic academy...?\"\nThadd bit his lip. It was a delicate personal matter of Headmaster Alpheas. However, Ethella was the only one he could rely on now, and he trusted her character to accept it without prejudice.\n\"Viltor Arcane is, well, the teacher of Headmaster Alpheas.\"\nEthella blinked, but as Thadd expected, she didn't imagine anything beyond what she heard.\n\"I see. But it doesn't seem like Arcane is among those taking the students. We don't know the reason, but we should first rescue the students.\"\n\"We can't do that. As you felt, the magic magic is hard to counter. Trying to save the students one by one will likely lead to a counterattack.\"\n\"But we can't just leave them either.\"\n\"You said there are three people following them. Any idea who they might be?\"\n\"I couldn't confirm it for sure, but... it might be Shirone.\"\n\"Shirone?\"\nHearing Ethella's words, Thadd also recalled. The timing of Arcane's magic would be around 24 hours ago. The only student likely to be outside the academy at that time was Shirone's group, who were on suspension.\n\"I didn't see their faces, but judging by the temperament, it seemed like Shirone, Nade, and Yiruki.\"\n\"It must be them. Those kids will be fine for now. They're smart enough to know what to do. Better leave it to them while you, Teacher Ethella, please find Arcane.\"\n\"What are you planning to do, Teacher Thadd?\"\n\"I'll look for the headmaster. Finding the headmaster and lifting the dark magic is the priority.\"\nEthella nodded in agreement.\n\"Alright. I'll look for Arcane.\"\nThadd looked over the mountain ridge. The vast grounds of the magic academy made it difficult to guess where Arcane might be.\n\"With hundreds affected at once, this grand-scale magic must have significantly drained his mental strength. He's likely hiding in a secluded area. Searching around the mountain would be faster. What's the radius of your Spirit Zone in Zoner mode?\"\n\"About 2 kilometers in diameter.\"\nCalculating roughly, Thadd nodded.\n\"Marking about five points should do. Please patrol starting from the training grounds. I'll head to the academy.\"\n\"Alright. After I capture Arcane, I'll rescue the students.\"\n\"Don't push yourself too hard. Arcane is...\"\nThadd swallowed his words. Saying the opponent was strong would only fuel her sense of duty more. After all, who else to trust if not a bishop of the Karsis Order and a nationally recognized Zoner?\n\"No, thank you.\"\nFeeling a sense of responsibility as a disciple of Alpheas, Thadd respectfully bowed his head. Ethella, slightly smiling, shook her head modestly.\n\"I may not know the full story, but I'm a teacher of this academy too. I'll do my best for the students.\"\n\"Yes. Then...\"\nNow it was a race against time.\nThadd cast Spatial Warp and flew towards the academy, while Ethella took a deep breath and focused her mind.\nSequence Method accelerated as her Spirit Zone expanded. Only Zoners could extend their zone like this, enveloping everything within a 2-kilometer radius in her synesthesia.\n'First to Training Ground 26.'\nTransforming into a beam of light, Ethella flew towards the mountain peak, covering 1 kilometer with a single Spatial Warp.\nCanis and his group gathered those whose memories were blocked at the starting point of The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed.\nArin, having completed her task, looked pale. Even though she was under the influence of Abyss Nova, controlling the minds of hundreds of people was an immense labor.\nNade, observing Canis's group from the bushes, spoke up.\n\"Why this place? It's just a bridge and a cliff.\"\n\"I'm not sure. Maybe they're waiting for someone?\"\nYiruki, counting off on his fingers, suggested,\n\"Cliffs, mind control, villains. Considering these three elements, the answer seems obvious. They plan to throw them off the cliff.\"\n\"What? Why would they do such a crazy thing?\"\n\"Logically, it doesn't make sense. Dropping students off the cliff gains them nothing. But what if it's an emotional issue? Like hatred or revenge.\"\nShirone thought it made sense. Moreover, if they really intended to do such a thing, simply waiting wasn't the best approach.\n\"We should intervene before that situation arises. We might even have to fight.\"\nFor 10 minutes, nothing happened. The students and teachers, under mind control, just stood there blankly, while Canis and Arin looked beyond the cliff, waiting for their teacher.\n\"Is it really okay, Canis? We searched the entire academy and still couldn't bring Alpheas.\"\n\"We can't help it. Teacher told us to be especially careful around Alpheas. We just have to do what we can.\"\n\"Still... I feel like we might get scolded.\"\nCanis looked at Arin with annoyance.\n\"Arin. Our master is a good person. Don't worry; he won't scold us for this.\"\nHearing their conversation, Lucas started to get annoyed. He came along for the promise of a large sum, but didn't expect to conduct a terror attack on the entire magic academy.\nConsidering the mission's difficulty, even the advance payment he received was less. Moreover, Arcane was still nowhere to be seen, despite the promised time having passed long ago.\n\"Hey. When is your master coming? Did he run away, by any chance?\"\nIt was a massive event, targeting one of the top five prestigious academies of the kingdom. Considering most students were from noble families, the aftermath of this incident would be immense, even if it ended without incident. Even an archmage might have fled in fear.\n\"Don't casually judge our teacher. He's not someone you should be talking about.\"\n\"Ah, what nonsense.\"\nLucas scratched his head in irritation. Then, suddenly, he raised his head and glared at Canis with a look in his eyes never seen before.\n\"Do I look that easy to you?\"\nAs an overwhelming hostility surged, Arin, with her sensitive mental empathy, hastily retreated. In contrast, Canis remained calm. This kind of look was something he had experienced countless times in Radum.\n'Serpent Eyes?'\nA Schema technique that uses the gaze to target the brain and paralyze the central nervous system. It was a skill manifesting from practical experience and innate tendencies rather than training. The fact that Lucas could employ Serpent Eyes was indicative of the life he had led.\n\"No more kid gloves. From now on, you'd better watch your words. You talk about contracts, but it's you guys who are delaying things.\"\nCanis couldn't refute this time. Why wasn't their master coming? It was strange for someone who had been eagerly waiting for this day to be late.\nAs Canis remained silent and withdrew his fighting spirit, Lucas also relaxed his Serpent Eyes. After all, they were still a team for now, and importantly, he had yet to receive the rest of his payment.\n'I wasn't supposed to be part of this from the start.'\nLucas looked over those affected by Abyss Nova. Since their metabolism was normal, the time they could remain standing was running short. Those with weaker stamina would soon start collapsing, making things more complicated.\n\"Hey, why not just kill them now? It'll be troublesome if they faint. We can't pick them up and throw them off one by one.\"\nLucas was hired as a professional swordsman. While mages were suitable for reaping many lives, swordsmen were unmatched in dispatching survivors one by one. Eventually, as their stamina depleted, it would all fall to Lucas, so he wanted to reduce their numbers in advance.\n\"We can't do that until the teacher arrives. The core of the plan is to annihilate them all in front of Alpheas.\"\n\"Damn, then let's at least have some fun. They're all going to fall off the cliff anyway.\"\nCanis glared at him in disgust, but in the current situation, there was no reason to stop him. Born in Radum, he knew how dangerous a person like Lucas could be. Ultimately, Lucas would do what he wanted. It was infuriating.\n\"Filthy man.\"\nLucas stopped in his tracks. He should have killed Canis at the first use of Serpent Eyes. The human brain adapts to shocks, so the effect diminishes with repeated use on the same target.\n\"Heh, you know why I hate you? You pretend to have some grand principle. You and I are just criminals. After today, you'll also be a mass murderer of hundreds.\"\n\"I don't maintain my principles to be great. I just find people like you repulsive.\"\n\"Ha? Really? Do you know what's truly repulsive? Weak people who only talk big. What will you do if I'm disgusted by you?\"\nLucas turned to face the front and grabbed Siena by the throat. Lifting her distorted face with one hand, he walked briskly toward the edge of the cliff of The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed.\n\"Once I kill one person, you'll realize. You're just the same garbage as me.\"\nAs Lucas extended his arm, Siena's legs dangled over the edge of the cliff. She kept making gasping sounds from her mouth.\n\"This woman isn't bad either. It's a shame to kill her, but well...\"\nLucas released his grip, letting Siena fall. At the same moment, his eyes sparked. A sensation unique to Schema users, a thrill only felt in the Spirit Zone.\n'Where is it?'\nHis sensitive nervous system pinpointed the focus of the Spirit Zone. As he leapt into the air, an explosion occurred where his right knee had been. If hit directly, the bone would have shattered.\nLucas landed and immediately rolled backward to gain distance. Even if he couldn't estimate the range of the Spirit Zone, it was standard practice to keep distance from a mage in a fight.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 81: The Battle of the Mages (1)\nNade and Yiruki, having cast Teleportation, appeared at the cliff edge of The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed. The eyes of the two, who had witnessed the humiliation Siena had suffered, were burning fiercely.\nYou dare do that to our teacher\nWhat, there were some unharmed ones too? As always with these Mages\nLucas was equally displeased. It was a mistake for someone called an ArchMage to miss a target. Moreover, any sane human was his responsibility to deal with.\nThat woman was a teacher? My apologies. By now, she must have almost reached the ground. Haha.\nAs Lucas finished speaking, Shirone, embracing Siena, appeared atop the cliff via Teleportation. His gaze was no different from his friends'. How corrupt must one be to throw a person off a cliff?\nI will not forgive you.\nLucas didnt even listen. He was just annoyed by the escalating situation.\nHey, what are you going to do? Is this part of your plan?\nLucas clarified responsibilities. It was because there could be a discussion when paying the balance. Canis did not avoid either. In the absence of Arcane, he was the leader.\nArin, step back.\nBut Canis\nYou don't need to intervene. Focus on your task of controlling the people. I will handle this.\nFighting while maintaining mental control over hundreds of people was too much. As Arin hid among the people, Canis, now unburdened, approached Shirone's group.\nWhat are you? How did you escape mental control?\nYiruki spoke up.\nDark Magic? Isn't that already a thing of the past? There are plenty of ways to counter it.\nNonsense. If it was that easy to escape, those in the back wouldnt be affected.\nThat's true...\nCanis looked up at the sun. It was still bright as they were on the mountain peak. But there was no need for a disciple of an archmage to negotiate terms with students.\nLucas, who had been watching with arms crossed, shouted.\nHey, what are we going to do? This wasnt part of the contract. I might deal with it for double the money.\nI dont need help. I will handle this alone.\nSuit yourself then.\nLucas stepped back, smacking his lips. He seemed uninterested, but his true intention was the opposite. He would wait, pretending to be disinterested, and then strike from behind once the fight began. That would be the end of it.\nCome at me quickly. Im busy.\nShirone and Canis slowly closed the distance between them. Through Synesthesia, Shirone felt that Caniss Spirit Zone was a sphere with a diameter of roughly 50 meters, similar to his own.\nIll handle this here, so you guys deal with that swordsman.\nShirones words made Yiruki look back at Lucas.\nThat guy? Doesnt seem like hell interfere from the look of it.\nYou never know how things might change when push comes to shove. He's vile enough to throw teacher Siena off the cliff.\nShirone spoke with a cold look in his eyes.\nDont believe anything that man says.\nYiruki swallowed hard. Shirone, who had switched his mind into combat mode, had a different look in his eyes than usual.\nShirone began to time his move. Photon Output, among attack magics, boasted exceptional activation speed. But the dark magic was no slouch in speed either.\nNo signal could be read from Canis's eyes. They swirled with an uncertain future, like the black pupils of an orangutan.\nNot human. Only those who have survived countless times could possess such animalistic eyes.\nWhat kind of life must one lead to have such eyes?\nBoth flickered their fingers. And as a bird suddenly took flight, they moved simultaneously. Photon Output and Might of Darkness moved dazzlingly, blurring vision.\nShirone cast Teleportation and shot upwards. The Might of Darkness, following him vertically, melted away in the sunlight.\nCanis sneered. What he aimed for was not Shirone's body, but the shadow buried in the ground. Shirone, belatedly recalling the nature of dark magic, hastily moved outside the cliff. As the shadow disappeared a thousand meters below, the target-less Might of Darkness extinguished like a flame.\nPhoton Output fired like a machine gun, and Canis cast Shadow Wall. A thick wall of shadows rose in front of him, absorbing all the photons.\nIncredible power. To block light with darkness.\nAgainst the natural order, such dark power. Shirone, who had enhanced the power of Photon Output through thousands of rebounds, realized the extent of Canis's mental strength.\nHow about this then?\nConcentrating on the photons in his hand, Shirone clenched his teeth and threw them. As the Photon Cannon fired, Canis maximized the thickness of his defensive wall. His smile was short-lived, as the Shadow Wall exploded, letting in a blinding flash.\nWhat is this?\nFeeling a chill, Canis instinctively cast Dark Skin. His body turned black just as the Photon Cannon struck his abdomen.\nUgh!\nThe impact exceeded the absorption limit of Dark Skin, and the shockwave shook his insides. Canis, lifted off his feet, flew and crashed into the forest.\nCanis!\nArin couldnt believe it. Light containing physical force. Light is pure energy. If it even held a small amount of physical force, planets around the sun would have been shattered.\nLucass expression turned serious for the first time. A beam of light quickly striking the opponent. If he had been in Canis's place, the chances of dodging would have been fifty-fifty.\nThis isnt just bad luck, it's like stepping in dog poop.\nA murderous intent swirled in Lucas's eyes. Although not a profitable deal, the balance had to be paid. His twin swords vibrated as he watched Shirone.\nEthella was somewhere in the mountain range about 800 meters from The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed, and in front of her stood Arcane, who had become an unofficial third-class archmage 40 years ago.\nFor Arcane, this was an unwelcome guest. Even if he had rested, his mental energy, depleted from casting Abyss Nova, had only recovered about 60%.\nHowever, that thought was fleeting. Arcane narrowed his eyes as he realized the true worth of the woman blocking his path.\nOh, look at this?\nShe wore big, clumsy-looking glasses. Her appearance, with her ample chest, seemed like a gentle sheep, someone unfamiliar with combat.\nBut he felt it through his skin. Simply standing there, there was no obstruction in the flow of energy throughout her body.\nHer eyes were especially remarkable. They radiated the spirit of a sage, transcending the eight emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, love, evil, and desire.\nShe was a seeker.\nAnd an exceptionally talented one, too talented to be just a teacher at a magic school.\nCapable of countering Abyss Nova.\nEthella, too, was tense in front of the dark magic authority, known as an archmage before she was even born.\nI've heard of your reputation.\nFrom a monastery?\nArcane guessed she was a nun without hearing it, but her response far exceeded his expectation.\nI am Bishop Ethella of the Karsis Order. I wonder why someone who once made a name with dark magic would commit such atrocities.\nA Bishop, huh.\nArcane burst into laughter, incredulous. Achieving the rank of Bishop at such a young age was unheard of during his prime.\nEspecially since Karsis was one of the leading orders on the continent with 2,000 parishes. And a Bishop was a position responsible for a parish, equivalent to the head of a city.\nWhere is Alpheas?\nEthella remained silent. She didnt know either, but even that fact could be information to the enemy.\nI can hear your brain ticking from here. Frankly, it doesnt matter. I never expected that cunning brat to fall for my magic.\nReferring to the over-sixty Alpheas as a cunning brat indicated just how long Arcane had lived.\nWhy are you looking for the headmaster? If it's a matter of gratitude and grievance, it should be settled in person. If you release the students from mental control and retreat, I can arrange a meeting for you.\nHahaha! Alpheas must have built quite a reputation in my absence. But my dear, Alpheas is not the man you think he is. He's the most foolish and arrogant man in the world.\nThe past doesnt matter. The current headmaster is a person respected by the students.\nOh, is that so?\nArcane stroked his chin playfully. In his memory, Alpheas was still a fiery youth in his twenties.\nI'm curious. What did that brat do to earn such respect? Let's hear it.\nEthella realized Arcane's strategy. It was almost time for the sun to set. He was trying to stall for time until nightfall, when dark magic would be most effective.\nStop waiting for darkness. As a teacher, I can no longer overlook further evil deeds.\nWhat?\nArcane frowned, displeased. A child not even 120 years old dared treat him like a time-wasting mage.\nAs he cast Might of Darkness, Arcanes shadow swallowed the trees. Branches rustled and then bent towards one point.\nDid you think I was afraid of you because the sun was up? Then you've greatly underestimated Arcane.\nEthella looked up. Trees within hundreds of meters leaned in, weaving together into a massive dome like a net. The sky closed, and the surroundings became darker than night.\nDie, detestable creature.\nArcane vanished into his shadow with a swoosh. It was Dark Port, a dark magic specialty, blending with darkness to erase the concept of distance, allowing instant movement to any shadowed area.\nIts strength was the ability to approach without a trace. As Arcane took her rear and cast Might of Darkness, Ethella turned into a flash of light and retreated. Dozens of shadow hands swiped through the air.\nThe battle that ensued was like a high-speed chase between dozens of Arcanes and Ethellas. As Arcane cornered Ethella into a narrow radius, she teleported at extreme speed from her standing position. Her upper body overlapped in multiple layers, causing the shadow hands to pass through mere afterimages.\nA Bishop of the Karsis Order, indeed impressive.\nEven Arcane, full of rage, had to admire her. Her mental magnitude might not match his, but her technique and senses far exceeded her age.\nThen I must target the weak point.\nEthellas eyes trembled with dismay. With Might of Darkness intensifying, thousands of hands flew at her simultaneously.\nAn endless magical power.\nA Zoner's sensing ability was magic in itself, but even so, it was impossible to avoid thousands of hands.\nWhen a shadow from a tree branch grabbed her wrist, Ethella abruptly stopped. If she teleported now, her arm might be torn off.\nUghhh\nThe shadows elasticity was like rubber. But Ethella's strength was formidable too. Gritting her teeth, she pulled her arm, tearing the shadow apart.\nHand-to-hand combat, too? A tough one, this girl.\nArcane smirked and said,\nIf thats your preference, I'll accommodate you.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 82: The Battle of the Mages (2)\nSensing killing intent, Ethella turned to the side. From the darkness in the air, a shadow lunged at incredible speed, striking her chin.\nA fist?\nDozens of shadow fists then flew towards her. Ethella crouched, guarding her vitals with her arms. Despite the dull thuds echoing in the mountains, she stood firm, as if rooted to the ground.\nOh? She withstands this too?\nAny ordinary person would have had their bones shattered by now, but Ethella's eyes, visible through her guard, were still clear.\nI acknowledge your toughness, but let's end this.\nShadow hands appeared from all sides, grabbing the groggy Ethella. Her limbs were stretched out as the Might of Darkness tightened its grip on her wrists and ankles. Her large glasses were tilted, cracked, and blood streamed from her lips.\nArcane cast Poison Cutter. It was a Triple Mix magic, much more complex than fusion magic, infusing rotation with the darkness and adding poison.\nThe magic, sharp as a blade, cut through the air, rushing towards her. Sensing the instant-death spell, Ethella exerted all her strength to sever the shadows, took a deep breath, and screamed.\nAaaaaaaah!\nThe high-frequency roar, knocking down bushes as it raced through, shattered Arcanes darkness like smoke.\nIt was the Pama's Shout, a technique of the monks.\nKarsis Yung, an ancestor of the Karsis Order, once said that awakening of the human spirit comes with a resounding roar. Pama's Shout was a righteous method that broke evil magic with a roar, similar to a sinner startled by thunder.\nBuried in the roar, Arcane shuddered. His skin tingled, and his hair stood on end. He had rarely encountered Pama's Shout in his 130 years of life, and now it was used by a woman barely in her mid-twenties.\nHahaha, this is why I can't leave this business.\nThe greatest talent brandishes the spirit honed to the extreme like a master sword.\nWhat an interesting affair.\nSomeone will die, and someone will survive.\nThrough endless destruction, creation, and re-creation, magic evolves, doesn't it?\nIndeed. Surely.\nArcane cast Poison Cutter again. Seeing her chance, Ethella, grasping her ankle, severed the Might of Darkness and cast Spatial Warp. As she flew away like a bending flash, the Poison Cutter passed through the afterimage of light.\nPhew.\nArcane whistled. The humiliation of retreat is great for the strong, but the ability to retreat without hesitation is also crucial in battle.\nArcane walked towards where Ethella had stood. There was blood on the ground she hadn't completely dodged the attack. If the poison had seeped in, she couldn't have gone far.\nThat cheeky lady will have a hard time.\nArcane was delighted to meet a formidable foe after 40 years. He had encountered a genius with a trinity of a Zoner's Spirit Zone, hand-to-hand combat to sever the Might of Darkness, and the noble spirit of a monk.\nA certified 6th-grade magician, wasn't it?\nHer rank was certainly high for her age, but geniuses don't conform to societal standards. If not bound by her duties as a teacher and seeker, Ethella's rank would have been much higher.\nAlpheas Myrhe. That brat is respected?\nArcane looked up sadly. As his mental control released, the trees straightened, revealing the darkened sky.\nArent you ashamed, Alpheas? To be respected by someone superior to you. What a tragic reality.\nLamenting his disciple's incompetence, Arcane slowly walked away. The darkness spread on the forest floor, showing him the path to take.\nDamn it! Where could he be?\nThadd grew increasingly anxious. Alpheas was not at the lodge where he was sure to be. If he hadn't been captured by the enemy, there was only one place left.\nMaster!\nHe burst into the headmaster's office. But Alpheas was not there either.\nThadd didn't give up and examined the books on the shelves. He knew that Alpheas had set up a personal space here long ago.\nThere must be a mechanism. I cant go through all the books.\nHis gaze quickly caught a book. Titled 'Perceiving Darkness,' it stood out among the old magic tomes. Knowing his master's past, Thadd was sure it was a portal directly connected to Alpheas's memories.\nPulling the top of the book, a heavy mechanism turned, splitting the bookshelf sideways. A tunnel with stairs leading downwards was revealed behind the wall.\nAs Thadd descended the stairs, the tilted book returned to its place, closing the bookshelf. He opened an iron door, revealing a small room with a crystal lamp. Numerous items were displayed on an old shelf, looking antique enough to be in a vintage store.\nA portrait of a woman hung on the wall. She wasn't strikingly beautiful but had a gentle and modest appearance.\nThat must be her\nThadd gazed at the portrait, lost in thought. Alpheas's words were true. Her eyes seemed to possess a magical power that drew people in.\nWho's there?\nStartled, Thadd turned around. Alpheas was sitting on a chair in the corner, leaning on his knees. His face, twisted in anger and confusion, was unlike his usual self.\nMaster! Youre safe!\nYou... seem to know me.\nThadd stopped as he approached, understanding the situation from Alpheas's words.\nYouve lost your memory.\nLike other teachers, Alpheas must have been affected by Arcane's magic. But as a certified 4th-grade magician, he had taken measures before completely losing his memory and sought refuge here.\nHearing Thadd's words, Alpheas approached a bronze mirror, examining himself with a serious expression.\nHmm. Lost my memory, have I? I thought I had suddenly come to the future. Anyway, it's quite annoying to see my 18-year-old face turn into an old mans.\nThadd's eyes widened. 18 years old meant about 40 years of his life had been blocked. If Alpheas hadnt been so rational, he might have gone mad by now.\nYes, lost memory Perhaps it's for the best. At least I haven't been robbed of my life. But where is this? What happened that I lost my memory?\nA magician cast dark magic to harm you, Master. You narrowly escaped it.\nTelling a person who lost their memory that might only increase their anxiety, but Alpheas seemed unperturbed.\nReally? How old am I now?\nUh, you're sixty-three.\nSixty-three, huh. So, what have I become?\nPardon?\nI'm asking what magical achievements I've made.\nAh, well, you're known for your noble character and currently serve as the headmaster of a magic academy.\nAlpheas showed a look of disbelief. The genius known as the light of the Myrhe family, teaching others? Considering his personality, it seemed impossible.\nSo you're saying I became a teacher?\nYes. Everyone follows and respects you, Master.\nPuhahaha! Puhahaha!\nAlpheas burst into a mad laughter. Initially, he was annoyed by his sudden aging, but after learning he had lost his memory, he stopped caring. The thought of hearing about his accomplishments was even exciting.\nI must have matured quite a bit. A headmaster, huh. Then, is this place a palace? Has the prince ascended to the throne?\nThadd became anxious. Even for a rational person like Alpheas, bridging a gap of 40 years was not trivial.\nThis is a private academy. It's the Alpheas Magic Academy, which you established yourself.\nPrivate?\nAlpheas's expression crumpled. A genius like him should have at least been teaching royalty. But private? What happened in these 40 years?\n...What grade am I?\nPardon? Oh, thats...\nThadd hesitated. The records proved how great Alpheas was in his youth. He lacked the courage to honestly reveal the current reality.\nOut with it! What grade am I? You said Im sixty-three, right? So, am I grade 1? Or grade 2?\nThadd, looking guilt-ridden, replied softly.\nYoure grade 4\nAlpheas staggered. The shock was too much for his aged body. But soon, he couldn't contain his burning anger and raged furiously.\nWhat the hell did I do! Idiot! Pathetic fool!\nAlpheas hit his head, reproaching himself. With the talent given by God, he should have been at least 2nd grade after 40 years. But 4th grade?\nWhat happened? What foolish life had he led to end up like this?\nHe needed to know his past. Everything. Determined, Alpheas glared at Thadd.\nYou can undo dark magic, right? You said you're my disciple, so you must know Photon Magic?\nYes. I'm not sure how long it will take, but with your help, it should be possible. But\nThadd suddenly realized.\nCould this be not a curse, but a blessing?\nAlpheas had lived with guilt for 40 years due to a mistake in his youth. If losing his memory could cleanse his past, it would erase a lifetime of regret.\nMaster, do you really need to regain your memory?\nWhat? What are you talking about? Its my memory, of course, I need it back. There must have been a problem. Even now, I can still reach higher realms if corrected.\nMaster. I know it's hard to accept. The light of the Myrhe family, known for divine talent, just a 4th-grade headmaster. But that's why I urge you not to. You made a grave mistake, Master, and suffered for 40 years. It's time for you to be free. Maybe this is a pardon from God?\nAlpheas, reverted to 18, knew how past wounds could torment life. If such things really happened, accepting and living with them was an option.\nRoaming the room in thought, Alpheas suddenly noticed the portrait on the wall.\nWhos that woman? Isnt this my room?\nIt is your room, Master.\nReally? I hung that picture? Shes not even beautiful, and her eyes look dim. Like a simpleton.\nThadd was overwhelmed with emotion. Knowing who she was to Alpheas, he couldnt contain his sorrow.\nMaster, you shouldnt say that. She is...\nAlpheas turned away from the portrait with a look of irritation. Nothing made sense to him.\nIll regain my memory. This future is too far off from my plans. I need to know what happened.\nPlease reconsider, Master. Life is\nHey, you.\nAlpheas interrupted Thadd with a haughty look. Thadd realized there was no falsehood in his master's words. This was the young Alpheas.\nYou said Im your master?\nYes. Its been an honor, and Im always grateful.\nThen consider yourself expelled as of today.\nWhat?\nAlpheas was serious. He was Alpheas of the Myrhe family, losing 40 years of memory without batting an eye, a paragon of intellect.\nWhats so important about regaining past memories? I dont need a pathetic disciple like you.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 83: The Battle of the Mages (3)\nThat's why I'm telling you. Don't you know, Master?\nThere's no guarantee that regaining memory will turn Alpheas back to his former self. Just because one lives the same life twice doesn't mean they end up at the same destination.\nNo. My judgment is always right. No matter how I change, I am still me. This is your last chance. Cast the Photonization Magic.\nThadd sighed and nodded. He now had no choice but to hope that Alpheass true personality would reemerge.\nAlright. Please, take a seat over here.\nThadd fetched a chair from the corner and seated Alpheas.\nI'll begin. I'll cast Photonization Magic, but from there on, it's up to you, Master.\nHa! You think you're capable of worrying about me? Stop with the needless worries and just do it. Once I regain my memory, I'll give you a good telling-off.\nThadd cast the spell with a fervent wish. As light permeated the Abyss Nova, a wave of drowsiness hit. Alpheas slowly closed his eyes and delved into thought. Time, halted at 18, began to flow again.\nBuried in the bushes, Canis was unable to move a finger while the shockwave spread across his abdomen.\nAfter realizing Arin's talent in mental magic, he had intensively trained in dark physical magic.\nAbsorbing force was also a form of physical power, and thus the shock absorption of his Dark Skin was quite high. Even an adult swinging a hammer was no more than childs play before Dark Skin.\nBut the power of the Photon Canon that hit him unexpectedly surpassed all expectations. More importantly, it was impossible to analyze how light could contain physical force.\nKiki, got hit hard, Canis.\nA husky voice tingled his ear. There was no one else in the mountains besides Canis, but the voice was real.\nHarvey... What hit me?\nNo idea. But from what I feel, it's mass. A mass flying at tremendous speed hit your abdomen.\nMass? Light has no mass.\nCanis knew about Photonization theory, a basic for any combat mage studying opposing attributes.\nOf course, light has no mass. But it has energy.\nIn reality, moving photons have a minuscule amount of mass, known as relativistic mass, with solar wind being a typical example.\nBut that's just a mathematical reduction. It's like feeling a hit from a stick in a strong wind.\nThat makes sense. But it's theoretically possible. So, it's not entirely impossible.\nNo, something's missing. To generate such power, something connecting mass and energy is needed. But such a thing doesn't exist in this world.\nThe voice, Harvey, spoke blandly.\nHe must have found it then.\nCanis didn't respond. Though he and Harvey were distinct entities, they shared thoughts. Sensing Canis's annoyance, Harvey reluctantly agreed.\nHe's remarkable. A unique talent. Even the magic academy had such a prodigy.\nContent at last, Canis stood up. Accurately gauging an opponent's strength was the first step to victory. For the first time, he had met a worthy adversary. His body seemed to warm up.\nCan we win, Harvey?\nKiki. Canis, if that's what you want...\nThe eerie voice melted into the darkness.\nThere's no enemy we can't defeat.\nCanis, casting an abnormally long shadow, headed back to the mountaintop where Shirone was.\nShirone stared into the forest's darkness for a while. He wasn't certain if Canis had cast Dark Skin, but information barely reaching his retina was sending warning signals.\nCanis emerged from the forest. Nade scowled as Shirones prediction was proven right.\nDamn. He's really unscathed?\nNade. The sun has set.\nWith night, the power of dark magic would be maximized, so Yiruki cast a lighting spell. It was far less bright than Fire Sun, so Nade contributed his strength. Two light sources glowed 10 meters above. But considering the speed of a mage, it was still a stretch for a frontal confrontation.\nTch. Still too dark with this?\nJust then, Canis cast a lighting spell. Light magic cast by a dark magician made both of them uncomfortable.\nWhy lighting magic?\nWhat's the problem? No matter the field, Photonization theory is essential. It's the basis of Teleportation.\nThat's not the point! Light is a weakness for dark mages, right? Why would you do something that hurts yourself?\nHahaha! Hahaha!\nCanis burst into laughter.\nAs expected, magic academy students are dumb and rigid. No magic, regardless of its field, is without a weakness. What matters is how you compensate for those weaknesses. Lighting magic is proof of that. Arin, shoot another one.\nArin, normally cautious, willingly cast the lighting spell as well.\nWith four light sources, it was almost as bright as day. But Canis wasn't satisfied and turned to Shirone. A light mage with a unique perception. His lighting magic could create the stage he desired.\nHey, how about you shoot one too? I'm looking forward to it.\nShirone didn't know how to cast lighting magic. From Teleportation to Rainbow Drop, Photon Output to Photon Cannon, his technical evolution had left no time to invest in other types of magic.\nWhat? You can't do it? That's ridiculous. A light magician who can't cast lighting magic.\nSometimes that happens. A magician with a short magical 'cord' but fortuitous affinity excels in one type of magic. While this could make one famous in a circus, magic is not a feat but a lethal skill. In a battlefield rife with psychology and tactics, someone like Shirone, who can only do one thing, is perfect prey.\nI was mistaken. I thought this would be a good duel, but you're just a kid who's neither here nor there, arent you?\nAt that moment, a bright light source appeared above Shirone's head, outshining the others' lighting magic.\nNade and Yiruki stared blankly. He had instantly cast a lighting spell he had never learned. It was his anger, even more than his boundless insight, that was palpable.\nShirone stepped into Caniss Spirit Zone. He couldn't forgive him for taking the entire student body hostage and talking about a fair duel.\nAre you satisfied now? I did as you wished, so do whatever you want.\nCanis retracted his previous thoughts. Shirone wasnt just a magician good at circus tricks. But did it matter? No matter how strong the opponent, he was stronger. The situation was perfect to prove it.\nAnything? Youll regret saying that.\nAs he cast Might of Darkness, shadows at his feet surged towards Shirone like a rapid current. Shirone, ascending into the sky, levitated photons on his palm. It was the same attack pattern as before.\nJust to annoy me with bluffs?\nAs Shirone cast Photon Cannon, Canis vanished into the shadow below. Although slightly novel, it was just a teleportation spell learned from books. As Canis appeared from all directions like a mole, Shirone bombarded him, devastating the mountaintop.\nGot him!\nStrategically analyzing Canis's movements, Shirone launched a predictive shot at an inescapable spot. Canis appeared too late to avoid it. Inevitable hit. And with power that Dark Skin couldnt withstand.\nJust when everyone thought it was over, a shadow rose from beneath Caniss feet. It was elongated like a humans shadow and intercepted the Photon Cannon with hands and belly. The photons, caught between palms, were absorbed with a bang into the shadow.\nA flustered Shirone landed on the ground. The shadow had destroyed the Photon Cannon. It meant darkness had overwhelmed light.\nKiki, what a grand entrance. How was I?\nHow can that be? Darkness swallowing light\nNade couldn't believe it. No matter how strong dark power was, it couldnt suppress light. Imagine lighting a torch, but the surroundings don't brighten at all.\nThe creature connected to Caniss shadow moved unhindered, even under the lit magic. It had a small head, but large shoulders and chest. Its waist was thin like a leopard's, arms long like a monkey's, and its palms were wide like shields, with fingers thin and long like blades. The beautiful balance of its body was evidence of artificial creation.\nKik, I told you I'm nothing special, right? Hey, kid. The photons you shot were really tasty.\nAs the shadow spoke, Shirone was dumbfounded. Moreover, the fact it used the term 'photons' and not 'light' indicated it possessed intellectual abilities.\nCanis introduced his shadow.\nThe essence of dark magic. The strongest magical creature, Harvest.\nA magical creature?\nThe pinnacle of alchemy and magical engineering - magical biology. Seeing something only mentioned in books was truly bizarre. Moreover, it was an intellectual creature never introduced before.\nKiki! Hes totally out of it! Whys he acting like hes seeing a magical creature for the first time?\nHarvest, boasting a rough sense of humor, chuckled and shrugged. A rash and peculiar monster? No, a being with supremely human yet transcendent qualities.\nHarvest is immune to light. Plus, it's linked to my life. As long as I live, Harvest won't perish.\nThats right! We are two yet one! One yet two! Of course, Im better looking. Really! I look great, but theres no way to show you. Kekeke!\nDespite Harvest's joking, Shirone had no time to care. If it was immune to light, even the only weakness of a dark magician was gone.\nCan I... win?\nSo far, he hadn't received any outside help, nor was Alpheass location clear. The lives of hundreds were in the hands of those present.\nCanis was pleased with Shirones dismay. Introducing Harvest after the lighting magic had a remarkable effect. It was also Harvest's strategy. The frivolous manner and tone were a perfect act. In reality, Harvest was an intellectual being, even more than Canis, having absorbed all of Arcanes knowledge. Even now, Harvest was continuously exchanging brainwave patterns with Canis.\n- Canis. Lets go into the forest. We're at a disadvantage here.\n- Think theyll follow easily?\n- Theyre in a hurry, not us. Plus, Lucas is quite strong. If we can get him to move, our strength will increase.\n- I dont like it. I dont want to rely on someone like him. I would have fought him if you hadnt stopped me.\n- For you, Canis. Hes strong and not stupid. Considering the total amount of shame, youre losing. I cant let you get tangled in a futile emotional battle.\nLucas was another face of the villains who tormented Canis in Radum. The thought of having to rely on such a person made Canis seethe.\n- Canis. Your heart rate has increased by 1.7 times. If your adrenaline level rises, your judgment gets clouded. If youre angry because of what I said, I apologize.\nHarvests consideration calmed Caniss heart. With the cold and rational Harvest, he was confident he couldnt lose to anyone.\n- No, Harvey. Sorry. Youre right. Lets start.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Light and Darkness, Good and Evil (1)\nCanis, clearing his mind of distractions, glared at Shirone. His pretty face, looking like he never faced hardships, twisted Canis's gut.\nHmph. You think of me as a villain. But...\nFrom Caniss shadow, Might of Darkness arose. Despite being diminished by the lighting magic, its regeneration rate was tremendous.\nTo me, you are the evil!\nAs Might of Darkness surged, Shirone cleaned the ground with Photon Output. He then threw the Photon Cannon he had mounted on his right hand. Harvest intercepted it, absorbing the impact with his body. The Photon Cannon burrowed into Harvest's torso, pushing him back into the forest. But rather than being affected, Harvest provocatively wriggled its long fingers at Shirone.\nKikikiki. Come on, come in.\nThough the forest was practically a home ground for a dark mage, Shirone rushed in without hesitation. He then launched dozens of photons from left to right, right to left, above his head.\nDudududududu! Dudududududu!\nOver a hundred lighting rounds pierced the forest canopy, lighting up the sky like day. Nade and Yiruki looked at the bright sky in disbelief.\nThat guy, hes really set off.\nHe knows, right? If Shirone cant stop him, we lose.\nYiruki slowly shifted his gaze. Lucas was following Shirone into the forest. As he spotted a gray smoke rising ahead, he leaped quickly. An Atomic Bomb exploded with a bang, and Lucas, who had jumped back 10 meters, glared at Yiruki with menacing eyes.\nYou!\nDont do anything unnecessary. We're already thinking what youre thinking. Just stay put there.\nThat's ridiculous.\nEven if he was immature, a mere magic trainee facing off against a B-class fugitive was absurd. Lucas drew his twin swords, producing a swishing sound. His Spirit Zone, transmitted through Schema, flared like burning wood.\nThe human body, enhanced by Schema, has infinite potential, but unbalanced enhancement can lead to severe side effects. Most use verified builds.\nA lopsided build destroys the body. For example, too much enhancement of the nervous system could lead to muscle ruptures as they fail to keep up with the nerves' speed.\nLucass current build, the Mitochondria Build, boosted the energy factories of cells, momentarily increasing energy efficiency.\nThough it rapidly drains stamina, the overall enhancement of the body is appealing, making it a base build for most users.\nIt could be dangerous...\nYiruki observed Nade's condition. Nade's cold eyes reminded Yiruki of the summer five years ago. On a day of heavy rain, the two had clashed. It was a miracle Nade could smile now. He would probably never show his old face again. He hated the face that resembled the person he loved the most in the world.\nBe careful, Nade. Hes a Schema user.\nI know. Lets increase our firepower and suppress him early.\nLucas was incredulous. 'Be careful' is a phrase for avoiding puddles or crossing rickety bridges, not for situations where your neck might be sliced off by a sword.\nAh, these kids nowadays\nAs Lucas scratched his head, his figure blurred. Simultaneously, a golden flash arose between Nade and Yiruki. Teleportation sparked, and they appeared 10 meters away from Lucas. Yiruki checked his chest. His clothes were sharply cut, and blood seeped from a line across his chest.\nYou okay?\nIt's not fatal. But hes really fast.\nEven if magic is transcendental, a mages body is human. Excluding magic effects, reacting and responding to a Schema swordsmans movements is naturally challenging.\nConversely, the same applies to swordsmen. The force of magic cannot be endured by Schema. Even a student-level spell, if it hits, could be lethal.\nNade and Yiruki concentrated their firepower. A chain explosion of Atomic Bombs snaked through, and Nade calculated and launched predictive shots at Lucas. However, Lucas's movement, entirely different from the mechanical patterns trained at the school, was too elusive for direct hits.\nDamn! Why am I outmatched by kids?\nLucas was not in a comfortable situation either. Due to the Mitochondria Build, his stamina was dropping by the second.\nBoosting his energy metabolism, his speed increased significantly. Swiftly circumventing a wide radius, he leaped from Yiruki's side, swinging his twin swords. Nade extended his hands, and Electric Shock magic struck Lucas's abdomen, vibrating his body at a rate of 60 times per second.\nYiruki, now!\nYiruki was already prepared. As Lucas, stunned, had gray smoke rising from his face, he tried to move desperately. His muscles felt charred, unable to generate strength.\nDamn it! Damn it!\nFacing death against mere kids was unthinkable. No, was he really going to die? Facing an unexpected situation, he felt a loss of reality.\nYiruki was certain it was over. The detonation reaction confirmed it wasnt a rash decision. But suddenly, the Spirit Zone vanished. Before he could figure out why, his legs started to go numb. Unbeknownst to him, someone else's shadow had connected to his feet. It was unmistakably Arin's handiwork.\nDamn it!\nLucas escaped the vibrating shock with all his might and charged at Nade, who had humiliated him. His anger, having reached the brink of death, was at its peak, and his charged swords gleamed menacingly.\nNade, run!\nNade, caught in the blades, still generated electricity in his hands. As Lucas swung his swords for a double attack, unexpectedly thick ice pillars erupted beside Nade.\nClang! The swords stuck in the ice. Lucas's eyes shook with shock. His swordsmanship could split rocks, but now he couldnt cut through mere ice.\nSlowly turning around, Lucas saw a familiar face. The female teacher he had thrown off the cliff earlier.\nTeacher Siena!\nNade, visibly relieved, shouted. But Siena remained silent, her eyes emotionless, focused solely on Lucas.\nHaah. Haah.\nEthella, leaning against a tree trunk, looked ready to collapse. She had been in a chase for 30 minutes, yet couldnt completely shake off Arcane.\nThe poison is spreading. I can't delay treatment any longer.\nSitting down, Ethella tore the waist of her nun's habit. Black blood flowed from a scar above her navel. It was a wound from Poison Cutter. She had been stalling the poison's spread with breathing techniques, but it was only a temporary solution. She needed to suck the poison out, but it was a difficult area to reach with her mouth.\nBending her back, Ethella stretched her hands behind and gripped the tree trunk, then curled her spine. Her hips rose off the ground, bending her waist dramatically. Twisting her body into a spiral, she finally reached her navel with her lips.\nEthella pushed all the toxins in her body towards the wound. Filling her lungs with air, she sucked on the wound. As the poison was drawn out, she experienced searing pain. Grimacing, she lifted her head and spat out the poison. The black blood fell on the grass, instantly drying it.\nEthellas face regained some color. She threw off her askew glasses and wrapped her torn habit around her fist.\nWhew. Now I can live a bit longer.\nAs her Spirit Zone stabilized, she felt the energies around her through synesthesia. Opening her eyes wide, she leaped up. Dozens of pitch-black hands emerged from the ground.\nHe's already this close...\nThe fact that Arcane, an expert in tracking, could relentlessly pursue a Zoner like her proved how agile a dark archmage could become when merged with darkness.\nThe poisons gone, I see. The more I see, the more I like you.\nArcane emerged from the darkness. But Ethella no longer needed to flee.\nFrom now on, it wont be easy.\nReady to fight for real? Then I won't hold back and enjoy it.\nEthella pushed strength into her fist, charging the Ethereal Resonance Fist. Arcane quickly noticed her change. She had completely abandoned her Spirit Zone.\nA mage handles Spirit Zone, a swordsman Schema. But monks train both simultaneously. A monk's existence is not about reaching higher but embracing the world with the broadest heart.\nArcane disliked this. Had she focused on one field from the start, there would be no one on the continent who didnt know her name.\nSuch a pity. Why choose asceticism with talent that could reach the summit? But I suppose its pointless to say this to someone who never intended to climb.\nArcane extended his hand, chanting a spell. Against a Schema-using opponent, he had a specific countermeasure.\nMinions of Darkness.\nCountless spiders crawled out of the forest shadows. The sight of spiders as big as human heads swarming was spine-chilling.\nGrrrrrrrrr!\nThe true value of Minions of Darkness was just beginning. A Dark Golem over three meters tall rose beside Arcane.\nIts face was buried in its shoulders, and its body and limbs were swollen as if wrapped in yarn. Its arms were long, legs short.\nMinions of Darkness was a spell that converted 100% mental power into physical force. Unlike Might of Darkness, which absorbs external energy, it wasn't immune to light but was incredibly powerful at night.\nGo, my minions.\nThe Dark Spiders initiated the attack. As they clumped together, it was impossible to tell how many were moving.\nEthella jabbed and flicked the spiders in all directions. A straight punch into the cluster created an explosion, scattering the shadows.\nGrrrrrrrr!\nDark Golem charged through the dispersing spiders. As Ethella leaped like a squirrel, the Golems thick forearm slammed into the ground.\nBang!\nA shock surged through Arcane's mind as the equilibrium was disrupted.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Light and Darkness, Good and Evil (2)\n\"Heh, is this really the punch of a human?\"\nThe power of Ethella's punches was comparable to magic. She didn't just stop at one hit; she was continuously throwing powerful punches. Every time she struck the heavy darkness, her wrists ached, but the impact on her opponent was several times greater.\nArcane gritted his teeth and focused. Ethella's punches were powerful, but the nature of the impact was unique. It wasn't about surface destruction but creating shockwaves inside. The problem was the interference caused by the overlapping shockwaves.\n'It's a wave type. This is dangerous.'\nThe Dark Golem writhed in pain. Ethella's eyes shone as she stepped closer and hit the golem's solar plexus with her palm. A huge ripple spread, creating approximately 400 interference actions. This meant a shockwave 400 times stronger than Ethella's fist was exploding inside.\nThe golem swelled as if it had swallowed a bomb and seemed about to burst.\n\"Argh!\"\nArcane scrunched up his face and held onto his consciousness. If the spirit zone broke, the Dark Golem would collapse. As the tremors in the golem subsided, Ethella bit her lip.\n'Was it still not enough? I should have overlapped the waves more.'\nYin-Yang Wave Fist, a martial art using wave patterns, piled waves inside the opponent's body and then pushed a powerful wave to cause an explosion. It took time to reach the peak, but once the final hit landed, the impact was terrifying.\nHowever, Arcane withstood it. The impact absorbed by the Dark Golem was 400 times a Schema martial artist's blow, but Arcane's mental strength as a archmage was not to be underestimated.\n\"Quite impressive, kid.\"\n\"The next won't end like this. Why don't you give up now?\"\n\"Hah! Still got some fight left in you, huh? Good. I haven't had this much fun in a while.\"\nArcane raised his hand, and the Dark Spiders began to merge into the body of the Dark Golem. The golem grew larger, eventually piercing the canopy of the dark forest.\nEthella felt dizzy. The Dark Golem she was seeing now was the true identity behind Arcane's notorious fame. It could decimate a mid-sized city in days.\n\"How do you like it? No matter your wave fist or whatever, you'll have to hit hard. My golem's depths are deeper than the ocean.\"\nFacing a 10-meter-tall giant golem, Ethella doubted whether her shockwaves would even spread. But she clenched her fists until they almost burst. She had to be the light of the world. Even if advancing meant death, she had to move forward.\nThe Dark Golem roared and advanced. Despite its size, its speed remained. The ability to move at the speed of thought was the main reason why the minions of darkness were considered overpowered.\nThud!\nThe golem's fist smashed down where Ethella stood. Seismic waves caused trees to fall and the ground to split as if moles were burrowing underneath.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nThe golem continuously pounded the ground, devastating the area. On the sixth strike, Ethella changed direction, climbed the golem's arm, and reached its shoulder. She crossed her arms and jumped down, pummeling the golem with lightning-fast punches.\nDrdrdrdrdrdrdr!\nIt was the secret technique of Yin-Yang Wave Fist, the Thousand-Hand Guanyin Thunder Strike.\nArcane's brain sparked relentlessly with the shockwaves. The interference occurring at more than 30 times per second was overwhelming. If each second produced about 300 ripples, and considering two seconds to land, it meant around 600 ripples. Just that would cause about 3,000 interferences. But the essence of Yin-Yang Wave Fist was in the final strike. If that was allowed to hit, what would be the outcome? Considering interference, refraction, and reflection, the number of interferences in two seconds would be\n'68,000 times.'\nThe impact, 68,000 times more than Ethella's punch, was about to explode inside. Arcane's hair stood on end, but his lips curled into a strange smile.\n\"Haha! Finally, I feel alive again.\"\nHe had no intention of fleeing. If the enemy was strong, just overpower them. How much he longed for this moment! The glory days of battling countless geniuses flashed before his eyes.\nThe Dark Golem twisted its waist like a pretzel. Ethella, who had just landed, pulled back her hands to her sides. The final form of Thousand-Hand Guanyin Thunder Strike, the Strong Thunder Palm, began to gather in her palms. As the golem's fist, laden with rotation, approached, Ethella clenched her teeth and thrust her palms forward.\n'Strong Thunder Palm!'\nBoom!\nA mushroom cloud rose from the middle of the mountain range.\nWithin a 20-meter radius, trees were uprooted, turning the once lush forest into a wasteland.\nBeneath the twinkling stars, Ethella blinked as she caught the starlight through the branches.\n\"How long has it been? Or how far did I fly?\"\nThe trees along her path were all broken.\nAt the end of the trail of devastation, Ethella lay sprawled, unable to move a finger. Her muscles twitched uncontrollably, and she felt no sensation in her fingertips or toes.\n'Master...'\nEthella was incapacitated.\n'The archmage is truly powerful.'\nEven the ultimate technique of Yin-Yang Wave Fist wasn't enough to counter the archmage's minions of darkness.\nWas this what a calamity-level magic looked like?\nThe regret of not extinguishing evil gnawed at her.\n'If only I had overlapped the waves more, perfected the ultimate technique of Thousand-Hand Guanyin, or increased the power of Strong Thunder Palm.'\nTears streamed down her face like a waterfall.\n\"I failed you, Master.\"\nEthella's sobs echoed through the mountains.\nShirone and Canis, amidst the complex terrain of the forest, never lost track of each other's positions. The fight was more cautious than fierce, leaning more towards a psychological battle than a firepower one. Due to the contrasting nature of light and darkness, a slight imbalance could swiftly tilt the scales of battle. It was all about who would throw the first punch.\nCanis felt the greater pressure. As a practitioner of dark magic, he was on the lookout for counter-attacks, but Shirone never gave him an opening, maintaining tension with tactical movements. Thoughts from Harvest flowed through their neural link.\n- He's quite something. Maintaining such composure in battle is not something just anyone can do.\n- Should we engage? We need to create a variable. We can't keep being dragged around like this.\n- Hmm. It's like mirror chess.\nThe strategy of mirroring the opponent's moves in chess doesnt lead to a power gap until the mid-game. Eventually, when one cannot withstand the pressure and makes a mistake, that's when the other strikes. But if the opponent maintains their pace until the end, the initiator might suffer.\n'It doesnt seem like hes faltering. We might be in danger if this continues.'\nCanis saw taking the initiative as advantageous and conveyed his intention through the mental channel.\n- What do you think, Harvest?\n- Hmm? Oh, yeah. As time goes on, we'll be at a disadvantage. Let's take the offensive.\nReceiving a delayed response, Canis created distance with a Dark Port and asked.\n- Something wrong?\n- No, just felt a seismic wave. It's from about 2 kilometers away.\nHarvest, with a highly developed sense of vibration, could perceive, hear, and even taste through vibrations.\n- Seismic wave?\n- It's still transmitting. Such an impact could only be from Arcane. He must have used the minions of darkness.\n- Master Arcane? But the minions of darkness are his trump card. What does this mean?\n- It could mean something good or bad. Good being that hes in tip-top shape. Bad being that he had to use it against a strong opponent.\n- A strong opponent... Alpheas?\n- For now, thats a reasonable assumption. Anyway, we need to move. If Arcane has found Alpheas, we should wrap things up here too.\n- Got it. Let's begin.\nCanis closed the gap and engaged. Shirone, unexpectedly, also didn't hold back, matching the flow change with almost animalistic feedback.\nCanis used the power of darkness. His shadows, reflecting his unique style, were specialized for attack with dual-sided blades.\nShirone fired a barrage of Photon Cannons, eroding the darkness like a rock in a storm. Light was indeed the natural enemy of darkness, but Canis persisted with his dark magic. Each magic type's basic spells were all usable, but not enough to face this level with mere tricks.\nJust hold on. He can't keep using such powerful magic indefinitely. The tide will turn if we endure.\nAs Canis expected, Shirone's mental fatigue was accumulating. Even with a natural advantage, the defensive power of dark magic was formidable.\nI need more power.\nPhotons are highly active, inevitably leading to loss. Therefore, Shirone compressed photons faster than they could dissipate, increasing their mass. It was mentally taxing but increased the power significantly. The blinding spheres grew, flickering chaotically.\nCanis immediately sensed the change.\n- What's this?\n- Hes increased the power. I'll handle it.\nStepping in front of Canis, Harvest braced himself. As the massive Photon Cannon hit him, he covered it with his hands, trying to suppress the photons. But instead of crushing, they blasted Harvest through the forest.\nCanis's face showed disbelief.\n- Harvest, are you okay?\n- Kinda. Damn heavy. Its a murder weapon.\nShirone conjured a Photon Cannon above his head and then two more over his shoulders. As three powerful cannons vibrated with immense mass, Harvest, not to be outdone, spread his arms and shouted.\nKiki! That tickles! Is this really your trump card?\nNo. Up till now was just practice.\n...\nHarvest fell silent as the doubly powered Photon Cannons fired, blasting the giant trees in their path. Canis's mental channel accelerated with Harvest's thoughts flooding in.\n- Canis, we should dodge this.\n- Once we start dodging, we'll lose control. We can't back down in this fight.\n- I dont think I can block it!\n- You can. Absorb my mental strength.\n- Damn, what a nuisance you are!\nAbsorbing Canis's mental strength, Harvest's body swelled massively. His stomach opened like a beast's maw, and the\nshadow roared at the trio of light beams.\nKaaaaaa!\nLight collided with darkness.\nCreas, a warm southern city, was now in summer. Yet, at the summit of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed, a snowstorm akin to a winter wasteland raged.\nYiruki and Nade bundled up their clothes. The blizzard obscured their vision, making Siena and Lucas's figures blurry.\nBrrr. It's freezing. What's going on? Why did Instructor Siena use magic?\nMaybe she's regained her senses? She might have awakened when she fell off the cliff.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 86: Battle of Wits (1)\n\"It doesn't seem like that, does it? What is this magic? It's not like the teacher at all. We'll all freeze to death if this continues.\"\nNade was equally puzzled. Hundreds of students were currently at this location. The thought of them enduring minus 20 degrees Celsius for long seemed unlikely. However, this blizzard effectively pressured Lucas, as the mitochondrial build's effectiveness decreases with cooling of the body cells.\n\"Damn it! This is maddening!\"\nEspecially around Lucas, where the wind was blowing fiercely, the chilled wind made it feel even colder. Peripheral neuropathy was already setting in.\nThis was why expert ice mages typically start battles with a Blizzard. Although not highly lethal, this wide-range spell inflicts fixed damage from cooling, making it essential against swordsmen.\n\"Anyway, mages are annoying.\"\nLucas was exasperated by mages who tormented swordsmen with all sorts of strange magic. But it wasn't time to give up yet. More importantly, her condition was far from normal.\nAs sharp spears of ice pierced through the blizzard towards him, Lucas hastily moved. However, due to the weakened mitochondrial build, he couldn't fully evade and got grazed on the side.\n\"Damn it!\"\nMost living creatures have reduced activity in cold temperatures. Moreover, swinging a sword in such cold was causing frostbite symptoms on his fingertips.\n'It seems colder. Is she really trying to kill us all?'\nIf a Schema user like Lucas is suffering from frostbite, the students should have been frozen dead by now. But, in reality, only Lucas was trapped in the blizzard. The snowstorm, which had narrowed its radius, was targeting him specifically.\nUnaware of this, Lucas confronted Siena, who had emerged from the blizzard, with a snarl.\n\"Are you crazy? How long will this damn blizzard last...?\"\nLucas stopped mid-sentence. Siena's eyes still held nothing - no emotions, thoughts, or even self.\n\"Could it be...?\"\nLucas shivered. It was as if her body remembered the magic, not her mind.\nLiterally, a 'meat brain'.\nJust as swordsmen master techniques through endless repetitive training, Siena had reached a state where she could implement specific brainwave patterns even with lost memory.\nRepetition, again and again. She must have relentlessly pushed her mind to the brink of death since birth.\n'How much has she trained?'\nHis hair stood on end. Beyond her skills, the path of suffering she walked was vivid in his mind.\n'Damn! This isn't just stepping in crap, this is a disaster.'\nIt was time to escape. No amount of gold was worth more than life. Lucas summoned all his remaining strength and fled. Once out of the blizzard, he thought he wouldn't be pursued. But it was mere wishful thinking, and he paid dearly for turning his back on a Grade 6 Mage.\nWhen Siena pointed her finger at Lucas, he soon screamed and was buried in the snow.\n\"Aaaaah!\"\nThere was no pain. But, according to the Schema's understanding of the human body, his legs were gone, as if cut by scissors. Lucas twisted his waist to check his legs. They were frozen solid, completely numb.\n'This can't be real.'\nHe was facing Absolute Zero, the pinnacle of ice magic.\nThis magic, Preservation Condensation, at the zenith of ice magic, restricts particle activity to an extreme degree.\nSiena had reached the level of Absolute Zero, ascending to a Grade 6 Mage at only 20.\nHowever, even she could only produce localized effects due to the immense mental power required.\n\"Damn it! I thought this was just some crappy school... The students and teachers are all monsters!\"\nSiena impassively began casting her next spell, Glacier Bombing, a high-level magic derived from Preservation Condensation. As huge blocks of ice formed in the sky, Lucas's face turned pale. With his legs frozen, he had no way to escape. All he could do was leave his fate to the heavens.\nNade and Yiruki rushed to the students. Although not a wide-area spell, the icebergs' massive size still posed a danger. As several ice chunks split and collided, one almond-shaped iceberg began to fall towards the students.\nNade, rushing to Arin, grabbed her shoulder and knocked her to the ground.\n\"Kyaa! What are you doing?\"\n\"Evacuate the students! Otherwise, we'll all die!\"\n\"It's too late! We don't have time!\"\nYiruki blocked the two, shouting urgently.\n\"I'll do it!\"\n\"How?\"\nYiruki, without a moment to spare, clenched his teeth. Could he really manage it? The iceberg weighed tens of tons. Even if he detonated it with Atomic Bomb, the splinters from dozens of fragments were a concern. Assuming the size of the iceberg, at least a thousand pieces were needed to avoid fatal injuries.\n'I have no choice but to try...'\nMomentum could be predicted mathematically. If he calculated the physical quantities of splitting and re-splitting the iceberg, he could detonate it before it fell.\n\"Here I gooo!\"\nHe dove into the center of the iceberg with a Deviate Form Spirit Zone. After initiating a series of Atomic Bombs, the iceberg shook and split into seven pieces.\nYiruki activated his Double Spirit Zone and frantically fired Atomic Bombs, shattering the iceberg.\nPop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, boom!\nThe ice bloomed like flowers. The iceberg burst into fragments, scattering like sparks.\nNade and Arin watched the chain explosions in the sky, stunned. Then, realizing the falling ice grains, they turned to the students. The small ice fragments rained down like hail, but no one was hurt.\nShock trembled in Arin's eyes. Arcane always belittled the students of the Magic Academy. Students without a spirit of challenge or combat will, just passively accepting whatever is given, weak and feeble. But the level of the Magic Academy students she witnessed far exceeded her expectations.\n'So this is the Magic Academy. Huh?'\nArin turned her head, realizing she was in the arms of a strange man. She impulsively pushed Nade away, shouting.\n\"Get off! What are you doing?\"\nNade, landing on his backside, blushed.\n\"What! I just helped you, and this is the thanks I get!\"\n\"Why are you helping me? We're enemies!\"\n\"Who says? Hurry up and lift your mind control! Are you really going to kill all these people? Are you in your right mind?\"\nArin bit her lip. She was ready to become the protagonist of a historical massacre, but she wasn't afraid. If she hadn't met Canis in Radum, her fate would have been far worse.\n\"It doesn't matter. For Canis, I don't care if the whole world dies.\"\nNade saw the despair and cynicism in Arin's eyes. What kind of life had she led to have such a gaze?\n\"Alright.\"\nYiruki, seeing Siena collapsed in the snow, carried her on his back and then turned to Lucas. Does a sinner too have a god? Lucas, barely managing to stay a few meters away from the glaciers, was trapped. His jaw was dislocated, and his eyes showed only the whites, having lost both legs and unable to steal again. Just seven days after his escape, he was destined to return to the gloomy prison of Inferno.\nBoom!\nA loud explosion from the forest made Nade and Yiruki turn their heads. A thick beam of light was piercing the sky.\n\"Wow. What's that big thing?\"\n\"It's a Photon Cannon. Did he have an epiphany?\"\nAs the forest shook, Shirone burst out, looking as if he had just escaped a quagmire. Arin's face brightened, indicating Canis had the upper hand.\nHowever, her assumption quickly crumbled.\nHarvest emerged, toppling trees with his long arms, and Canis limped out. His condition was no better than Shirone's, if not worse.\nYiruki, in disbelief, said, \"An even match...?\"\n\"No way. Shirone's Photon Cannon evolved during the battle. And yet he couldnt win?\"\nShirone, supporting himself off the ground, said, \"I cant win.\"\nHis friends doubted their ears. Was this the first time they had heard such words from Shirone?\n\"What, man? Dont talk weak.\"\n\"It's not about being weak. That guy... he's really strong.\"\nShirone admitted it honestly. Knowing that Canis was the disciple of an Archmage would have been more convincing, but even without that knowledge, he could feel Canis's will in each of his spells.\nThe will to not lose. The will to destroy humanity. The will to prove that he was the best.\nEven with Photon Cannon's maximized power, Harvest, borrowing Canis's mental strength, absorbed it.\nWhat followed was a melee. A war of attrition, exchanging Might of Darkness and Photon Cannon, cutting each other down.\nUltimately, Canis successfully countered, pushing Shirone out of the forest.\n'Why would someone so strong... want to harm others?'\nWhatever the reason for choosing evil, it could be understandable. After all, everyone makes mistakes.\nBut he couldn't accept that evil was strong. Strength is the result of effort, not mistakes.\n\"Why are you doing this? What have these students done to you?\"\n\"Are you just blabbering because you're losing? That's typical of weak nobles.\"\nShirone wasn't ruffled because it wasn't true.\n\"Answer me. What you're doing now will be recorded in history as a terrible act. I at least need to know why.\"\n\"History? Who cares about that? The abandoned just struggle to survive each day. If I dont kill, I'll be killed.\"\n\"Dont try to justify it with sophistry. No matter what life youve lived, everyone has their own unbearable pain.\"\n\"Have you ever eaten fallen excrement off the ground?\"\nShirone was silent. A cold wind blew.\n'Canis...'\nSadness filled Arin's eyes. Those who haven't lived in Radum can never understand what it's like.\nRadum was another world, isolated from society.\nCanis and Arin were abandoned there. Its unclear how long they had been together or why it was just the two of them.\nBut they had been there as long as they could remember, surviving while others died or were sold.\nCanis was clever from a young age. Though weak as a child, he showed how strong a person can become when talent meets venom.\nIn Radum, swarming with villains, Canis had only one desire.\nTo protect Arin for the day.\nThere were no women in Radum. Precisely, no females past infancy.\nIn a place where food was scarce, powerless girls were consumed upon birth.\nBut Arin survived in Radum until she was ten.\nThe only woman in Radum.\nCanis was the one who preserved that eerie symbol.\nHe was always like a mad dog. He would rush to death whenever enemies targeted Arin.\nBeing with Arin meant they couldn't join any organization. So they scrounged through trash bins to survive.\nThe funny thing in Radum is even garbage has owners. They fought, not minding torn flesh, just to obtain leftovers others discarded.\nAfter fierce battles, Canis managed to secure half a piece of moldy bread.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 87: Battle of Wits (2)\nArin had been starving for three days. Consequently, Canis had not eaten anything for twenty days.\n\"Huff! Huff! I did it! I got it! The bread!\"\nCanis ran frantically through the alleyways. After losing his pursuers, he leaned against a wall to catch his breath.\nHis consciousness was fading; all he felt was hunger. He couldn't remember how long it had been since he last ate.\nThen, he spotted a piece of bread.\nCanis swallowed hard, his eyes wild with hunger.\nHe wanted it. He wanted to put it in his mouth.\n\"Yeah, I need to be strong for Arin. I can eat this. Arin can last a few more days.\"\nThis thought seemed remarkably rational.\nWas there a more logical decision? Eat this and use the remaining strength to find more food.\nCanis opened his mouth to eat the bread. His mouth watered, and his hands trembled.\n\"Ugh!\"\nBut then Canis clenched his eyes shut and placed the bread in his pocket. It was all a lie. What strength could he gain from such a piece of bread?\n\"I must endure. It doesn't matter if my body breaks down, but if my mind does, it's over.\"\nCanis looked around like a madman, ready to fill his stomach with stones if necessary.\nHe crawled towards some feces discarded in a corner and, without a second thought, shoved it into his mouth.\n\"Ugh! Ugh!\"\nEvery part of his body rejected it, but Canis swallowed it.\nBetter than a stone.\nFeces were better than a stone.\nReturning to their hiding place, Canis felt sick but managed a smile when he saw Arin and presented her with the bread.\n\"Arin, look! I got this.\"\n\"Really? Wow, that's great.\"\n\"Haha, I've got the knack for it. I'll get more in the future. Eat up.\"\nArin looked at the bread with sad eyes. She wanted to help find food, but stepping outside as a girl in Radum was suicidal.\nShe never talked to anyone but Canis. Social phobia developed, but what did it matter? At least she wasn't someone's food.\n\"Let's eat together, Canis.\"\n\"I'm fine. I found stuff while roaming. I even ate a big centipede for nutrition. You can't eat that, so you should eat this.\"\n\"I can eat it too. Stop treating me like a child.\"\nCanis gripped Arin's shoulder tenderly.\n\"Arin, I know you're brave. But you shouldn't. Do you understand? The only reason I can endure this hellish Radum is that I can feed you like a human. If you become like me, you might go mad. So, eat.\"\nArin usually pretended to be defeated and bit the bread. But this time was different.\nShe looked at Canis's mouth, noticing something stuck there with a stench.\n\"Canis, what did you eat?\"\nCanis panicked.\n\"Oh? Haha! It's cake. I licked some cream off it, maybe it's stuck. Sorry, I was so hungry...!\"\nSlap!\nCanis's face swung violently. He'd been hit countless times in back alleys, but never had he felt such a painful slap.\n\"Arin...\"\nArin looked at him with a frightening expression he had never seen before.\n\"You bastard... How could you do this to me! Am I livestock? Are you raising me? Then you give me this to eat? What am I to you!\"\n\"Arin, it's not like that! This is punishment for me! It has nothing to do with you!\"\n\"I don't need this!\"\nArin threw the bread away. Watching it roll in the dust, Canis turned angrily.\n\"Arin! What are you doing! Do you know how hard I worked to get this...!\"\nArin pulled Canis's face to hers and kissed him. She licked something off his lips, tears streaming from her eyes.\nIt wasn't a sweet kiss. Not a beautiful exchange of emotions between humans. Just two creatures, born as sinners, sympathizing with each other.\nCanis finally realized what he had eaten. For the first time, tears flowed. A lifetime of suppressed sadness burst out.\n\"Sob! Sob!\"\n\"Don't ever do that again. If you do, I can't stay with you anymore.\"\n\"I'm sorry, Arin. Don't leave. You're my only family, my reason to live.\"\n\"Okay. Let's live, Canis. We must survive.\"\nOverwhelmed with sorrow, Canis couldn't respond and just nodded. But Arin didn't forgive him. That day, she didn't eat until Canis had eaten every bit of the bread from the ground.\nCanis recounted his past as if narrating someone else's life.\n\"We lived in hell. But our master saved us there. He gave us food, gave me the power to protect Arin, and even bestowed upon us the essence of dark magic, Harvest.\"\nPeople's gazes turned towards Harvest, who usually was talkative but remained silent this time.\n\"I get it,\" Shirone said, \"I understand the life you've led. But that doesn't justify killing people. Just because you had a harder life doesn't make doing bad things right.\"\n\"Don't be mistaken. I'm not defending myself, I'm teaching you. Your so-called justice is shallow, and the world you live in is hypocritical. It wasn't your kind of justice that saved me and Arin. I just act on what I believe in.\"\n\"Harming others won't get you anything. If you don't try to understand others first, your past will never receive the solace it needs.\"\n\"Ha! Solace? You're spouting nonsense until the end. Want to know the situation now? Our master is going to obliterate this entire school. That includes your friends.\"\n\"No. You can't hurt anyone. Except yourself.\"\nShirone raised a photon above his hand, and Harvest extended his broad palm to shield Canis. Seeing it wasn't enough, he stretched his other arm around Canis.\n\"What are you doing, Harvest? There's no need to be scared.\"\n\"It's dangerous. There's something off about his energy.\"\nCanis scoffed, already having measured Shirone's strength in the forest. He was a decent talent for a magic academy student but still just a greenhouse flower.\n\"Hmph. To me, it's just...\"\nCanis's expression went blank. The photon cannon hovering above Shirone's palm vibrated frighteningly. More powerful than the one cast in the forest. But Canis couldn't have been holding back, considering the severity of his injuries.\n'What's going on? He has this ability and still...'\nWhat Canis and Harvest overlooked was the fact that Shirone was an Unlocker, having opened the realm of the infinite.\n\"This is your last chance. Release the mind control.\"\nCanis frowned, his pride hurt by the realization he couldn't underestimate Shirone.\n\"What a joke. Even if I die, I'll follow my master's will. I can't break my belief.\"\nShirone's eyes turned cold. The power of the Immortal Function enhanced the photon cannon, making it unlike anything before.\n\"I don't want to hurt people. But if you try to harm the students, I have no choice.\"\n\"Release their memories, or...\"\nThe photon cannon burst into light, transforming into a chillingly cold sphere of white light.\n\"I'll have to harm you.\"\nThadd's forehead was drenched with cold sweat as he tried to counteract Viltor Arcane's magic, trying photonization magic on Alpheas's head. \"Phew. Such powerful mind control. Even in today's age, it would be effective.\"\nAt first, Thadd underestimated it. Even with the title of Archmage, 40 years had passed. Magic had evolved over several generations, and dark magic had become obsolete.\nBut Abyss Nova was a complex spell beyond Thadd's analysis, even as a beneficiary of cutting-edge magic.\nAfter 20 minutes, the light's energy finally penetrated the core of darkness. Then Thadd pushed the light with all his mental strength. The darkness lifted, and Alpheas's memories started unfolding along the stream of light.\n40 years ago in Bashuka, Thormia Kingdom.\nA magic craze unlike any before swept through the kingdom. King Adolph XII, unlike his military-obsessed predecessor, was full of intellect and kindness.\nUpon his coronation, he separated the magic department, previously limited to military, and gathered numerous talents.\nStudents from provinces and other countries came to study in Bashuka, turning the capital's streets into daily hubs of intellectual conversation.\nYoung mages fresh from magic school gathered in pubs for debates, a common sight.\nVividly colored gypsy-style clothing was in vogue.\nFor women, short hair revealing the neck was a symbol of intellect, while men wore their hair down to the waist.\nThe pubs were scenes of intellectual clashes and factional fights, leading to arrests by the guards.\nThe most famous pub was \"Homeland of the Ancient Gods,\" with a large hall and over 200 tables. People frequently ascended the central podium to express their magical views.\nThe place was a hub of magic debates and real-time gossip among nobles.\nIt was a romantic era.\nAlpheas reminisced about his golden youth.\n\"Hey, girls! Look who's here! Alpheas is coming!\"\nA woman's excitement at the pub entrance drew the ladies' attention to the door.\n\"Hello, ladies! Always so lively here!\"\nBlond-haired Alpheas, his hair reaching his waist, entered the \"Homeland of the Ancient Gods.\" With him was Klumph Ogent, sporting an out-of-fashion buzz cut.\nDespite being invisible to the ladies, Klumph, a swordsman, was ignored as they flocked to Alpheas.\n\"We waited for you, Alpheas! What magic will you teach us today?\"\n\"First, let's quench my throat. My tongue stiffens up without alcohol.\"\n\"Ha ha! So funny, Alpheas. You're truly entertaining.\"\nAlpheas would have been ridiculed by his current students, but back then, he was a popular figure, charming in any conversation.\nHe was the scion of a first-class family, valedictorian of the magic school, with good looks and refinement. Perhaps no woman disliked him?\nMen, however, viewed Alpheas with disdain. Even those not petty enough to be jealous harbored unkind thoughts towards him, reflecting the resentment he faced from men.\nThe light of the Myrhe family.\nThat was Alpheas's official title at the time, but those who knew him had another nickname for him.\nProud Alpheas.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Battle of Wits (3)\nAnyone immersed in the world of magic would recognize Alpheas as a man chosen by the gods. The problem was his tendency to flaunt his talent indiscriminately, regardless of time and place.\nOnce embroiled in a debate, he would see it through to the end, relentlessly digging into even the slightest mistake made by his opponent to extract an admission of defeat.\nOnly a few, like Klumph, knew that Alpheas's actions weren't driven by malice. He wasn't arrogant; he was simply too passionate, which often exhausted others.\nIn truth, Alpheas would graciously acknowledge his own mistakes and celebrate the victory of others. The problem was, such instances were rare.\nAlpheas, seemingly bored even while waiting for his beer, wandered around the tables engaging with others. Klumph watched him, worried about potential trouble but too drained to intervene.\n\"Saroph! You're having a drink in broad daylight?\"\nAlpheas greeted Saroph, a native of the capital and one of his few rivals. Although always defeated in debates, Saroph was considered the most promising in the photon field if Alpheas were out of the picture. Saroph's feelings towards Alpheas were understandably complex, but Alpheas, unfazed, approached him.\n\"Right, Saroph, I heard you submitted a paper to the palace recently? I read a bit of it, quite interesting.\"\n\"What? Why did you read my paper?\"\n\"Isn't it obvious? I'm also specialized in photons, and the royal librarian is my avid follower. Anyway, I enjoyed it.\"\nSaroph brightened at the praise but Alpheas didn't stop there.\n\"But there was one error. About the wave nature of light. That's a clearly wrong theory.\"\n\"What are you talking about? Light being a wave is a fact proven by experiments.\"\n\"That may be, but I disagree. Recent experiments suggest that light cannot be explained by wave theory alone. Perhaps light is closer to particles.\"\n\"Hah! Alpheas, now you resort to gossip? Critics have pointed out errors in particle theory experiments! If light is a particle, how do you explain its wave nature? They're completely different concepts!\"\nThe debate over light being a particle or a wave was a hot issue in Alpheas's time. Although wave theory was prevalent, some scholars, including Alpheas, continually challenged it.\n\"Do you really trust those critics? I've seen the documents about errors in particle experiments too. But their approach wasn't scientific. Isn't that the real error?\"\nSaroph, already suffering from insomnia due to his paper, was infuriated by Alpheas's provocation.\n\"Enough! Who asked for your opinion? If you're so confident, why don't you publish your nonsense and amuse the world!\"\n\"I'm concerned, that's why I'm saying this. Even if it's rejected now, you can improve it later, right? What matters isn't the paper but realizing the truth.\"\nUnable to bear it anymore, Saroph exploded.\n\"Get lost! I won't even talk to you anymore!\"\nAlpheas returned to his table, unfazed by the conflict. He saw debates with rivals as mutually beneficial.\nBut Klumph worried for him.\nThey first met at a Bashuka inn. It had been a year since Klumph came to the capital from Creas and joined Alpheas.\nFrankly, Alpheas was unpopular. If even Klumph, a swordsman, thought so, imagine the feelings of rival mages?\n\"Alpheas, are you looking for a fight? If others can't do it, just leave it at that. Why must you correct them?\"\n\"There's no 'others' in this. Wrong is wrong, and it should be corrected. That's true intellect.\"\n\"Really now. Do you know what people call you? 'Proud Alpheas.' That's your nickname these days.\"\n\"Ha ha! I like that! Much better than the cringy 'Light of Myrhe.'\"\nMagic was a realm of talent, and Alpheas was bestowed with more than his share. No matter how much he tried to hide it, his talent shone through. To him, humility was nothing but pretense.\n\"Such is the fate of a genius. Now, come on, don't worry so much and have a drink. Hey, Laphne, take special care with the appetizers. This guy eats more than a bear.\"\n\"Ho ho! Anything for Alpheas! You seem to have everyone swooning.\"\nThe waitress Laphne gazed at him adoringly. Klumph, who had little luck with women, felt a headache coming on.\nAlpheas wasn't deeply involved in any serious relationships. Just flirting with women left and right, causing countless men to miss their chances. Not limited to magic, Alpheas was a public enemy among the local men.\n\"Now Laphne too?\nWhy don't you have a proper relationship? What are you thinking?\"\n\"Well, as you know, I am a lover of all. And it's not like I'm trying to seduce them. They just melt at my killer smile.\"\nAlpheas grinned, demonstrating his charm. Klumph, unfamiliar with flirting, tried to imitate the smile.\n\"How's this? Do I have a killer smile too?\"\n\"Ah, that's right! A real killer smile, huh? A murderer's smile. Haha!\"\n\"Are you asking for a beating?\"\n\"Hahaha! Just kidding. Actually, it looked pretty cool. Remember to wear that smile at the party later. The ladies will fall for it for sure.\"\n\"Party? Do I really have to go? I'm not even a mage.\"\nTonight, the Bastadd family was hosting a party titled 'A Night for Young Mages.' Although the family had little to do with magic, holding such events was a way for nobility to assert their status at the time.\n\"There's no rule saying only mages can attend. It's a social gathering for various circles, so you should build some connections too. Skills are important, but so are connections.\"\n\"Coming from you, that sounds funny.\"\n\"Well, what can I do? You need to climb high to spread your wings. Anyway, just come along. Who knows, you might find your other half there.\"\nKlumph, brimming with zeal for swordsmanship, had no interest in networking. But the last remark intrigued him.\nWho knows? Maybe the rustic swordsman from the countryside might fall in love with a sophisticated city girl.\nSuddenly struck with a cough, Klumph cleared his throat repeatedly.\n\"Ahem! Well, why not take a look around?\"\nThe Bastadd family's mansion, one of the wealthiest in the capital, was opulent and dazzling, nearly crossing the legal line that no noble's residence should outshine the palace itself.\nThe hall was adorned with 300 crystal chandeliers, and the marble tables with gold trim were lavishly set with delicacies from around the world.\nTo the accompaniment of musicians, nobles danced with their partners, while elder politicians chatted over wine on the side.\n\"Hello? My name is Klumph Ogent. Are you here alone?\"\n\"Kyaa!\"\nAt the sight of Klumph, a woman screamed and ran away. How could she not be frightened by a man looking like a cattle thief, grinning creepily? It was indeed a killer's smile. Shocked, Klumph froze as Alpheas approached, laughing heartily.\n\"Hahaha! You actually did it? Oh, my sides!\"\n\"Damn it! It's my fault for trusting you. By the way, where have you been until now?\"\n\"Just chatting with some lovely ladies over there. Had to keep them company, you know.\"\nKlumph looked where Alpheas pointed. Elegant city women were glancing at Alpheas, blushing.\n\"Damn. They're all looking at you, not me.\"\n\"Haha! Don't worry about it. Let's just enjoy the feast.\"\nIntrigued by the exotic dishes he couldn't find back home, Klumph decided to indulge himself, ignoring the women and heading towards the tables. Alpheas chuckled. He liked this simple yet positive friend.\nAs Klumph devoured the food, Alpheas was busy attending to nobles approaching him every five minutes. When the head of the Bastadd family came to converse, all the nobles' eyes turned to Alpheas.\n\"Pleased to meet you. You must be the renowned Alpheas.\"\n\"Honored to be recognized, sir. Thanks for inviting me to this splendid party.\"\n\"Ho ho! Mixing with young intellectuals is my pleasure. Let's see more of each other in the future.\"\n\"Of course, I'd be delighted to attend any invitation.\"\nThe conversation was brief, but for the head of the Bastadd family to engage a young mage in more than a couple of sentences was a significant sign of favor.\nPleased, Alpheas turned back to find Klumph stuffing his face with meat, causing him to look bewildered. Clearly, Klumph was venting his unstoppable energy on the food.\n\"Doesn't your jaw ever tire? Where does all that food even go?\"\nPointing to his biceps, Klumph mumbled through mouthfuls of meat. Alpheas shook his head, amused. He felt the gazes of numerous women but found them merely tedious. Then, his attention was caught by a woman darting between tables across the hall.\n\"Huh?\"\nHis first thought: definitely not a mage. She wore a simple dress, not the usual flamboyant gypsy-style attire, and her long black hair defied the short style symbolizing intellect. Carrying a plate and fork, she hopped around, completely out of sync with the decorum and dignity of the setting.\n\"Hey, isn't that the eldest daughter of the host?\"\nAt Klumph's words, Alpheas became intrigued, only half-turning to ask.\n\"The host's eldest daughter?\"\n\"You came to the party without even knowing that? You really lack manners.\"\n\"I didn't know. Go on, explain.\"\n\"Her name is Erina Bastadd, 19 years old. She's the sole troublemaker of the Bastadd family.\"\n\"Troublemaker? Because she's boisterous?\"\n\"No. She's a bit slow.\"\nAlpheas turned fully to Klumph, likely believing him. Klumph wasn't the type to joke cruelly.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Battle of Wits (4)\nWhen she was young, she had an accident. Thats why her mental age is around 10. I heard she's not even allowed out of her room. How did she end up at the party?\nAlpheas looked back at Erina with mixed feelings. However, she seemed oblivious to the stares of others, cheerfully greeting the young men around her with an innocent smile.\nAs is often the case at balls, she seemed to be looking for a dance partner, but no one offered her a kind smile. Instead, they awkwardly greeted her once and hastily left. It was only because of the Bastadd family's power that even this minimal interaction was possible.\nAlpheas glanced at the family's head sitting across the table. Predictably, the man was red-faced with anger, trying to contain his fury. Finally, he couldn't hold back and shouted at his wife.\nDidnt I tell you not to bring Erina? Take her away right now!\nDear, please be patient. Erina enjoys the party too. It'll only be worse if you force her out and she creates a scene. Leave her be; Ill discreetly take her away soon.\nUgh! Its so embarrassing. A disgrace to our family, a disgrace!\nAlpheas pursed his lower lip. He understood the sentiment but to call ones daughter a disgrace seemed too harsh. Of course, he knew well what position a first-class noble family held in society. After all, Alpheas was also born into a first-class family and had even earned the cringe-worthy nickname \"The Light of Myrhe.\"\nJust like the old fogies at home. Nobles, I tell you.\nAlpheas couldnt take his eyes off Erina for three songs' duration. He realized she was genuinely enjoying the party, satisfied just with the act of exchanging greetings.\nBut what kind of people were these mages? Arrogant beings who equate ignorance with evil. Alpheas could see that even while smiling to her face, they mocked the slow-witted Erina behind her back.\nKlumph, hold this for a sec. Actually, you drink it.\nAlpheas handed his drink over and turned towards the ballroom, but Klumph quickly stopped him.\nWhat are you planning now? Please dont cause any trouble here.\nThe idiots are rejecting the ladys kindness just because theyve learned a few words. As Bashukas most popular man, I should raise her status a bit.\nKlumphs bear-like strength spun Alpheas back around.\nAlpheas. Thats a bad idea. Sympathy for Miss Erina could be construed as mockery. The current situation is enough. Dont make her feel any more miserable.\nKlumph was serious. His usual goofy eyes were gone, replaced by a burning sense of justice. Alpheas smiled and patted Klumphs shoulder.\nAlways so simple-minded. Do you think I dont know that? Ive never deceived any woman in my life. All sins originate from discrimination, didnt you know? To start pitying her would mean confining her life in a cage. Ive got a plan, just trust me.\nAre you serious? Youre really going to do it? Hey, wait!\nAs Alpheas crossed the ballroom, he turned back to Klumph, flashing his trademark killer smile.\nDont worry. Im the lover of all.\nWhen Alpheas reached her, Erina was alone; everyone had subtly cleared the area. To her, this was just another ordinary day, happily munching on an apple.\nHello? Enjoying the ball, I see.\nStartled, Erina stopped mid-chew and blinked at Alpheas. Just by looking into her eyes, he could tell her intellectual disability.\nYet, there was an innocent purity in her gaze.\nShe mirrored emotions like a mirror, perhaps the real reason why people avoided her.\nHi! Im Erina!\nShe greeted him brightly, a contrast to her distant demeanor from afar. However, there was an unmistakable hint of fear.\nIt must be her first time someone has approached her like this.\nAlpheas bowed politely.\nIm Alpheas from Myrhe, the mage. I was so captivated by your beauty that I only just managed to come and introduce myself. If it's not too much trouble, may I have the honor of being your partner for tonights ball?\nErina gaped, a piece of apple tumbling from her open mouth. She looked completely bewildered by the situation.\nSuddenly, she bowed her head and, without a word, turned and walked past Alpheas.\nStartled, Alpheas quickly stepped in front of her.\nWait a moment, please. Was I too forward? Im sorry. I just wanted to be friends with you, Miss Erina.\nErina remained silent, just looking down, shuffling her feet, seeking an escape.\nBut Alpheas didnt give up. He blocked her path, continually trying to engage her in conversation.\nI understand. If you dont want to dance, lets just talk. I have many interesting stories. Do you like constellations?\nI want to go. Back to my room. Mom will scold me.\nWhy would your mom scold you? No ones going to scold you here. Youre at the party, and Im asking you to be my partner.\nThey told me not to talk. If someone talks to me, they are bad. I want to go to my room.\nAlpheas felt both frustrated and anxious. His usual charm with women seemed to have vanished; he was desperate just to make eye contact with Erina again.\nYoure not talking to a bad person. Look at my face. How could this be the face of a bad person?\nAlpheas grasped her shoulders. Suddenly, Erina started having a fit and screamed.\nNoooo! I dont like it!\nAll the nobles in the hall turned to look at Erina. To any observer, it looked as though Alpheas was up to no good.\nMom! Help me! Mom!\nErina, look at me! Im not trying to hurt you!\nMom! Mom!\nAmong the invited mages was Alpheas rival, Saroph, who was incredulous at Alpheas absurd behavior. He knew Alpheas was a bit off his rocker, but he never imagined him to be this insane.\nFrom charming all the women in Bashuka to now pestering a mentally challenged girl? He must be desperate for advancement.\nMost nobles shared the same thought. Even if her intelligence was lacking, Erina was still the eldest daughter of the Bastadd family. Winning her over could guarantee a secure future.\nThe only one who knew Alpheas true intentions was Klumph, but even he gave up as the situation escalated.\nDamn, hes like a lunatic. Hes made his bed, let him lie in it.\nErina was having a near-seizure, and a sane person would have let go in front of her family, but Alpheas stubbornly held onto her shoulders.\nErina, wait. Look at me. Look at me.\nMom! Im scared, Mom!\nAs Alpheas shouted, Erinas movements momentarily froze, but now they were more fearfully tremulous than ever.\nPlease, just look at my face once. Im begging you.\nSlowly, Erina turned her head with a look of terror on her face. Alpheas burning eyes met hers. His intense gaze seemed to warm her heart.\nSee? Nothing's happened. Im not a bad person. I wont do anything you dislike. But its a party, dont you want to dance?\nA hint of excitement flickered across Erinas face. The crystals refracting light, the musicians melody, the buzz of conversation she just wanted to smile like everyone else.\nMiss Erina. I want to be with you. Will you be my partner tonight?\nThere was no verbal response, but Alpheas didnt wait for one. Taking Erinas hand, he led her to the center of the hall. She followed him like a toddler taking her first steps, and for the first time, she embraced someone other than her family.\nThe quick-thinking musicians resumed playing, and Alpheas began to lead Erina in a dance. The nobility looked on in stunned silence, even Erinas parents lost for words.\nAlpheas didnt care. Erina didnt care. As if in their own world, they immersed themselves in the music. Their dance was far from graceful, more instinctive and passionate, often losing balance and bumping into others. With each collision, Erina's laughter grew louder. After about ten minutes, Erina became the star of the party.\nPlayful laughter echoed through the garden. Having almost caused a scene at the party, Alpheas and Erina had fled and were now running through the forest in disarray.\nReaching the top of a hill, Alpheas gasped for breath, his tongue hanging out. Embarrassingly, Erina seemed hardly tired, making Alpheas question his own stamina and consider cutting down on alcohol. He looked up at the night sky, brimming with stars.\nErina was surprisingly quiet, but then, Alpheas was known in Bashuka for his loquaciousness. He kept the conversation going without pause, filling the atmosphere with his chatter.\nAs time passed, it almost seemed as if Erina was drawing out his stories. She listened silently to every topic, occasionally smiling in understanding, encouraging Alpheas to talk even more.\nEventually, Alpheas began discussing his latest concern the true nature of photons.\nIs light a wave or a particle?\nSaroph believed it to be a wave, but Alpheas was convinced otherwise. Yet, he couldnt fully advocate for particle theory either.\nHonestly, he didn't know. He believed that admitting one's ignorance was the first step to understanding.\nIts strange, isnt it? Light has such unusual properties. In interference experiments, it shows wave-like behavior, but on the other hand\nAlpheas stopped, realizing he had gotten too engrossed in his own story, forgetting that his listener was Erina. She sat squatting on the grass, gazing down the hill. Yet, her smile remained beautiful.\nHaha! Did I talk too much? Its the first time Ive had such a long conversation. Normally, people get bored.\nYou are a good person.\nIt was the first sentence Erina had spoken. Alpheas blinked in surprise, feeling his heartbeat quicken inexplicably.\nHis mind was in turmoil.\nWhy am I here? What do I expect from this woman?\nIt was an unknown world, a mixture of wanting to explore and fear, preventing any judgment.\nAlpheas chose to ignore it. Continuing his conversation as if he hadnt heard her.\nHaha! Embarrassing to say, but as a mage, I need to write a thesis, and I dont know anything. I cant decide which theory to pursue. What do you think, Miss Erina? Is light a wave or a particle?\nErina didnt seem upset by his change in attitude. Standing up, she looked at the stars and said\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Battle of Wits (5)\n\"Light is beauty.\"\n\"Huh? What did you say?\"\nAlpheas Myrhe asked again. It was natural for her not to know about photonics, but this kind of answer was unexpected.\n\"Light is beautiful. Flowers are beautiful too. We are beautiful too. But the light you talk about... it doesnt sound beautiful.\"\nAlpheas felt as if he had been struck in the head with a hammer. It was a direct hit of pure thought, unforgeable in language.\n\"That's true. But why is light beautiful?\"\nTo Alpheas, light was merely photons. But Erina Bastadd answered without hesitation, as if she knew everything.\n\"Light shows us darkness. Without light, how could we see the night sky?\"\nThe world fell silent, like the universe itself.\nAlpheas couldn't say anything. Thoughts he truly desired cascaded over him like a waterfall.\nWhy did I try to separate the two? When I step back, it all becomes so clear.\nBecause its beautiful.\nEvery contradiction ceases to be a contradiction.\n\"Beauty... It is indeed beautiful, Miss Erina.\"\nErina turned her head with a childlike, pure smile. At that moment, Alpheas decided.\nHe would remember this moment for the rest of his life.\nAlpheas knelt on one knee before Erina and extended his right hand in the most respectful gesture.\n\"Please be my light.\"\n40 years ago, that night.\nThe confession under the moonlight was an irreplaceably happy memory for Alpheas Myrhe. As the shroud of Abyss Nova lifted, a gentle smile lingered on his lips.\nCanis stared intently at the white glow burning in Shirone Arian's palm. It was an overwhelmingly dominant presence. Of course, he was ready to rush towards death with his aggressive nature. However, he believed that even in death, one must reclaim whats owed.\n-Harvest. I'm in favor of fighting. Lets face him.\n-That magic. How fast is it? It might be unavoidable.\n-You can block it.\n-If I can't block it, you'll die. If you die, I cease to exist too. We have to fight, but there are too many variables.\nExchanging thoughts at the speed of thought was a huge advantage in battle. However, when opinions diverged so drastically, it was unclear what decision to make.\n\"Whats going on here?\"\nThe tension was broken by an unexpected voice. A shadow flowed like water from the cliff, and a gaunt old man emerged from the dark surface.\nIt was Archmage Viltor Arcane.\nRealizing the situation at a glance, Arcane's expression soured. He had been able to devote his full power against Ethella Romie because he was confident that this situation would have already been resolved.\nArcane trusted Canis. Or more precisely, he trusted Harvest, who was subservient to Canis.\nYet, upon arrival, the situation was completely different. Lucas lay miserably defeated, and Canis with Harvest were being intimidated by a mere boy.\n\"Im sorry, Master.\"\nArcane was not a forgiving man. Ignoring Canis's apology, he turned coldly and glared at Shirone.\n'So familiar.'\nHe resembled Alpheas. Not the face or the appearance, but the overall temperament. Even under the gaze of the Archmage, Shirone had the audacity to speak his mind.\n\"Did you plan all this?\"\n\"Such audacity for a young one. Whats your name?\"\n\"I dont want to tell my name to a murderer. Release the mind control and leave the school. If not, I wont let you go.\"\n\"Heh heh heh.\"\nArcane burst into raucous laughter. He wasn't angry, but his standard for killing someone wasn't anger, but how much amusement he could derive. In that regard, Shirone was ripe fruit, ready to be plucked.\n\"Sorry, but I can't release the mind control. Because Alpheas's students must die.\"\nFeeling the murderous intent, Shirone instinctively fired the Photon Canon, a clear accidental shot.\nArcane easily dodged the Photon Canon with a light twist of his body, waiting until the magic dissipated before turning back.\n\"Spirit Zone with a radius of 52.7 meters. Impressive. Quite a level for your age.\"\nEven photons, when given mass, can't surpass the limits of physical laws. However, the basic speed of photon output meant it was much faster than any typical flying object. Dodging the Photon Canon in an instant and measuring the radius of the Spirit Zone was beyond human perception.\nShirone clenched his teeth and concentrated photons again. Facing an inscrutable master, he had no choice but to fight to prevent hundreds of students from free-falling off the cliff.\n\"Stop, Shirone.\"\nEthella emerged from the woods. Her clothes were torn, revealing her skin, and she was covered in dirt from head to toe.\n\"Don't rush in recklessly. Arcane is a dangerous man.\"\nViltor Arcanes brows furrowed. He had enjoyed their battle, but he had long forgotten about her, like food trampled underfoot.\n\"A loser with such audacity. Shouldn't you cherish the life I spared?\"\nShirone's group was shocked. Could it be true that Ethella, a bishop of the Karsis Order and an authority on the Spirit Zone, had been defeated by this frail old man?\n\"It's impossible. Ethella...\"\nNade couldn't believe it. Of course, there are higher ranks like Grade 5 and 4, but it was unimaginable what kind of level one must be to surpass Ethella.\n\"Are you okay, Teacher?\"\n\"I'm hanging in there. But it will take time to recover.\"\n\"What happened? Who is that man? Why is he doing this?\"\n\"Viltor Arcane. A Grand Archmage who ascended to unofficial Grade 3 forty years ago.\"\nThe group's eyes wavered. Every student at the Alpheas Magic Academy knew what unofficial Grade 3 meant in the world of magic.\n\"Arcane bears a grudge against Headmaster Alpheas. He won't back down until he gets what he wants.\"\n\"Blathering on and on. Complaining to your students only makes you more pitiful.\"\n\"I'm not interested in competing. Im a teacher. I'll do whatever it takes to protect my students.\"\n\"And what can you do? Can you stop me now, when you couldn't win against me at full strength?\"\n\"Such arrogance. Arcane.\"\nArcane's expression turned menacing.\n\"Indeed, I couldn't stop you. But you must be lacking the mental capacity to focus on the battle now, arent you?\"\nEthella's statement was half right, half wrong. Indeed, having cast Abyss Nova, Arcane's magical power was only a tenth of his normal state. But it was still a tenth of a Grand Archmage's power. Enough to sweep away a weakened Ethella and these fledgling students.\n\"The times have changed. Spoiled by affection, now they blabber without knowing their place.\"\nArcane gathered his magic power. The 10% he had reserved for killing Alpheas didnt matter. Calculations like that didn't fit his philosophy of life.\n\"Master, please leave it to me.\"\nCanis intervened. Abyss Nova was a grand magic spell that even ordinary mages couldn't attempt due to its immense consumption of mental energy. Having cast it and engaged in battle, even his master wouldnt be in top condition.\nArcane looked displeasedly at Canis. Even if he was a disciple, challenging his authority was unacceptable. But after some thought, he looked at Shirone with interest.\n\"Hey, boy. You too are a student of Alpheas?\"\n\"Don't mention Headmaster Alpheas's name so casually, you murderer.\"\n\"Ha ha ha! Is that so? You respect him that much?\"\nShirone didnt feel the need to answer. How could he not respect Alpheas? He was the one who opened his eyes to magic and allowed him, a commoner, to enroll in the magic academy.\n\"It doesn't matter if youre a Grand Archmage or Grade 3. Compared to Headmaster Alpheas, you're not even a mage.\"\n\"Ha ha ha ha!\"\nArcane burst into laughter, but his eyes burned with rage.\n'Alpheas. How much hypocrisy have you lived with? You know as well as I do that you don't deserve to be respected by anyone.'\nDeciding, Arcane nodded.\n\"Fine. Let the disciples fight. It should be entertaining. Canis. Face him.\"\n\"Yes. Thank you, Master.\"\nCanis finally felt relieved. This was an opportunity to make up for all his past mistakes. However, Harvest thought differently.\n-Canis. Rethink this. It's better to leave it to Arcane.\n-What are you talking about? I've already disappointed Master. Now, even if I die, I must defeat Shirone.\nThe disagreement in their opinions at this critical moment was not a good sign.\n-Harvest. Answer me. Even for you, I can't concede this time. We must fight.\nHarvest remained silent. Unprecedented for Canis, he was bewildered. But with Arcane watching, he couldnt show any weakness.\nUsing Dark Port, Canis instantly moved to where Shirone was. Shirone, in turn, used Teleportation to fly out over the cliff, trying to avoid affecting the students as much as possible.\n\"Ha! Are we fighting in the air?\"\nIn the dark night sky, Dark Port's movement was not disadvantageous for Canis.\nAbove the 1,000-meter abyss, the two engaged in a battle reminiscent of eagles, unleashing their firepower.\nShirone condensed seven photons in front and fired them all at once. The Photon Canon, activated in the Infinite Realm, was several times more powerful but also had tremendous recoil.\nEach time he cast the spell, his consciousness briefly slipped away. Threatening the opponent while simultaneously collapsing his own mental strength, the Infinite Realm was indeed a double-edged sword.\n\"What is that...\"\nEthella stared blankly at the sky. The shockwaves of the photon output were something she had never seen before.\nThe brilliant trails of the Photon Canon split the night sky, like golden ink swirling on a black canvas.\nYiruki and Nade were captivated by the rays of light. Shirone, firing the Photon Canon indiscriminately, was practically weaponized.\n\"Indeed impressive. But is that okay?\"\n\"We have no choice but to trust him. He did well at the presentation, didnt he?\"\n\"But it's different now. He's risking his life in battle. He might cross the line without realizing it.\"\nEthella turned to them and asked.\n\"What do you mean? So Shirone has entered Immortal Function before?\"\n\"Yes? Oh, well... lately, he seems to do it whenever he's bored.\"\nEthella sighed. Despite being warned about the risk to his life, he didn't even pretend to be cautious. Then again, such passion was necessary for his rapid growth.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Adverse Dominance\nCanis, frantically dodging the blinding flashes of the Photon Canon, was in unprecedented panic. Why wasn't he getting tired? It seemed as if the limit to his mental strength had vanished.\n-Harvest! At this rate, we'll be done for!\nThere was still no response from Harvest. Unprecedented in their history, this silence was ominous. And the reason behind it was unclear. Harvest wasn't a foolish magical creature that would stay silent in battle just because of a disagreement in opinions.\n-Harvest! Answer me!\nA Photon Canon brushed past Canis, who hastily twisted his waist to dodge. It was clearly a delayed reaction. It wasn't that he avoided it; it was that he wasn't hit.\n\"What's going on?\"\nAbout a dozen flashes were fired by Shirone, but the aim wasn't precise. Canis then realized something. The numerous flashes were annihilating all the darkness, blocking his Dark Port routes.\n'Insane...!'\nIf he couldn't hit, he would trap and beat him that was the strategy. It made sense but was too brute-force, wasn't it? Photon Canon, a magic spell that consumes a lot of mental strength, had already been fired more than 200 times. But instead of tiring, the number of flashes was increasing.\n'How immense is his mental strength?'\nChilled by the thought, Canis felt despair as dozens of Photon Canons filled his view, blocking all escape routes through Dark Port.\n'I can't escape this. It's over.'\nHe felt bitter and resentful. More than dying, the fact that he was being defeated by a light mage in front of his master was scarier.\n-Annoying. Arcane.\n-Harvest?\nFor the first time since the aerial battle began, the mental channel opened. Harvest blocked Canis's path and took the Photon Canon hits. The consecutive shockwaves made the magical creature's body shudder, emitting strange moans.\nUnable to absorb through its surface alone, Harvest opened its body wide and swallowed the Photon Canon whole. Its body twitched, and its once slender waist ballooned like a balloon. It began digesting the photons at full capacity, and gradually, its body shrank back to its original form.\n\"Cough...!\"\nCanis bent over, shocked. Harvest was able to absorb the Photon Canon because it drew upon his mental strength without permission. However, unilaterally borrowing power without consent was impossible under the master-servant contract.\n-Harvest?\n-Get it together and prepare!\nHaving drained all of Canis's mental strength, Harvest rushed towards Shirone, swinging its claws. Shirone, not adept at close combat, was cornered. Harvest's speed was nimble enough to catch up with his teleportation. How could this be? It even seemed much stronger than Canis.\nEthella, thinking the same, looked at Arcane. Watching the battle with emotionless eyes, she understood the situation.\n'Viltor Arcane. You are truly cruel.'\nAttaching the supreme magical creature to Canis wasn't out of love for his disciple. To the revenge-driven Arcane, a disciple was merely a tool to achieve his goals. Canis was just a fuel tank to maximize Harvest's power.\nAs Shirone increased the speed of his teleportation, Harvest's movements became faster. Canis's complexion turned as pale as a corpse. Completely drained of mental strength, he couldn't even think. Only feelings of betrayal and deprivation echoed in his mind.\n-Harvest. Why?\nOnly silence returned. Realizing who the real master was, life faded from Canis's eyes. All past events flashed before him, bringing tears.\nShirone retreated to the ground. Blood flowed from a wound as if cut by a sword.\n'The Photon Canon doesn't work. There's not much time left for Immortal Function.'\nCanis, who came down with Harvest, leaned on the ground, his pupils out of focus. Harvest, unconcerned, charged at Shirone. It had to end the battle before Canis's mental strength completely ran out.\nDodging Harvest's razor-sharp claw attacks, Shirone thought. Until a moment ago, he had the upper hand, but the situation had been reversed in an instant.\nReversal of master and servant.\nThe situation changed as Harvest, previously just a support for Canis, took the forefront. A magical creature without fear of death. Could there be a more difficult enemy on the battlefield? Harvest moved as a war machine, feeding on the life force from Canis, the fuel tank.\n'A war machine...?'\nShirone suddenly realized his mistake. He hadn't noticed it, blinded by Harvest's intelligence. The reversal of master and servant simply meant that the enemy changed from a living being to an inanimate object. Naturally, his magic needed to adapt accordingly.\nShirone canceled the Photon Canon and cast Photon Output. The Photon Canon was dangerous because of its impact force on living beings. However, for lifeless Harvest, physical force was irrelevant. If it specialized in absorbing energy, then overwhelming it with energy beyond its limit was the solution.\nPhoton Output, being pure magic without even mass, was easier to wield than Photon Canon. Moreover, the Immortal Function was still active. When Shirone's power, channeled through 300 hologram devices around the campus, converged, a beam large enough to cover a human body was fired.\n\"Aaaaaah!\"\nHarvest was pushed back, buried in the light. Although it had no physical force, smoke rose from its body made of dark matter. However, immune to light, the properties of the photons were of no help. Only the energy contained in the photons could whittle it down.\n'I need even stronger energy.'\nShirone recalled the core principle of photonization theory: energy is mass times the speed of light squared. The Particle of God provides mass. If so, reversing the photonization theory's formula to convert mass into energy was also possible.\nReconfiguring the photon output's power source to be mass-based, he combined it with the omnipotence of the Immortal Function. Mass began converting into energy in real-time. When theory and reality perfectly aligned, the exhilarating feeling was incomparable. Stepping into an unknown world for the first time, Shirone felt a thrill.\n\"What... what is that?\"\nEveryone watching the battle widened their eyes. The photon output began to narrow and emit a crimson hue. Although the nature of the magic was unknown, the color itself was threatening.\nYiruki recalled a phenomenon of light his father had mentioned.\n\"Is that... a laser?\"\n\"Laser? What's that?\"\n\"A state where light energy is highly amplified. You could say it's the ultimate evolution of the flash series. But how is that possible?\"\nA laser was a matter of brute strength, not talent or effort. At least ten years of mental rebounding was needed before photons could be amplified to laser intensity.\nHowever, it's a different story if approached mathematically. Shirone, reconfiguring photonization theory with the Particle of God, amplified the energy through mass conversion instead of brute strength. Essentially, his unique power source developed a new route.\n\"Aaaaaah!\"\nHarvest writhed in pain. The laser was extremely thin compared to photon output, but the concentrated energy was unimaginably powerful. The color was never the issue. The real danger was the invisible heat rays outside the red spectrum. The single-wavelength laser vibrated molecules, generating immense heat.\n\"Harvest!\"\nCanis, clutching his throbbing head in agony, shouted. The immense shock hitting his brain meant that in just 2 seconds, Harvest had exceeded its energy absorption limit. This was the power of Shirone's new magic, Laser Pulse Cannon.\nHarvest struggled to digest the energy, but the vibration speed of the molecules was too fast. As the absorption reached saturation, its body swelled enormously, ballooning up like a balloon.\nEthella observed Arcane's reaction. Despite the clearly dire situation, his expression remained unchanged, stirring unease within her.\n\"Canis! Just give up!\"\nWhat would be the next state of the massively swollen Harvest? It could be dissolution, but perhaps something even more dreadful awaited.\n\"Shut up! I will fight!\"\n\"You're being deceived by Arcane, Canis. Harvest isn't your subordinate. Rather, you've been its subordinate all along. Arcane just used you.\"\nCanis didn't respond. It wouldn't be true to say he felt nothing. He had suspected this possibility since he was first told that the ultimate product of an archmage, a magical creature, would be his. He just lacked the courage to face reality. Accepting the truth meant he would be left with nothing.\n\"I will win! I'm not afraid to die! I'll never surrender to you people!\"\nWhen he came to his senses, he found himself in Radum, the world's hell. To Arcane, he was just expendable. To Harvest, whom he thought was a friend, he was merely a fuel tank. Now, nothing mattered anymore. Only his hatred for the world remained.\n'Canis...'\nArin covered her mouth, tears streaming down. Canis had always been that kind of boy, poor and suffering, with nothing to offer to those he loved but his own pain.\n\"Master! Please save Canis! I beg you!\"\nShe didn't even consider him a master anymore. Still, she swallowed her pride, pleading to save Canis. But Arcane only coldly commanded Harvest, indifferent to the plea.\n\"End it here, Harvest.\"\nHarvest, in a state of energy saturation, couldn't respond. Even attempting to vocalize through vibration could cause an explosion. And that was exactly what Arcane desired.\n-Canis. Listen.\n-Harvest.\n-Arcane intends to detonate me. Probably, everyone here will be caught in the blast. Then, both you and I will be finished.\nArin released the students from mental control. Then, running towards Arcane with tears and snot streaming, she pleaded.\n\"Save Canis! If not, I'll never forgive you!\"\n\"Arin!\"\nCanis, rising up, said,\n\"What are you doing to the master? Stop right now.\"\n\"Canis! This man... he...\"\n\"Yes. The master saved us from hell. He helped us escape Radum. That's enough for me. I'll fight to the end.\"\nWas Canis's word sincere? But it no longer mattered. His rage burned so fiercely that even his own death felt satisfying.\n\"Yeah! We'll all die together!\"\nCanis screamed to the sky, hot tears rolling down his cheeks. His life had been filthy. But if that was his fate, he would embrace a nauseating end to the last.\n\"Aaaaaah!\"\nBubbles erupted over Harvest's body as molecules boiled. Everyone knew what Arcane wanted to blow up the entire school.\n\"Shirone! Stop! Harvest is going to explode!\"\nShirone, engrossed in releasing energy, abruptly stopped upon hearing Ethella's words. But the chain reaction in Harvest's body was already underway, foreboding secondary and tertiary explosions.\n\"Hahaha! Farewell! Dying with trash like me must be disgusting! This ends everything!\"\n-Canis. I'm sorry.\nCanis's face hardened.\n-I'm going to release the master-servant contract.\nHarvest absorbed all of Canis's remaining mental strength and released the contract. Canis, feeling as if his soul was being ripped out, collapsed in shock.\n\"Why... Harvest...\"\nHarvest soared into the sky. How many seconds were left until the explosion? 3 seconds? 2 seconds? In the final moments of life, memories seeped in vibration form. Harvest. Harvest. Harvest. The constantly calling voice was now beyond reach, and Harvest felt regretful.\n'Hehehe. Canis. That's your problem. You pretend to be strong unnecessarily.'\nNever fearing death, as it had no life to begin with, Harvest was just worried. The sense of betrayal received through the mental channel was still palpable, as if they were one. But now, unable to convey anything, Harvest just hoped.\n\"I hope Canis isn't too hurt.\"\nAt an altitude of 2 kilometers, where voices couldn't reach the ground, the mouth on the shadowy face grotesquely split.\n\"It was fun, though, Canis.\"\nBoom!\nA massive explosion, shattering the world's darkness, erupted.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Genius Lost in Light (1)\n\"Your name is Harvest.\"\nAt Arcane's words, the black orb vibrated. Its molecular bonds loosened, and black matter rose like smoke. Born from darkness, the monstrous entity spoke in a muffled voice.\n\"I am Harvest.\"\n\"I will run a few tests. For now, stay inside the test tube.\"\nArcane pointed to a 3-meter-tall glass tube. It was an uncomfortably narrow space for humans, but for a magical creature, the concept of enduring time was irrelevant.\nThat night, Canis and Arin sneaked into the lab. Without Arcane's permission, tension was evident. However, their anxiety dissipated the moment they saw Harvest.\nA 2-meter-tall humanoid shadow.\nWith a slender waist and dynamically broad shoulders, Canis was deeply impressed.\n\"This is the master's...\"\nThe pinnacle of magical biology, perfected by the archmage over 150 years. Plus, being a magical creature endowed with Arcane's intellect.\nUnlike Canis, Arin shuddered, as if looking at a monstrosity.\n\"Eww, so weird. I thought it'd be more human-like.\"\n\"Magical creatures must look intimidating, right? To me, this form is truly remarkable. Its combat-effective.\"\n\"But I find it strange...\"\nCanis didn't care. If she disliked it, all the better.\n'Wait for me, Harvest. I will become your master.'\nArcane had said he would choose between him and Arin to be Harvest's master. Of course, Arin was a dear friend, but there was no room for compromise in this matter. He was determined to prove his worth through a fair competition.\n\"Canis, let's leave. The master might come.\"\n\"Uh? Oh, right.\"\nArin followed Canis, switching off the lights. Then, she suddenly looked back, feeling the intense emotions vibrating from Harvest.\n\"Goodness!\"\nShe fled the room as if escaping and never returned to the lab. However, having been trapped in a warehouse in Radum as a child, she couldnt just leave Harvest like that.\nDuring the night, when everyone was asleep, Arin mustered the courage to visit the lab. Harvest was still trapped in the glass tube.\n\"Do you feel trapped?\"\nWhen she received no response, Arin examined the tube's mechanism, looking for a switch.\n\"I could let you out for a moment.\"\n\"Why do you think I feel trapped?\"\nArin stepped back, startled by the chilling voice.\n\"You've been locked up for a month.\"\n\"Not being able to move is inconvenient for humans. I can't perceive time. I dont mind being trapped forever.\"\nArin looked puzzled, sensing Harvest's suppressed and uneasy energy.\n\"Maybe you're right.\"\n\"What comes to your mind?\"\n\"Curiosity, perhaps? That's not quite the right term. I was created to learn from the moment of existence. But now, thats impossible.\"\n\"That's what we call frustration.\"\nHarvest pondered. Could that be true?\n\"How can you read my emotions?\"\n\"Hehe, just ended up this way. I lived in Radum for a long time.\"\n\"Radum. Thormia's capital Bashuka's slum. A den of demi-folk who lost territory on the continent. Concealed in hardship and drastic population changes.\"\nEven Arin, who lived in Radum, was hearing this for the first time.\n\"You know a lot, Harvest.\"\n\"What information do you have?\"\n\"Are you asking for a conversation?\"\n\"It seems so. I have no master to share minds with yet.\"\nArin talked with Harvest throughout the night. It was her first time having such a long conversation with anyone, having spent most of her youth alone.\nAfter two months of experimentation, Harvest finally gained freedom. Arcane opened the glass tube. However, Harvest remained motionless.\n\"Come out. You will resonate with Canis, but won't be restricted as a subordinate. I'll explain the reasons later.\"\nHarvest didn't respond. A delay from a magical creature with superhuman computing speed was unusual, prompting Arcane to turn around.\n\"Why? Is there a problem?\"\n\"Why Canis?\"\n\"Hmm. You dont like it? It's strange for you, who havent formed a mental resonance, to have preferences already.\"\n\"I understand that being subordinate to you, who shares your memory, offers no benefit. But Canis is stubborn and prideful. He's unlikely to heed my advice. Such traits could be a weakness in battle.\"\n\"Indeed, that is true.\"\n\"On the other hand, Arin is different. She lived in Radum for 10 years and hadn't met anyone besides Canis. This caused her to have an incredibly sensitive mental resonance due to her rebellion.\"\n\"Are you talking about synesthesia?\"\nSynesthesia is a unique brainwave pattern where everything is perceived as if being seen for the first time. Arin grew up without seeing anything, causing her brain to solidify in that state. Hence, she couldn't distinguish objects like ordinary people. However, she was absolutely adept at sensing the emotions imbued in objects. Despite its inconveniences, this was a supreme talent for a psychic-type mage.\nArcane also knew that Arin's talents were more exceptional than Canis's.\n\"Arin is not suitable. Her heart is too soft.\"\n\"I don't understand. Synesthesia more than covers any other shortcomings. With her, my abilities could be maximized.\"\nArcane gave a bitter smile.\nHaving the same memories but different forms led to different judgments, then?\n\"Maybe you're right, more logically speaking. But Arin is out of the question. You're going to Canis.\"\n\"Kekekekeke!\"\nFalling, Harvest's body twitched.\n\"So that was it, Arcane.\"\nOnly in the last moments of life did Harvest realize why Arcane had specifically chosen Canis over the magically talented Arin.\n'Same stubbornness.'\nHarvest's fall seemed more pitiful as it couldn't feel the weight.\n\"Harvest!\"\nCanis rushed to Harvest. The shriveled-up body of Harvest, with holes here and there, was too gruesome to behold.\n\"Why! Why did you do it! I didn't care if I died! If you were going to betray me, why start at all! Why?\"\n\"Kekeke. How should I know? You're my master.\"\nCanis clammed up, realizing something.\n\"A magical creature does what its master wants.\"\n\"Harvest...\"\nCanis's head dropped. He felt bitter and wronged about living, but part of him wanted to live. Why wouldn't he? That's human nature. It seemed Harvest knew this. That's why it broke the master-servant contract and decided to self-destruct.\n\"Sorry, Harvest. I...\"\nHarvest didn't care. A magical creature does what its master desires. That's how it was designed, so death wasn't shocking. Rather, Harvest was more intrigued by Shirone's combat ability that overpowered their combined play.\n'Hmm. Strange magic. But it's not just about being outmatched in magic.'\nHe was definitely a strong opponent. Unhesitant in overpowering the enemy, yet not aggressive. Rather, a methodical focus on the outcome resembled a magical creature.\n'His recovery of emotions is incredibly fast. Probably superhuman insight. The journey from problem to solution is so short that it seems unshakable.'\nHaving analyzed, Harvest twisted its lips. Specialized in something unfathomable. Not a common trait in nature.\n'Kekeke. Arcane, you're in for a hard time.'\nArcane's expression was not good. Everyone was acting against his wishes. Frustrated with the situation, he slowly walked and spoke.\n\"Pitiful, Canis. Even after disgracing me...\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nShirone interrupted. His friends widened their eyes at his unusual aggressiveness. Arcane, surprised, turned his head.\n\"Hahah! What a spirited lad. What if I make a proposition?\"\n\"Didnt you hear me? Shut up.\"\nEven Arcane had to stiffen his face this time.\n\"I'm already struggling to restrain myself. So shut it. One more word and I'll smash you.\"\nShirone's body glowed with a faint red light. The laser. Its power was already proven. Even Arcane, specialized in energy absorption, could be overwhelmed by it.\nBut his friends couldn't help but feel blood run cold. Arcane was a world-dominating archmage, and Shirone was just a student. This provocation was akin to suicide.\n\"What are you doing? You'll really cause trouble!\"\n\"No, it'll be fine.\"\nNade and Yiruki turned to Ethella.\n\"What do you mean, ma'am? Shouldn't we stop him?\"\n\"Arcane is in a tough spot. He's outmatched. If Shirone's magic is energy-focused, Arcane can't block it in his current state. He won't act impulsively knowing he could be hurt. Shirone knows this.\"\nNade looked back at Shirone. Even so, defying an archmage wasn't something anyone but Shirone could do.\n'So cunning.'\nArcane readily admitted.\n\"True. In your current state, you could overpower me.\"\nAn eerie silence fell. It was hard to believe such words from an archmage. But it wasn't out of cowardice. He even smiled leisurely.\n\"Red wavelength. Particle vibration principle, it seems. A perfect nemesis to dark magic. Plus, I'm exhausted, so it'll be quite hard to fend you off.\"\nArcane keenly observed Shirone's reaction.\n\"How does it feel? To hear this from an archmage?\"\n\"What are you trying to say? You're going to pay for what youve done?\"\n\"That could be one interpretation, but...\"\nDark smoke rose from Arcane's body. His eyes turned white, and his expression became ghostly. A sharp murderous intent exploded in all directions.\n\"Combat is understood only through experience.\"\nShirone involuntarily stepped back. Pure combativeness, unrelated to skill or level. The aura of death, only those who've crossed countless death lines can emit.\n\"Good compatibility doesn't matter if you can't win. How about it? Will you face me?\"\nFor the first time, Shirone remained silent. He didn't feel like fighting. Arcane's combativeness was overwhelming.\n'Really a piece.'\nShirone thought of how persistently Arcane exploited weaknesses and quickly switched tactics when they disappeared. No stubbornness. His thoughts flowed like water, and his vision opened in all directions. Canis's defeat seemed somewhat clear.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Genius Lost in Light (2)\n\"It's a wise decision. Ignoring nine for the sake of one is foolish. In any situation, never stop thinking. Everything in the world is determined by the amount of thought. Combat is no different.\"\n\"Don't be mistaken. I will never forgive you.\"\n\"Haha! If you're also determined, there's nothing more to ask for. Shall I guess? You grow in real combat. A school that teaches only standardized things doesn't suit you. How about it? Won't you join me? I'll make you the greatest mage.\"\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I respect the teachers here far more than a murderer like you.\"\n\"Then tell me. What have you learned here? Photon Cannon? Red wavelength? Or did they even advise you on Immortal Function?\"\nShirone's eyes wavered slightly.\n\"How do you know that...?\"\nArcane burst into laughter. This must be why he enjoys teaching. Gathering naive children and spouting nonsense to his heart's content.\n\"It's indeed rare. Immortal Function, is that an ordinary realm? But child, there are terrifying monsters in places you don't know. If you mingle with them joyfully...\"\nArcane grinned slyly with one eye.\n\"Unlockers aren't that rare either.\"\nShirone swallowed dryly. How many life-and-death situations must one overcome to casually mention Unlockers as not rare? Regardless of skill, the accumulated experience alone made him a different entity.\n\"In 100 years, I've met seven. Four were decent, and I killed three. The uniqueness of Unlockers is distinct. The potential for distortion is infinite. But untrained uniqueness dies before greater stability.\"\nIt was undeniable, though bitter. Uniqueness could be a variable that ignores objective power, yet sometimes it's a double-edged sword, powerless before straightforward methods.\n\"You won't learn anything in a school that ignores uniqueness, teaching the same things. You need to sharpen your unique strengths. I can help you with that.\"\n\"I don't learn magic to defeat someone. Don't lump me with someone like you.\"\nArcane read the conflict in Shirone's eyes. Of course, without a similar obsession with magic, he wouldn't have reached his current position.\n\"You think everyone likes you now. But humans are naturally favorable to the great. It's not that they like you personally. How long do you think you can interact with such hypocrites?\"\nEveryone frowned at Arcane's words.\nBut Shirone just listened silently.\n\"Get stronger. Make them unable to ignore you forever. Otherwise, they will trample on you. Can you still avoid conflict with polished excuses when that happens?\"\nArcane spread three fingers.\n\"Three years. I'll make you a mage no one on the continent can ignore within three years. Too short? I don't think so. If we maximize your uniqueness, it's not impossible.\"\nTo Shirone, it wasn't nonsense. As an Unlocker, staying in school seemed fruitless. At best, he would easily land a job in the mage society.\n\"Your words may be right.\"\nNade and Yiruki's faces darkened.\n\"Shirone...\"\nIf it's the truth, there's no need to deny it. Unlockers hold a unique position in the mage society, and standardized education at a magic school has its limits in skill development.\n\"Maybe you're right. But still, I won't follow you. This academy isn't just a place for me to fight; it's where my life is. Teachers, friends, a sense of belonging. I don't think you can offer me those things.\"\nArcane frowned. Whatever Arcane did to brainwash the students was admirable.\n\"You're being deceived. Those things don't matter in life. If you weren't strong, you would have been just an average kid at school. Proving your strength is everything in life.\"\n\"If that's really everything, then what's left for you now? Everyone hates you. Aren't you lonely? No one cares about you, so you can only prove yourself this way.\"\nArcane ground his teeth, his face reddening.\n\"Nonsense. The strong are lonely. It's the weak who seek to band together. Look at the situation. Everyone is kneeling at my feet. I rule them. This is loneliness.\"\n\"No. You're just a murderer who nobody cares about.\"\nThe word 'murderer' ignited madness in Arcane's eyes.\n\"Haha! Maybe. But did you know? I once had comrades. But one led everyone to ruin. That's the Alpheas you respect.\"\nShirone didn't believe it. He had heard from Ethella about their enmity. The Alpheas he knew wouldn't lead anyone to ruin.\n\"I don't know what happened in the past, but I won't listen to you. You're a murderer. And you're still committing murder.\"\n\"Murderer, you say. Then isnt Alpheas... just like me?\"\nShirone widened his eyes, shocked.\n\"Lies. What do you know about the headmaster?\"\n\"Hahaha! Of course, I know. That kid was my disciple.\"\n\"What...?\"\nShirone was speechless. Alpheas was a pioneer of light magic since his youth. How could someone who practices dark magic be his mentor?\nArcane looked up at the sky, reminiscing. Realizing something, he turned to Ethella.\n\"Did Alpheas ever marry?\"\n\"No. He has devoted his life to education, living alone.\"\n\"I see.\"\nA fleeting sadness passed through Arcane's eyes. Although he harbored hatred for Alpheas for 40 years, the only thing he possibly felt sympathy for was the matter of Erina.\n\"You might not know, but Alpheas was once married.\"\nEthella tilted her head in confusion. To her knowledge, Alpheas had always been single. Even if he had married and separated, it should have been documented as a union of houses.\n\"But Headmaster Alpheas is officially single.\"\n\"It seems his marriage was never acknowledged. But Alpheas was indeed married. They lived together for three years. Her name was Erina. A wonderful woman. She shone brighter and was more beautiful than anyone.\"\n\"What exactly happened between you two? Is it something worth harboring a grudge over, even after 50 years?\"\n\"At that time, Alpheas was a rising star, recognized for his Photon Theory. Having received the Gold Circle Award from the Emperor, you can imagine his stature. He secured a position in the Thunder Dragons' Magic Department and set up a household with a woman from the Bastadd family. He had nothing to envy in the world. But he had his worries.\"\nArcane tapped his head as he spoke.\n\"His wife, Erina, was a bit slow. Her intelligence was around that of a ten-year-old.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"But Alpheas didn't mind. He truly loved his wife. His affection was neither pity nor pretense.\"\nArcane's memory traveled back in time, to 40 years ago. It was when Arcane ruled the world, and Alpheas, a new star in the magic world, was dubbed a supernova.\n\"This year's Gold Circle Award! Alpheas Myrhe!\"\nFanfares echoed in the Grand Hall. As Alpheas walked amid the colorful confetti, tears of joy welled in his eyes. The Gold Circle Award, given to the mage with the highest achievement of the year, ensured entry into Thunder Strike and support from numerous noble families.\n\"Congratulations, Alpheas. I knew you would win.\"\n\"Count on me in the future. Don't forget your old friends now that you're successful.\"\nMany mages flocked around Alpheas, hoping to make an early impression, foreseeing his continuously rising value.\nHowever, not all eyes were favorable. Saroph, who had been a close competitor until the end, looked sour as if he had swallowed something bitter.\n\"Hmph. Married an idiot and rose to fame. Myrhe and Bastadd's union, how can anyone compete with that?\"\n\"It's true. It's really frustrating. But what can we do, the results are out. We need to watch our words around Alpheas now.\"\nSaroph was aware too. As long as they were part of the magic society, it was wise to get on Alpheas's good side.\n\"What will you do, Saroph? Approaching subtly and seeking reconciliation might make it worse. Shall we leave it for later and go for a drink?\"\n\"Sounds good. I don't want to stay here any longer.\"\nSaroph left the castle with his friends. Although he narrowly missed the Gold Circle Award, no one paid attention to the loser.\nKlumph heartily laughed, pulling Alpheas out of the crowd. Alpheas wanted a break, but soon found his face squeezed against Klumph's muscular arm.\n\"Hahaha! You did it, my friend! My friend won the Gold Circle! I can't believe it!\"\n\"Ouch! It hurts!\"\nAlpheas screamed, but Klumph's celebration knew no bounds.\n\"When you were being a smart aleck, I really wanted to beat you up, but now I see, you're a genius! You did it, man!\"\nAlpheas felt dizzy but didn't think of escaping. It's the Gold Circle. When else would he experience such thrilling pain?\n\"Alright! Let's drink until our stomachs burst on this great day. I've booked a tavern, just bring your stomach, leave your brain!\"\n\"Ah, I can't go right now. I need to stop by somewhere.\"\n\"What? The star of the night can't be absent. What's the matter?\"\n\"I'm going home. I want to put the medal on my wife.\"\nKlumph couldn't argue with that. Having married Erina a year ago, due to opposition from both families, they lived in a small house in a civilian area without any support.\nIt started with the Myrhe family. They couldn't accept their son, sent abroad for education, marrying a foolish woman.\nThe Bastadd family didn't back down either. They claimed that despite being nobles, they wouldn't be looked down upon, even if their daughter was a bit slow.\nIn the end, Alpheas and Erina had an unofficial wedding ceremony with only friends present.\n\"Right. There's Mrs. Erina. Why not bring her here?\"\n\"No need. What wife would like to see her husband drunk? I'll just be back soon.\"\n\"Stubborn as always. Well, hurry back.\"\n\"Will do. Go ahead to the tavern!\"\nAlpheas rushed out of the castle. Despite being exhausted from relentless research, he felt exhilarated tonight.\n'I did it! I made it!'\nWinning the kingdom's most prestigious award meant that the Myrhe family would have to accept him back, paving the way for a formal wedding with Erina.\n\"Honey, I'm back.\"\nErina knew about the award day. In any other home, there might have been a surprise party, but she greeted him as usual from the kitchen.\n\"Are you back? Have you eaten?\"\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Genius Lost in Light (3)\nAlpheas adored her for that. Even though her intelligence was that of a ten-year-old, her way of thinking wasn't. She always thought ahead, considering how he would feel if he didn't win the award, and that brought tears to his eyes.\n\"Honey, I\"\nWith trembling hands, Alpheas took out the golden medal.\n\"I did it! I won it! The Gold Circle Award!\"\nErina, always calm and composed, couldn't help but have her radiant eyes shimmer with emotion. The day Alpheas always talked about had finally come.\n\"Congratulations. I knew you would win.\"\n\"Erina, it's all thanks to you. Everything is because of you. Come here, let me put it on you.\"\nAlpheas believed that the true recipient of the Gold Circle was Erina. Of course, the straightforward Klumph didn't understand this. He thought Alpheas was admirable for deciphering the profound meaning behind Erina's childlike words. But Alpheas knew. The small ideas that came from Erina's mind would become the key codes responsible for the future of humanity.\n\"This award belongs to you. Your thoughts amazed the world.\"\nAs Alpheas approached her with puckered lips, Erina stepped back like a shy bride.\n\"Let's eat first. Come quickly.\"\n\"Ah, sorry. Klumph has arranged a party, so I need to go. I'll eat later.\"\n\"Ah, is that so?\"\nErina couldn't hide her disappointment this time. Noticing this, Alpheas playfully picked her up in his arms.\n\"That's why we need to save time for dinner.\"\n\"Kyaa!\"\nAlpheas carried Erina upstairs, bounding up the steps.\n\"Wait a minute! The bread will burn.\"\n\"Let it burn! Otherwise, I will!\"\nAfter Alpheas's award, dozens of invitations flew in daily. They were all from notable nobles and institutions. Mingling with everyone meant mingling with no one. By declining all but the necessary connections and increasing his value, his reputation spread quickly. As part of this strategy, Alpheas was leaving for a dinner hosted by the Alchemy Foundation today, a crucial event as they handled 40 percent of the magic material logistics.\nUnaware of this, Saroph and his friends had been camping outside Alpheas's house since before sunset, anxiously waiting for the evening.\nSaroph sighed.\n\"Ah, this hurts my pride.\"\n\"Is pride the issue? His value rose too high. Alpheas is not just a skilled magician. We should have seen it coming.\"\nSaroph was filled with regret. He should have mingled with the crowd and resolved any lingering resentment when Alpheas won the Gold Circle Award. Just a month after the award, Alpheas's fame was intimidatingly high, all thanks to his excellent political acumen. Now that Alpheas was selective about his company, the chances for Saroph to wedge in were slimming.\n'Why does nothing ever go right?'\nIt was a question without an answer. At least having friends around made the embarrassment bearable.\n\"We should go in. I'll do the talking.\"\nSaroph led the way, knocking on Alpheas's door.\n\"Is Alpheas there? It's Saroph.\"\nUnexpectedly, Erina opened the door.\n\"Who is it?\"\n\"Ah, the lady of the house. You might not remember, but I'm Saroph, Alpheas's classmate. Is Alpheas home?\"\n\"No, my husband is out. At the Alchemy Foundation.\"\nSaroph knew about the dinner. It wouldn't last long since it wasn't a drinking affair. He thought it worked out well and politely said,\n\"Then, if it's not too much trouble, may we wait inside? We don't want to attract public attention...\"\nStanding outside would certainly lead to gossip.\n\"Yes, come in.\"\nSaroph and his friends sat in the living room, rubbing their hands nervously. Seeing their plight, Erina called them to the dining table, offering snacks and drinks.\n\"Have something to eat. My husband will eat there.\"\n\"Thank you. You're very kind.\"\nSaroph felt awkward, regretting not bringing a gift. He had bought one, but his pride made it unbearable to carry it.\nIn his mind, it wasn't a matter of skill. Despite Alpheas and Erina's families cutting ties, their first-class status must have influenced the evaluation.\nWith those thoughts, the alcohol hit him quickly. Initially tensed, they relaxed once they perceived Erina's intellectual level.\n\"I tell you! I was once called a genius. Me, it was me!\"\n\"It's so unfair! Some work hard and get nowhere, while others use connections to rise! Magic is dead!\"\nHearing his friend, Saroph's eyebrow twitched. The target was none other than Alpheas. But he let it pass. After all, Erina wouldn't understand their conversation. Suddenly, the drink tasted sweeter. Maybe, for the first time, he had beaten Alpheas by being able to loudly criticize him in front of his wife.\nSaroph scooped up more courage and addressed Erina.\n\"Right, don't you agree, sister-in-law? Magic, you see, isn't just about skill. You agree with me, don't you?\"\n\"Yes, I don't really know.\"\n\"Haha! Of course, you wouldn't know. But it's true, all of it.\"\nSaroph savored a sense of victory. He had criticized Alpheas and even mocked his wife. His friends, sensing Saroph's intention, joined in, banging on the table.\n\"Sister-in-law, since the mood is set, why don't you sing us a song?\"\n\"Yes! Let's celebrate Alpheas's success with a song.\"\nErina's smile stiffened. People think if someone's intelligence is lacking, they don't understand anything. But reading emotions has always been the burden of the underdog. Erina was aware that Saroph and his friends weren't being kind; they were tolerating her only because she was Alpheas's wife.\n\"In my hometown, when the wheat ripens...\"\nAs Erina started singing, Saroph and his friends clapped and whistled. Even as they made fun of her, she bravely continued with a trembling voice.\nBut before she could finish three lines, a cold voice cut through from the living room.\n\"What are you doing right now?\"\nEveryone turned their heads. Alpheas stood there, his face red, fists clenched. Saroph sobered up instantly. Coming to his senses, he realized what he was doing.\n\"Sorry, it seems we drank too much.\"\n\"You bastard!\"\nAlpheas rushed over and swung his fist. Saroph, hit squarely in the face, tumbled to the floor. His friends stood up, yelling.\n\"Alpheas! What a violent act! No matter how angry you are...\"\n\"No, it's okay. Let it be.\"\nSaroph raised his hand to stop his friends. He felt ashamed. Was he just a loser who found comfort in mocking the wife of a rival?\n\"Get out, before I kill you. Leave my house right now!\"\n\"Sorry about today. We won't bother you again.\"\nSaroph and his friends were kicked out of Alpheas's house. The living room, now devoid of the unwanted guests, was eerily silent. Alpheas was unable to contain his rising anger, knowing why they made Erina sing.\n\"What happened? Why were those jerks here?\"\nErina, terrified, couldn't speak. It was the first time she had seen her husband so angry.\n\"Tell me! Why did you let those bastards in?\"\n\"Sorry. I thought you'd be happy, they being your friends...\"\n\"What are you talking about? Why would those jerks be my friends? Can't you even tell who my real friends are? And you just sang for them? You're really a fool!\"\nAlpheas turned away abruptly, his face contorted with regret. He had blurted out words he vowed never to use, words that should never be spoken.\n'I'm such a despicable person. I'm not even fit to be a husband.'\nHe wished he could turn back time, but it was too late. Even if he could, he wasn't sure if he wouldn't have said the same thing again. His anger was uncontrollable.\n\"Forget what I just said. It was my mistake.\"\n\"I'm sorry, honey. I won't do it again.\"\nErina's apology made him feel even worse. She had no reason to apologize. But then, where should he direct this frustration?\n\"I'll go out for some air. I'll be fine after some time. Sorry. You go to bed first.\"\nAlpheas left the house. That was the only way he could rationally deal with the situation.\nAt Klumph's inn, Alpheas drank all night. He couldn't get drunk. As the alcohol's effect grew, Saroph faded from his memory, and only the hurt he might have caused Erina lingered.\n\"Damn it. I'm a scumbag. I don't deserve to be a husband. She trusted and followed me, and I spoke to her like that.\"\nKlumph looked pitifully at him. He understood Alpheas's anger as a man, but still felt it was a mistake.\n\"Marital fights are like cutting water with a knife. You have a bright future ahead, and the worst is over. Maybe today's incident will bring you closer?\"\nAlpheas remained silent, prompting Klumph to bring up a long-considered suggestion.\n\"Why not have a child?\"\nAlpheas's eyes sparkled momentarily, but then he shook his head sadly.\nKlumph, guessing the reason, widened his eyes in surprise.\n\"You mean to say? You never...?\"\n\"What nonsense? We're a married couple. No matter how young Erina is, she knows what she needs to.\"\nKlumph smirked.\n\"Who's talking about her? Maybe you're the problem, being so feeble. Hahaha.\"\nNot in the mood to laugh, Alpheas sullenly gulped down his drink.\nKlumph sighed.\n\"What's the problem then? Just have a child and live happily.\"\n\"Erina... I'm not sure if she can have a child.\"\n\"Why? Is she ill?\"\n\"No. It's just that... childbirth is terribly painful, and I don't know if Erina can endure it. And there's the issue of raising a child.\"\nKlumph sighed as he grasped the situation. The problem was whether a woman with the intelligence of a ten-year-old could endure childbirth. Intelligence is a great control over humanity. Knowing and unknowingly enduring pain are worlds apart.\n\"Alpheas, I hate to say this, but you knew this when you decided to marry her.\"\n\"Yes, I know. I don't regret it. Really, I don't. I can't live without Erina. Without her, no honor means anything.\"\nKlumph downed a couple of drinks in quick succession. He felt suffocated, thinking about what Alpheas must be going through.\n\"So, what are you going to do? It's not like you to just moan about problems. You're too smart for that.\"\nAlpheas twirled his drink, deep in thought. Suddenly, his eyes sparkled with intelligence, a sharp contrast to his intoxicated state.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Genius Lost in Light (4)\nArcane was aware that someone had infiltrated his dungeon the previous night. However, he didn't care. Countless people had tried to invade the dungeon of an archmage like him, only to end up as corpses, victims of monsters or traps.\nPutting aside his fleeting thoughts, Arcane refocused on his research. Recently, he had been delving into the effects of dark magic on memory. Suddenly, his writing stopped. He took off his glasses and looked towards the door as the mechanisms were being rapidly disabled. This was no ordinary intruder.\n\"Seems like a big catch this time.\"\nFor Arcane, who could stay holed up in his dungeon for years, intruders served as a form of entertainment. And today, it seemed like a rather interesting individual had taken the bait.\nThe sound of a heavy door opening echoed as Arcane glanced at his clock. Exactly 32 hours, 28 minutes, and 5 seconds. That was the time taken to dismantle the traps and reach him from the entrance.\n\"Are you the archmage, Viltor Arcane?\"\nA bloodied man stood before him. Handsome and with eyes sparkling with resolve.\n\"You don't seem like someone after wealth. Who are you?\"\n\"I am Alpheas Myrhe. I had to come personally since there was no other way to meet you.\"\n\"Ah?\"\nArcane's eyebrows raised in interest. Even secluded in his dungeon, he was not ignorant of the world's affairs. He had already come across Alpheas's theory of Photonics through covert channels.\n\"A mage of light seeking a mage of darkness. Quite an unusual event. Sit down. I'll heal you.\"\nArcane activated a life-sustaining device. Alpheas, submerged in a tank filled with a green liquid, quickly fell into a deep sleep.\nThree hours later.\n\"Puhah! Haak!\"\nAlpheas jerked upright out of the liquid. It was a close call to suffocation. How could he have fallen asleep under these circumstances? As he turned his head, he saw Arcane writing at his desk, looking more like a scholarly academic than the continent-tormenting archmage.\n\"Thank you for the treatment. It's an impressive device. I'm curious about its principle.\"\n\"No need to beat around the bush. It doesn't change the fact you're an uninvited guest. Tell me why you're here.\"\nIf someone was driven by curiosity and interest, there was no need to prolong the conversation.\nAlpheas got straight to the point.\n\"I want to learn dark magic. Please accept me as your disciple.\"\n\"Ah?\"\nThe idea of Alpheas, the hottest topic in the world of magic, asking to be his disciple intrigued Arcane, even with his status.\n\"Do you have a special reason?\"\n\"I have a wife, but she has intellectual disabilities. I've heard about your research on embedding memories using dark magic, and I want to give her my memories.\"\nArcane's eyes twinkled. They both thoroughly understood each other's expertise, so no extended explanations were needed.\n\"I've done considerable research on memory manipulation. But what you're asking for is a different dimension. There's the issue of personality, and above all, it's about transferring an entire life's memories.\"\n\"I believe it's possible. Combining the absorptive nature of dark magic with the information-transmitting capabilities of photons, couldn't we create a virtual intelligence?\"\n\"Hmm, constructing the neural network with photon magic and then infusing it with memories?\"\nIt was indeed a novel idea. Until now, photon magic had been as limited as time magic, but with the revelation of Photonics, Arcane anticipated it would soon excel in the field of information.\n\"Before examining the theory, one question. Has your wife consented to this experiment?\"\n\"Not yet. But I'm sure she will agree.\"\n\"A story behind it, I presume.\"\nAlpheas shared his story, leading up to why he sought out Arcane. Understanding his situation, Arcane found the proposal intriguing and genuinely brilliant. After a day of discussion and theoretical examination, they both agreed on the feasibility of the idea.\n\"Very well. If you're truly prepared to bet your life on this, I'll accept you as my disciple. But convincing your family won't be easy.\"\nBecoming the disciple of an archmage, yet Alpheas was also from a prestigious family. It seemed unlikely he would abandon a guaranteed future at the Department of Thunder Magic and enter a dimly lit research lab.\nHowever, Alpheas had no alternative plans. If Erina was unhappy, so was he. All he wanted was her happiness.\n\"Thank you. I'll bring my family here soon.\"\nAfter returning home, Alpheas consulted with Erina, with Klumph also present. Alpheas emphasized the potential to treat Erina's intellectual future. Klumph immediately objected.\n\"Alpheas, what are you saying? Why would you go to such a person? He's a criminal!\"\n\"Such things don't matter to a mage. What's important is that he has the deepest understanding of dark magic on the continent. He's also well-versed in human memory and brain structure. It won't be a loss.\"\n\"No, it will be. You're bewitched. Implanting memories in the human brain? Impossible!\"\n\"Klumph, your thoughts...\"\n\"Yes! I'm dumb! Not as smart or genius as you! But even I know this: you're throwing away a stroke of luck. Associating with him might even cancel your entry into Thunder. What about your family? They'll surely disown you!\"\nAlpheas was aware of these risks but had already made his decision.\n\"It doesn't matter. Those things can't determine my life. Thunder, family, I don't need them. As long as Erina is happy, I can be much happier than now.\"\nErina pondered. But Alpheas's final words had essentially made the decision. If her husband was happy, so was she.\n\"Honey, I'll do it.\"\n\"Missus! This is something that needs careful consideration.\"\n\"I will do it because I trust my husband. Alpheas will make me happy.\"\n\"Of course! Who am I? A mage who won the Gold Circle. And my master is an archmage. Together, we can easily fix any weakness of yours.\"\nDespite Klumph's daily attempts to persuade Alpheas, the couple's determination was unshakable. Eventually, Alpheas settled all his affairs and entered Arcane's dungeon with Erina.\n\"Pleased to meet you. I am Viltor Arcane.\"\n\"Hello, my husband has been indebted to you.\"\nErina greeted him politely. Now that her husband's mentor was here, she couldn't afford to act carelessly.\nArcane, however, reassured her in a nonchalant manner.\n\"Don't worry too much. I've been delving into this field for decades. You've made a big decision. If successful, many with mental illnesses can be cured. Your husband will gain a reputation unparalleled by his work in Thunder.\"\nBecoming the disciple of an archmage meant regaining everything Alpheas had sacrificed. Erina considered it worthwhile, seeing the potential reward.\nFor two years, Alpheas stayed in the dungeon, working on transferring memories to Erina. Arcane, adept at experimental work, provided rational care, allowing Erina to stay in the dungeon without significant discomfort.\n\"Hey, Missus. How are you feeling?\"\nKlumph visited weekly, bringing food. The busy couple, especially Erina, couldn't be expected to endure poor meals.\n\"I'm fine. The experiment is almost over. Soon, my husband can return to the world.\"\nKlumph laughed heartily. Despite the hardship of the past two years, Erina had borne it well. Yet, it was bittersweet; her lower intelligence didn't diminish the value of her heart, which sacrificed for her husband.\nHearing of Klumph's arrival, Alpheas joined them, looking increasingly gaunt each visit.\n\"Thanks for coming every time.\"\n\"How's the experiment? Any progress?\"\n\"Nearly complete. Clinical trials were a success. Next month, Erina can finally escape the disdainful glares.\"\n\"Next month? That quick?\"\n\"What are you saying? It's been two long years. We've been working day and night with the master. You must come on that day. Bring plenty of booze instead of food.\"\nAs the month passed, everyone anxiously awaited the day of the experiment.\nErina lay on the bed, waiting. With Arcane and Alpheas busy checking equipment, Klumph kept her company, easing her tension.\n\"Missus, how do you feel? After today, you'll have Alpheas's memories. Even those embarrassing moments from his childhood. Be sure to check if he ever had a roving eye. Hahaha!\"\nErina burst into laughter at Klumph's joke. The atmosphere was tense but positive. A day that felt like everything would go right, and the equipment was all set.\n\"Let's start, Erina.\"\nAlpheas lay beside Erina, stroking her hair. He could give her his memories because he loved her. Embarrassing or shameful, it didn't matter to her.\n\"Thank you, honey.\"\n\"Don't mention it. I should be the one thanking you. You've been so strong. Let's be happy. Have kids too.\"\nAlpheas wondered if his smile looked forced. Truthfully, he was incredibly nervous. Arcane approached, attaching a device to their heads. The experiment was a culmination of various fields: magical engineering, magical biology, alchemy, photonics, and human biology.\n\"Starting now. Relax. It will be over soon.\"\nAs Arcane activated the machine, Klumph walked to a corner, anxiously rubbing his hands. The clanking of mechanical parts filled the room, with dozens of components working and crystals lighting up chaotically.\nAlpheas willingly accepted the dark magic infiltrating his mind.\nThe principle was simple: Alpheas's memories were absorbed through dark magic and then transmitted to Erina's memory using photon output.\n\"Ugh!\"\nErina's eyes widened. The influx of massive information made her eyes spark. From Alpheas's earliest memory to their recent conversation, all his life's moments were being transmitted at the speed of light.\nErina faintly smiled. It felt like truly becoming one with Alpheas.\n'Thank you, honey. And I love you.'\nShe closed her eyes, content. There were no regrets. Born into the world, she had received more love than deserved.\nMeeting Alpheas... was a blessing.\nThe light faded, signaling the experiment's end. Arcane checked the panel. A 100% transfer rate. All memories had been perfectly conveyed.\n\"Honey! Honey!\"\nAlpheas turned to Erina. She looked pale and sweaty.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Genius Lost in Light (5)\n\"Master! How did it go? Was the experiment successful?\"\n\"Yes, it was a success! Our magic worked!\"\nHowever, Alpheas couldn't rejoice. Something was clearly wrong with Erina.\n\"But why is my wife like this? Honey! Snap out of it!\"\nArcane, re-examining the control panel, was shocked. The balance of each item was normal, but the overall bodily rhythm was dropping simultaneously, as if life itself was fading away.\n\"Why is this happening? The clinical trials didn't go like this.\"\n\"Honey! Erina! Open your eyes!\"\nErina half-opened her eyes, showing a faint smile.\n\"Honey I'm okay.\"\n\"Erina! What's wrong? Are you hurt?\"\n\"There was a rejection reaction starting from the terminal nerves. It seems the human brain has something different. But you've achieved something remarkable. With a little more research Ugh!\"\nErina gasped for air and convulsed.\n\"Honey! Don't talk! I'll try to do something! I'll save you, no matter what!\"\nAlpheas, realizing the irreversibility of the situation, cursed his own intellectual ability. But he had no choice but to say those words.\nErina slowly shook her head, knowing what her husband knew.\n\"Honey hold my hand.\"\nAlpheas tightly grasped his wife's hand. He would have tried anything if there was even a 1% chance. But now, all he could do was stay by her side.\n\"Erina, this can't be happening. How can this?\"\nErina smiled sadly.\n\"Honey, I'm sorry.\"\n\"Sorry for what? What did you do?\"\n\"For being a fool.\"\nAlpheas's heart tore apart. Trying to change her, forgetting her words that her mere existence was beautiful.\n\"No Why are you sorry? What are you sorry for! I'm the fool! It was me!\"\n\"Meeting you was a blessing.\"\nErina finally understood her husband. A wonderful world governed by rationality. She was happy to have shared his memories, even for a short while.\n\"Honey! Open your eyes! Please I was wrong, honey!\"\nAs Erina's eyes closed, Alpheas held her face and wailed.\n\"Uwaaaa! Honey! Honey!\"\nArcane, with a somber expression, bowed his head. How is the human brain different from animals? The tragedy could have been avoided with initial human experimentation.\nBut it was a meaningless conjecture. Erina's only condition for allowing herself to be experimented on was never to experiment on others.\nTherefore, the effort was even more devoted. The data obtained so far would be precious for humanity.\n\"I'm sorry. Your sacrifice won't be in vain.\"\nA dull thud sounded. Turning his head, Arcane saw Alpheas hitting his head against the wall.\n\"Uwaaaa!\"\nWith each collision, the sound of breaking echoed. It was unclear whether the wall or his head was breaking.\n\"What? Light of the Myrhe family? Light? Light!\"\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nAlpheas, repeatedly hitting his head, bounced back like a rubber ball. But he didn't stop. The horror of surviving alone without his wife overwhelmed him.\n\"Arrogant Alpheas!\"\nAlpheas charged at the wall again.\nThud!\nKlumph grabbed Alpheas. Left alone, he would surely die.\n\"Alpheas! Snap out of it! What are you doing!\"\n\"Let go! Dammit! Uwaaaa!\"\nEven Klumph's strength struggled to restrain Alpheas. It seemed he was burning his soul, rushing toward death. Eventually, overcome with shock, his eyes rolled back and he lost consciousness.\n\"Erina. Erina.\"\nKlumph wept at the sight of Alpheas calling his wife's name even in unconsciousness.\nErina's funeral was held. Only family members gathered, and Alpheas was prevented from attending by relatives. Without a formal wedding or descendants, the couple parted as strangers in the end.\nAlpheas sat listlessly in front of the funeral hall. As evening fell, he got up like a man out of his mind and walked somewhere.\nHe arrived at Arcane's dungeon. The equipment used for countless experiments over two years remained untouched.\n\"Erina.\"\nAlpheas carried a can of oil, spreading it throughout the lab. Tears flowed with every splash of oil, reminding him of the moments he had shared with her, as vivid as yesterday.\nWhen the oil can emptied, Alpheas slumped against a wall. Knowledge that should not exist in the world. How could humans conduct such cruel experiments?\n\"Have you come, Alpheas?\"\nArcane entered the lab. He knew Alpheas wasn't invited to the funeral. This place was essentially Erina's grave for him.\n\"I regret what happened to Erina. Take some time to recuperate. And then come back to...\"\nArcane paused, sensing something amiss. The smell of oil was too strong for a mere leak.\n\"Alpheas you're not...?\"\nAlpheas stood with dark eyes. A single fire spell would blow up the lab.\n\"No! What are you doing!\"\n\"Master, we should never have started this.\"\n\"Even if weakened by your wife's death, no! It's not true! The experiment was almost successful! Have you forgotten Erina's legacy? Destroying this place is to ignore her sacrifice!\"\n\"It doesn't matter. Without my wife... there's nothing left for me.\"\n\"Still, you can't! This is not only yours and Erina's. My life's knowledge is accumulated here! You can't destroy it without my permission.\"\nAlpheas cast a flame spell. Arcane absorbed it with dark magic, but the temperature had already risen past the ignition point.\nFlames enveloped the room.\nThousands of documents, precision magic devices, and dangerous alchemical materials were transformed.\nAlpheas watched the flames impassively and left the dungeon.\nBut Arcane couldn't leave. He had to extinguish the fire. Even if everything was lost, the experimental data had to be saved.\n\"No, no!\"\nRunning through the flames, Arcane tried to save the documents. Then, an explosion occurred as the fire reached a box of volatile chemicals.\nThe lab was destroyed, and the entire underground dungeon shook with the impact.\nThe fire, greedily consuming the air, raced through the tunnels.\n\"Uwaaaa! Alpheas! I won't forgive you, Alpheas!\"\nArcane ground his teeth in anger. Losing his life's work just before completion was more frustrating and grievous than death.\n\"I will survive... I will survive and take my revenge. Wait for me, Alpheas!\"\nEven while being consumed by flames, Arcane seethed with hatred for Alpheas. Alpheas had been arrogant to the very end.\nSurviving on the sole thought of revenge, Arcane conserved his strength while mobilizing his network to scour the continent. However, no one knew of Alpheas' whereabouts.\nIt was seven years later when Alpheas reappeared in the world.\nHe was in the main house of the Orgent family in the city of Creas.\n\"Alpheas! Hey, man! What happened to you?\"\nKlumph stared dumbfoundedly at Alpheas, who had become unrecognizable. His once neat appearance was replaced by a wild, bearded look. Wearing rags, his skin was burnt black.\nKlumph took Alpheas to the bathroom and personally washed him. Numerous scars were etched on his body: wounds from wild beasts, torture, and clear self-inflicted ones.\n\"Were you wandering around looking for a place to die?\"\nAlpheas, with his wet hair covering his face, remained silent. After a long while, he finally spoke.\n\"I didn't particularly want to die. Nor did I want to live. I just wandered aimlessly.\"\n\"Right\"\n\"I heard the news. You became an official inspector. Congratulations.\"\n\"Congrats between us? I'm the latest of our peers, man.\"\nKlumph awkwardly responded. The achievement felt less impressive, knowing what his friend had gone through.\n\"Sorry. I had nowhere else to go. I need to impose on you for a while.\"\nKlumph sadly gazed at Alpheas' emaciated back.\nHow had he come to this?\nOnce hailed as a rising star of the magical world, Alpheas was now a vagrant, shunned even by his own family.\nAfter the bath, Klumph had the maids prepare a meal. But Alpheas could hardly eat, his stomach having shrunk too much.\nKlumph knew it wasn't just because Alpheas had nowhere else to go.\nTaking Alpheas to the study, Klumph poured him a drink. Alpheas didn't even look at the alcohol but briefly flashed the same sharp gaze he had seven years ago.\n\"Talk to me. You've ended your wanderings, so you must have plans. You need to get back on your feet. I'll help you.\"\nAlpheas bluntly said.\n\"Lend me 100 million gold.\"\n\"100 million gold?\"\nAn astronomical sum.\nKlumph, having passed the official exam, was in line to succeed as family head. But even as head, there were limits to what he could lend.\n\"Not at once. I'll withdraw it over four years. Hire a financial advisor. With a monthly limit of 7 million, it should be manageable without significant impact. I'll pay interest too. But no compound interest. Set the annual rate at 20%. I can start repaying the principal after a year.\"\nWhile the lender usually sets the terms, Klumph didn't mind. He knew Alpheas would have optimized the deal before even arriving.\nEffectively, it meant earning 80 million gold in profits over four years, besides the principal. Klumph was more curious about how Alpheas planned to achieve this.\n\"What's the plan? Developed a new spell or something?\"\nAlpheas shook his head.\n\"I've lost all passion.\"\n\"Then what will you do with 100 million gold?\"\n\"I'm going to build a school.\"\n\"A school?\"\nKlumph's eyes widened. Alpheas, who always considered himself the best, was planning to teach others.\n\"What are you thinking?\"\nSeeing tears on Alpheas' cheeks, Klumph couldn't finish his sentence.\n\"I mustn't let another like me arise. I'll teach students, atoning until my last breath. Ensuring no one's talent gets trampled by a moment's mistake, I'll live devouring my pain.\"\nAlpheas covered his face with his hands, sobbing uncontrollably, yet unable to stop the tears.\nKlumph's eyes reddened too.\nErina Bastadd. Alpheas would probably never forget her. He might suffer for a lifetime.\nBut that made the decision easier.\nIf Alpheas' pain could transform into someone's growth, if that could truly happen, then this friend, who once dreamed of success and happiness, might smile again someday.\n\"I'll lend it. 100 million gold.\"\nAlpheas named the school after himself in Creas City. He worked as a mage during construction, paying off the interest, and studied at night to get a teaching certificate.\nFour years later.\nAlpheas, the headmaster of the Alpheas Magic Academy, repaid 180 million gold to the Orgent family.\nAs the effects of Abyss Nova completely faded, Alpheas slowly opened his eyes. With all memories returned, he remained silent for a long time. The 40 years he had relived were so lengthy and burdensome.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Genius Lost in Light (6)\nMaster\nThadd hesitated to speak. Was Alpheas still the same person he used to be? Humans hold hope because they don't know the future. But Alpheas's memories held no hope. Any happy memory was buried under terrible pain.\nAlpheas closed his eyes again, a tear rolling down his cheek.\nMaster, are you alright?\nThank you, Thadd.\nRelieved by Alpheas's kind tone, Thadd sighed.\nAre you really okay?\nOf course. Sorry for being harsh to you earlier. But that was the old me.\nNo, I'm the one who should apologize. I thought it might be better for you to stay as you were, fearing something might happen to you\nAlpheas patted Thadds shoulder reassuringly.\nIt was a decision true to your nature. Maybe it would have been better that way.\nThen, Master\nThadd became anxious again. Maybe he should have persisted with his initial thought. It could have been an unrepeatable chance for Alpheas to escape his past.\nYes. Memories I never want to recall. But\nAlpheas looked at Erinas portrait, recalling the moment they first met at the ballroom and how he confessed his feelings, a faint smile appearing on his lips.\nEven in a life filled with pain, there are moments worth living for.\nI see.\nThadd finally felt at ease. Alpheas was still the same person he knew, unchanged in any way.\nThe woman named Erina, who had shaken the entirety of Alpheas's life, remained in his heart as a painful but unforgettable memory.\nMaster, the one behind this incident is Arcane. Currently, Teacher Ethella is\nI had a hunch from the start. Its not the time for explanations. Lets move.\nAlpheas walked towards the door, Thadd following him. The first crisis might have been averted, but the real problem was just beginning. The entire student body was under Arcanes influence.\nI just hope its not too late.\nAfter learning about Alpheas's past, Shirone and his group were speechless for a while. It was a shockingly tragic and sad love story.\nThe Headmaster had such a past\nA certified 4th-grade mage and the headmaster of a prestigious school, anyone would think Alpheas led a successful life. But after hearing Arcanes story, it was clear that young Alpheas was extraordinary. He proved the Photon Theory at a young age and was a Gold Circle awardee. His experiment on memory transfer was a progressive idea just beginning to be explored in the magical society.\nCertainly, Alpheas was a genius. But he was weak. Had he endured a little longer, the world would have been different. He ruined everything with a mere sentiment. I can never forgive him for that.\nShirone had a lot to think about. Arcane was known as a villain, but he was also a mage. At least in Erinas experiment, he was nothing but a helpful collaborator.\nThats true. Headmaster Alpheas destroying your research might have been hypocrisy.\nArcane's murderous intent softened, allowing Shirone to approach him a bit closer.\nBut even then, I would have made the same choice.\nArcane frowned in displeasure, but Shirone wasnt being stubborn.\nIf sacrificing one person could save ten thousand, it might be a rational choice. But I wouldnt sacrifice that one person.\nThen ten thousand will die.\nThats a risk we have to take.\nShirone spoke with conviction.\nTen thousand might die. But we shouldnt interfere beyond our human limits. It's arrogant to weigh human lives. Even if it leads to more sacrifices, we just need to do what we can. Eventually, there might come a day when we can save ten thousand without sacrifices. What youre trying to do isnt different from a tyrant trying to stand above humanity.\nArcane realized that Shirone stood at the opposite extreme of his beliefs. Sacrificing a few for the many is not an option? Some might call it virtue, but if such a situation really arose, not many people would agree. Humans are creatures that wander between good and evil, looking for what benefits them. But Shirone stood at the farthest end of goodness. Both a cruel murderer and a savior saint are inhuman, and both are persecuted by the public.\nYour life wont be easy either. Dying here might even be a blessing for you.\nA mage bases his choices on intelligence. Arcane believed in the efficiency of evil to advance humanity. To him, Shirone was a future threat that must be eliminated.\nWe are incompatible breeds. Regrettably, I have to kill you.\nShirone stepped back in surprise. Arcane, who had seemed weakened, was now exuding the aura of a true archmage.\nSurprised, boy? Magic is a mysterious thing.\nAccording to the Magic Association's research, the mental fatigue a mage experiences when casting pure magic is equivalent to the focus an ordinary person maintains for 48 minutes on a single task.\nHowever, Arcane defied such arithmetic calculations and quickly gathered his strength.\n\"Let's end this. There will be no pain.\"\nShadows surged from Arcane's body, covering the sky with a black curtain. Its massive size astonished everyone. It was on a completely different scale from the dark powers exhibited by Canis.\nAs Arcane raised his right hand, the curtain morphed into the shape of a fist. Shirone admired its purity. The size of the fist indicated that if it fell, it could obliterate half of the basin.\n'I can't block it. Nor can I avoid it.'\nIf quantified, the power of a unit cube (1 cm in width, length, and height) of dark powers is about 0.1N, slightly better than an ant's jaw joint. But beyond a billion units, it can exert a tremendous force, enough to sweep away everything on the surface of the earth.\n\"Stop this nonsense, Master.\"\nEveryone's gaze turned to the cliff. Alpheas stood there, hands behind his back, followed by a beam of light roaring in, with Thadd landing beside him.\n\"Teacher Thadd!\"\nShirone and his companions brightened up. Just the arrival of Alpheas and Thadd felt like gaining a mighty army. Thadd looked up at the dark power and cast Fire Sun. The stream of flames spiraled upward, forming a huge fireball.\n\"Wow\"\nThe surrounding scenery turned into a blinding white light, making it impossible to open their eyes. But Arcane countered the blinding light with his dark magic, staring directly at it.\n\"Hmm.\"\nStretching his palm towards the Fire Sun, the darkness in the sky mimicked the movement, engulfing the giant fireball.\nChiieeee!\nShirone shivered. He had never seen anything burn with such a massive sound. Darkness enveloped the world again as Thadd grimaced and transformed his Spirit Zone into an offensive form.\n\"Damn! Annoying old man...\"\nAlpheas stopped him with a hand gesture.\n\"Let it be, Thadd.\"\n\"But, Master...\"\n\"This is my battle. A matter between me and Arcane. Leave it to me from here.\"\nAlpheas walked leisurely forward, and Arcane, extinguishing the Fire Sun, reshaped the dark power into a curtain and spread it across the sky.\n\"You've aged, Alpheas. Well, even a time mage is just a human before the years.\"\nAlpheas ignored Arcane's first greeting in 40 years. At least not yet... it wasn't time for two foolish old men to settle the past. Looking past hundreds of students, the injured Yiruki, Nade, Shirone, and finally at Ethella, he saw bruises spreading over her pale skin.\n\"You've had a hard time, Ethella. It's my fault for being irresponsible. I have nothing to say but sorry.\"\n\"It's not your fault, sir. I failed to protect the students.\"\nAlpheas shook his head. Ethella, who excelled in magic, martial arts, and mental techniques, had seemed bewildering when she came for a teacher interview. But today, he couldn't be prouder of his decision to hire her. Without her, the students wouldn't be safe as they were now.\n\"Headmaster, please be careful.\"\nShirone looked worried. If Arcane had been exhausted, Alpheas, a 4th-grade certified mage, might have had a chance. But Arcane was undoubtedly at his peak now.\nAlpheas smiled reassuringly.\n\"Don't worry. There's no magic that defies the law of equivalent exchange.\"\n\"But Arcane must have regained his mental strength...\"\n\"Yes. He must have recovered. But that too is magic.\"\n\"Magic?\"\n\"Abyss-type magic controls memories. Arcane created it and is the best at using it. Right, Master?\"\nArcane snorted dismissively.\n\"Not senile, I see. By the way, the magic you experienced was Abyss Nova, far more advanced than mere memory manipulation.\"\n\"It was impressive magic. Thanks to it, I could relive old memories.\"\n\"Don't pretend. You must have been crying out of fear. You always run away in the end. And you were probably weeping like a baby.\"\n\"You're right. But Master, you've weakened too. Struggling against a hundred-year-old child and resorting to Abyss Memory, of all things.\"\nArcane didn't get angry. If Alpheas was calm, so was he. A 40-year-old grudge couldn't be resolved with mere words.\nAlpheas turned to Shirone with a pre-storm calmness.\n\"Shirone, casting magic requires intense concentration in a moment. Its like using an hours worth of focus in a second. Thats why Arcane did this.\"\nTapping his temple, Alpheas continued.\n\"He cast a spell on his own head. A memory erasing spell.\"\n\"Ahh...\"\nThat was a possibility. Erasing the memories used by the brain eliminates mental fatigue. Although it would undoubtedly overload functionally, it was a viable way to recover mental strength once.\nAlpheas understood Shirone's feelings. Viltor Arcane, a dark mage who had survived a century on the battlefield, was not someone to be underestimated, regardless of past grudges.\n\"Yes. Bold and brilliant. Arcane lives in such a world. Remember that. A combat mage who doesnt have at least one last resort isnt truly a combat mage.\"\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Even passing dogs would laugh.\"\n\"Are you sure you're alright? You might have restored your mental strength with Abyss Memory, but it's merely an illusion of the brain. If you plan to exert yourself further, I cannot guarantee your life.\"\nThere's no free lunch in magic. The mental strength restored by Abyss Memory was an equivalent exchange achieved at the risk of brain death.\n\"So what? You're trying to stop me?\"\n\"If you step back, we can end it here. Perhaps its your last chance. Since everyone's still safe, I can make this offer. But if you can't let go of your obsession, you'll have to pay the price.\"\n\"Hahaha! As always, eloquent with your words. Pretending to care, but in the end, you only think of yourself. Do you think stepping back will cover up your past? It's too late. Everyone here, and even those affected by Abyss Nova, are listening, so you can't remain as the headmaster anymore.\"\nShirone glanced at the students who had lost their memories. Once the magic is released, everything that happened here would be remembered. Even if the battle ended safely, it was undeniably a serious situation.\n\"Ha! Now you realize the situation? How about killing everyone here? Then I might consider covering it up for you.\"\nAlpheas Myrhe slightly lifted the corners of his mouth.\n\"What a joke.\"\n\"Then how about coming with me? I'm giving you your last chance. Shouldn't you continue the legacy left by Erina? Look at what I've achieved. Behold, the magical creature Harvest!\"\nShirone and his companions looked where Arcane was pointing. Harvest lay on the ground, crumpled like a rag.\n\"Well, it's a bit unsightly now. But anyway, the experiment was a success. With your help, we could achieve even greater results. And that's exactly what Erina truly wanted.\"\nHearing Erina's name, Alpheas's eyes flashed coldly.\n\"Master, please be sensible.\"\nFinally, Arcane revealed his murderous intent. The seemingly casual conversation was, in fact, meaningless. From the beginning, they were doomed to be irreconcilable adversaries.\n\"Do you think you can beat me, headmaster? Don't make me laugh. As smart as you are, you've always made foolish decisions, Alpheas.\"\nThe mass of darkness in the sky again formed into a fist. Alpheas slowly raised his hands, preparing to cast his magic.\n\"No, this is right. One foolish decision is enough.\"\nAlpheas compressed photons in his palms. Seeing the Photon Output, a basic light mage skill, Arcane snorted dismissively.\n\"You think you can stop me with that? You've weakened, Alpheas.\"\n\"Only trying will tell.\"\n\"Haha! Weren't your least favorite words, 'try before knowing'? Where's the Alpheas who used to say that, knowing everything in advance?\"\n\"A mage lives in the future. Though my courage has waned, I've not only aged. Do you think I wouldn't have calculated your 40 years?\"\n\"Ho? You foresaw this day? And prepared nothing but Photon Output?\"\n\"Let's end this.\"\nAlpheas raised his hands to the sky, compressing the photon into an almost dust-sized particle. Meanwhile, Arcane swung his fist, and the massive Might of Darkness plummeted to the ground. This strike was to vent 40 years of frustration.\nShirone and his companions watched in disbelief as the Might of Darkness descended with incredible speed. When viewed up close, it was much larger than expected.\nAs Alpheas's arms slowly descended, they split into dozens of afterimages, puzzling those watching.\n'What's this?'\nThe afterimages of Alpheas moved excruciatingly slow. The photon, once compressed in his palm, disappeared in an instant. During this time, the Might of Darkness had not yet covered half the distance.\nShirone couldn't move a finger, let alone breathe. Time was moving slowly. Only a tiny photon was moving at the speed of light.\nThe photon plunged into the vast darkness. Like a ripple in water, the wave slowly expanded in the slowed time.\nAnd then, in the next moment.\nFlash!\nA powerful explosion of light obliterated everything. The Might of Darkness was torn to shreds, spreading throughout the Magic Academy. The brightness diminished from the center, eventually dissipating like a ring.\nAs time returned to normal, Shirone and his group looked up at the sky in astonishment. The pale moon hung in the night sky where even the clouds had vanished.\n'What kind of magic was this?'\nIt was neither a physical force like Photon Canon nor a persistent effect like Shining. It was a spell designed to explode with the strongest light at a moment's notice.\nArcane's expression twisted.\n\"Alpheas\"\n\"Big Bang. A spell I'm hesitant to report to the Association, but fitting as a parting gift, I believe.\"\n\"Indeed You haven't just been running away for 40 years.\"\nArcane realized Alpheas's intention. It wasn't a counter to dark magic, nor to surpass him. Alpheas had honed Big Bang for this moment, this situation, for 40 years.\n\"Not bad, for someone like you.\"\nArcane's knees hit the ground with a thud. The aftermath of Abyss Memory had severely diminished his brain function.\n\"Lucky you, Alpheas. A 50-year bet paid off. Defeating the great Viltor Arcane will surely raise your fame. Do you aspire to become an archmage?\"\nAlpheas shook his head. Even in such a moment, Arcane clung to his pride, the driving force behind today's Arcane, yet it also seemed pitiful.\n\"Master, you're no longer an archmage. That title belonged to you 50 years ago. It's been enough time for a 10th-grade novice to become a 2nd-grade archmage. Our era has ended. The world has changed, and we're too old for ambitions. How can you not see that?\"\nArcane's temples throbbed with veins. Even though he had lost, he wasn't prepared to be lectured by his disciple.\n\"Why do you think you're the arrogant Alpheas? You probably think you're caught in unfortunate circumstances. Let me tell you the truth. You're not a genius. You're just a half-witted mage who runs away from misfortune.\"\nArcane forced himself to stand on trembling legs.\n\"Old? I became an archmage at your age. Be honest. You lack confidence. You're just making excuses because you can't climb any higher, right?\"\n\"Climbing up isn't the only thing that matters. With age should come the right reflection. But Master, even now, you chase after sweet ambitions like a boy.\"\n\"Hahaha! Foolish Alpheas! What are you so afraid of? Take a step back and look. There are no absolute imperatives in this world!\"\nArcane's body erupted with a terrifying aura again. Realizing he had erased his memory again with Abyss Magic, Alpheas's eyes widened in shock. One use of Abyss Memory might be bearable for the brain, but a second was almost certainly fatal.\n\"Foolish old man! Are you intent on dying?\"\nArcane responded with a sneer and cast Might of Darkness. The shadows under his feet expanded to cover the grounds, lifting the amnesiac students into the air and moving them towards the cliff.\nAlpheas couldn't help but feel terrified this time.\n\"Stop it! It's just meaningless slaughter! What do you gain from this?\"\n\"The satisfaction of victory.\"\n\"Fool! At your age, you still want to win! Do you think you'll always remain a boy?\"\n\"Foolish Alpheas. Listen well.\"\nIn his final moment, Arcane spoke with a confident smile.\n\"A mage is... an eternal boy.\"\nThe 400 students caught in the Might of Darkness were flung out over the cliff like scooping water with a ladle. Alpheas couldn't comprehend it. Using the mental strength exchanged for his life for such foolishness.\n'What drives you? What has this senseless belief brought you?'\nRegardless, now was not the time to worry about Arcane. Having expended all his energy on the Big Bang spell, Alpheas quickly turned and shouted.\n\"Save the students!\"\nAs soon as the order was given, Thadd transformed into a flash of light and flew off. Shirone followed, with Nade and Yiruki using Teleportation to reach the cliff. There were 400 of them. It was impossible to save everyone, but even thinking such was a luxury in this dire situation.\nMidway down the cliff, Thadd created a wall of air with his magic. But to cover at least 50 square meters, the wall had to be thin.\nEventually, the weaker parts of the wall gave way, and students began to fall.\nBelow Thadd, Yiruki and Nade were active. However, it was too late to turn the situation around. From young children to graduating adults, many were falling. Tears welled up in their eyes.\n\"Damn it! Damn, damn!\"\nThrough his blurred vision, Yiruki looked up at the sky. A star in the night sky twinkled, then a streak of light descended vertically.\n\"Shirone!\"\nThe light passed even Yiruki, continuing downward. In Shirone's eyes, a girl with red hair came into view.\n\"Amy!\"\nHearing Shirone's voice, Amy turned her head. Such a response should have been impossible under the influence of Abyss Nova, but Shirone called out again, holding onto a sliver of hope.\n\"Amy! Snap out of it!\"\n'Snap?'\nHumans are thinking beings. Not thinking is harder than thinking. But under Abyss Nova, which blocks memories, the source of thought isn't provided.\n\"Amy! Amy!\"\nYet Amy could think.\nBecause she was Amy Karmis.\n\"Amy! Wake up!\"\n'Annoying. Please stop.'\n\"It's me! Shirone!\"\n'Shirone?'\nWhat did that mean? It was an unknown word. But Amy couldn't let go of the three-syllable word tickling her brain.\n'What is it, what is it? What was it? So curious.'\nAmy kept thinking. Electricity spread across her cerebral cortex, searching for information. Suddenly, one pattern sparked, and the meaning of Shirone surged through her.\n'Ah, right. Shirone! It was Shirone.'\nAmy sighed as if suffocating, relieved. Simultaneously, her eyes ignited with a red glow, activating the power of Red Eyes. Abyss Nova burnt away in an instant, and memories flooded in.\n'Im such an idiot! What am I doing right now?'\nHer trait was Red Eyes, academically known as Autographic Memory.\nThe Karmis family, when their red eyes manifest, can revert to a specific state.\nFor example, they could store the action of swinging a sword and infinitely repeat it with no deviation. Moreover, like Schema, being in the realm of feeling allows for immediate error correction.\n'One mistake is the seed of growth; two mistakes, a disgrace to the family' this adage confidently reflected their belief.\n'What's my current state?'\nUsing her Autographic Memory, Amy analyzed the discrepancy at a neural level. She was under the influence of gravitational acceleration. Her body was tilted at an angle of 87.6 degrees, and her heart rate was 1.6 times faster.\n'I'm falling.'\nThat didn't particularly bother her. Shirone was descending in a streak of light. Recollections involving him surfaced. How could she have forgotten Shirone?\nJoin our discord at .gg/yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 99: To Infinity (2)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\n\"Foolish... really foolish...!\"\nShe had come to him first, offered him a coffee, but then harshly shook off his hand and left. Trying to ignore the scenes filled with regret, Amy tightly closed her eyes. And then she screamed with all her might.\n\"Shirone!\"\nShirone smiled. It was a relief that Amy had regained her memory. At least, in his final moments, he could leave as a Shirone remembered by someone.\n\"Thank you, Amy.\"\nShirone's tears fell on Amy's cheeks.\n'Why are you crying, Shirone?'\nAmy felt anxious. Something was wrong. Then, the moment she saw the will to live fading from Shirone's eyes, she realized.\n\"Shirone! No!\"\n\"I'm sorry. I couldn't keep the promise.\"\nEmbracing Amy, Shirone fully opened the Immortal Function. His consciousness expanded infinitely, and his self began to dissolve like a substance in water.\n'Goodbye to all...'\nFather, mother, the members of the Ogent family, friends at the academy. Having received the love of many, Shirone could smile. A massive light filled the area beneath the cliff. The falling students, along with Yiruki, Nade, and Thadd, were engulfed in the radiance.\nThe next moment, a huge flash of light soared upwards.\nIt was a Mass Teleport, moving as many as 400 people at once.\n'Ah, I see.'\nLying on the ground, Viltor Arcane watched the flash of light rising above the cliff split into dozens of streams. Only in his final moment did he become certain. Where he had been and what a magnificent life he had lived.\n'It was a playground worth playing in all my life, wasn't it, Alpheas?'\nThus, the legendary archmage Viltor Arcane left the world.\n\"Master?\"\nIn front of Arcane's corpse, Canis was stunned. Wasn't he a disciple after all? But Arcane left without leaving any last words, having done only what he wanted until the end.\n\"Was it really nothing? Were we just tools?\"\nCanis rushed to Arcane and shook him.\n\"Wake up! How can this happen! It would be better if I died! Why do you leave me alone!\"\nArin approached Canis with sad eyes. Reflected in the twilight, his figure was made of murky liquid. The shape kept spreading like a liquid and rising again in human form.\n\"No, Canis. It's not your fault. He used us. Hes a villain.\"\n\"Hahaha, how is he not? You're only realizing it now.\"\nHarvest spoke in a hoarse voice.\n\"Yes, Canis. It's all because of you. Arcane, me, and eventually Arin will die too.\"\nArin, glaring at Harvest, hurriedly turned to Canis. Shocked, his figure collapsed and melted into a sticky liquid on the ground.\n\"Why? What did I do? Because I survived in Radum? Because I'm a jinx?\"\n\"Because you're weak.\"\nHarvest's conclusion was simple.\n\"How long will you live just hoping for others' recognition? There is no such thing as 'should live like this' or 'should die like this.' Arcane lived his life his way.\"\nArcane lost his life upholding his belief in evil. Harvest chose self-destruction to fulfill his contract as a magical biobeing.\n'What was I trying to die for?'\nHe found nothing. He was nothing but a blind colt, prancing around. His life was nothing but an empty shell.\n\"Like the master...\"\n\"Yes, and like that boy.\"\nIn the midst of the sprawled 400 students, Shirone lay fallen. He had said he wouldn't hurt anyone. And he kept his belief to the end.\nCanis approached Harvest to check his condition.\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"What does it matter? I'll die anyway. I can't live without parasitizing a life.\"\nArin spoke.\n\"You can make a master-servant contract with me. Canis won't last with his depleted mental strength.\"\nHarvest shook his head.\n\"Sorry, but I can't.\"\n\"What? Why? You'll just disappear like this!\"\n\"My master is Canis.\"\nHarvest's words pierced Canis's heart. It was time for him to raise the banner of his own belief. Could he really endure it? If he made a mistake, they both might lose their lives.\n\"Harvest. I accept you as a subordinate. But I will not forgive a second betrayal.\"\n\"Hahaha. Understood, my master.\"\n\"Canis! It's too dangerous! If something goes wrong!\"\nArin stopped speaking. The shape of Canis, made of liquid, was hardening as mud seeped into it. Would he one day acquire an unwavering heart, like the one she had seen in Shirone during her first awakening?\nCanis reached out his hand to Harvest. As the Contract of Subjugation proceeded, the little life force he had left began to be drained by Harvest. His consciousness fading into darkness, Canis's eyes slowly closed.\nStanding apart from Canis's group, Alpheas stood solemnly. Though he had managed to save the students by the skin of his teeth, the loss was too great.\n\"Headmaster.\"\nEthella shared the same sentiment. From today onwards, there would be significant changes in the magic academy. The students, having regained their memories, would fall into chaos, and the mistake Alpheas made 40 years ago would resurface.\n\"Ethella, I am a sinner.\"\n\"Don't be too hard on yourself. If a life where even mistakes aren't allowed exists, then the very existence of humanity is a sin.\"\nAlpheas shook his head. Everyone makes mistakes, but with every action comes responsibility. Like Arcane, he had no intention of running away.\n\"The person who elevated dark magic to the ranks of great magic. Harvest could be said to be an innovation in the field of memory transference. Abyss Nova will be registered as a standard magic in the Magic Association.\"\nIn front of Arcane's corpse, Alpheas clasped his hands and mourned the death.\n\"Archmage Arcane, always a boy at heart. The path of magic you walked will be passed down to future generations.\"\nAlpheas, having opened his eyes, seemed unburdened. Ethella, on the other hand, still looked worried. This was an incident where the entire academy's lives were threatened, not something that could be settled within the academy.\n\"Headmaster, what do you plan to do now?\"\n\"What else can I say? I am also waiting for my fate. The issue of punishment should be left to the experts, but perhaps we should celebrate today's heroes instead?\"\nAlpheas looked around for Shirone. The more he saw him, the more he realized the boy had a knack for surprising people. Even he couldn't confidently say if he could teleport 400 people simultaneously.\n\"Somebody please help!\"\nAmy was sobbing near where Shirone had collapsed.\nAlpheas and Ethella hurried over, sensing the seriousness of the situation. From afar, Yiruki and Nade were running towards them.\nBut before they arrived, Amy shouted first.\n\"Shirone isn't breathing!\"\nShirone expanded massively and also became fainter. He was permeating everything, having even forgotten his worldly attachments. Then, a powerful force pulled him to a single point. If there is something beyond life for humans, this event could be aptly named the hijacking of the soul.\n\"Ugh! Ugh!\"\nShirone's consciousness reassembled, recalling memories from before he tried the Immortal Function. Trembling briefly with the fear of death, he took ragged breaths and checked his condition. Except for being unclothed, there seemed to be no abnormalities.\n\"Where is this?\"\nIt was a space filled with white. In this monochromatic landscape that stretched infinitely, it was impossible to sense distance. He tried moving slowly, but couldn't feel any progress.\n'It's very strange. It's as if all my senses are paralyzed.'\nShirone had a sudden unique thought. As an experiment, he slowly bent his knees and then stepped forward as if climbing stairs. Surprisingly, his body rose.\n\"Huh?\"\nShirone kept climbing the endless stairs. Pausing to look around, he was at a loss for words.\n\"......\"\nHe didn't feel like he had ascended high. No matter where he moved, the landscape remained the same white scene.\n\"There is no distance.\"\nIf it cannot be measured, then space does not exist. To test his hypothesis, Shirone then tried descending. His assumption was correct. No matter where he moved, it was as if he hadn't moved at all.\nWhen he was about to give up on moving further, a woman's voice was heard.\n\"Impressive. To grasp the meaning of space. You indeed deserve to be here.\"\nShirone did not turn around. In this place, the concept of direction did not exist.\n\"Who are you? Am I dead?\"\nA beautiful woman emerged from the white landscape. As the feeling of distance emerged, the scenery rapidly changed. An enormous temple, like nothing he had seen before, loomed over him.\n\"Wow...\"\nThe scale was unimaginable. Even ancient temples were not this big. Hundreds of pillars supported the ceiling, each about 2 kilometers high.\n\"Where is this exactly...\"\n\"Welcome, Shirone. I've been waiting for you.\"\nThe woman, with aquamarine hair flowing down to her ankles, was the most beautiful woman Shirone had ever seen. It wasn't about her looks. It was about the value of her existence. Like a man in love thinks his lover is the most beautiful in the world, her value here was absolute.\n\"Oops!\"\nShirone quickly covered himself, realizing he was completely naked.\n\"Hehe. There's no need to be shy. This is not your world. Your body still remains in the original world.\"\nWith a wave of her hand, clothes were instantly on Shirone. He gazed at himself dumbfounded, then gave up trying to make sense of it. One question came to mind.\n\"Is this the afterlife?\"\n\"No. It's not the afterlife. Its just a different spot from where you lived.\"\nShirone was puzzled. A spot is a 1-dimensional space without space. A spot moves to become a line, a line moves to become a plane, and a plane moves to finally create a 3-dimensional space.\n\"Could it be...?\"\nHe recalled the white space he had been in before.\n\"Correct. That's the spot. It's not that there's no space, but that it's infinitely compressed.\"\nIf what she said was true, it made sense that he couldn't feel distance. But even trapped in 1-dimension, his body was 3-dimensional. If he could measure the distance between his right and left arms, doesn't space exist?\n\"Aha. So, a 3-dimensional space is within 1-dimension.\"\n\"Exactly. Your insight is remarkable. That's the essence of space-time. No matter how vast a world, from afar it's just a dot. Conversely, even the smallest dot can unfold into an infinite world when you enter it.\"\nShirone finally felt at ease. If logical conversation was possible, even if it was the afterlife, there was no need to fear.\n\"Then who are you?\"\nThe woman laughed innocently. It felt eerie, but to Shirone, even that was beautiful. She was the most valuable existence here.\n\"I am a god.\"\nThe magic academy was in a state of chaos.\nIt took a full 8 hours just to gather Arcane's body and send the students back to their dormitories.\nThe students were still blocked from their memories, lying in their rooms. The teaching staff regaining their memories would speed up the process, but the turmoil that would arise when all the students awoke was a headache.\nTo make matters worse, Canis and Arin, the suspects in the incident, had disappeared, leaving only Nade, Yiruki, and Amy to care for Shirone, who had been moved to the infirmary.\nIn truth, \"caring\" was not the right word. Shirone was not breathing, and his heart had stopped. But no one dared to utter the word \"death.\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 100: Meeting God (1)\n\"Amy...\"\nAmy, her eyes swollen from crying, clutched Shirone's hand. The teachers were out of their minds and nobody had come to visit. Or maybe they had already accepted the fact that Shirone was dead.\nBut Amy shook her head in denial. She couldn't believe that Shirone was dead. There were too many unconvincing aspects to simply label it as an obsession.\nNade offered words of comfort.\n\"Don't worry, senior. Shirone will come back.\"\n\"Right. It doesn't make sense logically. Why would he die just from casting Mass Teleport? If that was lethal, it wouldn't have activated in the first place. Something strange definitely happened to Shirone.\"\nYiruki frowned in dissatisfaction. He too had been watching over him all night, but he believed that thinking a dead person was alive was the most foolish thing in the world.\n\"If that's the logic, Arcane should have lived too. Just casting magic is enough to die.\"\n\"It's different with Arcane! Shirone fully unleashed the Immortal Function. That's completely unrelated to a decline in brain function!\"\n\"Anyway, it's the same as exceeding the capacity. Humans can die from any variable. It's important whether he's dead or alive, not why he died.\"\nNade scowled. Even if it was true, there were things you shouldn't say in front of a girlfriend. Just as he was about to retort, Amy approached Yiruki with cold eyes.\n\"You, always as unpleasant as ever.\"\nYiruki, resting his chin on the table, looked at Amy. Her eyes were burning red.\n'Karmis family, huh. Well, if she has red eyes, she must be immune to mental magic.'\nRed eyes were a famous trait on the continent. The only thing that could penetrate their minds was probably Anti-Magic, so it made sense she escaped Abyss Nova. But that was as far as his interest went, and he turned away, saying disinterestedly.\n\"It's a bad habit to blame others just because you're upset.\"\n\"No. You're the one spoiling the mood. What are you? Are you really Shirone's friend? How can you think he's dead?\"\n\"I didn't think he might be dead. I said he is dead.\"\n\"That's even worse! And you, a Class Five, how dare you use informal language?\"\n\"If you're upset, report me to the student council. I don't care about disciplinary actions.\"\nUnable to hold back, Amy approached and grabbed Yiruki by the collar, lifting him up with the power of Schema. Yiruki's legs dangled off the ground.\n\"Say it again. But this time, say it properly.\"\n\"Oh, how scary.\"\nThere was no emotion in Yiruki's eyes. He just looked down at Amy with empty eyes. But Amy, too, was known for her recklessness when angered.\n\"Repeat after me. Shirone is not dead. Or else you'll end up lying next to him.\"\n\"Shirone is dead.\"\n\"Shirone is not dead! Say it now!\"\n\"Shirone is dead.\"\nAmy's red eyes flickered. She had designed the accuracy of her punch using self-remembered memories, aiming for Yiruki's third and fourth teeth. But Yiruki's expression didn't change. Seeing the deceleration, it seemed she planned to stop just before reaching the lips.\nAs expected, Amy stopped her punch just before it landed. Watching her trembling fist, Yiruki commented dryly.\n\"Ah, that's fortunate.\"\n\"Don't joke around! Frickin annoying savant. You don't even understand why I stopped my fist.\"\nAmy couldn't hit Yiruki. No matter how much she hated him, he was Shirone's friend.\n\"What was the meaning of stopping your fist? Wanting to waste energy, are you?\"\nFire sparked in Amy's eyes.\n\"So, are you saying Shirone is dead with that torn mouth of yours? Do you know? Someone like you doesn't deserve to have friends.\"\n\"Maybe so. But do you have the right?\"\n\"What's wrong? This is really...\"\nAmy pulled his collar again, raising her fist. That's when Yiruki grimaced for the first time, shaking off her hand.\n\"Ah, damn!\"\nAs Amy looked on, shaking her hand, Yiruki walked to the bed and pointed at Shirone.\n\"It's you who are pathetic. Does this really look alive to you? Hes not breathing and his heart stopped! But you keep saying he might be alive, or there's some strange problem, such nonsense! What kind of friends are you!\"\n\"What should I do then! Shirone's like this, what do you want me to do!\"\n\"That's why I'm saying, think!\"\nYiruki shouted, more agitated than usual.\n\"Thinking he's alive will bring a dead person back to life? If you have the mind to spout such nonsense, better think of a way to revive the dead!\"\nAmy bit her lip, searching for words, and finally hung her head in dejection. Yiruki was right. Mathematically, Shirone was dead.\nNade spoke with a sad expression.\n\"I get what you're saying. But Yiruki, how do we revive him? There's no way to revive the dead...\"\n\"Hmph, that's just your limit.\"\nYiruki slammed the door as he left. Silence fell in the infirmary. Amy sat down, covering her face, as Nade consoled her.\n\"Senior, don't hate him too much. Yiruki is just frustrated.\"\n\"It's okay. I don't want to bother with that guy. Telling us to think of a way to revive the dead? Doesn't he understand that's an even greater wound?\"\nNade had no answer to that. It was typical Yiruki behavior, but today, even he felt hurt by such a friend.\nYiruki, leaving the infirmary, frowned as he walked down the corridor. The last two people he wanted to see were waiting for him. Canis leaned against the wall, while Arin looked anxious, unable to find a place to rest her gaze.\nGiven their central role in the recent crisis, they should be strictly monitored, but the current situation didn't allow for such attention.\nYiruki was no exception in lacking peace of mind. If they had intended to flee, they would have done so already. But even then, escaping the Magic Association's watchful eye would be impossible.\n\"Here to gloat? Or perhaps you've come to apologize?\"\nCanis pushed off from the wall.\n\"Both. I came to gloat and to apologize. It's one thing to die in battle, but Shirone's sacrifice for something meaningless bothers me. But it seems I've chosen a bad time.\"\nHe must have heard the argument with Amy from outside. Yiruki, annoyed at having shown such a sight, scratched his head irritably.\n\"Good thinking. Entering now would only show you an ugly scene. The girl in the infirmary would start by breaking your legs. Anyway, do your best. I'm leaving.\"\nCanis followed Yiruki with his eyes as he passed.\n\"That doesn't matter. Choosing a bad time means even the opportunity to apologize is gone. What's the use of apologizing to someone who's already dead?\"\nYiruki stopped, turning to Canis with a fierce glare.\n\"What?\"\n\"I completely agree with your opinion. Dead is dead. The sight of them making a fuss over a corpse makes me lose any desire to apologize.\"\nYiruki paused, thinking, then chuckled.\n\"Well said for someone who's been resurrected. Whose thoughts are those? Yours? Or the shadow's?\"\n\"...Do you want to fight?\"\n\"Shirone, you know, is quite irritating from my perspective.\"\nCanis frowned as Yiruki brought up an unexpected topic.\n\"Actually, I'm a very strange and bad person. That's why I decided to impose restrictions on myself. In a way, Shirone is like a lock to me.\"\n\"Hmph. That's a weak concept.\"\n\"Is it? Maybe I wouldn't have thought this way if it weren't for Shirone. Anyway, now that Shirone is gone, I'd appreciate it if you'd be careful with your words.\"\nArin, sensing something from Yiruki, stepped back.\n\"Because I'm different from Shirone. If I set my mind to it, I can do any crazy thing. So pray that Shirone comes back alive to stop me.\"\nYiruki's eyes began to sparkle fiercely, reflecting sparks originating from his brain through his eyes.\n\"If Shirone ends like this, I'll find a way to kill you first.\"\nCanis's mental channel opened, and Harvest's brainwaves were transmitted.\n-Canis, this is a warning level. You've been targeted.\n-I know. I knew he was a savant.\n-It's more than that. His calculation speed is incredibly fast. By Spirit Zone movements, it's estimated to be more than ten thousand times faster than our mental channel.\nCanis couldn't believe it. His exchanges with Harvest were faster than thoughts. A speed ten thousand times faster was unimaginable.\n-How significant is that?\n-Enough to analyze every event in a city within three seconds. To deal with him, a special strategy is needed. But we're criminals. Causing trouble here would only worsen our situation.\nCanis didn't want to back down. Such stubbornness was why he was chosen as Arcane's disciple, but the timing wasn't right. Amidst Harvest's desperate dissuasion, Arin interjected.\n\"But that means you also believe Shirone isn't dead, right?\"\nYiruki's Spirit Zone disappeared. Arin, observing through her first awakening, finally felt a sense of relief. Yiruki calmed himself. He needed to be more rational than anyone. Getting swept away by emotions was for the fools in the infirmary.\n\"Shirone is dead. Denying reality won't produce a solution. I'm just thinking rationally.\"\n\"No. You believe Shirone is alive. Maybe even more than the two in that room.\"\nYiruki scowled. As a savant, his strength lay in calculating the cause and effect of events. Illogical emotions had no place in it.\n\"What do you know to talk about me?\"\n\"I have the ability of first awakening. I perceive everything as if seeing it for the first time. That's why I can't remember the shape of objects. They always appear different to me.\"\n\"And? What's your point?\"\n\"I can see your emotions. In a completely different form than others see.\"\n\"I'm not affected. Dead is dead. There's no room for emotions.\"\n\"No. It's different.\"\nArin shook her head.\n\"Because right now, you're crying with such a sad expression.\"\nYiruki didn't respond.\nTrue to Arin's words, a hundred words were futile before the first awakening.\nThat night.\nThe infirmary door slowly opened.\nAmy lay exhausted on a cot from crying, and Nade was dozing off in a chair in the corner.\nYiruki approached Shirone. Sleeping and dead had different feelings. Seeing Shirone's cold, lifeless face felt like his heart was crumbling.\nBy morning, the teachers would come to check on Shirone. They would probably begin embalming for the funeral, but once that started, reviving Shirone would be impossible.\nYiruki composed himself and took out a hidden scalpel.\n'I'll definitely save you.'\nHe checked Amy and Nade, but they showed no signs of waking up. Two days of extreme stress had taken their toll. Finally, Yiruki brought the scalpel close.\nThe blade, reflecting the moonlight, cut into Shirone's skin.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 101: Meeting God (2)\nShirone felt as if he had been hit in the head with a hammer. He could believe this place was the afterlife, such was its plausible reality, but meeting a god was an entirely different matter.\nYoure a god?\nIs it hard to believe?\nWell, I didnt even know gods existed, but if they did, I didnt think theyd be so human-like.\nThe woman smiled.\nAll creations inevitably resemble their creator. Everything made by humans contains human thoughts and forms. Plants, animals, mountains, and seas, they all resemble god. But to varying degrees. The standard is creativity. For instance, a squirrel is more creative than a rock. In that sense, humans are quite similar to god. And Shirone, you are among those most akin to god.\nThe woman reached out and gently stroked Shirones face.\nShirone, would you like to create a world with me?\nShirone was confused. Everything was too sudden and unfamiliar. Above all, the woman's statement that this place was not the afterlife lingered in his mind. Perhaps there was a glimmer of hope.\nIs there no way to return?\nThe woman looked at Shirone as if surprised, then shook her head.\nUnfortunately, Shirone, theres no way back. Wasn't it your choice to end your life? Do you now wish to return?\nThats not it. I was prepared for this, and if it wasn't for you, I wouldnt have regained my consciousness. Um is it okay to call you this way?\nOf course. The concept of a god is just that, a concept. I dont have a name.\nThen may I ask one more thing?\nHehe, anything.\nWhy are you lying?\nThe woman's brow furrowed. Just that was enough to make the temple feel like it was shaking.\nGods do not lie. No, they cannot lie.\nAn omnipotent god cannot lie. Whatever they say becomes the truth. But Shirone read in the womans eyes. She was hiding something.\nWhen I asked if there was a way back, you said no. But that's not true.\nWhether there is a way or not, since I said there isnt, there is no way back. Thats why.\nThats a lie.\nThe woman's shoulders twitched. Shirone did not miss her reaction. As she panicked, the temple's scenery wavered as if submerged in water.\nAre you really a god?\nIt had been doubtful from the start. Theres no reason the god imagined by humans has to be the real one, but even so, the woman's reaction was too human-like.\nThe woman nodded as if understanding something.\nShirone. We have different concepts of a god. Thats where the misunderstanding lies. God isnt as noble as you think. God is just a designer of the world.\nThe woman extended her hand, and a glass orb floated above her palm. Inside the orb was a miniature village, with people sparsely scattered around.\nAs you see, I created this village. Of course, its a model. But I can also move people like this.\nThe woman put her finger into the orb and moved a farmer, who was feeding a horse, to a nearby field.\nSee, the farmer has moved. Changing space means time was assigned. Can you find any difference between this world and the one Shirone lived in? None. This is what a god is. I am now the god of this village.\nThe woman brought the orb closer to Shirones eyes.\nA god is merely a designer who can create a dimension one step lower than the one they reside in. Yet, why does god feel absolute? This is the interesting part. This farmer wont realize that some force has moved him to a nearby field.\nThe woman drew the orb back and cradled it in her palms. As she spread her arms wide, the village rapidly expanded, engulfing the temple.\nShirone looked around. Suddenly, he was in the village. The two of them stood at opposite ends of a path, facing each other. The other people remained still.\nThe woman approached the farmer tending the field.\nThis farmer doesnt know how imperfect my world is because he was born here. Theres only one way to know.\nThe Immortal Function.\nCorrect. The Immortal Function expands your senses as a whole. This village is contained within the orb. So, its not an exaggeration to say theres no world beyond this orb.\nThe woman touched the farmer's shoulder. He turned into light, covering the entire sky. Then, as she clenched her fist, the scenery shrank, and the entire village was again encapsulated within the orb.\nShirone quietly observed the orb, now filled with light emanating from the farmer.\nThe farmer expanded to the whole through the Immortal Function. But even so, he cannot perceive my existence. The same goes for you, Shirone.\nShirone felt the farmers state was not unrelated to him. Had the woman not attempted a hijack, he too would have dissipated into meaningless light.\nWhat do you want from me? Knowing such facts, what can I do?\nExactly this, Shirone.\nThe woman placed the orb between her palms and pressed down. The orb shrank and compressed into a black dot.\nSpot\nYes. This is the essence of the world we live in. The world you dwell in is merely a dot. But if you go inside, an endless world unfolds. Its the space-time matrix.\nThe woman demonstrated directly. As the landscape in the orb vanished into a point, a new world was born. A world within a world, and then another world within that... Then, as she pressed her palms together, the orb disappeared. Billions of worlds vanished in an instant.\nPlease enter the space-time I created. There, create your own space-time. Then, a perfect universe will be born.\nFor reasons unknown, she seemed to desire innovation in her world. It wasnt an entirely unwelcome proposal. Becoming a god of another world as the price for facing death seemed like an acceptable ending.\nI cant do that.\nThe woman asked, puzzled.\nWhy not? Theres no reason or justification for refusal.\nIf I enter your space-time, I would have to sacrifice someone else like me.\nA flicker of sorrow passed through the woman's eyes. But her emotional change was brief, and she returned to a cold expression, speaking to Shirone.\nWhat does it matter? Its a world you create, after all.\nBut you are not a god.\nFor the first time, hostility appeared in the woman's eyes.\nYoure a human, just like me, inhabiting the same world. The fact that you brought me here before being completely dismantled is proof. If you were truly a god, shouldnt you exist outside this world?\nThe woman did not deny it. But it didnt change the outcome.\nShirone, you must follow me. I called you here for a purpose. If you refuse, we can proceed with the dismantling process right now.\nHer power had reconstructed his mind, so it might be possible for her to reverse it as well. However, now that there was even a slight possibility of returning to his original world, Shirone had no intention of complying easily.\nI will not be dismantled.\nThe woman extended her hand towards Shirone, casting the omnipotent dismantling. However, Shirone did not disintegrate. He was already in the Spirit Zone.\nYouve hit upon another problem. An excellent choice.\nThe womans arm slowly lowered.\nNow I understand. The Spirit Zone was also a Spot.\nA Spot could infinitely delve deeper, following the principles of the space-time matrix. That was why Shirone, as a spirit, could enter another Spirit Zone.\nAnd this place is your Spirit Zone.\nShirone concentrated the energy of light. The woman grimaced, displeased. The red glow emanating from Shirones body was pressuring her with a menacing aura.\nIt had been five days since Shirone's death.\nAll the students had regained their memories. The children were especially confused. But they were geniuses with exceptional mental strength, so the aftereffects were less severe than expected.\nHowever, the real challenge was just beginning.\nThe incident of the academy being occupied by the miscreants exposed the vulnerability of the security system. Especially for an academy operating a dormitory system, safety was a top priority.\nThe biggest problem was that there had been a student death. And it was Shirone Arian, a promising student of the academy.\nAt the request of Yiruki and Nade, Shirone was in the infirmary, not the mortuary. Logically, a funeral should be held, but the teachers were wary of taking any action.\nThe reason the student council had yet to determine responsibility was because Shirones death was not officially declared.\nIn effect, they were planning to label Shirone a ghost and evade responsibility.\nOf course, many teachers felt guilty about this approach. Currently, they were gathered in the teachers' meeting room, emphasizing the urgency of the matter.\nWe must hold Shirones funeral immediately. We have to inform his parents as well. If we dont handle this now, the academys policy will be criticized in the future.\nIts not a decision to be made lightly. If the news of a student's death spreads, the repercussions will be huge. We could lose the reputation weve built up in an instant.\nSo, we lie that a dead student is alive? Itll come out eventually! The academys position now should be to make a declaration of conscience. It's not about reputation, the academy might even be shut down.\nWho doesnt understand that? Cant we just take a little more time to think?\nThe more we delay, the worse it gets. Why cant you see that? Currently, the whereabouts of Arcanes disciples are also unknown. The failure to capture the criminals is also a critical issue. We need to act now.\nThe teachers delaying Shirones funeral were divided into two groups. Those making political calculations wanted to draw out time and gather the students' anger.\nOn the other hand, there were teachers who genuinely couldn't accept Shirones death. Prominent among them were Ethella, Thadd, and Siena, who were directly involved at the scene and doubted Shirone's death.\nHeadmaster, please speak up! I heard the student council is convening today. The teachers must act.\nThe teachers' urgency was partly influenced by the student council. If students backed by powerful families began accusing the academy, they might miss the opportunity to act.\nI suggest we wait and see.\nThe majority of the teachers stood up.\nHeadmaster!\nAlpheas understood their feelings. The longer they delayed, the more the academy was at a disadvantage. But for him, something was more important than the academy's survival. It was determining Shirone's exact condition.\nWas Shirone really dead?\nIt was a preposterous notion to entertain at a magic academy, the symbol of intellect.\nThats why he was more cautious. If it wasn't Shirone, would such doubts even arise?\nI must think rationally. But I cant.\nPerhaps Shirone was receiving special treatment. But even knowing this, Alpheas couldnt ignore the subtle feeling lodged in a corner of his mind.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 102: Vajra Ascent (1)\nLets not jump to conclusions about Shirone. Currently, we lack information about Unlockers.\nAlpheas found agreement with Ethella, who added her thoughts.\nShirone entered the Immortal Function three months ago. And in this battle, he opened it to an extreme degree. The Karsis Order recognizes the Immortal Function as a process of mental sublimation. It might be a matter separate from life itself.\nWhat are you saying? We're not here to hear the stance of the Karsis Order. We want to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.\nSome teachers didnt understand Ethellas point. The Immortal Function is not about level, but a state of being. Even the most learned teacher can't confidently claim to have deeper insight than a street beggar in the realm of enlightenment.\nThe teacher who had rebuked Ethella addressed Alpheas directly.\nHeadmaster, please reconsider. With all due respect, this whole situation started because of your past. There's nothing more important to us than the academy. If we continue like this, the worst-case scenario might unfold.\nAlpheas looked around at his audience. Dozens of eyes were silently pressuring him.\nThe worst-case scenario? What exactly do you think is the worst-case scenario?\nThe academy could be shut down.\nNo, thats not the worst-case scenario.\nA teacher, frustrated, hit his chest as he spoke.\nI cant understand your stance, Headmaster. What could be worse than the academy shutting down?\nThe worst-case scenario for an academy is when all the students and teachers are dead.\nThe meeting room was engulfed in silence. The gazes towards Alpheas shifted.\nIf it werent for Shirone, no one would have survived. And that list of the dead would have included you all as well.\nAlpheas was disappointed with the teachers who, instead of honoring a student's death, were only trying to exploit it.\nIsnt there a sliver of possibility left? Even if its less than 1%, he's a child who sacrificed his life for us. Shouldn't we at least try until we can? Even if the academy shuts down, shouldnt we as teachers do our utmost for Shirones return? Isnt that our duty?\nBut Headmaster, what does the academy mean to us? Its sad about Shirone, but if we shut down like this\nThe academy wont shut down. I will take all the responsibility. So please, do your best for Shirone. Shouldnt we make this sacrifice for him?\nThe teachers couldnt argue against Alpheas. Regardless of the reason, the fact that a student had saved their lives was undeniable.\nAfter the meeting, the teachers left the room with gloomy expressions.\nAt the Magic Academy Student Council.\nIn a large meeting room, student council members from each class had gathered. Unlike the teachers, worried about their own futures, these sensitive students felt betrayed by Alpheass past.\nGood day. I am Amyra, the Student Council President. Ive convened this meeting to deliberate on the current situation. Please, let's have a constructive discussion.\nAmyra, a Class Two student, and a Climate Magic major, declared the meeting open from the podium. At twenty-two, she was the top candidate for graduation.\nAs a representative of the student council's leftist faction, the atmosphere of the debate was predictable. Unsurprisingly, the first to request speaking rights were conservatives defending the academy's position.\nIm Sharelle from Class Three. Theres a serious criticism against Headmaster Alpheas within the academy. However, we must be cautious. The academys honor is the same as that of the students. Attacking the teachers in this situation could negatively impact the advanced class students.\nKas from Class Four here. I see some merit in Sharelles opinion, but this issue is about the moral conduct of the teachers. Even if it happened 40 years ago, it was still a crime. If the academy doesnt take responsibility, I believe it has no future.\nNaturally, Amyra agreed with Kas. But, as the chairperson, she simply nodded instead of openly showing support.\nThis is Olivia from Class Six. The main issue now is Shirones death. As we know, Shirone is dead. However, a minority of students and teachers are distorting this fact. This has led to the academy missing two suspects who colluded with Arcane and delaying the prosecution of the Headmaster. This is a clear avoidance of responsibility, and the student council should step in.\nAmyra was also angered for the same reason. The teachers were delaying Alpheass prosecution under the pretext of uncertainty about Shirones condition.\nSharelle countered.\nIsnt that an overinterpretation of the teachers' intentions? Shirones heart is not beating, but theres no decay either. As far as I know, the Ivory Tower is discussing the aspect of him opening the Immortal Function. Considering these factors, the teachers judgment is not incomprehensible.\nThe students responded indifferently. The Immortal Function, hard for even teachers to grasp, was beyond their understanding. Some students didnt even know what the Immortal Function was.\nAmyra was no different. The ultimate state a mage could aspire to. But what did that mean, exactly?\nMagic is a knowledge-based phenomenon. Claiming something as the pinnacle while it remains elusive and abstract makes it hard to appreciate its significance.\nExcuse me, Im Veronica from Class Ten.\nA girl, only eight years old, raised her hand. In the student council, class representatives were chosen regardless of age, so her opinion carried equal weight.\nYes, go ahead, Veronica.\nDid Headmaster Alpheas do something wrong?\nHer voice, on the verge of tears, made Amyra furrow her brows and sigh.\nThis is why I proposed separating by class.\nVeronica continued, sobbing.\nEven if Headmaster Alpheas did something wrong, cant we forgive him?\nThats not possible, Veronica. This is about the academys honor.\nBut everyone makes mistakes, right?\nThe atmosphere in the meeting room stirred. Veronica's innocent yet profound statement had certainly caused ripples. Seizing the opportunity, the conservatives paid close attention to her words, observing the unfolding situation.\nI often get scolded by my mom too. But she doesn't scold me too harshly. She says that everyone can make mistakes. Headmaster Alpheas made a mistake, but he has led the academy well so far. Cant we forgive him?\nSeeing his chance, Mark from Class Seven raised his hand and stood up.\nIm Mark from Class Seven. I agree with Veronica. Of course, those who commit crimes must be punished. But we, who have so far trusted the academy's security and advocated for maintaining the status quo, should not overstep our bounds. If the teachers arent trying to neglect the situation, then the student council should also have the wisdom to wait.\nWell done, Mark.\nSharelle gave a thumbs-up under the table, and Mark nodded back in acknowledgment.\nWith this turn of events, opinions were sharply divided.\nAmyra calculated the votes based on everyones statements. Generally, the lower grades were siding with the academy, while the graduating class was critical. The higher grades votes were split.\nThis might not go well.\nWithout a way to accuse Alpheas, the situation would remain unchanged. But turning the tide against the relatively younger students of the lower grades, who were more emotionally driven, was challenging.\nIm Fermi Ardino from Class One.\nAll eyes turned to Fermi, who had been silent until now. As the top student in the graduating class and a future graduation candidate, it was natural to be curious about his thoughts.\nSharelle watched Fermi with unease. A young man with neatly combed dark brown hair and a professional look, but his authoritative appearance hid a mischievous streak.\nDespite being capable enough to graduate, he had repeatedly failed, and even though he was a likely candidate for the next student council president, he had withdrawn, leaving the position to Amyra.\nHonestly, it was hard to understand what he was thinking. The only clear thing was his penchant for stirring trouble and enjoying conflicts with everyone.\nWe all owe a debt of gratitude to Shirone. If it werent for him, we would have been dead by now. Therefore, there are surely those among us who cannot accept his death.\nThe students grew solemn. They were aware of how hard Shirone had fought for the entire student body.\nBut Sharelle became more anxious. As far as she knew, Fermi was not the type to feel grateful to anyone. The reason for his sudden talk about Shirone was a mystery.\nI am grateful to Shirone too. But the teachers are using him as a shield. Therefore, our judgment is not overstepping. Its a struggle to protect Shirones spirit.\nWhat do you mean by protecting his spirit? Shirone isn't dead yet...!\nIts been five days. Shirones heart isnt beating. Everyone here must miss Shirone, dont you?\nMost nodded. Even if they didnt think so, mourning someones death wasnt a difficult task.\nWe all miss and are grateful to Shirone. So, let me ask again. Does anyone here truly believe Shirone is still alive?\nSharelle realized Fermis strategy. By separating emotions from logic, guilt disappears and reality becomes clearer. The students would make a cold judgment.\nOf course, no one does. Its not cruel, its common sense. Yet the teachers still claim Shirone is alive. Its like some kind of cult.\nSharelle stood up, banging the table.\nThats not true! There are certainly strange aspects to Shirones condition...!\nWhat's so strange? Ive read the report on the Immortal Function. But it has nothing to do with the biological death of a being. Weve also received intel that Shirones body has been preserved.\nThats...!\nIt was Alpheass directive. If the Immortal Function involved the spirit, then physical decay must be managed here with foresight.\nHow Fermi had accessed such closely guarded information was a mystery.\nAmyra sharply asked, her eyes flashing.\nPreservation? Is what Fermi said true?\nSharelle glared at Fermi, annoyed at his innocent smile.\nThat bastard. Stirring trouble for no reason. He just wants to cause chaos.\nSharelle, please answer.\nSharelle sighed. A fight they could have won turned uncertain due to a momentary lapse.\nI invoke my right to remain silent. If you want more answers, I suggest formally convening an inquiry.\nRemaining silent implied consent, but saying it outright was a different matter. The importance of silence was leaving room for argument. There was no need to prematurely seal ones fate when the situation could still turn around.\nAmyra didnt waste time. The mood had shifted again, making this the best point for action. She moved to the vote.\nLet's begin the secret ballot now.\nThe outcome... was as Sharelle had expected.\nAlpheas, resign! Undergo an investigation by the Oversight Department!\nProceed with Shirone's funeral! Playing with the dead is not what teachers should do!\nAbout a hundred students who joined the student council's decision were demonstrating in front of the infirmary, holding pickets and protesting.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 103: Vajra Ascent (2)\nAmyra, standing at the forefront, encouraged the students.\nThe academy must fully disclose everything about this incident. Prosecuting Headmaster Alpheas is the only way to ensure the future of the Magic Academy!\nRight! Alpheas, resign! Proceed with Shirones funeral!\nTheir shouts echoed beyond the infirmary windows to where Amy and her group were. Suddenly, the door burst open, and Sharelle entered.\nAmy, its a mess!\nWhat happened? Why are they suddenly like this?\nAmys confusion was natural. She thought the student council meeting was about to end, but suddenly they gathered, demanding Shirones funeral.\nThe seniors are conspiring to accuse the Headmaster. I thought we could at least protect Shirone, but Fermi messed it up\nAmy didnt need to see to understand. Fermi was more than capable of such a thing. The student council seemed to be heading towards the Headmasters retirement. However, she couldnt blame them. If the academy's head had moral flaws, moving on was better for the future.\nBut it was too extreme. Thats why Fermis behavior was irritating. The teachers lukewarm response had triggered the student council's anger, but Fermi was the one who lit the fuse.\nThat bastard. He owes his life to Shirone too.\nWhat should we do now, Amy?\nAmy bit her nails, deep in thought.\nWhat else? We have to endure.\nAlpheas had said to watch over Shirone for a while. That he had convinced the teachers to do even this much was a miracle.\nNade, looking out the window, turned to Yiruki with a sharp retort.\nAre you satisfied now? Theres a crowd out there thinking just like you. Shouldnt you be out there with them?\nDo you want me to join them?\nYiruki snapped back. The tension between them had remained since their fight.\nSharelle frowned.\nStop it, both of you. Fighting among ourselves wont solve anything. We need to unite now.\nTch! You think Yiruki will cooperate? Hes heartless.\nEnough. And Yiruki, you too. Be cautious. The situation has seriously escalated. One word could change public opinion, so stay here for now.\nI had no plans to leave anyway.\nYiruki buried his face in his hands, deep in thought. It had been five days since Shirones death. His prediction was taking much longer than expected.\nIf the student council is moving, the teachers wont hold out for long. Maybe 48 hours left\nThe atmosphere in the infirmary turned cold. Everyone was overly sensitive from the ordeal.\nAmy stroked Shirones forehead. Logically, he should be considered dead. But was clinging to hope in the current situation normal?\nPlease, come back, Shirone\nAmy couldnt be certain of Shirones return. But now, five days since his heart stopped, the realm of certainty had passed. It was now a matter of faith.\nThe woman watched the red light emanating from Shirone. Its high energy could vibrate particles and destroy any object.\nShirone, dont do this. That magic is too destructive. It doesnt suit your nature.\nI dont want to fight either. But you intend to keep me here. I cant allow that. I must return.\nDo you think you can defeat me?\nShirone shook his head. It was an honest feeling. This being, calling herself a god, possessed formidable powers. She was surely at a higher level than even Arcane.\nWho exactly was this woman? And where was this place?\nShirone stopped his thoughts. He knew this was not where he belonged.\nPlease tell me how to return to my original world.\nEven if I tell you, it wouldnt be possible. It would be an act leading you to death once again.\nI still think I should try.\nThe woman was not afraid of Shirones magic. But the power of the laser was not to be underestimated. She had to prevent the destruction of this world at all costs.\nAlright. Ill let you do as you wish. But promise me, if you fail to return and come back here, then follow my will.\nWhats the method to return?\nWill you still do it, knowing theres no room for negotiation?\nShirones resolve didnt change, regardless of the looming danger.\nAlright. But Ill never give up.\nYour life is yours. Use it as you wish.\nThe woman created a glass orb in front of Shirone. Inside, dark shadows swirled.\nShirone. To return to your original world, you must reverse the process you underwent to come here.\nI see.\nIts not something to be taken lightly. Going from a pure spirit back to a human. Humanity is a collection of unpleasant elements. If you cant accept it, youll become a strange being, neither human nor anything else.\nThe woman was certain of Shirones failure.\nWhat you see now is a Spot that penetrates space-time. Commonly known as a black hole. Through it, you can return to your original world.\nAs the orb vanished, a vast darkness appeared in front of Shirone.\nWhat should I do?\nIts simple. You just need to enter. Its a Spot connected to your physical body.\nThank you. I wont forget this kindness.\nShirone was sincere. Although hijacked, if not for her, he wouldnt have had the chance to return to his original world.\nDont thank me prematurely. I never thought you would succeed. If you want to give up, just walk back this way.\nWould such a situation arise? It seemed unlikely he would return if he died, but Shirone didnt jump to conclusions without experience.\nThen, I'll go now.\nThe woman, with sleepy eyes, said,\nHave a good journey.\nShirone stepped into the sphere. It felt similar to when he first entered the Spot. As expected, he couldnt find the exit. No matter how much he walked, nothing changed.\nGlancing back, Shirone was startled. The woman was still looking at him with sleepy eyes. Time wasn't passing. He was trapped in the event horizon, a phenomenon only occurring in extreme gravity.\nI cant escape. Its absolutely impossible to leave this place.\nShirone finally understood the woman's words. In a place where even time couldnt escape, there was nothing he could do.\nAs smart as he was, he quickly faced reality. With a dejected heart, Shirone turned around. He had to go back to her. It was better to live among people than be trapped in darkness forever.\nWait. Maybe\nShirone stopped suddenly. In the event horizon, time was eternally trapped. But he had the ability to generate time. It was photonization magic.\nSub-light speed, near-light speed, light speed, super-light speed.\nThere were four speeds categorized by photon mages. According to Shirones calculations, to pass through the event horizon, he needed a speed faster than light - super-light speed.\nSuper-light speed... Can it be done?\nShirones level was at best near-light speed. Adding the Particle of God, light speed seemed possible, but that was still far from super-light speed.\nLet's think.\nNow that he had a plan, time wasnt an issue. After much deliberation, his eyes lit up with resolve. It might be possible to achieve super-light speed in his current formless state.\nImmortal Function.\nEven the speed of light is not fast enough to travel the vast universe. But the speed of infinite expansion is instantaneous. Perhaps the Immortal Function was the key to reaching super-light speed.\nRegardless, his priority was to return. Shirone took a deep breath and simultaneously cast photonization magic and opened the Immortal Function.\nThe effect was immediate. The trembling of acceleration from sub-light speed, near-light speed, to light speed was strong enough to collapse the Spirit Zone.\nUghhh\nYet, he didnt reach super-light speed. As long as the concept of faster than time was incomprehensible, casting magic through willpower was impossible. What remained was the complete opening of the Immortal Function. Entering an unknown realm of potential annihilation, he expanded his consciousness to the whole.\nShirones form burst, disintegrating into particles. Finally, something faster than light crossed the event horizon and raced towards the light.\nIt worked!\nShirone still maintained consciousness. Even with the Immortal Function fully open, no particles dispersed in the black hole. He saw the exit in the distance. His physical body was waiting there.\nIm going! Finally!\nSuddenly, his speed started to decrease. Meaningless particles began to stick between Shirone's particles. As they combined, creating meaning, they acted like voices, confusing Shirones mind.\n-Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption.\n-Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction.\nAs Shirone's eyes grew heavier, the exit seemed to move away. The particles intertwined complexly, evolving simple meanings into higher-dimensional concepts.\n-Ah, birth, to the lowest of beings.\n-I dont want to die. The life of mortals.\nShirone realized this was the process of becoming human, as the woman mentioned. A being thrown into the world, embracing both desire and fear.\nPerhaps every human heard such voices in their mother's womb?\nI wont lose! I will return!\n-Where to? Theres nowhere welcoming you.\nTo my world! Where my friends are waiting!\n-They will kill you. Youll hinder consumption and reproduction. A journey of inevitable death awaits you, filled with collisions of desire and painful struggles.\nUghhh! I cant hear anything! Nothing can stop me!\nShirone cried out desperately. But as the combination progressed, the drifting voices grew louder.\nA human, in the end, is a being made of numerous voices. Like a solo buried in a chorus, Shirone eventually lost his own voice.\n-Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption.\n-Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction.\nSeven days since Shirones death.\nThe student council was still staging a sit-in. Specifically, it was the radicals following Amyra.\nIn contrast, conservative students blocked the entrance, preventing entry. With factions dividing even the moderates, the number of demonstrators had doubled.\nMost of the student body was gathered in front of the building, protesting day and night. The friends protecting Shirone were on the verge of a nervous breakdown.\nExecute Shirones funeral!\nExecute! Execute!\nAlpheas, face the judgement of the Magic Association!\nFace it! Face it!\nSharelle covered her ears. Though the windows were closed, muffling the sound, she couldnt bear to listen anymore.\nIsnt this too much? Why are they so desperate to condemn Shirone?\nAmy, who had been dozing off on the auxiliary bed, raised her head at Sharelles words.\nThose kids have their reasons. Even students who usually disliked Shirone have joined in.\nIs Shirones competence his fault? Because theyre narrow-minded?\nThats how humans are. If there are people who acknowledge Shirone, there are bound to be those who reject him.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Vajra Ascent (3)\nYiruki, who had been lying on the table, spoke up.\nDid you actually do something about it? Just yesterday, you were saying youd go after them and beat them up.\nAmy had no energy to get angry. Yiruki probably felt the same. After a week of relentless stress, even moving a finger felt like too much effort.\nAmy, resting her chin on the bed, said,\nSeeing how things have turned out, I understand now. But there are still people fighting for Shirone.\nNade, watching the sit-in through the window, interjected.\nBut our side is mostly low or high classes. On the other hand, most of those protesting are advanced class students. If they really attack, we wont be able to stop them.\nSharelle said,\nBut for now, we should be okay. We have the teachers on our side. Headmaster Alpheas, Teacher Siena, and Teacher Ethella are with us.\nThats because you dont know, senior. Those people... their actions have been suspicious since yesterday.\nHuh? What do you mean?\nSharelle turned to Nade for an answer, but it was Yiruki who responded.\nIt seems a few are missing. Amyra and Fermis absence is especially strange. At least one of them should be there to incite the crowd.\nAmy, irritated, shouted,\nHey! Why do you speak formally to Sharelle but keep using informal language with me?\nYiruki turned away, uninterested. He had no particular reason. He simply thought of Amy as a friend, being Shirones girlfriend.\nThe infirmary door opened, and Alpheas entered with Siena and Ethella. The teachers faces were increasingly worn due to the persistence of the student council.\nYouve been through a lot. How is Shirone?\nAs you can see... no change.\nThat's unfortunate, but it cant be helped.\nEven Alpheas now harbored doubts. A week had passed. If some absolute being claimed Shirone would come back to life, he could wait a year, even ten. But no one could prove Shirone would return, which was the problem. It was a fight against time.\nIll cast a spell on Shirone.\nAmy and Sharelle made way. Alpheas placed his hand on Shirones chest and cast a slow spell, a preservation treatment that wouldnt harm the body.\nAfter finishing, Alpheas stepped back. Now Shirone could last another day.\nBut for how long? Teachers were silently watching, but over time, voices of dissatisfaction would inevitably rise.\nSiena gazed at Shirone, then gently stroked his head. It was unfair and regrettable. A promising mage like him ending up like this before blooming.\nThat's why I said I should have stopped it.\nShirone had overcome the Overflow. But the price was frequent contact with the Immortal Function. Ethella had said she would take all responsibility at the time. Now, she didnt want to criticize the choices made. If Shirone took the wrong path, she would spend her life comforting his spirit.\nTeacher! Something's happened!\nSharelle shouted. Amy and Nade, looking out the window, couldnt hide their anger. Siena walked to the window. Amyra and Fermi, unseen since yesterday, were pushing documents towards the infirmary.\nWe, representing the students of Alpheas Magic Academy, will file a complaint against all teachers! Please allow us to take Headmaster Alpheas into custody!\nSiena felt a headache coming on. What she feared had happened. The student council had played a strong hand. Not only Alpheas but also other teachers were in line for punishment.\nIf the complaint was filed, the situation would escalate uncontrollably. If the students families intervened, the academy would collapse without a chance for recovery.\nSiena opened the window, and the crowd suddenly quieted.\nWhat is all this noise about? Is this what the student council should be doing, stirring up the academy?\nAmyra walked toward the window.\nThis isnt incitement. We didnt want to go this far. Thats why we havent submitted the complaint yet. But there are too many unanswered questions. Its been seven days since Shirones death. But the teachers are reluctant to announce it.\nShirone isnt dead. Hes just in a comatose state.\nTheres no such thing as a coma without a heartbeat. The reason for no decay is also unacceptable. Couldnt Headmaster Alpheas magic make it possible?\nThe student council seemed to have reached that conclusion. It was an accurate prediction.\nBut there are things in the world that shouldnt be judged by results alone. The student council failed to understand why Shirone had to be preserved.\nThe root of the issue was the Immortal Function. Even students of the Magic Academy didnt know about the state of nirvana, so they responded emotionally.\nYour thoughts are correct. Currently, Shirone is being preserved from decay by a slow spell.\nSiena admitted frankly. The student council, and even the students blocking the entrance, stirred.\nAre you admitting the allegations?\nThat's premature, Amyra. Allegations are for when teachers use Shirone as a shield to escape. Thats not the case here.\nYour words are valid, teacher. But we havent heard any facts which justify such a decision. The student council cant understand the teachers actions.\nThe teachers havent acknowledged Shirones death. Nor are they trying to escape. Thats why we are asking for your understanding.\n\"Teacher, Shirones death is also a sad matter for us. But the student council does not want our beloved alma mater to fall apart like this.\"\n\"We understand that you currently cant trust the teachers. But we too have thought carefully and made the best decision. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\"\nAmyra pondered Shirone's words. There was a possibility that the teachers knew something they were missing. Humans tend to believe what they think is right.\nBut no matter how much she thought about it, it didnt make sense. Shirone was already dead. Or, frankly, whether dead or alive, the fact that all teachers were protecting him was infuriating.\n'Is this the right way? Am I in a rational state? What if Shirone comes back to life? But that's impossible...'\nAmyra, as the student council president, didnt want to file a lawsuit unless necessary. But if she backs down, the students would suffer the consequences.\nWatching Amyras conflicted demeanor, Fermi was displeased. If things continued like this, the plan could fall apart. He decided to step in.\n\"So, we cant find a middle ground after all. Then we have no choice but to use our last resort.\"\nSiena looked at Fermi with a displeased expression. In her four years of teaching, she had never encountered a student like him. Talented, yet more skilled in hiding it.\nHe reveled in controlling situations with deception and lies. Though this might be a necessary skill for a mage, it wasnt a quality a student should possess.\n\"Pfft, file the complaint or dont, it's your choice. Youll be the ones to regret it in the end.\"\n\"Fine, let's do that! First, we'll recover Shirones body and proceed with the lawsuit! Let's go! Well rescue Shirone with our strength!\"\nFermi led the advanced class students toward the infirmary. No one could stop the crowd, now caught in mob psychology.\n\"Carry out Shirones funeral! File charges against the teachers! The academy belongs to students, not teachers!\"\n\"Wait! Dont do this!\"\nMaria, among other students supporting Shirone, stepped in. However, they couldnt prevent the path from opening. Fermis side was mostly advanced class students, revered as seniors. If they resorted to force, numerical advantage meant nothing.\n\"Isnt this too much? Youre making a big deal over a dead student. What does protecting him mean to you?\"\n\"Shirone isnt dead.\"\nNade, with tears in his eyes, said fiercely,\n\"What do you know? What can you say about Shirone?\"\nEven though she was feeling pity for Nade, Amyra couldnt change her stance.\n\"If you want a physical confrontation, I wont stand still. I'll subdue you before the students get hurt.\"\nAmyra stepped back, gathering energy into her fists. White clouds billowed around her, the Cloud Magic from the weather series. It had a very good affinity with electricity. At Amyras level, she could even charge the clouds with Nades electricity and counterattack.\nWhy do people make irresponsible decisions without thinking about the consequences?\nYiruki emerged from the entrance. Nade frowned. What was he here for now? But Yiruki stopped not beside Amyra, but next to Nade.\nWhat? Dont interfere. This is my fight.\nBut from now on, it's also my fight.\nWerent you on their side?\nNades tone was brusque. Although there was no lingering resentment between friends, Yiruki, who believed Shirone was dead, had no reason to get involved in this battle.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Vajra Ascent (4)\n\"Are you dividing sides like children? I'm serious too. I don't want them taking Shirone.\"\nAmyra looked dumbfounded. She respected the desire to protect a friend, but against the advanced class, they stood no chance.\n\"Do you really think you're so great? Think you can beat us?\"\nAmyra led the protest group into their Spirit Zones. The potent zones of the advanced class students resonated with Nade and Yirukis empathy.\n'Hehehe. Hehehehe.'\nFermi, watching their standoff, chuckled to himself. The current situation seemed ludicrous to him.\n'Yes, fight, fight. Destroy yourselves.'\nFermi knew that profit came from chaos and conflict. War was the ultimate blue ocean, where the few winners exploited the many losers.\nHe knew how to win in war: desensitize emotions. Emotion is a human's weakness. Those who could manipulate others' emotions ruled the world.\n'Mourn. Rage. Shout that you alone are right. That's how you fuel the fire. Of course, I'll reap all the benefits.'\nSiena, observing from the infirmary, caught Fermi's smirk.\n'It's all your doing, you wretched boy.'\nAngry but unable to blame him, Siena recognized the merit in Fermi's philosophy. Perhaps even Fermi was exploiting Shirone's situation.\nAlpheas approached Siena.\n\"It's inevitable now.\"\n\"Headmaster.\"\n\"It seems this is as far as we go. Let's accept the student council's demand.\"\nAmy protested.\n\"Headmaster! No! What about Shirone?\"\n\"Sorry, Amy.\"\n\"How can you do this? You know Shirone isn't dead!\"\n\"I'm not sure.\"\nShocked, Amy froze. Alpheas touched her shoulder.\n\"Amy, no one knows Shirone's condition. We just believe. I believe he'll return.\"\n\"But why...\"\n\"Look outside. Students who shouldn't be involved are fighting. Why it happened doesnt matter. I can't let students fight any longer.\"\nAlpheas, valuing every student, couldn't prioritize Shirone in this chaos.\n\"I'll go down and speak. Inform Shirones parents and start funeral procedures. Well discuss the disciplinary action later.\"\nDefeated, Amy slumped into a chair. Siena approached her, teary-eyed.\n\"Amy, what now? Shirone, Shirone is...\"\nAmy felt the same. Shirone hadn't returned. The moment Alpheas admitted it, Shirone vanished from her heart.\n\"Shirone...\"\nOutside, the atmosphere was tense. Everyone was in their Spirit Zones, ready to cast deadly spells.\nDoubt crept into Amy. Was this the right path? Could logic justify students from the same school aiming deadly magic at each other?\nShe bit her lip, alternating glances between Nade and Yiruki. Nade was ready for battle, but Yiruki seemed open to a conversation.\n\"You, Yiruki, the Savant, right?\"\nYiruki didnt respond.\n\"Is this necessary? Your friend is too emotional. But you're different, right?\"\n\"Sorry, but Im emotional too now.\"\n\"Lies. Or, it doesn't matter. You know, dont you? Do you really think Shirone is alive? Is that your conclusion?\"\n\"Hmm, a conclusion? Then there is only one answer.\"\nYiruki, who had been thoughtful, glared at Amyra.\n\"Shirone isnt dead.\"\nNade, shocked, looked at Yiruki. Yiruki had insisted Shirone was dead until now. The sudden change was baffling.\n\"Yiruki, you...\"\nYiruki still faced forward. Amyras disappointment grew. She had hoped in the most rational person in school, but he was just another high-class kid.\n\"If you really think so, you must have logic to convince us, right?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nAmyra blinked. It was unbelievable until she heard it.\n\"Then provide evidence. Why do you think Shirone is alive?\"\n\"Because it's 4:07 PM.\"\nDing. Ding. Ding. Ding.\nThe clock tower rang.\nYiruki, as a Savant, didnt need a clock to tell time. He was simply counting seconds from a point.\nNade realized why Yiruki had been silent lately.\n'He was counting seconds, but since when?'\nAmyra, shocked, turned from the clock tower.\n\"I get it now. You're crazy. What does time have to do with Shirones death?\"\nYiruki didnt answer. He thought there might be some discrepancy, but it was much later than expected.\n'4:07 PM. 8 seconds. 9 seconds. Whats happening?'\nAmyra concluded. Her judgment was right. Conversing with an emotional Nade and insane Yiruki was futile.\n\"We'll take Shirone. Let's see how long you can last against the advanced class students.\"\nThe energy from the school's top students made Nades eyes fill with murderous intent. Then, a familiar but unexpected voice rang out.\n\"Having fun, I see. Mind if I join? This is my specialty, after all.\"\nEveryone looked around, but couldnt see the voices source. Soon, two figures, Canis and Arin, emerged from the shadow cast by the building.\nAmyras eyes sparked with anger.\n\"You all! How dare you do this here! I'll restrain you right now!\"\n\"Go ahead if you can. I'm not planning to run anyway.\"\nCanis nonchalantly responded and approached Yiruki.\nYiruki frowned in annoyance.\n\"You're too late.\"\n\"Wasn't it until 4 PM?\"\n\"You're 27 seconds late.\"\nCanis bristled but managed to suppress his anger. Settling the debt he owed was the priority.\n\"Here it is, what you asked for.\"\nYiruki quickly took the document Canis handed over and flipped through the pages. Nade, puzzled, peeked at the document.\n\"Yiruki, what's that?\"\n\"A pathology report for Shirone. I sent his tissue samples to the King's Commission.\"\n\"What? When? And how could it arrive from the capital in just 5 days?\"\nIt would take four days by carriage alone, not counting the analysis time at King's Commission.\n\"I asked Canis for help. He knows Bashuka's geography well.\"\nCanis ground his teeth, recalling the ordeal. It was a journey taken at the risk of his life to meet the deadline. He traveled by carriage during the day and used Dark Port at night. Though faster at night, it drained his magic to the point of losing consciousness multiple times.\n\"Anyway, this clears my debt to Shirone.\"\nCanis didnt particularly feel remorse for Shirone's death, but as a disciple of Arcane, he felt a sense of responsibility for Shirone's sacrifice.\n\"Well, it's not my business. Anyway, I'll let Shirone know.\"\nThe situation took a strange turn, and Amyra felt uneasy, especially knowing the King's Commission was headed by Yiruki's father, the leader of the kingdom's top organization.\n\"What's this trick? You think we'll back down just because you're Mercodine?\"\nThe students gathered were from families no less influential than Mercodine's. They had enough power to fight back if they pushed with numbers.\n\"Don't worry. I used a pseudonym. If my name were there, who knows what that old geezer would pull. More importantly, isn't the content of this document what matters?\"\n\"Pfft! What, some magic spell to revive the dead written in there?\"\nYiruki closed the document and started from the beginning.\n\"Title. Opinion on Immortal Function and Cessation of Biological Activities.\"\nHearing the title, the protest group tensed and fell silent. Those in the infirmary on the third floor also perked their ears to Yiruki's following words.\n\"Analysis of the subject's tissue sample. Non-kinetic cataleptic state. No organic transformation found in the sample taken more than 24 hours after death. Data attached.\"\nYiruki turned to the next page.\n\"Based on the data, the subject is considered to have ceased biological activities, but its premature to extend this state as an absence of life.\"\nHe emphasized this important section.\n\"The King's Commission classifies heart stoppage into three cases: First, the heart's function has ceased. Second, the heart's function has temporarily ceased. Third, the heart has not ceased, but appears so.\"\nAmyra scoffed in disbelief.\n\"What nonsense is that? I understand the first case, but the rest makes no sense!\"\nYiruki turned the page, unfazed.\n\"Explanation of cases. Although a biological entity is considered dead with the heart's function ceasing, two new cases are possible with Immortal Function.\"\nThe silence deepened as Yiruki's voice rose.\n\"Case 1. If mental expansion is delayed due to a particular event, the body may temporarily cease functions until the mental conclusion is drawn. Report attached.\"\nNodding, Yiruki read the next section.\n\"Case 2. Even if mental expansion concludes, the observer's time may differ. That is, life activities are normal, but the external world cannot confirm those activities due to a spacetime barrier. Report attached.\"\nYiruki briskly flipped through the remaining pages, reaching the final section.\n\"Based on the magical findings, the subject, currently in the infirmary...\"\nHe presented the report from the King's Commission to the crowd.\n\"Shirone Arian cannot be considered deceased.\"\nThe previously noisy protest group maintained a stunned silence. They, being mages, knew no one could refute the King's Commission's analysis.\n\"Yiruki. When did you start...\"\nYiruki, facing a dazed Nade, smirked.\n\"How about that? The way I found to revive the dead.\"\nNade awkwardly pursed his lips. There really was a way. While all were lost in false hope and sorrow, Yiruki had been fighting a lonely battle.\n\"See for yourself.\"\nYiruki handed the report to Amyra. She wordlessly took it, her gaze fixed on the first page stamped with the King's Commission's seal.\nFurther struggle seemed pointless. The kingdom's top academic institution affirmed the teachers' judgment. Even if they filed a complaint, the court would likely favor the school.\n\"You've worked hard, Amyra.\"\nAlpheas appeared at the building entrance.\n\"Headmaster.\"\nAlpheas's appearance seemed to bring a close to the confrontation, with the weight of the situation palpable in the air.\nJoin our discord at /yT4GsFAYRf\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Vajra Ascent (5)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nFor the first time, Amyra's eyes, which had been firmly set, wavered. Even her steel-like determination melted away upon seeing Alpheas Myrhe's face.\nWhy wouldn't it? He had been with her since the days when she wet the bed.\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to burden you with this.\"\nAmyra bowed her head, struggling to hold back the tears that threatened to fall.\n\"I don't mean to cause pain to the Headmaster. Those who are respected by the world should not cover up their wrongdoings. Otherwise, the school might even...\"\n\"I understand. None of you here are hated by me. You are the future of the school.\"\nAlpheas looked at Amyra with a sympathetic gaze. All the students gathered here were like his own children that he had nurtured. He felt nothing but regret for having caused them any hurt.\nLifting her head again, Amyra looked at Alpheas with moist eyes. He was smiling kindly, just like she remembered from her childhood.\n\"Will you trust me just this once? Once Shirone's matter is settled, I will handle everything transparently. Even if I am to be punished, I will stand proudly before my beloved students. There will be no running away.\"\nHot tears streamed down Amyra's cheeks.\n\"Will you really return? The one I admire...\"\n\"Of course. There will be no deceit in my punishment. I promise you, with my life's honor.\"\nAmyra wiped her tears with the back of her hand. She could never cry in front of Alpheas. She wanted to show him how much more mature she had become since childhood.\n\"Understood. Since you have spoken thus, the student council will reconsider the matter. I hope you will not do anything to tarnish your honor.\"\nAlpheas smiled contentedly. She had grown into a smart and mature student. The child who used to run to him calling, 'Headmaster Dun-Dang!' had grown up so much.\n'Erina, perhaps my life hasn't been in vain after all.'\nWith the student council president's decision, the protestors immediately disbanded. The conservative faction that had occupied the entrance scattered, and the front of the building quickly became desolate.\nFermi Ardino, the only one left, scratched his head awkwardly.\n\"Ah, it was going so well, but it got messed up at the end.\"\nAlpheas burst into a hearty laugh.\n\"Hahaha! It seems things didn't go as planned this time, Fermi.\"\n\"It can't be helped. Honestly, I think it's cheating for the Headmaster to step in.\"\n\"You should be graduating soon, right? You'll be twenty-two next year.\"\n\"Maybe. Maybe not. There's no better money-making place than here, after all.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nAlpheas was aware that Fermi was a key figure in orchestrating this situation. But to him, Fermi was just a student who had grown up too fast.\n\"Besides, this place is still fun for me. I'll be taking my leave now.\"\nWithout any further pleasantries, Fermi bowed and walked away. He probably wouldn't set foot in the student council again after today. After all, peaceful places don't make money.\nHeading towards the infirmary, Yiruki and Nade were silent. It was their first serious argument in five years, and the awkwardness lingered. But Nade couldn't stand the atmosphere.\n\"Hey! How can you not say a word? You don't need to fool me, too. You're just trying to look cool, right?\"\n\"That's ridiculous. What's the point of discussing strategies with someone swimming in a sea of sorrow? Besides, if information leaks, they'll take measures, too. Why can't you think straight?\"\n\"Fine, I'm an idiot! Why are you always thinking you're so great!?\"\nWhether it was anger or insults, the conversation broke the ice. The awkwardness vanished in an instant. Yiruki asked with a worried expression.\n\"But what about you? It's not good to revert to your old temperament, no matter how angry you are.\"\nNade wrapped his head in regret.\n\"Ah, I don't know. I didn't have time to think about anything else at that moment. Anyway, we didn't fight, so it's fine.\"\n\"Yeah, I was pretty cool, wasn't I? You've probably already forgotten.\"\n\"You're joking. You had it all calculated, didn't you?\"\n\"Hahaha, what does it matter? You should bow down to me.\"\nThe conversation between the two ended as the door to the infirmary opened. Amy was waiting to meet them. Yiruki scratched his head awkwardly. It was still difficult for him to be comfortable around Amy, unlike with Nade.\n\"Well, it turned out like this. Anyway, we protected Shirone...\"\nJust as he tried to brush it off, tears streamed down Amy's eyes.\n\"Thank you. Thank you, Yiruki...\"\nYiruki looked terrified.\n\"Ugh, enough.\"\nUncomfortable with emotions, he quickly escaped into the infirmary. However, there awaited Sharelle, another bundle of emotions, with open arms.\nYiruki dodged Sharelle's embrace with a weaving technique from boxing and took refuge beside Shirone.\n'Ugh, this is why I can't stand women.'\nAt the door, Sharelle and Amy hugged each other and started jumping around joyfully. Nade joined in, and the infirmary became a whirl of excitement.\n\"Woohoo! We did it! Shirone is saved!\"\nEven Yiruki, amidst the cheerful atmosphere, couldn't help but smile slightly. But deep down, he wasn't feeling as optimistic. They had only postponed Shirone's death on paper; the situation hadn't really improved.\nShirone still lay motionless, as if asleep. The promise to be together after graduation was still fresh in his mind, yet it felt unreal that the person himself might be dead.\n'Come back. I'll wait for you, no matter how long.'\nShirone regained consciousness. More precisely, he went from one form of madness to another. His mind, like a coin spinning rapidly between the North and South poles, oscillated between normality and insanity.\nHe seemed to go mad a thousand times. Though he desperately tried to hold onto his sanity, the overwhelming stimuli infiltrated Shirone's essence, altering his nature.\n\"You are an abandoned child. Your parents would have been fine with anyone but you. Did they never struggle raising you? Every time, they must have regretted it. Wishing they hadn't picked you up. If you had been with your birth parents, such thoughts would never have crossed their minds.\"\n\"No! That can't be true!\"\n\"Your essence is that of a vile predator. With your superior abilities, you trample over everyone. Your power inevitably leads to someone's failure. You are an unnecessary tumor in this world.\"\nShirone went mad again, feeling as if his mind reeked of foulness. What would he become if this fusion ended now? A demon? A yaksha? A devil? It was uncertain.\nThe pace of his madness accelerated. As he reached the limit, two contrasting natures began to coexist simultaneously in his mind.\nIt was a new world.\nIn a state of supreme mental clarity, unreachable by any drug, Shirone finally found the only solution to maintain his sanity.\nThe origin.\nIf the extremities of the cycle are the limits, the origin is the starting point of these limits. But it contained the potential to encompass the entire world.\nSome call it a spot. Others call it a Spirit Zone. Yet others, the Taiji. But a mage would call it this:\nInfinity.\nShirone's eyes snapped open. The Spirit Zone, which had been sucked into his head, began restoring the myriad of particles fluttering at superluminal speeds back to a mental body.\nFrom the center of infinity, Shirone remained unshaken. The tormenting voices disappeared, and the strength of his psyche tightened like a diamond.\nThe state of Vajra, reachable only after thousands of mental torments.\nIndestructible Vajra.\nShirone, burning brightly, looked towards the exit. There was no more confusion. As he moved, the warm and bright light of the exit merged with his body.\nA small, transparent glass bead floated before him. Inside the tiny bead, which could fit on his palm, was the temple he had just left and a woman looking up at Shirone.\n\"You're finally leaving, Shirone.\"\n\"I'm sorry, but I want to go back.\"\n\"There's no need to apologize. Honestly, I didn't think you'd succeed. You are worthy.\"\nThe woman's unexpected acquiescence made Shirone's departure feel heavy. Maybe that's why he felt compelled to ask despite it being irrelevant now.\n\"Were you lonely?\"\nThe woman blinked in surprise, then smiled warmly.\n\"Shirone, you are kind. But gods don't feel loneliness. I'm just a bit sad that you're leaving. Just a bit.\"\n\"Thank you for reviving me. I really wanted to say that.\"\nThe woman's expression turned serious for a moment.\n\"Remember this. There won't be a second chance. Having reached the state of Vajra, you're no longer a being who can be invited here.\"\nShirone nodded firmly and walked towards the exit. As his mind was pulled into another dimension of space-time, he felt a warm light.\n'I'm finally going back.'\nAs his consciousness faded, he heard the woman's voice.\n-Please send my regards to Headmaster Alpheas.\nEven in his blurred state, Shirone wondered how she knew Headmaster Alpheas. But his thoughts didn't last long, and his spirit smoothly merged back into his body.\nOn the 10th day of Shirone's death.\n\"Ugh.\"\nAmy Karmis woke up, rubbing her sleepy eyes. Stretching her back in the chair, she heard a crack. Staying up every night, her body moved, but her brain still felt asleep.\nLooking around, her friends were still asleep. After drinking water and washing up, she approached Shirone, drying her face with a towel.\n\"Shirone, will you come back today?\"\nAmy's breath hitched with a gasp. Her heart pounded in her ears. A chill ran up her spine, shaking her shoulders and face.\nShirone had opened his eyes.\n\"What? What?\"\nAmy called Nade and Yiruki, who were sleeping on a spread blanket.\n\"He, here... here, here...\"\nShe couldn't find her words. She tried to make a sound, but her throat felt blocked. Amy took a deep breath, closed her eyes tightly, and screamed.\n\"Kyaaaaaaa!\"\nNade and Yiruki jolted awake at the ear-piercing scream in the infirmary.\n\"What! What is it!\"\nAlpheas steadied his trembling heart and reached out his hand. Even he, a Grade-4 mage, couldn't help but be startled seeing Shirone with his eyes open.\nShirone was currently under a Slow Magic spell. He probably spent the entire night just lifting his eyelids. To really know if he was alive, the spell had to be dispelled.\nAlpheas placed his hand on Shirone's chest and turned back time. Yet, Shirone still showed no signs of movement. What happened next was beyond anyone's guess. It was left to the will of the heavens.\n\"Huff!\"\nSuddenly, Shirone gasped for air and sat up. The faces of those anxiously watching brightened. On the other hand, Shirone looked terrified, as if he had returned from hell.\n\"What happened? How?\"\nShirone was startled by the rush of air entering his lungs. The world in Slow State appeared as a colorful abstract painting. As the scenery returned to normal, he saw the faces of the people, with Amy and friends crying behind Alpheas.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Back to Everyday Life (1)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nFrom Shirone's perspective, not much time had passed. After entering the Immortal Function, meeting the woman, and escaping through the black hole was all that happened. However, in reality, 10 days had already passed.\nShirone awkwardly smiled and raised his hand.\n\"Haha. Hi?\"\n\"Hi, my foot, you jerk!\"\n\"Ouch!\"\nAmy punched Shirone's face playfully. Though there was no real impact, pushed by her force, Shirone fell onto the bed, looking up with a pained expression.\n\"Ow! Why'd you do that all of a sudden?\"\nAmy was shedding tear drops like chicken droppings.\n\"You bad guy, making us worry like this... you bad kid!\"\nShirone looked dazed. Everything was rushed and bewildering. But soon, he realized something and smiled warmly. Amy's tears told him all he needed to know about what had transpired.\n\"I'm sorry. I caused you all this trouble...\"\n\"Shirone is back!\"\nNade and Yiruki pushed Amy forward, burying Shirone under a heap on the bed. Caught unintentionally in Shirone's embrace, a blushing Amy screamed.\n\"Kyah! Hey, get off!\"\n\"Ow! It hurts, it hurts!\"\nShirone also screamed, more out of embarrassment than pain. Twisting his body with all his might to avoid further embarrassment with Amy, he ended up dropping his friends to the floor.\n\"Phew, what's all this about?\"\nSitting on the bed, Shirone looked like a refugee who had just survived a bombing. On the floor, Amy, nursing her sore back, scolded Nade and Yiruki.\n\"That is quite the grand welcome back. Youth really is something else.\"\nShirone fixed his expression upon seeing Alpheas. His presence alone indicated the gravity of the situation.\nShirone asked Nade the most pressing question.\n\"What happened to Arcane? And the others? What exactly happened?\"\nNade, who was being scolded by Amy, shouted in disbelief.\n\"That's not the issue! You've been dead for 10 whole days!\"\n\"What? 10 days? And dead?\"\n\"Of course, man! How can you be alive if your heart isn't beating? Explain what happened.\"\nShirone seemed shocked and was at a loss for words for a while. He knew he had to explain what he had experienced, but he didn't know where to start.\nThe door to the infirmary opened, and the teachers entered. Siena was surprised to see Shirone awake. Although she had prayed fervently for his revival, the shock of seeing it with her own eyes was considerable.\nEven though she hadn't achieved the Infinite Realm like Shirone, she vaguely understood how terrifying and painful it was to come back from a state of mental disintegration.\n'But I'm glad you're back. Thank you.'\nSiena smiled at Ethella, who had been tormented by immense guilt over the past 10 days. As expected, Ethella approached Shirone with a face about to burst into tears.\n\"Shirone.\"\n\"Teacher, I'm sorry. I've caused trouble again...\"\nEthella embraced Shirone before he could finish speaking.\n\"I'm sorry. It's my fault. I should have paid more attention. This will not happen again.\"\nTo the friends, it seemed like a beautiful embrace between teacher and student, but for Shirone, it was excruciating. Ethella hugged him so tightly he could barely breathe. Aside from the embarrassment, he felt like he was suffocating.\n\"Uh, Teacher...\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Sorry to ask, but could you let go? I can't breathe.\"\n\"Oh my!\"\nRealizing her mistake as Shirone gasped for air, Ethella quickly released him.\n\"I'm sorry. I just got too excited...\"\nShirone took a deep breath, his face turning pale. But this feeling too was part of the real world. Delighted to be back, he smiled and said,\n\"Now I really feel like I'm back.\"\nNoticing his friends' skeptical looks, Shirone hurriedly waved his hands.\n\"No, it's not what you think. I mean, this is...\"\n\"You little brat, what are you going on about?\"\nAmy rushed over and pinched Shirone's cheek.\n\"Why? Am I not real enough for you?\"\n\"No! That's not what I meant!\"\nNade and Yiruki burst into laughter. Alpheas watched Shirone mingle with his friends, then quietly slipped out of the infirmary. He knew the busiest times were ahead for him.\n\"Headmaster.\"\nTurning around, Shirone had quietly left the infirmary and was approaching him.\n\"What is it? You should rest for a while. Talk with your friends. We'll probably continue to be closed for a while.\"\n\"Thank you for your concern. But there's something I'm curious about.\"\n\"Oh? What's that?\"\nShirone recounted everything he experienced without omission. From the moment he entered the Infinite Realm to how he returned through the black hole.\nInitially, Alpheas listened with interest. However, as the story progressed, his expression gradually hardened. Especially when Shirone described the woman's abilities, Alpheas closed his eyes and sighed deeply.\n\"That woman said she knew me?\"\n\"Yes. She said to send her regards to you, Headmaster. It's a bit of a hazy memory, but that's what I remember hearing.\"\nShirone wondered if he had brought up an unnecessary topic. Alpheas's expression was far more troubled than he had anticipated.\n\"Yes, I think I know who she is.\"\n\"You do?\"\nShirone's eyes widened in surprise. Alpheas was undoubtedly a great mage, but the woman he had met existed beyond life itself, in another world. The idea that Alpheas knew someone from that other world was intriguing.\nAlpheas's thoughts, however, were different. It wasn't coincidence but destiny that Shirone met her. From the moment he achieved the Immortal Function, it was destined to happen.\n\"Who is she, exactly?\"\n\"Adrias Miro. She was known as the Labyrinth of Time and Space back then. A student of mine who specialized in Scale Magic.\"\nShirone looked stunned. He had never imagined that she was Alpheas's student. Especially the abilities he had thought divine were actually a form of magic, Scale Magic.\n\"What is Scale Magic?\"\nAlpheas Myrhe pondered how to explain, scratching his eyebrow.\n\"Shirone, in the world of mages, those who have reached the Immortal Function are called Unlockers.\"\n\"Yes, I've heard of it.\"\n\"Then this will be easier to understand. Miro was also an Unlocker. From a young age, her curiosity was immense. She delved into it endlessly, exploring worlds larger than the universe and smaller than particles. Scale Magic is a magic that only those who have realized the infinity of space-time can wield.\"\nShirone recalled his encounter with Miro. Indeed, her primary ability, the glass bead, freely manipulated the relativity of space-time.\n\"Miro said she had been watching over me. Is that possible?\"\n\"Don't worry. Miro resides in a different dimension from you. But when you opened the Immortal Function, you may have briefly reached the same dimension. She must have been waiting for that moment.\"\n\"But why me? Unlockers are rare, but according to Arcane, there are quite a few. There must be many more talented than me.\"\nAlpheas stroked his beard, pausing for a moment. The information he was about to share was highly confidential, known only to staff who had worked there for over 20 years.\n\"Miro is the founding president of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\"\nShirone pictured Miro's face. The founder of the research group he was a part of was impressive enough, but the fact that she was the first president nearly 20 years ago and had hardly aged was astonishing.\n\"Miro wasn't obsessed with phenomena. She believed too much couldn't be explained through knowledge. Along with her peers, she established the research group in Estas. The current President of the Thormia Magic Association, Garold Mikeah, was also one of the early members.\"\nShirone imagined the members of that time. According to Nade, the master key to the Estas, the Magic Warehouse, was created by an Unlocker with the same Savant ability as Yiruk. It wasn't Miro, and it probably wasn't Mikeah. He could guess how talented the early members were.\nAs Shirone pondered, Alpheas too, was reminiscing about events 18 years ago. Miro was a kind soul. If it weren't for that day's incident. Realizing something he had omitted, Alpheas turned back to Shirone.\n\"Shirone, do you know the total number of students in the school?\"\nIt seemed more like a rhetorical question, as Alpheas quickly continued.\n\"The total changes, of course. Some graduate, take leaves of absence, or are disciplined. But no matter the number, this school always has one less student than it should.\"\nAlpheas looked out the window as he spoke.\n\"Miro never graduated. She still resides in this school.\"\nShirone gulped. It felt like hearing a ghost story passed down through the school. But what did \"resides\" mean? Wasn't she said to be living in a different dimension?\nAt that moment, the idea of Scale Magic came to Shirone's mind.\n\"Then could it be...\"\nAlpheas nodded.\n\"Yes. Miro is in Estas. Of course, it's a higher dimension created by Scale Magic. Those who know refer to it as the Upper Layer.\"\nAlpheas placed his hand on Shirone's shoulder.\n\"Promise me, Shirone. Don't speak of today's conversation to anyone. The Upper Layer is not something you should involve yourself in. Don't interfere with it under any circumstances. It could lead to chaos in the world.\"\nShirone hesitated to respond. The unknown world. Unlockers. Scale Magic. All this information swirled in his mind. He had no intention of recklessly stepping into danger, but promising never to get involved would be a lie in one way or another.\nAlpheas sighed as if expecting this reaction.\n\"If you really want to know about Miro, I'll allow you to research the ruins of Kergos. This isn't to appease you. It's too dangerous to delve straight into the Upper Layer. So please, abide by this.\"\nFinally, Shirone nodded. Alpheas's strict warning must have had its reasons. Shirone also preferred a gradual approach.\n\"I understand. But thinking that she's in Estas is kind of eerie. I might not be able to sleep in the research group. She could appear suddenly.\"\n\"Don't worry. Miro will never leave the space she created.\"\nShirone tilted his head, wondering how Alpheas could be so certain.\n\"But she's incredibly talented. Is there a special reason?\"\nAlpheas looked out the window with a sad expression. It wasn't a statement made with certainty, but he knew that Miro would never return.\n\"To Miro, this world is... just too painful.\"\nAlpheas, Canis, and Arin left for the capital, Bashuka, to face an inquiry by the Magic Association. According to the teachers, the school would remain temporarily closed until the Association's decision was made.\nShirone was admitted to the infirmary. Having had no heartbeat for 10 days, the medical team decided to monitor his condition. Shirone, not wanting to do anything for the time being, was killing time with his friends.\n\"Shirone, I'm sorry. You must have felt so let down.\"\nSharelle said with a sad face. After regaining her memory, her biggest regret was coldly pushing Shirone away the day he brought coffee.\n\"No, it's not your fault. It was the magic. You didn't do anything wrong, Senior Sharelle.\"\n\"Still, how could I forget you?\"\n\"It's really okay. Don't worry about it too much.\"\nSharelle's eyes softened like a deer's.\n\"Shirone, you're so kind. So, what are you going to do now? Are you going to demand my body?\"\n\"Wha-?\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Back to Everyday Life (2)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nShirone's face turned incredulous. His friends' reactions were no different. Amy shook her head in disbelief and then, pressing her forehead with her hand, said,\n\"Sharelle, what book have you been reading these days?\"\n\"Yes! This one!\"\nSharelle eagerly pulled out a novel. The provocatively red cover bore the title \"Primitive Snare.\"\n\"This is the hottest book in the bookstores right now. Its about a married nobleman who falls in love with a maid. Theres this line where the maid breaks his dish and asks, 'What are you going to do now? Are you going to demand my body?' Then the nobleman ties her up with ropes and...\"\n\"Stop! That's enough!\"\nAmy raised her hand to stop her. It felt like they shouldnt hear anymore.\n\"Why? The interesting part is just coming up.\"\n\"Sharelle, even if you like novels, please don't confuse them with reality. Such books are vivid and provocative to captivate readers.\"\n\"Humph! You say that because you haven't read it. If you read it just once, youll be hooked. Speaking of which, do you want to borrow it?\"\nAs Sharelle offered \"Primitive Snare,\" Amy quickly turned her head away. Accepting her request would mean enduring a week or more of her reviews.\nShirone leaned back against a cushion and spoke.\n\"Ah, today's the last day in the infirmary. Thanks for coming by. You too, Senior Sharelle.\"\n\"Don't say such disheartening things. Honestly, studying in the advanced class was killing me. It was a nice break for both Amy and me.\"\nAmy didn't disagree. The stress of daily ranking competition had reached its peak. Thus, the temporary closure of the academy was like a blessing for the seniors.\nSharelle spoke with a gloomy expression.\n\"But I'm worried about the headmaster. Honestly, this decision was unexpected. It was something the Creas Autonomous District could handle, but he chose to undergo the Magic Associations inspection.\"\nAlpheas had voluntarily filed a lawsuit. Although he could have easily defused the situation due to his high standing in the continent, he accepted all the student council's demands. Consequently, the case had been transferred to the most dreaded Inspection Division 3 of the Magic Association.\n\"The Inspection Division 3 is known as the special investigation unit in the Magic Association. They strictly abide by the law, regardless of connections or status. Even Headmaster Alpheas can't avoid disciplinary action.\"\nShirone thought it was for the best.\n\"The headmaster has been carrying this pain for 40 years. If this opportunity can lighten his burden even slightly, I think accepting the punishment is a good thing.\"\nNade commented.\n\"Let's just wait and see how things go. Who are we worrying about? It's Alpheas Myrhe, a Grade-4 mage. We'll be busy again once the academy reopens, so let's rest while we can.\"\n\"Yeah, that sounds good.\"\nShirone turned to look out the window.\nThe afternoon sun poured in lazily.\nBashuka, the Capital.\nViewed from the Jijeon Mountain Range, the scenery of Bashuka was dominated by the towering royal palace, with key institutions spread out around it in concentric circles. The residents of the capital say that the buildings visible from the mountain range symbolize the nation's key institutions.\nOne of these was the Magic Association. The 18-story building oversaw the affairs of all registered mages in the Thormia Kingdom and handled the surveillance and intelligence tasks of the mage community in collaboration with other agencies.\nWhile any mage would want to visit the place at least once, Thadd, assigned as the guide for Alpheas, Canis, and Arin's party, felt like a cow being led to the slaughterhouse.\n\"Master, is this really the best course?\"\n\"This is what I've chosen. My only regret is that it took too long.\"\nAlpheas's determination was unwavering. Thadd didn't really expect an answer; he just wanted to reconfirm his master's will before crossing the Association's threshold, from where there was no turning back.\n\"Understood. Then I'll wait until the trial is over.\"\nAlpheas looked pleased. Taking Canis and Arin with him, he surrendered to the inspection department, and thus, the three were locked in separate cells for a day.\nThe next day, Alpheas was the first to be called into the interrogation room. Meanwhile, Canis and Arin waited in an isolation facility decked with magical devices. The magic control devices made entering the Spirit Zone impossible. Additionally, even Harvest couldn't operate.\nAfter about three hours, they were called.\n\"Canis, Arin. Come out.\"\nAlthough no formal charges had been proven yet, the Association's staff already treated them like criminals, likely influenced by Alpheas's report.\nCanis and Arin silently complied. As they entered the corridor to the interrogation room, they saw Alpheas approaching from the opposite side. Canis intended to pass by him indifferently, but Alpheas turned to the guards and spoke just as they were about to cross paths.\n\"Excuse me, could we have a moment to talk?\"\n\"Yes, but please be quick.\"\nCanis snorted at the guard's completely different attitude towards Alpheas. It wasn't Alpheas's strength but his fame that earned him such treatment. The fact that Alpheas, whose magic skills were inferior to Arcane's, could exude the air of a victor, irritated Canis.\nAs the guards stepped aside, Alpheas said,\n\"Don't be too tense. Just answer a few questions and you'll be out.\"\n\"You're mistaken. We're not your docile students. We've fought countless battles. No situation scares us.\"\nHaving experienced life and death in battle, Canis had something that his peers lacked. But that life also meant many losses. Alpheas wanted to help them regain what they had lost, with their future still so promising.\n\"That's actually why I wanted to see you.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"How about enrolling in the magic academy after this is over?\"\nCanis felt insulted. Didn't Alpheas know how he had lived? Being told to mix with sheltered students after learning magic in life-threatening situations.\n\"Don't joke around. We didn't lose because we were weak. If it weren't for Abyss Nova, or if it had been a fair fight, master could have taken you down in one hit.\"\n\"That might have been possible.\"\nAlpheas readily agreed.\n\"But if it hadn't been for that method, maybe I would have been the first to kneel and apologize.\"\nCanis bit his lip. It was an unacceptable statement, yet he couldn't argue against it.\n\"Canis, that's what evil is. No matter how justifiable the reason, hatred is inevitable. You can rise higher. I want to give you not darkness but a bright future.\"\n\"Why do you care about me? Is it sympathy?\"\n\"I, too, was a disciple of Arcane. You could say it's a death sentence for you. Just as time can't be turned back, connections last forever. If you want to start a new life, I will help you.\"\nCanis didn't respond. What could a new life possibly mean now? He had only learned combat, and thus, it was his fate to live on the battlefield.\nAs Alpheas walked away down the corridor, the guard grabbed Canis and Arin and dragged them back to the interrogation room. Contrary to what he had imagined about Inferno's prison, the interrogation room was neat and tidy. A slender man sat at the table, his back turned, unidentifiable except for his silver hair.\n\"Investigator, these are the suspects in this case, Canis and Arin.\"\n\"Ah, come this way.\"\nHis voice was chilling, like sharpening steel. Fitting for someone who roamed the notorious Inspection Division 3 fields, there was a blade-like aura about him. Canis and Arin walked around the table to face the investigator. Contrary to expectations, he wasn't a fearsome sight. His chin was pointed like a cat's, and he was smiling with narrow eyes.\n\"I am Sakiri, an investigator of Inspection Division 3. You are Canis and Arin, correct?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nCanis answered calmly. However, there was no response from Arin. Not wanting to irritate the investigator, Canis turned to her and asked.\n\"Arin, what's wrong?\"\nArin was trembling, her face pale. Canis realized from her eyes, shaking with shock as she looked at Sakiri, that she was horrified.\n'What did she see to be this scared?'\n\"Canis, I can't read it...\"\nArin, being at the first stage of her psychic abilities, should not be unable to sense the feel of objects. This meant the object originally had no feel, or the feel was artificially erased.\nIndeed, Sakiri, as seen by Arin, appeared bizarre. His whole body was like smooth metal, mirror-like, and his egg-shaped face lacked any features. His hands and feet were pointed like cones, making reading even the slightest emotion impossible. It was a form of the first stage that could only appear in a state of perfect emotional blockade.\n\"Oh, it seems the lady is startled. Its the first stage, right? Magic is blocked, but there's no way to block inherent traits. Of course, I don't think you two will cause any trouble.\"\nSakiri seemed intrigued, putting down his pen and crossing his legs.\nArin watched as his cone-shaped legs twisted. They coiled and uncoiled like a pretzel.\n'This person is playing games.'\nIt wasn't just about suppressing emotions. He was someone who could perfectly control his own emotions.\n\"Focus.\"\nArin jerked her head up. The mirror-like face of the investigator extended sharply into a cone, coming right in front of her forehead.\n\"Please do. We are on official duty, after all. Arin, is that correct?\"\n\"Yes, it is.\"\nTerrified, Arin didn't even realize she had answered. The sharp cone pointing at her forehead must have been Sakiri's intense gaze. It was her first time seeing the first stage manifest in such a clean form. Any criminal caught by this man would have no bones left to pick.\nCanis and Arin finally faced reality. They were caught by the most powerful and authoritative judicial body in the kingdom. As they waited, deflated, Sakiri's face returned to its smooth, egg-shaped metallic form.\n\"Well, I have prepared a report based on Alpheas's statement, but there are a few things I need to confirm. Please answer my questions.\"\nSakiri checked several things through question and answer. Canis and Arin answered honestly. An hour passed, and Sakiri, looking satisfied, organized his files and said,\n\"Yes. Most of the statements match. There are some discrepancies, but nothing important.\"\nHis words were too casual to have come from an investigator of the Inspection Division. But Sakiri leaned back in his chair, seemingly unconcerned, and continued.\n\"So it's like a kind of brainwashing, isn't it? Basically, Arcane used your unhappy lives to brainwash you from childhood.\"\n\"What?\"\nCanis's eyes narrowed with intensity. He would have preferred to be called a villain. Sakiri's statement was no different from denying the root of Canis's entire life.\n\"Master never forced anything on us. I did it, and I committed those acts.\"\nKnowing the investigators strength, Arin was nervous as Canis became angry. However, Sakiri's first-stage form remained unchanged.\n\"A vicious tactic. To save and make you respect, then to say this. I need this, but of course, it doesn't have to be you who does it.\"\nCanis couldn't understand what the investigator was saying. He had come here to pay for his crimes. And now, brainwashing? Were they planning to put him in a mental hospital?\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 109: Back to Everyday Life (3)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\n\"So what are you saying I should do? Admit to being brainwashed, and everything changes?\"\n\"Well... You both would be acquitted.\"\nCanis's expression turned blank. He had followed Arcane to Inferno and helped a criminal escape. He was also the main culprit behind endangering the lives of hundreds at the magic academy. Even if he wasn't the mastermind, an acquittal was an impossible verdict.\n\"Acquitted... us?\"\n\"Yes, if you admit to being brainwashed. Anyway, the Association is currently focusing on the possibility of brainwashing.\"\nAdmitting it meant freedom. He could start a new life, and so could Arin, as if nothing had happened.\nFor once, even Canis felt drained. More bizarre was the Association's decision. Why release criminals they should be capturing?\n\"Oh, and one more thing.\"\nSakiri rummaged through his files as if he just remembered. Perhaps he really had. After all, Arin couldn't read the investigator's emotions.\n\"Arcane's personal lawyer sent a document. He requested anonymity, but it's been notarized. Take a look. It contains his will, property details, and inheritance documents.\"\n\"A will?\"\nSakiri slid the documents across the table without a word.\nCanis went through them with trembling hands. Arcane's will was unremarkable. Written in a calm hand, it merely listed affairs to be handled posthumously.\nAmong them was this clause:\n[Document] All property bequeathed to Canis\n'Master...'\nHe didn't think Arcane was secretly kind or cared for his disciples in secret. Rather, he had always been forthright about his beliefs, and there seemed to be no deceit in how he treated Canis.\nArcane proved this with his will. Though he seemed indifferent to his disciple's life, he regarded Canis as his only disciple.\nAfter putting down the will, Canis reviewed the property details.\nReal estate, including various dungeons, physical assets like magic equipment, valuable artifacts, rare herbs, and bank deposits, were neatly listed.\n'1, 10, 100, thousand, ten thousand...'\nCanis counted the total amount listed at the end.\n'4.8 billion gold...'\nIt was a huge sum, fitting for the wealth amassed by Archmage Arcane over 150 years. Faced with such an amount, Canis couldn't understand his current situation. First, they declared him innocent out of nowhere, and now he was the heir to 4.8 billion gold.\nSakiri scratched his head as if perplexed.\n\"But there's a bit of a problem. Arcane's bequeathing his fortune to Canis was surely a gesture of recognition. But the Association believes it's a kind of brainwashing, right? A false identity was implanted. Ultimately, they think Canis was deceived by Arcane. Otherwise, why would you commit such atrocities? That's why the Association is considering acquittal. But if that happens...\"\n\"I won't receive the inheritance? Because I'm not Arcane's disciple?\"\nSakiri smiled warmly for the first time, though his first stage showed no change.\n\"Yes. That's the issue. The brainwashed Canis is the intended heir, not the unbrainwashed one. So, this money will be deemed illegal and confiscated by the Association. Before that, we wanted to hear your thoughts. If you admit to being brainwashed, you'll be acquitted. And you just need to sign here.\"\nSakiri presented another document. Canis looked at it with empty eyes.\nA waiver of inheritance.\nAdmitting to being brainwashed would clear him of charges, as he would be just a victim used by Arcane. But then, Arcane's fortune would entirely go to someone else.\nThe Association had chosen the tangible benefit of 4.8 billion gold over detaining two nobodies.\n\"You can take time to decide, but it might work against you in court. It indicates suspicion of voluntary crime. Does that make sense? Obviously, you were brainwashed. Otherwise, would you and Miss Arin commit such heinous crimes?\"\nCanis's mind went blank. He thought he wasn't afraid to die fighting. But now, the investigator was declaring them innocent. It seemed wrong, yet they were being told it never happened.\n'This place is no different from Radum.'\nThe outside world wasn't a sunny greenhouse either. It was a battlefield swirling with giant desires, cloaked in the guise of law.\nCanis hesitated to respond, and Sakiri clicked his tongue, standing up.\n\"Then I'll give you some time. Maybe an hour...\"\n\"I'll sign.\"\nSakiri, halfway to standing, paused, then sat down again with a smile.\n\"Good decision. Here...\"\nSakiri handed over his fountain pen. Canis wrote his name in the waiver's signature field.\nThe pen scratched across the paper.\nSakiri, with a satisfied smile, took back the pen and checked the waiver.\n\"Congratulations on regaining your freedom. It's over now, but you made the right choice. Things would have gotten more complicated with a lawyer.\"\nA lawyer. Canis hadn't even thought of it. Maybe he should have hired one?\nNo, Sakiri wasn't lying.\nIf the Association were lenient, they wouldn't have pushed for the waiver in the first place.\n\"What do we do now?\"\n\"Well, you can just leave. You're free.\"\nCanis and Arin were left with nothing. But Sakiri, as if it was none of his concern, gathered the documents and turned to leave.\n\"What about the release procedure...\"\n\"There isn't one. Just go.\"\nWith an attitude like shooing away an annoying salesman, Canis realized the truth.\nThe Association never cared about them. They had just spent two hours to recoup Arcane's fortune.\nMore humiliating than wounded pride was the Association's unassailable power. Arcane, who had boldly faced nations across the continent, must have been a formidable man.\nCanis regained his composure. It was now clear. He was a battle mage, and knowing how to fight, he wouldn't hesitate any longer.\n\"Hey, you.\"\nSakiri turned at the door.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"You're a mage too?\"\n\"Hmm, you could say that. All employees of the Association are.\"\n\"What grade?\"\n\"Officially 5th grade.\"\nCanis could imagine the level of his enemies. An Association investigator was 5th grade, and such a man he was.\n\"I won't end here. I'll never just collapse like this.\"\n\"That's right, as you should. Well, I'll be going then.\"\n\"Someday... I will make you my subordinate.\"\nSakiri's hand, turning the doorknob, paused. Then, after a moment of thought, he turned back to Canis with a thin smile.\n\"You'd better study hard for that. This position itself wasn't easy to get; the competition was fierce. But if that situation ever comes...\"\nSakiri put his right hand on his chest and said,\n\"Then, I'll be in your care.\"\nDespite the investigator's unusual attitude, Canis remained unfazed, only realizing how thoroughly pragmatic Sakiri was. Bowing his head wouldn't cost him anything. After all, no one knows what the future holds.\nAfter Sakiri left, Arin smiled at Canis. They were acquitted, which was a relief. Its better to be free than rot in jail clutching 4.8 billion gold, right?\n\"Canis, you made the right choice.\"\n\"There are many strong people in the world...\"\nA faint smile formed on Canis's lips. With a new goal, his heart pounded as intensely as when he first met Arcane.\n\"Arin, let's become stronger.\"\n\"Yes...\"\nArin looked at the door Sakiri had exited through. Canis knew they would return here someday. This was not their end, and so she, too, could move towards the future.\nHaving left the interrogation room, Sakiri headed straight to the Inspection Office. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the situation, the matter was resolved quite easily. Arcane's death played a big part. There was no legal conflict, and Alpheas's confession was crucial.\nThe Inspection Office was a luxurious room with marble flooring. The man known as the legendary \"Iron Inspector\" of Division 3 stood with his hands clasped behind him, looking out the window.\n\"Inspector, here are the documents for this case.\"\n\"Leave them on the desk.\"\nSakiri placed the file on the desk. Normally, he would have left, but this time his curiosity got the better of him, and he turned back at the door.\n\"Is everything alright with the Alpheas case?\"\n\"Why? Do you think there will be issues from above?\"\n\"A six-month suspension does seem light. But it's unlikely to raise concerns. It was an incident from 40 years ago, without malicious intent, and considering 4.8 billion gold as a settlement, it seems fair.\"\n\"But why do you ask?\"\nHis question implied the answer was as expected. Feeling he might have stirred unnecessary trouble, Sakiri swallowed hard. But now that he had started, backing down would be a bad move.\n\"I was wondering if it was meant as a penance.\"\nThe Inspector was silent for a while. Then, slowly turning around, he looked at Sakiri.\n\"I did wrong to Alpheas. But I've never let personal feelings dictate a criminal's punishment.\"\n\"I apologize. I misspoke.\"\n\"Leave now.\"\nSakiri hurriedly exited the Inspection Office, flustered. Though a fearsome investigator to criminals, within the Association, he was just a mage wary of his superiors.\nThe Inspector opened the file and meticulously reviewed the documents before bringing out his fountain pen for the final approval. Memories flashed through his mind. Now a white-haired old man, he still felt a twinge in his jaw from the blow he received at Alpheas's house.\n\"Tsk. He should've taken the gift.\"\nHe never visited Alpheas again after his mistake with Erina, but he lived without accepting defeat.\nBut over 40 years, the Theory of Photonization evolved and revolutionized, transforming the world even now.\nHe finally had to admit Alpheas's genius achievement at the time.\n\"Ha, a belated gift then. The Gold Circle was rightfully yours.\"\nThe Inspector engraved his signature onto the document.\nSaroph Ardiano.\nThe end of the semester, the most nerve-wracking time for magic academy students, had come. Half a year's work was condensed into a single piece of paper. Promotion or failure hinged on a daunting cut-off line.\nAlpheas received a six-month teaching suspension from the Magic Association. It would take effect the following semester, and currently, Coli, the oldest teacher, was acting as the interim headmaster.\nAlpheas, weeding the flower beds, straightened up and smiled. His adorable students were approaching from a distance. Shirone, Yiruki, Nade. They were troublemakers known by everyone at the school, but that made them all the more promising.\n\"Hello, Headmaster.\"\n\"Haha. Didn't I tell you not to call me that? I'm just an old man doing some chores now.\"\n\"Come on. You'll be the headmaster again in half a year.\"\nAlpheas just laughed. He appreciated his students' continued support, but felt undeserving of it.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

You must be dying now that the school break is over, huh?\"\nNade's face quickly turned gloomy.\n\"I'm going crazy. I have to score above 80 in all subjects in the remaining time, and its killing me.\"\n\"Haha! You could even get promoted this time.\nThe only way to move up from Class Five to Class Four was to score above 80 in all subjects. It is not an average of 80, but in each subject, it is extremely challenging.\n\"Of course. Isn't that what every student naturally aims for?\"\n\"Right, that's true. Well, I'll give it my best shot.\"\nNade looked dumbfounded, having expected words of encouragement. But Alpheas's teaching philosophy was firm. Students aren't racehorses. Left in the meadow, they'll come to realize their worth on their own.\n\"Should we help you?\"\nShirone, rolling up his sleeves, offered to help with the weeding.\n\"Haha, I can't let you steal the only pleasure of an old man. I'll handle the weeds; you kids do what you enjoy.\"\nDisappointment flickered in Nade's eyes. His plan to escape reality, even momentarily, by weeding was thwarted.\n\"Okay. Then take care, sir\"\nAs Shirone and his group headed back to the dorms, worry clouded their faces. The same was true for other students. The school had been unsettled since Arcane's attack, making it hard to focus on studies as before.\nFrustrated, Nade burst out.\n\"Ah, this is maddening. I need to study. Study! I just can't concentrate.\"\n\"It's normal to be unable to focus on anything else after a big blowout. It was the same after the presentation.\"\nAt Yiruki's words, Shirone sighed deeply.\n\"Still, it's better than my situation. I have twice as many subjects to raise above 80 compared to you guys. I'm not sure if it's possible.\"\n\"My only advantage is in math. I'm zero in humanities. So, in that sense, Nade's in the best position.\"\n\"What are you talking about? I don't particularly excel in any subject. You and Shirone are sure to top in practicals, but I can't, so I'm at the biggest disadvantage.\"\nFor Class Five, the practical exam focused more on the utilization of Spirit Zone than magic. Shirone with his Immortal Function and Yiruki with Savant Syndrome could excel in any practical, whereas Nade had to compete with a regular Spirit Zone like other students.\n\"My heads starting to hurt with all these thoughts. Let's just take a break today and start tomorrow?\"\nAt Nade's suggestion, they neither agreed nor disagreed. Even the usually diligent Shirone kept silent, indicating that their motivation had waned.\n\"Hey, guys, look over there...\"\nShirone pointed towards the central park, and Nade and Yiruki's eyes widened in surprise.\n\"What? How are they here?\"\nCanis and Arin were walking around the school grounds. As they made eye contact with Shirone's group, they walked over. Canis raised his hand in recognition.\n\"Hey there. Are classes over already? The facilities and environment seem fine, but they seem to coddle the kids too much.\"\n\"You! What the hell are you planning?\"\nNade blocked their path. Although he knew they were released without charges from Thadd, he thought their connection had ended. Or at least, it should have. So why were they strolling around the school?\nShirone asked,\n\"What's going on? Do you have some business at the school?\"\nCanis just looked at Shirone, the person he was most concerned about at the school. More than Alpheas or the teachers, Shirone was significant. He was the first to defeat him. If he couldn't surpass Shirone, getting stronger would be pointless.\n\"Listen carefully. If we face off again, the outcome will be the opposite of last time.\"\nBefore Shirone could respond, Nade retorted.\n\"You're still not in your right mind. You're a decade away from beating Shirone.\"\n\"You seem to be a decade short of being my match.\"\nNade's expression soured. The emotions from when Shirone was battling for his life resurfaced, and a murderous intent flickered in his mind. Yiruki, not wanting unnecessary trouble, intervened.\n\"Enough. What's important is why are you here?\"\n\"Why come here?Im just touring the place I'm going to be staying at.\"\n\"What?\"\nShirone's group was taken aback by this unexpected revelation.\n\"Exactly as I said. This magic academy or whatever, I thought it'd be good to experience it.\"\nNade, rolling up his sleeves, snapped back.\n\"There are limits to underestimating a magic academy! Who would accept someone like you?\"\nCanis raised a finger and pointed out.\n\"Senior.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Call me senior. I checked, and you guys are in Class Five. I'm in Class Four.\"\nShirone's group was dumbfounded. Most likely, Alpheas had admitted the two of them. However, being admitted directly into Class Four was rare, though not unheard of.\n\"Why so surprised? We are disciples of an Archmage. We've learned all the basics of magic. Treating us the same as you leisurely folks is the real joke.\"\nShirone's group, irritated, remained silent. Considering the magic they had honed for over ten years with Arcane, being placed in Class Four indeed seemed undervalued.\n\"So, from now on, I expect you to address me respectfully as 'senior'.\"\n\"That's ridiculous! You're starting next semester, right? By then, well also have advanced to Class Four!\"\n\"Really? Your grades were surprisingly bad. Honestly, I was disappointed. To have struggled against such inept students.\"\nThe first thing Canis had investigated at the school was Shirone and his friends' grades and social relationships. Contrary to his expectation of them being top contenders, they were mid-ranked in Class Five, which was shocking.\nHowever, no one in the advanced class underestimated them. The consensus was that they could rise to the top at any moment, a sentiment Canis had heard ad nauseam.\nAs Shirone's group bit their lips in frustration, Canis turned away with a satisfied look.\n\"Anyway, do your best. If you come in as juniors, I'll take good care of you. Hahaha!\"\nAs Canis walked away, his shadow stretched towards Shirone's group, and Harvest raised both arms, showing the middle finger with both hands. The trio trembled with barely contained rage.\nShirone broke the heavy silence.\n\"Cancel the plan to rest today.\"\n\"Yeah. Canis as a senior? I'd rather quit school than endure that.\"\n\"Pfft, why quit? We should advance and show him up.\"\nThe three were solely focused on advancing. But how? The end-of-term evaluation was a different league of challenge. A summation of a long half-year, starting something now wouldn't guarantee success.\n\"I've been thinking about something...\"\nShirone spoke with a serious tone.\n\"My chance of advancing, at best, was around 30 percent. And that's if I studied my hardest.\"\nWhile not a mathematical analysis like Yiruki's, Shirone's insight was highly credible, so his friends believed his estimation. Nade's expression darkened again.\n\"Honestly, I bragged, but now that I think about it, it's not easy. If Shirone is at 30 percent, maybe I'm around 50 percent? Yiruki might be around 60 percent.\"\n\"No. I'm about 58.7 percent. Of course, advancement mainly depends on end-term grades, but honestly, I haven't attended a single class.\"\nThe trio sighed in unison. If things continued this way, they would have to bow their heads to Canis and Arin from next semester.\n\"So, I have an idea... What about this?\"\nAt Shirone's suggestion, Nade looked up with bright eyes.\n\"What is it? Do you have a good plan?\"\n\"Studying the way we've been doing won't cut it; our chances are too low. We need a new strategy.\"\nYiruki asked,\n\"Change our approach? But how?\"\n\"My 30 percent chance is based on diligent studying. But if we focus solely on the exams, we could increase our chances to over 50 percent. For you, it might even reach 70 or 80 percent.\"\n\"Hmm. Focusing on exams? I get it. Specialize and concentrate, right?\"\n\"Exactly. We only need to score above 80. No need to waste time on subjects we're good at. And we can ignore parts of the curriculum not likely to be on the exam. We can categorize the sixteen subjects into four areas: humanities, mathematics, sciences, and practicals.\"\nShirone counted off on his fingers as he explained.\n\"Fortunately, at least one area should be easy for each of us. And, importantly, our areas don't overlap. I'm humanities, Yiruki's mathematics, and Nade's sciences. Practicals are something we can't help each other with.\"\nYiruki nodded, understanding.\n\"So, you're proposing a study group. We skip areas we're strong in and help each other with weaknesses, right?\"\n\"Exactly. If we focus on just getting over 80 in the exams, our chances will rise significantly. We might push it to 50 percent.\"\nYiruki's lips curled up in a smile. Seeing Shirone this desperate, it must have irked him to have Canis and Arin as seniors.\nEither way, it was a good idea. And if all three could advance simultaneously, there couldn't be a better outcome.\n\"I'm in. Let's head to the study hall right now and start planning. What do you say?\"\n\"Let's do it!\"\nThe determined trio rushed off to Estas.\nShirone dedicated himself to studying day and night.\nHe knew the importance of managing time. An hour might fly by unnoticed for some, but for those who divided it into ten-minute segments, it felt substantial.\nShirone divided all his time until the end-of-term exams into one-hour blocks. Keeping time always in mind was his strategy to prevent it from slipping away.\nHe aimed for efficiency in targeting the exams.\nRather than understanding the material, he focused on mastering types of problems, analyzing the intention behind the questions and the methods to solve them. In this regard, the study group was effective. They filled in each other's gaps, allowing Shirone to raise his mock exam average to above 70.\nHowever, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Once they started studying, it became clear that their weaknesses in certain subjects weren't due to laziness but a genuine lack of aptitude.\nEspecially Yiruki, whose disparity between humanities and mathematics was stark. Frantically solving problems Shirone had set, Yiruki put down his pen after just 30 minutes.\n\"Done.\"\n\"Let me see.\"\nShirone checked each of Yiruki's answers. His hands trembled as he realized why humanities teachers grimaced at the sight of Yiruki.\nShirone pointed at the test paper in disbelief.\n\"Hey, how does 'You eat pasta, I will eat pasta.' make any sense? I explained the use of auxiliary verbs to you.\"\n\"Why doesn't it make sense? You eat pasta! I will eat pasta! Perfectly clear. Emphasizing each as an independent subject.\"\n\"Uh? Oh, that...\"\nShirone was momentarily flustered, finding the explanation plausible. But he quickly regained composure and yelled.\n\"That's not it! Language isn't math. It's a tool for expression, not for proving! So, you need to read between the lines, not separate the sentences!\"\n\"Damn it, what's all that? Math is the best!\"\n\"Shut up! I know you're being stubborn! You know it's weird, too, right?\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Mathematically, there's absolutely no problem with the sentence.\"\nYiruki's pride in mathematics was enormous. It's no wonder the humanities teachers gave him zero on the tests, so repulsed by his attitude.\nShirone decided to play his final card.\n\"Don't you want to advance?\"\n\"Ugh! Damn it!\"\nYiruki had no choice but to concede to that argument. He would rather die than become a junior to Canis.\nAs Yiruki returned to solving problems, Shirone went back to his seat and sighed.\n'If he really messes up like this in the actual exam, it'll be a disaster.'\nNade, seemingly struck by a thought, looked up from his book and asked.\n\"Ah, speaking of which, isn't there a practical exam next week? Have you guys practiced a lot?\"\nShirone and Yiruki asked in unison.\n\"What exam?\"\n\"Damn it. You don't even know? It's the Psychic Pulse Test, the Spirit Zone endurance assessment.\"\n\"No need to practice, right? Both Shirone and I can easily score above 80. Why, are you worried?\"\n\"No, but practicals have many variables. It's different from other subjects; it's relative grading. If others do better, our scores drop. I thought we should discuss it at least.\"\n\"It's fine, it's fine. We don't have time for that.\"\nYiruki, completely focused on solving problems, ignored the suggestion. For students of Class Five, how much better could they handle the Spirit Zone? Yiruki was confident he'd pass the practical exam without a hitch.\nAs Shirone worked on a math problem, he said,\n\"I'll skip it too. I can't afford to worry about that now.\"\nNade had confidence, but he knew scoring higher than the other two was difficult.\n'What should I do?'\nIf it really seemed too hard, he could ask for help. But to take his friends' time just because of his own anxiety seemed like exploiting a loophole.\n'Forget it. I just need to be in the top ten.'\nNade decided to let go of his worries and started studying again. If each study group member couldn't achieve their share of 33.3 percent, the group's efficiency would fall apart.\nThe benefit of the whole required them to cooperate fully, but the end result wasn't something others could give.\nThe Image Zone training area.\nUsually, it would be bustling with advanced class students, but now it was occupied only by Class Five.\nIt was the notorious evaluation period that had pushed Shirone into corners several times. With the end of the term approaching, the students' tension was higher than ever.\nEntering the Image Zone, Ethella, as always, expanded her 20-meter diameter Spirit Zone and started explaining.\n\"Today, we'll be conducting the Psychic Pulse Test. It measures how long you can sustain changes in your Spirit Zone.\"\nEthella gestured with her hands far apart, pointing at a towering black pole with unidentifiable characters etched on it.\n\"The evaluation criterion is the 20-meter diameter between the ends of the pole. A Spirit Zone smaller than that is ineligible for the test. Of course, I assume none of you will fail to reach 20 meters.\"\nEthella then contracted her Spirit Zone. As the volume of the zone dropped below 2 cubic meters, a buzzer sounded from the sound system.\n\"That sound marks one cycle. The test is 30 seconds, and your score depends on the number of pulses in your Spirit Zone. I'll demonstrate first since it's rare to practice with the recorder on.\"\nAt Ethella's signal, the Image Zone's Psychic Pulse mode activated. Her Spirit Zone began to pulse like a beating heart, expanding and contracting.\n\"Wow...\"\nThe sight of a 20-meter Spirit Zone shrinking below 2 meters and then rapidly expanding was impressive. The cycle wasnt particularly fast, but the explosive-like expansion and contraction were powerful.\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\nThe sound machine in the Image Zone, calculating the speed of expansion, emitted explosion sounds.\nThe sound wasn't just for entertainment; it helped perceive the intangible Image Zone through all senses, providing optimal efficiency for magical training.\nAfter 30 seconds, the scoreboard showed 30 points, indicating one pulse per second.\nSenior students had said that to make the cut for advancement, you needed at least 90 points. That meant three pulses per second. The students used Ethella's demonstration to fine-tune their strategies.\nAfter the demonstration, Ethella, with hands behind her back, said,\n\"In real situations, you often need to rapidly switch between various forms of zones. Psychic Pulse is a fundamental training for that. Even after the practicals, it's crucial to continue training. Now, let's begin the evaluation.\"\nStudents were called up in reverse order of their Speed Gun test scores. As usual, it was hard to improve significantly in just a month or two, so most rankings were similar to the last.\nAs students each recorded their scores, with the lowest being 48 points, it was Nade's turn. Since he was in the upper-middle rank in the Speed Gun test, he had to take the exam much earlier than Shirone and Yiruki.\n\"Do well, Nade.\"\n\"Phew, I'm nervous.\"\nWith Shirone and Yiruki's encouragement, Nade entered the Image Zone, closed his eyes to concentrate, and then opened them as the starting signal sounded. He expanded his Spirit Zone, pulsing rapidly like a heart in full sprint.\n\"Wow! What's this? Nade?\"\nThe students' eyes widened in astonishment. Only 10 seconds had passed, and Nade had already surpassed 50 points. A pulse rate of five per second was impressive even to the onlookers.\n\"Wasn't he just mid-ranking? At this rate, he's definitely entering the top ranks.\"\n\"Hanging out with Shirone really improved his skills, huh? We should've joined their study group too.\"\n\"Yeah, lately those guys have been studying ferociously. Even Yiruki, who used to slack off, hasn't missed a single class.\"\nWhen the 30 seconds were up, Nade's score was revealed: 173 pulses. The acceleration in the last 10 seconds had boosted his score.\n\"Good job, Nade,\" praised Ethella with a pleased smile, recording his score. Her disciple had made remarkable progress, which delighted her.\nWell, I expected as much from the beginning.\nReturning with a sheepish grin and exchanging high-fives with his friends, Nade settled down and said, \"Phew, I thought I was going to die from the tension.\"\n\"Well done. One of us has passed. Just the two of us left.\"\nInspired by Nade, the following participants gave their all. However, no one surpassed Nade's score of 173.\nNear the end, Yiruki entered the Image Zone. Without any sign of nervousness, he activated his Savant abilities at the start.\nHis method of pre-designing the expansion and contraction mechanism, though not very useful in real situations, was highly efficient for the test.\nHis final score: 210 points.\nThe students looked at the score in disbelief. Achieving seven pulses per second without varying speed was an impossible feat without Yiruki's mechanical precision.\n\"Wow, incredible. Even his mind operates like an equation. That guy probably didnt even do his best.\"\n\"Can't help it, he's a Savant. Even Shirone might have trouble beating him this time.\"\nSuddenly, a disdainful voice from the back dampened the enthusiastic atmosphere.\n\"Pfft, making a fuss over such a trivial score. Class Five really is a collection of pathetic fools.\"\nThe students turned around, their expressions changing to shock as they recognized Canis and Arin, who were observing the practical evaluation.\nEthella, recording the students' scores, asked, \"Huh? You two there, what brings you here?\"\n\"We got permission from the headmaster to observe. We just wanted to see how the test is conducted.\"\n\"Oh, I see. Come this way, then. You'll have a better view from here.\"\nCanis frowned. Was that woman really a match for their master? She seemed foolishly gentle and naive.\n'Is she pretending, or is she really that clueless?'\nRegardless, Canis was genuinely interested in the exam.\nHe and Arin moved to the back of the participants.\n\"What do you think, Arin?\"\n\"Having practiced Psychic Pulse so much, I could easily score over 250 points. Master always insisted on pushing our limits. I can handle it.\"\nArin, a psychic mage specializing in the highest difficulty level of Spirit Zone forms like the Tentacle Form, was confident in her endurance.\n'Indeed, disciples of an Archmage. We're on a different level.'\nThe students felt overshadowed upon hearing Arin's comment. Even though they were nobility, being a direct disciple of an Archmage was a dream for anyone aspiring to be a mage, regardless of their background.\n'But we have our secret weapon too.'\nAs the last participant, Shirone entered the Image Zone, and the students collectively cheered him on. They knew about Shirone overpowering Canis and were eager to see him triumph again.\nShirone took a deep breath in the center of the Image Zone. Scoring around Yiruki's 210 would be enough for advancement.\nBut Shirone's gaze had changed. Now with a clear goal, he wasn't planning to take the exam half-heartedly, not even if his opponent wasn't Canis.\nWith Ethella's signal, lights on the device lit up, and Shirone immediately pulsed his Spirit Zone to its maximum.\nWithout a precise design like Yiruki's, evenly dividing a second was difficult. However, humans have a very accurate internal clock called rhythm.\nShirone accelerated the pulses of his zone to the rhythm. The sound machine emitted rapid drum-like rolls.\nRatatatatatatatatat!\nThe students couldn't close their mouths, astonished. They watched intently but could only discern the Spirit Zone's movements about once per second.\n\"How is that possible... How many pulses per second is that?\"\nWith multiple layers of Spirit Zone moving simultaneously, it was impossible to count. Everyone waited for the 10-second mark. Soon after, the scoreboard flashed an incredible number: 120 points.\n\"Twelve pulses per second...\"\nCould anyone imagine a 20-meter sphere contracting 12 times per second? They could only see it, but no one knew what was happening inside. Only the explosive sounds and the rapidly counting numbers proved Shirone's pulsing spirit.\nEven Canis and Arin watched in awe, especially Arin, who looked incredulous. With such rapid pulsing, the speed didnt matter; the mind would collapse first.\nThe key to pulsing was how quickly one could expand the sphere from the smallest to the largest point and endure the impact upon contraction.\nIn that sense, the demonstration Shirone presented maximized both speed and endurance, reaching the pinnacle of mastery.\n'Indestructible.'\nEthella recognized Shirone's level at a glance.\n'Truly remarkable. The potential of this child is beyond measure.'\nEven Ethella could no longer be sure where exactly Shirone stood. Just when she thought she had an idea, he had already moved far beyond that point.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Now, I can even control the Immortal Function to some extent.'\nShirone's specialty was the Defense Form of the Four Way Formation. Like most who specialized in defense, teachers had expected Shirone to become a defensive mage.\nHowever, the Immortal Function reversed that tendency. Now, his strength in resilience became an essential element supporting his offensive power.\nAround 20 seconds later, Shirone gritted his teeth and attempted the final acceleration. The score broke through 340 points as a fearsome speed caused a sonic boom.\nBeep-!\nThe measuring time ended, and the buzzer sounded. Shirone closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Despite dozens of children gathered, silence filled the hall. Everyone was staring intently at the scoreboard.\n410 points.\nOn average, it meant enduring 30 seconds at a rate of 13.6 pulses per second. Notably, the last 5 seconds were rapid strikes exceeding 15 pulses per second.\n\"It's incredible. What's with these kids lately? Are they really going to become our seniors next semester?\"\n\"No matter what, promotion will be tough. His theoretical grades are average. Raising the score in such a short time isn't easy.\"\nShirone looked back at Canis. It was an unspoken declaration could he become a senior too?\n\"He's truly amazing, that boy.\"\nArin admired him with pure amazement. Infinite mental strength through the Immortal Function, and the resilience to control it. Adding to that his unique magical affinity to imbue mass into light.\nHe could only be described as a mage specially favored by the gods.\n\"Hmph, only now can he be called a worthy rival.\"\nCanis's fighting spirit flared like never before. Initially, he thought it was just a difference in attributes. But Shirone's demonstration shattered that illusion, surpassing even in a contest of physical strength.\nAfter glaring at Shirone for a long while, Canis turned away abruptly.\n\"Let's go, Arin. It seems our tour here is over.\"\nAs Canis and Arin walked away, the students felt a sense of relief. Although Shirone wasn't representative of Class Five's level, the satisfaction of outperforming a disciple of an Archmage was universal.\n\"Shirone, that was epic. Bombed the test, but I feel great. So what if he's an ArchMage's disciple? How dare he underestimate Class Five of the magic academy?\"\n\"Shirone, and also Yiruki and Nade. Are you guys really planning to promote this time?\"\n\"Well, we're just doing our best.\"\nShirone evaded a direct answer. However, Nade, having secured third place, was overjoyed at having passed the practical exam.\n\"Hahaha! Of course! Get ready to treat us seniors properly! Come on, let's practice from now. Call me 'Senior'!\"\nA chorus of complaints erupted from the students.\n\"Such arrogance! Fall flat on your face!\"\n\"If he's a senior, I'd rather not attend school!\"\n\"How can you be so confident about promotion when you might fail the theory? I'll pray every night you don't get promoted!\"\nNade, unfazed, stood tall and laughed amidst the jeers. His amicable nature with all students made it bearable.\nShirone and Yiruki quietly slipped away.\n'Ah, so embarrassing.'\nThe final practical exam had ended.\nSummer was fading.\nCold winds blew in the mornings and evenings, and the plants prepared to don their colorful autumn attire. Yet, the days remained warm, and the children were busy burning through the last of the semester.\nOnly a week remained. Classes had ended the previous week, leaving only the final exams.\nThe exams were scheduled to start with Class Ten, proceeding daily in sequence. On the sixth day, Class Five students, with hearts about to burst, made their way to the examination hall.\nShirone's group nibbled at breakfast and arrived early at the exam venue.\nThe exam lasted a grueling 12 hours with only a 5-minute break. Compared to regular schools, it was almost like hard labor, but maintaining concentration was as crucial as knowledge for the students of the magic academy.\nThe exam questions were categorized into Types A, B, and C. The questions were the same, but the answer arrangements differed, to prevent cheating and lucky guesses.\nShirone had Type A, Yiruki had Type B, and Nade had Type C. Assigned to different examination halls, they came out to the hallway to ease their tension before the start. With half a year's worth of effort on the line, even the most mischievous couldn't help but feel stiff.\nNade shivered continuously, despite the warm weather.\n\"Ugh. I'm dying. How about you, Shirone?\"\n\"I feel like throwing up. One mistake in any problem, and it's over. Especially in math.\"\n\"Let's stay calm. Anyway, we have plenty of time. No need to get tense until we actually get the test papers.\"\nReassured by Yiruki's words, they calmed down. But at the sound of the bell signaling the start of the exam, anyone would turn pale.\n\"Let's go in. See you later with smiles.\"\n\"Yeah. Lets go!\"\nThe three parted ways, each entering their respective examination halls, promising to see each other in 12 hours.\nThe Supernatural Psychic Science Research Laboratory.\nShirone and his group were busy grading. The test papers were impossible to leak, but Yiruki perfectly recreated the questions.\nA Savant's memory knows no oblivion. It was as if filing papers in a drawer in their mind, to be taken out and read whenever needed.\nAs Yiruki called out the questions, Nade wrote them down, and Shirone found the answers. They worked till dawn to recreate the entire set of exam papers.\nExhausted but determined, they began matching their answers. Since Yiruki recreated Type B, Shirone's answers had to be aligned one-to-one.\n\"Phew, I'm nervous. I think I might have botched a few subjects.\"\nNade groaned. However, having weaker subjects was common for everyone.\n\"I feel the same. Actually doing it, this is really brutal. Even if you score perfect in other subjects, failing just one means it's over.\"\nShirone was unusually anxious. Even with his insight, he couldn't guarantee his promotion.\nThe three separated to apply their answers to the reconstructed test papers, each with a mix of hope and trepidation for what the results might reveal.\n\"Anyway, that's what the study group is for. Come on! Let's finish grading first, then see.\"\nAs hours passed, the contours of their scores began to emerge.\nNade was the first to jump up, punching the air.\n\"Yes! I did it! Average of 82 points! Broke 80 in every subject!\"\nThough he didn't score exceptionally high in any subject, his balanced performance across all subjects led to a solid 82-point average. The once-troublesome kid, who had looked down on Class Four, was now overjoyed with the prospect of advancing.\nYiruki and Shirone, however, remained silent. The real celebration would only come when all three were confirmed for promotion.\nHaving finished grading, Yiruki leaned back in his chair, wiping off sweat.\n\"Phew. Done. 87 points. Scored a low 80 in language. If I had got one more question wrong, that would have been it.\"\n\"Wow! So you passed too? Congratulations on Class Four!\"\n\"Well, it's not bad. Feels pretty good.\"\nWithout delay, both Nade and Yiruki turned to Shirone. Their first collective goal, simultaneous promotion, hinged on the last member's success.\nBut Shirone was unresponsive. Yiruki noticed his still hand, not moving to grade.\n\"Shirone, what's wrong? Did you mess up the exam?\"\nUp close, Shirone's face was pale as a sheet, a clear sign something was amiss.\nNade asked anxiously, \"What's up? How many points did you get?\"\n\"86 points\"\n\"Wow, that's great, isn't it?\"\nNade was genuinely surprised. They had set a goal for everyone to advance, but actually hearing it felt like a miracle. Shirone, a peasant's son, had lived a life far from academics. Yet, in just six months, he had achieved an average of 86 points.\nComparing it to Yiruki's 87-point average, achieved with a Savant's memory, made it clear how desperately Shirone must have studied.\nEven Yiruki was puzzled. \"Isn't that... good? Is there a subject you failed?\"\n\"It's just that, I can't remember.\"\n\"Can't remember? What do you mean? Explain.\"\nShirone chewed his nails anxiously, unable to recall.\n\"Yiruki.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"What was the answer to the last objective question in the math proofs?\"\n\"Oh, that one? The one where you had to link two mathematical expressions for the proof? That was a long answer.\"\nRealization struck Yiruki mid-sentence. \"Dont tell me\"\n\"I can't remember. What proof I thought was correct. I tried solving it again, and it's the same. But I distinctly remember agonizing over two options with just 10 seconds left.\"\n\"How many points is it worth? If you got it wrong?\"\n\"78 points\"\nYiruki and Nade grasped the gravity of the situation. The last objective question was worth two points. So, the result of this one question determined promotion or repetition.\n\"How can you not remember? What option number did you write?\"\n\"Number 3. But I had Type A, so I cant verify.\"\nNade frantically pulled out his exam paper. The cruelly long proofs filled the page. Frankly, Nade had also gotten this question wrong. Probably, only Yiruki in Class Five could solve it easily.\nShirone, clutching his head in agony, said, \"It was either 2 or 3. I remember suddenly thinking of the answer with 10 seconds left. But... I can't remember what it was.\"\nSuch a situation could occur under intense time pressure. Nade and Yiruki, long-time magic academy students, understood well enough.\nBut this was a matter of promotion. Failing meant another half year in Class Five.\nNade was beside himself with impatience.\n\"Damn! I can't wait!\"\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\"We have to check it ourselves. Lets ask Teacher Siena. Shes our class advisor.\"\nFeeling equally restless, the trio left the research group and headed for the exam hall.\nAs they had spent a full day grading, Class Four exams were currently underway. Sneaking into the building during lunch break, Shirone and the others waited anxiously for the teachers to return. After about 30 minutes, Siena appeared in the hallway. They rushed towards her.\n\"Teacher! Teacher!\"\n\"Huh? Why are you here? Class Five's exam ended yesterday, didnt it?\"\n\"The last objective question in the math proofs of Type A! What's the answer?\"\nSiena looked puzzled. Although her specialty was chemistry, she participated in grading as all teachers reviewed the papers at least three times. Even if it wasn't her field, her expertise made student-level math trivial.\n\"Why suddenly ask that?\"\n\"Quickly! This is really important.\"\nReading the urgency in Nade's eyes, Siena recalled the last objective question, a notably challenging one that had stuck in her memory.\n\"Oh, that one? For Type A, it's number 2, right?\"\n\"Number 2...\"\nShirone froze as if struck by a hammer. The answer he had chosen was number 3. He had gotten it wrong. His score was 78 points. Just 2 points shy of promotion, the thought made him feel suffocated.\n\"Number 2... Number 2...\"\nMuttering the same words, Shirone suddenly grabbed the back of his neck and then collapsed. Right before hitting the floor in the corridor, Nade quickly supported him.\n\"Shirone! Are you okay? Snap out of it! Aren't you supposed to be invincible?\"\n\"Number 2? Why... how could it be number 2...\"\n\"Teacher, we have to go now! Thanks for your help!\"\nAs Shirone was dragged away, he kept mumbling the same thing. Watching silently, Siena chuckled and returned to the teachers' lounge.\n\"Those kids, do they ever get tired? Always so energetic.\"\nThe teachers' lounge was bustling with grading activities. Siena, too, settled down to continue her work. Then, on a whim, she opened a drawer and pulled out the Type A math proofs paper.\n\"The last objective question, right?\"\nShe reviewed the problem, mentally solving it, and then smiled brightly.\n\"Ah, it's number 3.\"\nShirone Arian. Promotion confirmed.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 113: End-of-Term Report Card (4)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nThe Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy.\nSituated in the capital of the Kingdom of Thormia, the Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy, boasting a history of 200 years, has produced many knights of great achievements.\nThere were more than ten certified Grade-1 swordsmen, among whom three had even been honored with the title of Sword Saint.\nSymbol of courage. Embodiment of unwavering belief.\nAnyone in Thormia dreaming of becoming a knight aspired to enroll in the Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy.\nHowever, there was no entrance exam for this academy. Instead, a one-month probationary period was conducted, during which the aptitude of the trainees was assessed before finalizing their admission.\nA staggering 300 trainees applied each semester, but only 30 were admitted.\nAmong these 30, Rian proudly belonged, currently attending classes at the Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy.\nUrban Combat Training Ground.\nThe training ground, replicating the landscape of an urban area, was a pride of Kaizen.\nA teacher with cheekbones protruding like a skull sat on the stairs, glaring at the first-year students.\n\"Today's practical subject is Movement. Specifically, you first years will be assessed focusing on shifting your center of gravity.\"\nThe teacher's name was Parca Kuan.\nA certified Grade-6 swordsman, he was a master of the blade known as the 'Death Magician' before injuring his leg in war.\n\"Shifting the center of gravity is a crucial ability for a swordsman. It's where the sword's three rhythms: speed, strength, and accuracy, begin.\"\nKuan limped up the stairs, then pointed to a robust boy.\n\"You. Where is the swordsman's center of gravity?\"\n\"Sir! It's the navel!\"\n\"Wrong. You, speak.\"\nKuan pointed at a trainee with eyes wide like a shark. The trainee quickly stood up, knowing any hesitation would invite a scolding, exam or not.\n\"Sir! It's the soles of the feet!\"\n\"Wrong. You.\"\n\"T-The sword!\"\n\"Drop and give me 200 push-ups.\"\n\"Sir!\"\nThe trainee stepped out of the line to start the push-ups. Draining stamina before a test was dreadful, but the teachers at the swordsmanship academy hardly cared.\nKuan drew his longsword with a fan-like tip and a comparatively slender blade.\n\"Where is the swordsman's center of gravity? The answer is external. In Schema terminology, this is called 'external gravity.' Repeat after me, external gravity.\"\n\"External gravity!\"\nThe trainees shouted, seething with anger. They were being introduced to a term they had never heard before, just before their examination.\n'I really want to do something about this. What kind of teacher is he?'\n\"I'll demonstrate just once. Watch closely and apply it to your evaluation.\"\nThe Colosseum, usually quiet, was enveloped in silence.\n\"Advance while striking, and retreat while cutting.\"\nKuan demonstrated advancing and retreating cuts. Despite his limping leg making the display less elegant, the sound of his blade slicing through the air was formidable.\n\"This is the typical movement of swordsmanship. The body's strength shifts the center, and this shift amplifies the sword's destructive power. Moreover, enhancing muscular strength through Schema can exponentially increase this destructive power.\"\nThe trainees swallowed hard. It was a familiar lecture, but their tension was palpable with the exam looming.\n\"You're probably thinking of something as lowly as that. But approach actual combat with such a notion, and you'll be dead in three seconds.\"\nThe trainees' eyes blazed even more fiercely.\n\"Remember this: no matter how powerful your strike is, if you're outmatched in movement, the fight is as good as lost. Therefore, swordsmen use their center of gravity in movement according to the situation. For example, like this.\"\nKuan stomped his foot down, then lifted one leg, causing his body to tilt towards the ground.\nThe trainees gaped in astonishment. Kuan's axis was tilted over 70 degrees.\nWas this even possible? Without being tied to something, maintaining such a posture seemed impossible for a human.\n\"The power amplified by Schema maximizes the shift in the center of gravity. My center is currently outside my body. This is called external gravity.\"\nKuan sprang up as if he were a pop-up toy.\n\"Utilizing external gravity expands the possibilities of movement infinitely. For instance, this is also possible.\"\nKuan stomped the ground again and fell backward, his body tilting until his back nearly touched the ground, then spun around like a top.\n\"External gravity isn't an actual gravitational force. It's just extremely strong inertia. Therefore, when rotation is applied to external gravity, the body also rotates.\"\nAs Kuan extended his sword outward, the rotation slowed. However, as he straightened up, centrifugal force accelerated his motion.\nSsssss!\nStanding vertically, Kuan spun at an incredible speed, then abruptly stopped in a graceful, well-poised stance.\nThe trainees looked at Kuan with astonishment. If they had been in his place, what would have happened? Their ankles would have been severed first, and then they would have been diced into dozens of pieces by the accelerating blade.\nDefense was impossible. It was akin to a human being unable to stop a tornado caused by atmospheric pressure differences.\nSuch explosive external gravity. It was akin to a blade attached to a rotating mechanical device.\n'This is the Death Magician.'\nA nickname earned for causing death without the opponent even realizing how it happened.\n\"This is today's practical evaluation. The first is obstacle navigation, and the second is urban combat movement.\"\n\"Instructor, I have a question.\"\n\"Drop and give me 200 push-ups.\"\nThe trainee stepped out of line. While doing push-ups, he wondered, what did I do wrong?\n\"Always remember, you need to overpower the opponent to get the answer you want. An instructor is not your parent. Don't look at me with those eyes full of desire for praise. It's disgusting. Understood?\"\n\"Yes! I will correct it!\"\n\"Try again.\"\nHaving finished the scolding, the trainee raised his hand with a shout.\n\"Instructor! I have a question!\"\n\"Speak.\"\n\"What does the urban combat movement evaluate?\"\n\"I'm about to explain that.\"\nThe trainee was embarrassed. He had asked the question wanting to impress Kuan, but Kuan thought even respect was a sign of weakness.\n\"Urban combat movement. I'll keep it short and end it.\"\nKuan entered the building. The open front made it easy to listen to his explanation.\n\"External gravity shines in complex terrains, especially in urban combat where space is limited. The outcome can depend on the level of movement.\"\nKuan stomped the floor but did not attempt external gravity.\n\"Stomping the ground generates force to shift the center. This is called the first impact. Of course, there's no time for such madness in real combat, but rookies like you should definitely stomp the ground.\"\nDespite the mixture of contempt and ridicule, the students, awed by Kuan's prowess, were no longer angry.\n\"However, I dont stomp the ground for the first impact. If I use my full strength, I would shatter this floor. In the Schema of external gravity, there are various ways to execute the first impact. I'll use the basic muscle vibration.\"\nKuan contracted his upper body muscles, generating a vibration. Then, jumping up and touching the wall, he bent his elbows to control inertia, creating an extended moment of suspension in the air.\n\"Wow!\"\nThe trainees exclaimed in amazement. It was a situation that normally would warrant a 'Drop down!' command, but Kuan, seemingly too bothered, continued his explanation.\n\"Using the first impact to create external gravity, leap. Of course, in such a case, external gravity will act in the direction of the wall. By applying this, movements like this become possible.\"\nKuan walked along the wall. The trainees, slowly raising their heads in disbelief, looked up vertically. Kuan was upside down, his feet against the ceiling.\n\"External gravity essentially uses the power of inertia to negate gravity. Therefore, there is currently no gravitational force acting on my body.\"\nKuan walking on the ceiling was beyond wondrous, almost bizarre. But this was no magic trick.\nTo some extent, wall running was possible even for circus performers without Schema. Kuan, however, had maximized inertia with stronger and more precise power.\nAs external gravity dissipated, Kuan's body fell with gravity. Stepping outside after the demonstration, the expressions of the trainees had completely changed.\n\"Everyone, drop and give me 200 push-ups.\"\n\"Sir!\"\nThe trainees reluctantly lay down. As official students, most could handle Schema, so 200 wasn't an impossible count. But for first-year students with limited enhancement capabilities, 200 push-ups were a strenuous punishment.\n\"While doing that, listen. The first practical is horizontal obstacles, getting lower with each level. The last stage is impossible without using external gravity. You have 20 seconds. The obstacles are made of real swords, so severe injuries or even death could occur. Of course, I trust no one will be foolish enough to dodge the obstacles. If injured, you'll be treated by Instructor Kaina.\"\nKaina was the best surgeon at the swordsmanship academy. If mages had healers, swordsmen had surgeons who conducted operations. The problem was the extreme pain of the surgery, especially for amputees, where nerve connections could cause fainting during treatment.\n'Damn! Hearing that makes it even scarier!'\n\"Urban combat movement is simple. Create external gravity and lean against a wall. The longer you last, the higher your score. Understood?\"\n\"Yes!\"\nWith faces full of resolve, the trainees watched as Kuan gathered his assessment papers and moved on.\n\"Starting with number one. I wont call names, so come up when ready. Those waiting, take a break.\"\nRian leaned back in his seat, chin propped on his hand. With each person taking at least three minutes, there was ample time.\n\"How about it, think you can do well?\"\nIt was a rare female voice in the swordsmanship academy. But Rian just turned his gaze away, seemingly unbothered. The woman was a beauty with flowing blonde hair, tall and slim with long limbs, giving a refreshing impression.\nElzain Tess.\nThe only daughter of the prestigious Elzain family in the kingdom, she had enrolled in the swordsmanship academy to follow in her father's footsteps, the colonial commander.\nHer face could look cute or fierce, but her character was always fierce. Exceptionally skilled and unmatched among first-year students, she stood out even among many boys, a natural warrior at heart.\n\"Sit down quickly. If the instructor sees us, it's execution.\"\n\"Oh, the great Rian is afraid of the instructor? Hes too busy grading to notice.\"\n\"What do you know? He's got eyes on the back of his head. Besides, why did you suddenly move here?\"\n\"I wanted to cheer you up in case you were nervous.\"\n\"When have you ever seen me nervous?\"\n\"Haha. Right, there's no further bottom for you to hit, so why be nervous? You're comfortably at the bottom.\"\nAlthough such words might upset a typical trainee at the swordsmanship academy, Rian merely pursed his lips in response. Tess smiled. His non-reactive nature was definitely a trait that set him apart from other kids.\nWhy did such a boy consistently end up at the bottom?\nAmong the first-year students, Rian was undoubtedly the most diligent in training. In fact, his training regimen was so harsh it bordered on overwork. He tackled it day after day.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

In fact, his training regimen was so harsh it bordered on overwork. He tackled it day after day.\nYet, his grades did not improve.\nAlthough there were rumors that Rian had mastered Schema a month ago, the slow pace of his enhancement cast doubts on whether this was true.\n\"No matter that I'm the lowest ranked, I won't know unless I try. Who knows, things might surprisingly go well once I actually take on the challenge?\"\n\"Haha, that's so like you.\"\nTess had never seen Rian tense. The fact that he, the least skilled in the academy, was so composed before a test where his limbs could be severed was oddly unsettling.\nAfter all, it was the same back then.\nTess first became aware of Rian during the probation period.\nSwordsmen, by nature, enjoy combat. With 300 such kids gathered, the atmosphere from the first day was tense. The instructors did not particularly interfere with what happened inside the barracks. Predictably, some wolves bared their teeth.\nThe pecking order was established in no time.\nThose who had mastered Schema formed the first group, those with physical strength the second, and the rest, the third. The problem was with the trainees who didnt fit into the third group. They were boys with no interest in swords but were pushed into the academy by their parents.\nRichard Faiger, the leader of the first group, relentlessly bullied these boys. Already naturally brutal, he had come to an academy where killing techniques were legally taught, and his restraints had been unleashed.\nTess didn't care. In terms of skill, she was in the first group, and the handful of women among the trainees were exempt from the hierarchy battle.\nRians rank was in the middle of the second group at that time.\nWith this ranking, he wasnt a target for bullying, but Rian didnt mingle with anyone. His reason for joining the swordsmanship academy was just one: to become a swordsman worthy of Shirone. Graduation or anything else didnt matter; he just wanted to improve his skills.\n\"Pffhahaha! Hey, run! Faster!\"\n\"Giggle! Hee-hee!\"\nOne day, the first group's trainees rode on the weaker kids' backs, staging a race in the barracks. They hit the \"horses\" with sticks, eliciting horse-like sounds with each strike.\nSome trainees frowned at this, but most were engrossed in cheering, as if watching a real horse race. Small bets were placed, and showing dislike could lead to being at the bottom of the hierarchy.\n\"Faster! I'm winning! I'm winning!\"\nFaiger, leading the race, was thrilled. True to his nature of not accepting defeat in anything, even a playful race, he increased his strikes as the finish line approached. The human horse, crying and bleeding from his knees, had to crawl to keep going.\n\"Hee-hee! Haha!\"\n\"Yess! I'm first...!\"\nJust as Faiger was about to cross the finish line, a blurry afterimage caught his eye, followed by a strong blow to the bridge of his nose.\n\"Ow!\"\nKicked unknowingly, Faiger fell off the human horse. The following runners crossed the finish line in the meantime.\n\"Stop it. Is this your playground?\"\nFaiger clutched his throbbing nose, glaring at the blue-haired boy.\n\"You little...!\"\nRian Ogent.\nAs far as Faiger knew, Rian was mediocre even among the second group. Realizing he had been struck by a boy who hadn't even mastered Schema, his pride was wounded.\n\"What, you want to die?\"\nRian remained silent. His nature of conserving words hadn't changed since entering the swordsmanship academy. If he had nothing to say, he wouldnt make something up.\n\"Look at this guy...\"\nFaiger stood up, exuding murderous intent. The situation was tense, but the frightened trainees didn't dare intervene.\nOf course, there were those who felt no need to. Tess was one of them.\nThis was a swordsmanship academy. In a group learning war techniques, standing up for the weak changed nothing. In the end, the hierarchy was always established based on strength.\n\"Oh, it's Rian, right? Causing trouble again.\"\nTess turned around. Another female trainee, taller than most boys, stood behind her like a wall.\n\"You know his name? He doesn't seem very strong.\"\n\"He's weak, but he's stubborn. Recently, the second group collected some money for Faiger's birthday. Rian was the only one who didn't contribute.\"\n\"Aha, so he was targettted for that?\"\n\"Probably. But honestly, I was surprised. I thought he was quiet, but he's unexpectedly hot-blooded.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nFor the first time, Tess took a closer look at Rian. Still silent, he showed no intention of backing down.\n'Such a guy exists too. Indeed, the kingdom is vast.'\nThat was the extent of her interest. Having grown up seeing many eccentrics due to her father's influence as a colonial commander, she knew that in this world, if the sword wasn't strong enough, it would just break, no matter the conviction behind it.\n\"Ha, has this guy gone mute? Its too late for regrets. You didn't think you could do all this and remain unscathed, did you?\"\n\"Let's go outside. It won't look good in the evaluation if the instructor finds out.\"\nFaiger was incredulous. The very boy who should be begging for mercy was suggesting they fight out of the instructor's sight.\n\"Fine, as you wish. Follow me. And everyone else, come watch. I'll show you what happens when you mess with me.\"\nFaiger led Rian to an open area behind the building. Trainees from groups one to three followed Faiger, while only non-group members stood with Rian.\nBut they had already lost their will to fight. In fact, they hadnt come to fight at all, just not part of Faiger's clique. Deep down, they resented Rian for escalating the situation.\n\"Hey, if you dont want a beating, come to this side.\"\nFaiger offered them a way out. The trainees didn't hesitate, passing by Rian and rushing to the opposite side.\n\"Hahahaha! Pathetic. Hey, Rian, what now? Everyones left you.\"\n\"Relying on numbers? You've always been rotten to the core.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"If you must fight, then fight. Thats what a knight does. You don't even deserve to be called one.\"\nFaiger snorted. In war, knights would tear at each other like dogs. To him, the code of chivalry was nothing more than a fancy wrapper for those who survived such brutality.\n\"Fine, lets see if your fists are as strong as your mouth. Ill take you on myself. Dont get too comfortable. By saying I'll fight you alone, I mean I'll kill you.\"\nRian raised his fists in a fighting stance. Faiger, on the other hand, casually strolled up.\n\"I'll let you hit me first. Go ahead.\"\nFaiger gestured with his fingers, prompting Rian to throw a punch. In that instant, Faiger dodged the attack and struck Rian's abdomen.\n\"Ugh!\"\nRian's eyes widened with the pain of feeling his belly being ripped apart. It felt like a heavy boulder had been slammed into his stomach. Was this the power of a fist enhanced by Schema?\n\"Idiot. Why would I let you hit me?\"\nFaiger, while mocking Rian, was surprised that he hadn't ended it with one blow. He had been too complacent. With this realization, he threw a series of rapid punches with all his might.\nRian was in dire straits. This bare-handed duel was deadly, with Schema itself being a lethal weapon. It felt like being battered by a soldier in heavy armor.\nAs Faiger's fist buried into Rian's abdomen, his legs lifted off the ground.\nWhen he landed again, even Rian, with his tough resilience, couldn't stay upright. His body crumpled to the ground, starting from his knees.\n'That's more like it...'\nFaiger sneered at Rian. Suddenly, Rian sprang up like an arrow, closing the distance between them.\n'What? He's still fighting?'\nFaiger was taken aback. Rian hadn't mastered Schema, and the punch had definitely landed properly. Without Schema's protection, he should have been knocked out.\nRian focused his attacks on Faiger's abdomen. Aiming for the face would be easily evaded, but attacking from below while blocking the view with his wider back made it hard for even Faiger to counterattack quickly.\nThe tactic was effective, and Faiger found himself retreating under the onslaught. Each punch to his abdomen sent sharp pains through his body.\n'What's with this guy?'\nTo Faiger, there was no victory to celebrate. Just being engaged in a brawl with someone who couldn't even use Schema was shameful.\n\"You damn bastard!\"\nLosing control, Faiger grabbed Rian's shoulders, pushed him away, and then began to pummel him wildly. The dull thuds of his blows echoed across the yard. The trainees watched the one-sided beating with pale faces.\nWhen Faiger came to his senses, Rian lay crumpled on the ground like a rag doll, still conscious. Seeing Rian's fingers twitch, Faiger's eyes blazed with anger.\n\"Argh! Annoying!\"\nFaiger's kicks bombarded Rian. It was only then that the first group trainees realized the seriousness of the situation and rushed over.\n\"Stop it! He might actually die at this rate!\"\n\"Let go! I'm going to kill him! Die, you bastard!\"\nRian's responses gradually slowed, and then his movements ceased. Faiger looked around. The fear visible on the faces of the trainees seemed to satisfy him somewhat.\n\"Listen well! This is what happens if you mess with me! Get some rope!\"\nRian was stripped to his underwear and tied up with ropes. His muscular body bore bruises and wounds. Faiger, thinking it necessary to make an example, hung Rian on a tall tree.\nBlood dripped down Rian's face, curled up like a shrimp.\n\"Hahaha! Looks like a worm on a fishing hook, right? That's what you get for overstepping your bounds.\"\n\"Ha, he must feel so embarrassed. Acting all high and mighty and then getting caught like this.\"\nJeers rained from all around as if they had won a war.\nTess frowned. It was disgraceful to inflict such humiliation on someone, no matter how weak they were.\nAnd there were girls of the same age present. What could Rian be thinking right now? How hurt must his heart be?\n\"Uh...\"\nRian regained consciousness. He hadn't lost it entirely, but he was far from okay. The numerous trainees around him were giggling, watching him like a monkey in a zoo.\nTess locked eyes with Rian. She tried to keep a neutral expression, as any sympathy could hurt him more. But, breaking expectations, Rian smiled and winked at her.\n\"Ah, I'm sorry about this. Especially in front of the ladies.\"\nTess maintained her indifferent expression, but something stirred inside her.\n\"Hahaha! What's he saying now? Even in this situation, he's still bluffing. Is he just a fool, after all?\"\n\"Hey, be honest. Getting beaten up like that, do you think acting tough makes you look good? Youre just ridiculous right now.\"\n\"Aren't you embarrassed? In front of the girls in that state. Better bite your tongue and die.\"\nRian looked down at the trainees. Despite their numerous taunts, his gaze remained calm.\n\"It's okay. Even if it's embarrassing.\"\n\"Haha! Sure, someone like you would live with that shame all their life. Or maybe youre a masochist? Are you actually enjoying this?\"\nRian calmly replied.\n\"I'll forget it soon enough.\"\nSilence fell. An unexplainable, uneasy aura took over.\n\"I fought my best, so I'm not ashamed. Time will pass, and maybe days like today will fade into obscurity. But you know... can you really forget?\"\nNo one answered. Their hearts were pounding rapidly.\n\"You, who didn't fight and just curled up, will likely carry this memory for life. And you'll regret it. If only I had fought back then, if only I had stood up. But you know, right? You can't turn back time.\"\nThe trainees' faces quivered. This was a fear different from the terror of Faiger's violence.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 115: End-of-Term Report Card (6)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\n\"Defeat is okay as long as you maintain your conviction. The shame endured for sticking to your beliefs is quickly forgotten. But the memory of fleeing in fear will haunt you for life. It will torment you while eating, sleeping, or even on the battlefield. That's why a swordsman's conviction is as important as their life. Once broken, it never returns.\"\nNo one mocked Rian any longer.\n\"No one wants to carry the memory of being cowardly. Especially not a swordsman. Maybe a day will come when recalling today will be more detestable than death itself. So, end it here. If you want to hold your head high in the future, right now, in this moment, in this place...\"\nRian shouted, spitting blood.\n\"Fight, you fools!\"\nRian's cry pierced the hearts of the trainees. Their blood boiled. Regardless of individual skill, the desire to be known as a ghost of the battlefield, the strongest swordsman, or an iron knight was the same in all of them.\nThe fighting spirit of hundreds ignited simultaneously, palpable in the air. The atmosphere heated up. The fear once directed at Faiger was gone from their eyes.\nThe first group, led by Faiger, felt the looming crisis and exuded a murderous aura.\n\"Shut up! No one listens to the words of a loser! You want to take me down? Then come at me. Ill make you end up just like that guy hanging there!\"\nTess smiled and fiddled with her lips.\n\"Hmm.\"\nRian Ogent.\nA prospective student of Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy.\n\"That was good.\"\nTess leaped into action, untying Rian, who thudded to the ground and painfully arranged himself into a sitting position.\n\"Your name is Rian, right? I'm Tess. Let's fight together.\"\nTess offered a handshake, but Rian just stared back, unable to move due to the ropes.\nTess's intervention caused a stir among the kids. Although she was part of the women's group, her skills during training were on par with Faigers.\n\"I'll fight too! I can't stand this any longer!\"\n\"Even the women are stepping up; we men can't just stand by!\"\nOne after another, they sided with Rian. Eventually, all trainees except for the first group united, shouting:\n\"Let's show them! Drive those ruffians out of the school!\"\n\"Drive them out! Drive them out!\"\nFaiger and his group found themselves surrounded by nearly 300 kids. Even with enhanced strength through Schema, they couldn't take on so many.\n\"You brats! You really want to die!\"\n\"Kill us if you can, you bastards!\"\nA boy from the second group, known for his strength, attacked first. Faiger's jaw twisted as he grimaced in pain. The moment he glared back, dozens of kids pounced, pinning him to the ground.\n\"Wait! Stop!\"\nFaiger, realizing the reality, shouted, but the kids' anger wouldn't subside so easily.\nElsewhere, trainees from the first group received similar treatment. Even those not in any group joined in, thrashing them mercilessly.\n\"Save me! Teachers! Teachers!\"\nTess watched Rian, who was observing the battle dispassionately, and laughed.\n\"Haha, sorry about this. It feels like I just stuck a fork in a meal prepared by someone else.\"\n\"That's fine. I hate playing the hero anyway. That's why I called you over here.\"\n\"Oh? Did you really not know?\"\nAs Rian looked puzzled, Tess realized he was serious and looked incredulous.\n\"Are you an idiot? The instructors would never let us roam free like this. This whole situation is probably being reported right now.\"\nTess's assumption was accurate. Faiger suffered fractures and was expelled, and the other first group kids, despite completing their probation, were denied admission.\nAnd Rian... despite not having the best training record, was admitted as the top of the 30 successful candidates into Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy.\nRecalling her first encounter with Rian, Tess smiled broadly.\n\"So, that Rian is now lingering at the bottom.\"\n\"Shut up. Why bring up the past out of the blue? Who asked to be ranked first?\"\n\"Haha, but it's really impressive. If it were me, I'd have been overwhelmed with self-doubt, but you haven't missed a day of training.\"\n\"Self-doubt, you say? I got over that a long time ago.\"\n\"Arent you worried, though? After all, you've been admitted, so you should graduate and make a name as a swordsman. At this rate, youll end up neither here nor there.\"\n\"...Youre really trying to kill my spirit.\"\n\"Nonsense! I'm genuinely worried. And curious. What drives you?\"\nRian looked up at the sky, pondering. His motivation. Compared to the other trainees, he was in a more comfortable position.\n\"Its fine if I dont make a big name as a swordsman as long as I become stronger. For my lord.\"\n\"Lord? What are you talking about?\"\n\"Ah, Ive made a knight's vow.\"\nTess's eyes widened in surprise. It was like asking a child next door who they would marry and hearing they were already betrothed.\n\"Really? Youre not even twenty yet?\"\nA knight's vow was a lifelong pledge a swordsman could make only once. Therefore, choosing a lord involved careful consideration of the future and potential.\n\"Are you sure? Who is this person? Someone I know?\"\nTess guessed it must be someone famous. A war hero, a minister at the royal court, or a local lord. After all, to entrust one's life, they must be of such stature.\n\"Shirone.\"\n\"Shirone? Hmm... Shirone... I dont know. What does he do?\"\n\"Hes my friend. He's currently attending a magic academy in our hometown.\"\nTess opened her mouth in disbelief. A friend? Moreover, not even a professional mage, but a student?\n\"What were you thinking? Even if you're close, there's no need for a knight's vow. Wait, don't tell me...\"\nTess suddenly felt uneasy. There were cases where knight's vows were made to someone neither famous nor promising.\n\"Is this Shirone... a woman?\"\n\"Are you crazy? What are you thinking? I wouldn't make a knight's vow like that, talentless or not.\"\n\"Really? Hmm.\"\nTess let out a sigh of relief.\n\"Anyway, don't say that recklessly. I believe Shirone will be the best. That's why I've staked my life on it.\"\nToday, Rian seemed different. Frankly, it was like a camaraderie among boys, but it seemed unlikely to make a knight's vow for someone less than extraordinary.\n'Who is this Shirone...?'\nThen, a brilliant idea struck her. She had been pondering how to start a conversation, and now she had a perfect excuse with Shirone.\n\"Can I meet him? This Shirone.\"\n\"What? Why do you want to meet my friend?\"\n\"You brag about him so much, I'm curious. It's like securing a job before finishing school, right?\"\n\"It's not that simple. Besides, Shirone is in Creas. It's very far from here.\"\n\"So what? The term is almost over anyway. My family is in the occupied territories, so there's no one to meet. Let's go on a trip to Creas. Right, there's an island to the south, a tourist spot. I've always wanted to go there. Let's go with Shirone.\"\nTesss words flowed smoothly as if she had planned this all along. Rian's mind changed upon hearing her. He had no desire to go on a trip with Tess alone, but if Shirone joined, it would be different.\n\"Hmm, with Shirone... But won't it be awkward with three of us? Especially around women.\"\nEncouraged by Rian's positive response, Tesss eyes sparkled. She was jealous that he had changed his mind for someone else.\n\"Tell Shirone to bring someone too. There must be girls he knows at the magic school. Let's go on a double date. How about it?\"\nDouble dating. It sounded fun. Besides, Rian had been thinking about playing with Shirone after the term.\n\"Well, I'll think about it.\"\nThough he said that, he had practically agreed. Tess nodded, satisfied.\n\"Great. Then let's finish the final practical test with a bang.\"\nIt was soon Tesss turn for the obstacle course.\n\"Number 47, Elzain Tess. Ready for the test!\"\nAs Tess announced her readiness, Kuan signaled her to start.\n\"Go.\"\nTess charged through the obstacles with a limbo-like maneuver. However, she froze in front of the blade obstacle, lower than her height.\nHaving learned Schema early, it was still her first time attempting external gravity.\nAfter calming herself, Tess executed the first impact. The shockwave, amplified by Schema, resonated.\n'Now, shift the center of gravity outwards!'\nNot magic, but a powerful inertia overcoming gravity. Confident, Tess leaned back.\n'I did it!'\nShe smoothly slid under the blade, a testament to her previous training without external gravity.\n\"Number 47, Elzain Tess. Obstacle course complete!\"\nTesss completion was met with applause, but her heart was pounding.\n'I did it. It really works?'\nKuans teaching wasn't in vain. It was all planned.\n'Even a psychopath can teach.'\nTess finished first, unbeatable with few participants left.\n\"Number 52, Ogent Rian. Ready for the test!\"\nAs Rian's turn came, Kuan frowned. He didn't expect much, but Rian intrigued him.\n\"Go.\"\nRian dashed forward, excelling in obstacles that didn't require Schema. But the last one was a problem.\n'First impact!'\nHe stamped the ground and leaned back, but something felt off. The blade seemed to be heading for his neck.\n'What?'\nKuan kicked Rian's face, sending him rolling. Rian struggled to stand, only to be confronted by an angry Kuan.\n\"Are you crazy? Want to die? Where did you sell your Schema? Throwing your neck under the blade?\"\n\"I'm sorry! But I did it! Schema...\"\n\"What nonsense? Do you even know what Schema is? Those who can't do it are exempt from practical tests!\"\n\"No! I definitely succeeded! I passed the strength enhancement test!\"\n\"What? Strength enhancement? Where did you hear such nonsense...\"\nStrength enhancement involved lifting twice one's weight, a test to verify Schema. Kuan looked around, calculating Rian's weight for a suitable test.\n\"Come here and lift this.\"\nIt was a large stone left from building the training ground.\nRian approached, taking a deep breath. Even the previous test had been challenging.\n\"Huuuh!\"\nGrappling the stone, Rian strained to lift it. Trembling, he raised it above his head.\nKuan pressed Rian's body, feeling the vibration of muscle fibers. His expression darkened.\n'Damn it.'\nIt wasn't Schema.\nDespite his training, Rian hadn't mastered Schema. Normally, training would suffice, but not for Rian.\nKuan didn't want to give up on him. Rian was different, earning respect despite his lack of talent.\n\"How much have you trained...\"\nKuan admired his spirit but faced a harsh truth. Rian lacked talent.\n\"Rian, I'm sorry, but you haven't mastered Schema.\"\nThe trainees were shocked. Kuan's apology was unheard of in half a year.\n\"How can that be? I'm holding this stone! What does that mean?\"\nKuan sighed.\n\"That's just your foolishly strong muscle power.\"\nStunned, Rian dropped the stone.\nRian Ogent.

      "content": "Chapter 116: An Unexpected Guest (1)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nThe first half of the magic school year had come to an end.\nDespite the many challenges and hurdles, the atmosphere at the end of the semester was warm and pleasant.\nThe teachers, too, were engaging in jokes with their students, waiting for the time to head home.\nIn swordsmanship schools, where physical training is emphasized, rest is considered as important a trait as the training itself. However, this doesn't mean that magic schools, focusing on mental fortitude, overlook this fact.\nThe mind, though invisible, is an inherent function of humans. Even the most tenacious student needs a break to cool down an overheated brain.\nHowever, it's important not to completely let go of the tension, so Alpheas Magic Academy required students who didn't participate in the presentation to write a paper on a free topic.\nOf course, this didn't apply to Shirone. Having received the highest score for his presentation on 'Supernatural Existences' at the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group event, he could enjoy a carefree vacation.\nOn the last day, as students began to leave for the holidays, Shirone visited the empty third training ground.\nUsually noisy with the sounds of chanting and magical explosions, the place was now filled with a serene silence.\nThe third training ground was among the largest. A 1,600-meter track ran around the outside, and the divided areas were equipped with various devices for testing magical effects.\nShirone entered the teleportation training area. A mage can use countless movement magics: Teleportation, Fly, Dark Port, Air Walk, etc. The best environment to train all these magics was a desolate open field.\nShirone reflected on his progress over the past six months.\n'First, movement magic.'\nHis primary movement magic was Teleportation, which had evolved to allow curved movement in Rainbow Drop and high-speed lateral movement in Patrol Technique.\nHe couldn't ignore the achievements in Photon Output either.\nInitially just a magic for transmitting information, it transformed into a powerful offensive magic, Photon Cannon, upon comprehending the Particle of God.\nThis enabled him to easily master flash magic, maintaining light for an extended period.\nShirone didn't stop there; he continued to evolve. He developed Laser by mathematically regressing Photon Cannon.\nWhile Photon Cannon had a higher single impact, the cumulative damage of Laser was nearly infinite. It was a terrifying magic capable of destroying any hard object unless it was immune to Laser's waves.\n'I've actually worked quite hard.'\nShirone smiled contentedly, especially pleased that his proficiency in his major magic had jumped a level.\nCurrently, Shirone's photonization theory had surpassed sub-light speed and reached near-light speed realms. His reason for visiting the training ground was to attempt Space Warp, impossible for a mage not at the near-light speed level.\n'How will it feel?'\nSpace Warp differed fundamentally from Teleportation. It lets one distinctly experience the special nature of light as space-time folds.\nAs he activated his Spirit Zone, his synesthesia made the surroundings vividly clear. Focusing on a point, Shirone unfolded his photonization magic at near-light speed.\nHis body vaporized into light, shooting high into the sky, then crashing down to the ground.\nArriving at his destination, Shirone, pale-faced, gasped for breath.\n\"Huff! I did it!\"\nIt was a sensation he had never experienced before. The scenery he saw during Space Warp was different from Teleportation.\nTeleportation felt like the world was compressing and rushing in, while Space Warp felt like the sky and ground were rotating as if the world had folded.\n'This is Space Warp. My mind's all over the place. It's unusable in battle like this.'\nEven Ethella Romie, a Grade 6 mage, relied on Teleportation in her battle with Arcane. It proved that Space Warp wasn't effective in combat.\nSpace Warp's real advantage was in movement, not battle.\nFor long-distance travel, Teleportation risked collision with obstacles. Thus, most mages use it within a 10-meter range. However, Space Warp could transcend space regardless of obstacles.\nBut to see practical effects, the Spirit Zone's radius needed to be unimaginably larger than its current size.\nShirone's current Spirit Zone had a diameter of about 50 meters, quite large among students, but insufficient for advanced magic like Space Warp.\nUltimately, his magic level had outpaced his Spirit Zone. Normally, magic follows the level of the Spirit Zone, but as an Unlocker, Shirone's exceptional insight allowed him to surpass theoretical barriers.\n'It's an asymmetrical balance. Should I be happy about this?'\nHis Spirit Zone had grown significantly, not in size but in durability.\nIf asked to unfold a Zone like six months ago, he could easily reach 100 meters in diameter.\nBut using high-level magic with such an extended Zone would shatter it. Thus, it was more realistic to consider his Zone still at 50 meters.\n'With a Zone this size for Space Warp, people would laugh. For practical use in real situations, the diameter needs to be at least 200 meters.'\nHe estimated that for a mage to travel 10 kilometers, Teleportation would require about 1,000 casts. But with a 200-meter Zone, only 50 Space Warps would suffice.\nIn a battlefield where every second counts, saving 950 casting times is incredibly efficient.\n\"Having powerful magic alone isn't everything. Without a supportive Spirit Zone, one cannot be a great mage.\"\nAnd even focusing on expanding the Spirit Zone wasn't the answer. It had to be durable enough for major magic and dense enough for precision.\n\"Oh my...\"\nShirone stood there, mouth agape, feeling as if the path before him stretched to the horizon.\nThe range of skills a mage needed to master seemed endless: the radius and durability of the Spirit Zone, omnipotence and omniscience, adaptability and proficiency, combat experience, and judgment, to name a few.\nWhat thrilled Shirone the most was the realization that all these skills needed to simultaneously balance and elevate together.\nWith this revelation, he began to see the form of the path he was pursuing and what magic truly meant.\nShirone felt exhilarated. Sensing the outline of the vast world of magic, albeit faintly, was a sign of growth.\nThis was true for Siena, Ethella, and Arcane too. They had all undergone immense training to reach their current positions. Although it seemed a daunting journey, it didn't feel like a bridge to nowhere.\n'I can do it. I can climb even higher.'\nHaving successfully advanced to Class 4, he could apply for the advanced class next semester. And eventually, upon graduating, he would achieve his dream of becoming a mage.\n\"Me, a mage...\"\nJust the thought made his heart flutter. There was a time when he thought he'd spend his life in the mountains. But now, his long-cherished dream was becoming a reality.\n\"So much has happened.\"\nHe remembered being ridiculed by his peers for not being able to perform a single spell when he first entered the school. And wasn't there the extraordinary incident of the teleportation test?\n\"Haha! Looking back, it was pretty silly.\"\nLeaving the movement magic training area, Shirone entered the cutting magic training area in Section 4.\nThis was a place for testing magical cutting force, with a viscous cylindrical target floating above a magic circle.\nShirone approached the target and extended his hand.\n\"Wind Cutter.\"\nAs he chanted, a fierce wind whipped up. The sharp wind slashed the target, splitting the cylinder in two with a loud slap.\nWind specialists usually adjust the viscosity to the maximum for training, but for Shirone, who was trying it for the first time, the success of the magic itself was satisfying.\n\"Hehe, this is easy.\"\nHis omniscience had grown immensely since his initial enrollment.\nPassing all subjects with over 80 points, basic spells like Wind Cutter were no challenge.\nOf course, knowing omniscience doesn't mean everyone can achieve omnipotence. The reason he could instantly manifest a new spell was due to his inclination toward insight over analysis.\nMages can be broadly divided into theory and sensory types. Each has its pros and cons, but sensory types tend to learn faster when trying something new.\nEspecially Shirone, whose disposition was distinctly more on the sensory side. This was why Arcane had once said he learns in actual combat situations.\nReviewing six months of progress, Shirone smiled contentedly. He felt like he had become quite mage-like.\n\"Hey, Shirone!\"\n\"Uh?\"\nLooking around the track, he saw Nade and Yiruki waving.\nShirone was about to run over when a fun idea struck him. He stopped and switched his Spirit Zone to target form, calculating the distance to his friends before executing Space Warp.\nWith a metallic scraping sound, Shirone instantly appeared in front of the two.\n\"Whoa! What was that?\"\nNade jumped back in surprise, and Yiruki's eyes widened, clearly not expecting it.\n\"Did you just do Space Warp? You've been practicing it till the end of the semester?\"\nShirone replied with a sheepish smile.\n\"No, I just came to review since I won't be able to practice in the training ground for a while.\"\n\"But you just succeeded in Space Warp today, right? It's fascinating. Do it again.\"\nNade was excited, but Yiruki snorted dismissively.\n\"What's so fascinating? You've seen it before.\"\n\"Well, it feels different seeing our peer do it. When teachers do it, it's one thing, but seeing Shirone do it is another.\"\n\"True, Space Warp is considered advanced even for senior students in the advanced class.\"\nBeing called a specialist wasn't for nothing. Teleportation is basic for mages, but Space Warp is closer to being a major.\nAlthough both are classified as movement techniques, a 6th-grade certified mage must master Space Warp.\nHowever, even for specialists, using near-light speed as a student was more challenging than expected.\n\"But there's still no real use for it. The travel distance is too short.\"\n\"What do you mean, no use? At least you surprised Nade.\"\n\"What? When did I get surprised? I can do Plasma, too. Want to see it here?\"\nNade was defensive, but the situation was already obvious. Yiruki, seeming annoyed, waved his hand and spoke to Shirone.\n\"Enough. So, in summary, you were here, indulging in self-admiration by casting great magic alone in an empty place?\"\nShirone blushed. Although he was just reviewing his progress, in some way, Yiruki wasn't wrong.\n\"No, it's not like that...\"\n\"Well, you can afford to do so. You've shown the most growth this semester. Anyway, if you're satisfied, let's go say goodbye.\"\n\"Right, it's getting late.\"\nMost students had returned home, but a few, like Shirone and his friends, stayed to thank their teachers for their hard work during the semester.\nThey left the training grounds and headed to the building where the teachers stayed. The dormitory doors were open, and cleaners were busy in each room.\nShirone looked for the conference room. As expected, many teachers were there, chatting over tea before heading home for the holidays.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

What are you doing?\"\nCaught in an awkward stance, Shirone's group entered the meeting room, bowing their heads as Siena greeted them.\n\"Oh, we wanted to say goodbye before leaving. Thank you for teaching us this semester.\"\nAn elderly teacher chuckled warmly.\n\"Haha! It's funny to hear such words from the academy's biggest troublemakers. Anyway, you guys have worked hard too. Make sure to enjoy your vacation. Students should know how to have fun, after all.\"\nAs Siena made room for Shirone's group and poured tea, she offered some parting words.\n\"Congratulations to all three of you on advancing. Next semester will be busier, wont it? Its good to relax, but don't let your guard down. Ill be watching closely when school resumes.\"\nSiena was not one to let things slide easily.\nBut her words were kind even for a teacher known to freeze a classroom with her sternness. The teachers seemed more relaxed with the semester ending.\n\"Yes, we'll work hard,\" Shirone replied, sipping his tea. Then, standing beside him, Thadd asked Ethella.\n\"Teacher Ethella, if you have time, would you like to have a meal with me...?\"\nShirone almost spit out his tea in surprise.\nEven for a flirt, making advances to a nun was something else.\nEthella, too, seemed flustered, politely declining with a wave of her hand.\n\"I'm sorry, but I must manage the parish during the vacation.\"\n\"Ah, I see. If I could be guided by a beauty like Teacher Ethella, I'd join the Karsis Order right away.\"\nEthella was at a loss for words. It was unthinkable for someone to speak like this to a bishop of the order.\nBut true to her pursuit of virtue, she maintained her composure.\n\"Hehe, that's too bad. Then, Thadd, what will you do during the vacation?\"\nSiena interjected.\n\"Hmph, he'll probably just go around flirting with women.\"\nThadd's eyebrows furrowed.\nWhy was this woman always picking fights with him? Even on the last day of the semester, she seemed restless.\nTrying to appear unaffected, Thadd shrugged nonchalantly.\n\"Haha, there's nothing shameful about falling in love at my age. I'm more worried about Teacher Siena. With her prickly personality, it must be hard to find a partner.\"\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"What else? That you lack charm. It's obvious. You've never dated a man, have you? That's all because of your prickly nature.\"\nSiena glared at Thadd, grinding her teeth.\nShe might not care about anyone else, but she didn't want to lose to this man.\n\"Ma...\"\n\"Ma?\"\nEveryone leaned in, eager to hear her response.\n\"Magic. I'm in a relationship with magic.\"\nSiena's face flushed red.\nPeople often say things they don't mean when they're defiant, and this situation was a classic example.\nThe atmosphere in the room grew solemn as the teachers turned away, their faces red with embarrassment.\nThadd, wanting to escape, barely managed to respond.\n\"Ah, I see.\"\n\"Are you mocking me now? I'm committed to magic for life. Is that so wrong?\"\n\"No, I'm sorry. It seems I spoke out of turn.\"\nThadd quickly drank his hot tea and turned away from Siena.\nWatching this, Shirone's group covered their mouths, struggling to contain their laughter. It was a side of the teachers they rarely saw.\n\"Everyone's still here, I see.\"\n\"Oh, Headmaster!\"\nAlpheas entered the meeting room.\nHaving been suspended from his duties, he had been staying in the dormitory and decided to stop by after most students had left.\n\"You rascals have worked hard this semester.\"\n\"It's all thanks to your guidance, Headmaster. We are also grateful.\"\n\"Hoho, am I still the headmaster? From next semester, an interim headmaster sent by the Magic Association will take over. Treat them well as you did me.\"\nNade's face fell.\nIt seemed unlikely that anyone better than Alpheas would come.\nRegardless of the saying, \"old but gold,\" Alpheas was considered one of the best headmasters.\n\"Who could it be? Will next semester be even tougher?\"\n\"Haha! Possibly. But be confident. The progress you've made this semester is remarkable. You'll do well next semester too.\"\nAs the teachers finished their tea and started packing, Shirone's group prepared to leave.\n\"We'll see you after the break, Headmaster.\"\n\"Sure. Have a good time with your families and enjoy your vacation. Oh, and Shirone, could you spare a moment?\"\nShirone, about to follow his friends out, turned around.\nNade gestured towards the door.\n\"We'll wait outside for you. Hey, Shirone, we'll be in the hallway.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nIn the now-empty meeting room, Shirone had a private conversation with Alpheas.\nAlpheas looked serious, so Shirone tensed up, waiting for him to speak.\n\"The reason I wanted to see you is about the labyrinth.\"\n\"Ah, I see.\"\nShirone remembered the labyrinth.\nAlthough Shirone had been busy since his promotion was confirmed, the impression of Miro was still vividly etched in his mind.\n\"I'm curious to know. Are you still interested in investigating more about Miro?\"\n\"Yes. I'll have to discuss it with my parents, but I'm trying to make time for it. It seems like now or never since it's vacation.\"\n\"That's good. It'll be a valuable experience.\"\nAlpheas readily agreed, but his face betrayed an unease.\n\"Is that why you called me here?\"\nFinally, Alpheas brought up what was really on his mind.\n\"No, actually, I wanted to ask you something. Can you tell me about Miros condition at that time?\"\n\"Do you mean her mental state?\"\n\"Yes, that. But really, I'd like to hear in detail about Miro as you saw her.\"\nShirone recalled the encounter. Despite the brief interaction, the significant event had left a clear memory, even the minor details of their conversation.\n\"Hmm, thinking about it, her emotions seemed a bit... erratic. I overlooked it at the time because she was so enigmatic.\"\n\"How severe was it? Was it serious?\"\n\"No, not to that extent. Although there were moments that felt a bit chilling.\"\nAlpheas sighed softly, a complex emotion conveyed in the sound.\n\"Did Miro seem lonely to you?\"\n\"I asked her the same thing, but Miro said that gods do not feel loneliness.\"\n\"Gods do not feel loneliness. Hm.\"\nA shadow fell across Alpheas's face.\nPerhaps Miro wanted to convey something through Shirone, to him, or even...\n'No, maybe to them...'\nShirone observed Alpheas carefully.\nWhat could be so serious to make him look this grave?\nBut he had promised not to probe too deeply, so he couldn't outright ask.\n\"If you're that worried, Headmaster, I won't investigate the ruins.\"\nAlpheas seemed to snap out of his thoughts.\nHe realized he had been too absorbed in his own contemplations, ignoring the person before him.\n\"Huh? No, thats not it. The Kergos Ruins are a tourist spot; you should visit if you get the chance. You'll get a rough idea of the world Miro lives in.\"\n\"Does that mean there really is a secret hidden there? But its a tourist site.\"\n\"Haha! It's no fun if I tell you everything. Just never let your guard down. I allowed you to investigate because I trust your abilities.\"\nShirone sensed the gravity behind his words.\nAlpheas was known for letting students explore freely. However, he also had a mischievous side, allowing a suitable level of risk.\n\"Okay. I'll investigate thoroughly.\"\nAfter saying goodbye to Alpheas and leaving the meeting room, Shirone joined his friends waiting in the corridor.\n\"What did you talk about, Shirone?\"\n\"About Miro, the person I mentioned before.\"\n\"Oh right, you were curious about her, werent you? The Kergos Ruins, right?\"\n\"Yes. But now I'm even more curious after talking to the Headmaster. I'm planning to go there.\"\n\"That's too bad. We'd love to join you.\"\n\"No, you should spend time with your families during the vacation.\"\n\"Tch, who cares about that? I'd rather not go home if it means almost dying.\"\nNade grimaced at the mere thought.\nYiruki faced a similar situation. Being the son of the head of the Kings Commission, he couldn't act rashly outside.\n\"But I'm really curious. Miro was the president of our research group. Technically, she's my direct senior. Maybe she watched over me too?\"\nYiruki shattered Nade's childhood wonder.\n\"Shirone said if we don't enter the Immortal Function, contact is impossible. She's probably dwelling in a dimension between our world and theirs.\"\n\"Ah, I wanted to meet and greet her.\"\n\"Well, you might see her before you die. Anyway, it's time to part. Take care, everyone.\"\nYiruki pointed to three carriages waiting.\nAmong them, the flashy double-horse carriage from the Mercodine family stood out.\n\"Wow, first-class nobility. Youre a different class indeed.\"\n\"Quiet. It's all a waste of money. And it's so slow, too.\"\nThe three exchanged farewells.\nThough they'd see each other again soon, parting brought a rush of emotions.\n\"Shirone, Yiruki, I'll miss you. I've never disliked vacations as much as this time.\"\n\"Will you be alright? Can you endure it?\"\nYiruki asked with concern, knowing Nade's family situation and his current fear.\nSurprisingly, Nade smiled brightly, a change from the previous semester. Meeting Shirone had given him many happy memories.\n\"No problem. I'll reorganize at home and have more fun next semester. Stay healthy and take care.\"\nAfter half a year of shared joys and sorrows, they walked to their respective carriages, waving goodbye.\n\"Great! See you on the first day of school!\"\nOne week earlier.\nLike other swordsmanship schools, the Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy had finished its first semester of training.\nDespite receiving the worst report card, Rian's optimistic nature kept his spirits high on his way home.\nHe would've preferred to go straight to his hometown, but he needed to collect his luggage from his sister's house in the royal palace area.\n\"Darn it, I have to meet that witch again. I should've left my stuff at grandfather's place. She's going to kill me over my report card.\"\nHoping desperately that Reina was out, Rian opened the door to the mansion.\nFitting for an artist recognized by the royal palace, the mansion was luxurious. But for Rian, it just felt like an unnecessarily long escape route.\nSneaking through the hall like a cat burglar, Rian's hopes were crushed by the loud sound of a piano.\n\"Damn! She's home?\"\nThe piano sound drowned out his voice.\nReina was focused solely on playing the grand piano in one corner of the hall.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 118: An Unexpected Guest (3)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nSince becoming a disciple of the melody pianist Merhen, her skills had improved by leaps and bounds.\nHer sensitivity had sharpened to the extent of detecting even the slightest changes in air pressure through Schema, and her fingers were leaping over the piano keys at a speed invisible to the eye.\nReina's performance, even acclaimed by the royals, was magnificent.\nBut it was nothing but murderous noise to Rian, who had often lost sleep to those sounds since childhood.\n\"Damn it, the witch has gotten stronger. But that wont kill a human.\"\nReina seemed oblivious to everything but the sound of her performance.\nThe pout of her lower lip was a clear sign of her intense concentration.\nHer hair was disheveled, possibly from staying up all night, and her eyes were bleary.\nWearing only panties, her thighs were fully exposed.\nIn fact, she had been playing the piano for 17 hours straight.\nShe was struggling with a famously difficult requiem from the continent, having hit a recent snag.\nFor an artist, a barrier is both a curse and a blessing, as it often appears right before a significant improvement in skill.\nIn such cases, Reina often stayed up all night for days, overcoming these barriers.\nRian glimpsed a new hope.\nIf he could sneak into the room undetected and gather his things, he could escape through the window or break down the wall if necessary.\n\"Okay, stay calm. I'm going back home.\"\nRian slowly moved along the blind spot of the grand piano.\nThe plan would be a resounding success if he could just make it to the stairs.\nOf course, Reina was perched right on top of his head.\nThe moment Rian's eyes lit up with hope, Reina abruptly stopped playing, as always.\n\"Ah, damn it.\"\nWithout even shifting her gaze, Reina spoke.\n\"You, what have you been doing since a while ago? Do they teach you how to be a clown at the swordsmanship academy these days?\"\n\"Tch, if you saw, you should at least pretend you knew. And what's with that look? A grown maiden playing the piano in her panties? Don't insult art.\"\n\"Youre provoking me again, huh? You really haven't had enough yet.\"\nDespite her threatening words, Reina started by picking up her skirt.\nOnly her family knew that the more stressed she got during practice, the more clothes she took off.\n\"Kekeke, even in front of your brother, you feel embarrassed, huh? Ouch!\"\nThe moment Rian burst into laughter, Reina's foot struck his face.\nDespite his diligent training, Rian was still unable to react in time.\n\"Damn. What the hell are you doing? Ptooey!\"\nAs Rian spat out, Reina extended her hand.\n\"Give it here, your report card.\"\nRian's face stiffened.\nWhat he feared had finally come.\n\"Why the heck are you so obsessed with my report card? I'm grown up now. Ouch!\"\nReina yanked his ear as she shouted.\n\"Youre not giving it? Want to die today?\"\n\"Alright, alright! Here, here!\"\nRian pulled the report card from his pocket and threw it on the floor.\nThen he ran off to his room without looking back.\n\"Ugh! That kid really hasn't had enough. When will he ever grow up.\"\nReina picked up the report card and unfolded it.\nScores for training subjects were listed in order, with the total number of students and his overall ranking at the end.\nReina's hands trembled as she saw the ranking.\nLast place!\nNot just second to last, but actually dead last.\n'Impossible. He tries hard even if he's pathetic.'\nReina turned the report card over to check the comments from the dedicated teacher.\nHer eyes widened in shock as she read.\n\"We regret to inform you that your child has finished the semester with the lowest grades.\nCurrently, Rian believes he has opened his Schema, but the teachers have concluded it's merely a placebo effect from increased physical strength.\nThis phenomenon, known as 'Imaginary Schema', is extremely rare but can occur. Your warm attention as a family is needed at this time.\"\n\"Oh, really! I can't live like this!\"\nReina crumpled the report card and stormed up the stairs in a huff.\nBursting into the room, she saw Rian, hunched like a bear, gathering his things.\n\"Hey! You're at the bottom!\"\n\"Ah, I don't know. That's how it turned out.\"\n\"And what's this about an 'Imaginary Schema'? What does that even mean? Like some... imaginary pregnancy or something?\"\n\"Seems like it.\"\nRian responded as if it was someone else's problem, continuing his task.\nHe had become detached from all worries the moment he revealed his report card.\nReina, boiling with anger, glared at Rian.\nUnable to hold back, she started hitting him mercilessly on the back.\n\"Ugh, you, burn! Die, die!\"\n\"Ow! It hurts!\"\n\"Is it that hard? Just open the Schema!\"\n\"I don't know! What can I do if it doesn't work? I did my best. Anyway, I'm going, move. I might miss the carriage.\"\n\"Going where? Stick to the house! I'm going down with grandfather as soon as this is over, so you're coming with us then!\"\n\"No! I have a promise!\"\n\"A promise? What promise could you possibly have? Do you still want to play after seeing these grades?\"\nRian nearly blurted out about Shirone in his frustration.\nBut he held back at the last moment. It was something he couldn't ever tell Reina.\nIt was about a double date.\nIf Reina heard that Shirone was going with a girl, she would definitely find a way to stop him.\n'This ugly witch is just full of jealousy.'\nInitially, he had hoped that Shirone and his sister would get along, but now he felt the opposite.\nA calm and collected woman was far more suited for Shirone than this witch.\n\"What's the promise? Speak up quickly.\"\n\"It's with a girl. We agreed to hang out.\"\n\"A girl? What girl could you be meeting while attending a swordsmanship academy?\"\n\"There are girls there too. Elzain Tess, you know the Elzain family, right? She's their daughter.\"\nReina was familiar with the Elzain family, who had long been prominent in diplomatic circles.\nHowever, it was hard to imagine a girl from such an elite family going on a trip with her brother, who was the lowest-ranking student at school.\n\"Where are you making up these stories? Tell me the truth! You have some other ulterior motive, don't you?\"\n\"Leave me alone! I'm leaving now!\"\nIgnoring Reina's nagging, Rian seized the opportunity and quickly got up to run away.\n\"Hey! Aren't you going to stop?\"\nBy the time Reina stepped outside the door, Rian was already racing down the second-floor stairs toward the entrance.\nAlthough she could catch up to him by activating her Schema, Reina, looking annoyed, chose not to pursue Rian.\nShe had been babysitting Rian since they were children and was confident she could handle him from even 100,000 ri* away.\n*A ri is a unit of measure, it's about how far a person can walk in an hour at a reasonable pace. It clocks out at roughly 3.93 kilometers.\n\"Hehe. Go ahead, hurry to the carriage. Lets see who gets there faster.\"\nReina waved the report card behind the fleeing Rian.\nAfter saying goodbye to his friends, Shirone walked towards the carriage sent by the Ogent family. Deputy Butler Temuran from the main house was there to meet him. Temuran, who had been strict with Shirone while organizing the Grand Library, still had the same stern impression even after half a year. However, his attitude was quite different now. He greeted Shirone with a polite bow and a kind smile.\n\"It's been a long time, Young Master. You've done excellently.\"\n\"Its been a while, Deputy Butler.\"\nInitially, Shirone found it awkward to be addressed as \"Young Master,\" but it no longer bothered him after half a year. It still felt a bit embarrassing, though.\nThe two chatted on the way to Shirone's home, especially about how the people of the Ogent family were doing.\n\"Wow, Rai has already passed the official examination?\"\nRai Ogent, Rian's elder brother, had passed the official examination. As a 10th-grade swordsman, he couldn't afford much leisure and was having hectic days at the forefront.\n\"Yes. Moreover, Lady Reina has been promoted to the leader of the 7th Music Band at the royal palace. The head of the family is still busy with public duties, and the elder will soon retire and return to his hometown.\"\n\"Ah, I heard there's an eldest brother in the Ogent family. What does he do?\"\n\"Um, I am not at liberty to speak on that matter. Just know he's a 6th-grade official swordsman. It would be best not to bring up the eldest son in the main house.\"\n\"Ah, I see.\"\nConsidering the Ogent family's nature, they didn't seem like a family that would have conflicts. Still, if it was a topic to be avoided, it might be a political matter.\n\"Is Rian doing well? Ill see him soon anyway.\"\nTemuran's response was the shortest so far.\n\"He hasnt contacted us for half a year.\"\n\"Hahaha! That's so like Rian.\"\nDuring their pleasant conversation, the carriage entered the woods.\nShirone opened the window to enjoy the scenery of his hometown. The colorful forest seemed to welcome his return.\nThe carriage entered the yard of Shirone's house, the very place where Temuran had come to fetch him before.\n\"Thank you for the ride. I'll visit again soon.\"\n\"It was merely my duty. Have a good time.\"\nShirone turned with excitement in his heart. The sight of the humble but familiar log house brought fresh emotions.\n'Thank you. Ill be filial during the vacation.'\nAs he approached the house, thoughts of his parents filled his mind more and more. His mother, who had endured so much, and his father, who hadn't hesitated to kneel to send him to the magic academy.\nShirone opened the door, shouting with emotion.\n\"Mom! Dad!\"\n\"Hahaha! Right, right! Beer goes best with pork!\"\n\"Does Father think so, too? I find beer doesn't go well with lamb.\"\n\"Exactly. Lamb has a gamey taste that ruins the flavor of the drink. Come on, let's have another drink!\"\nShirone stood dumbfounded, looking at the living room.\nHe was surprised by the festive atmosphere, but what really shocked him was the burly boy sharing drinks with Vincent. Rian had grown taller and cut his hair short, but his robust appearance was unmistakably Rian.\n\"Shirone! Youre here!\"\nRian jumped up. But Vincent was the fastest to rush over.\nAs Vincent embraced him, the smell of alcohol was overwhelming. He must have drunk quite a lot.\n\"My son! Are you hurt anywhere?\"\n\"Uh, you stink with alcohol. Whats going on? Why is Rian here?\"\n\"Hes been staying for two days to see you. He helped with chopping wood and went hunting with me. Wasnt it fun, Rian?\"\n\"Hahaha! Of course, Father! A true man should know how to hunt!\"\nShirone was dumbfounded. The father he knew wouldn't casually interact with a noble's child.\nWhat kind of camaraderie had developed over two days that led to an early drinking session between the two?\nShirone, escaping from Vincents booze-scented embrace, shouted at Rian.\n\"You were out of touch, right? Did you stop by your house before coming here?\"\n\"No, why go to the main house? This is where my lord lives. Isnt that right, Father?\"\n\"Stop joking! What trouble have you caused now?\"\n\"What trouble could I have caused?\"\nRian pretended ignorance, but his face said it all. It wasnt that he didnt go home; he couldnt.\nShirone sighed and entered the living room.\n'Ah, this is not what I expected...'\nHis anticipated family reunion had turned into a drinking session. However, seeing his father's thinner appearance, he felt relieved that he could at least prevent him from crying.\n\"Ah, Shirone, you're here. Come here, my baby.\"\nOlina embraced Shirone with her warm arms.\nIndeed, the only thing reliable in the world seemed to be his mother. Finally, Shirone could share the greeting he had longed for.\n\"Mom, you must have had a hard time while I was away. I'm sorry.\"\n\"What hard time? The Ogent family helped a lot.\"\nOlina patted Shirone's back while casting a sidelong glance at Vincent, displeased with him being drunk when his son had returned after six months.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 119: An Unexpected Guest (4)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nOblivious, Rian fanned the flames in Olina's anxious heart.\n\"Father, instead of this, why don't we go chop some wood now in celebration of Shirone's return!\"\n\"Haha! Should we? Alright, let's set the woods ablaze, just us men!\"\n\"Honey! You've been drinking, and now chopping wood? Just go inside and sleep it off.\"\n\"Mom, it's okay. Ill be back soon.\"\nShirone readily agreed. Given the situation, letting off some steam seemed a good opportunity.\nOn the other hand, Olina couldn't help but worry. Even though Vincent was strong with alcohol, climbing a mountain in an inebriated state was perilous even for experienced woodsmen.\n\"Are you sure you'll be okay? What if you get hurt?\"\n\"I'll be there, so itll be fine. Well be back before lunch.\"\nOlinas words would have been enough to dissuade Shirone in the past, but now things were different. He had faced fearsome Ulks and protected children, so he was confident nothing worrisome would happen.\nOlina found her son's newfound confidence unfamiliar. He seemed brighter and more self-assured in his speech and actions.\nWas this the power of education? He had always been a good son but often hard to read. Now, he seemed like a completely different person, seemingly loving himself a bit more.\nWith Olina's reluctant permission, the three men set off to the logging area, exchanging stories they hadn't shared in a while. Rian, eager to show off his progress, quickened his pace.\nDuring his two-day stay at Vincent's, Rian had heard about Shirone's childhood tales, especially impressed by the Thunder Strike. Having struggled against Sword Smash in a duel with Shirone at the main house, Rian's interest was piqued.\nUpon reaching the logging area, Rian shouted.\n\"Alright! Let's chop some wood like true men! How about it, Shirone? Wanna bet? The loser grants a wish.\"\nRian, now bigger, effortlessly held the two-handed axe with one hand. Exaggerating a bit, beside Rian, who resembled a sturdy oak, Shirone looked like a squirrel standing beside him.\n\"Sure, why not.\"\nShirone easily agreed. He had never lost a bet to Rian. It wouldnt be right for a victor to run away from a challenger.\nRian lifted the axe and nodded at Vincent, who responded by giving a thumbs-up signal.\n\"Then I'll start.\"\nRian swung the axe with all his might. A thud echoed as the tree trunk shook violently.\nAn almost lethal destructive power. It was clear how rigorous his training had been for the past six months.\n\"Wow, amazing. Is that Schema?\"\n\"Huh? Ahaha! Of course not! Why would I need Schema for chopping wood?\"\nThough Rian's reply was somewhat awkward, Shirone chose to let it pass.\nRian raised the axe again, winking at Shirone.\n\"The real show starts now.\"\nRian's axe struck the same spot where the bark had burst open. With a loud crack like thunder, the tree fell in one strike.\n\"Thunder Strike...\"\nShirone recognized it immediately. Rian's success with Thunder Strike meant he could now perform Sword Smash.\n\"Hahaha! How about that, Shirone? I'm not the same as before!\"\nDespite his boastful shout, Rian's heart was racing. There was a slight chance of failure.\nHe had learned Sword Smash at the swordsmanship academy, but its success rate was much lower against human opponents.\nHowever, after hearing about Thunder Strike from Vincent and practicing all day, he had improved to a point where he succeeded nine out of ten times against trees.\n\"Impressive. Your Thunder Strike has a different impact from mine.\"\n\"Of course, it's only natural. Anyway, it's a bet. I succeeded in two tries, so you have to bring it down in one!\"\nVincent burst out laughing heartily.\n\"Haha! Give it your best, Shirone. If it's a tie, we'll continue until one of you wins. We might end up clearing the whole mountain at this rate!\"\nVincent thought Shirone would be no pushover. While Rian's strength was remarkable, Shirone had always had a natural talent for technical skills since he was young.\n\"Here, use my axe.\"\n\"No, it's fine. I'll do it this way.\"\nShirone approached the tree and extended his hand. Vincent and Rian looked puzzled. How could he bring down a thick tree without an axe?\nShirone entered his Spirit Zone and used Windcutter, a basic magic, to strike the tree.\nA snapping sound came from inside the tree trunk.\nAnd that was that.\nAs the two onlookers gaped in confusion, Shirone gently pushed the tree, revealing a clean cut as it fell over.\n\"Yay! I win!\"\nWhile Shirone jumped for joy, Vincent and Rian stood with their mouths agape.\nHow could a tree be cut down without any physical blow? Unless magic was used, it was an impossible feat.\n'Ah, so that was magic.'\nRian inspected the cleanly cut base of the tree. Even a swordsmanship trainee couldn't have made such a smooth cut.\n\"What kind of magic is that?\"\n\"It's called Windcutter. It sharpens the air by creating wind, but actually, it's quite a basic magic.\"\nVincent was lost for words at the transformation in his son.\nOf course, he had sent Shirone to a magic academy, so he had expected him to learn some magic, but he had only imagined something akin to a circus trick.\nBut to cut down a tree in one go? Depending on how it's used, it could be as deadly as a weapon.\n\"Hehe. Unbelievable. Can you teach me that magic? We could chop way more wood with that.\"\nVincent's innocent remark left Shirone smiling awkwardly.\n\"It's basic, but not so easy to learn.\"\nMastering Windcutter would naturally enable one to chop over a hundred trees a day. However, no mage ever chopped wood for money.\nEven if they cut down a thousand trees, a mage's daily wage was much higher. It wasn't that the value of a thousand trees was low, but the wages of a mage were high.\nShirone felt good realizing this fact. When he first entered school, he was overwhelmed by the fear of failure, but now he felt reassured, knowing he had skills to support his family even if he couldn't graduate.\nOthers might think a mage who had opened the Immortal Function was crazy to consider such things, but for Shirone, his family was that precious.\n\"Anyway, since I won, Ill make a wish. Rian, you carry the wood back home.\"\n\"Tch! Can't help it. I was going to carry it anyway.\"\nRian chopped the fallen tree into pieces and prepared to carry it back on a yoke. Despite losing the bet, a smile lingered on his lips as he descended the mountain. Shirone had proven his eyes werent wrong.\nAmazing, Shirone. Of course, what you showed today isnt all youve got, right?\nBack home, Olina had prepared a feast of delicacies from land, sea, and air.\n\"Wow, this looks delicious. Thank you for the meal!\"\nWhile eating, Shirone shared his experiences at school.\nHe naturally omitted life-threatening situations, but there were still many things to tell.\n\"...so the correct answer was actually number 3. Hahaha! Thanks to that, I'll be advancing to Class Four from next semester.\"\n\"Ah, is that so.\"\nUnexpectedly, Vincent and Olina didn't show much reaction. Shirone, realizing they might not have grasped the significance, spread his hands and emphasized.\n\"It's a really big deal.\"\nOnly then did the expressions on their parents' faces brighten. They might not have understood half of what he said, but they were as happy about their son's achievements as any other parents would be.\n\"Ah! Thats great, Shirone! Congratulations!\"\n\"Well done, our son. I was so worried.\"\nOlina dabbed her eyes with the tablecloth, moved to tears.\nRian watched the loving family scene with a pleased smile, understanding where Shirone's calm temperament originated.\n\"By the way, Rian, why did you really come here?\"\n\"Ah, right. I came to ask your parents for permission.\"\n\"You can ask anything. If it's something we can help with, we surely will.\"\nVincent said this, though he was quite worried. Why would the son of a noble family ask permission from a woodsman?\n\"Can I go on a trip with Shirone? For about a week.\"\nShirone turned in surprise.\n\"What, a trip? Why are you talking about something I don't even know? Where are you planning to go?\"\n\"Galiant Island. Dont worry. Ive already planned it out.\"\n\"Galiant? Really?\"\nShirone's eyes widened. The place that had recently occupied his thoughts was now being mentioned by Rian.\n\"I was stuck in the library when working. Lets get some fresh air this time. It's close to Creas and will be fun. Galiant Island is one of the most popular resorts in the world.\"\n\"And there's the Kergos Ruins too.\"\nThis time, Rian was surprised.\n\"Uh? You knew about that?\"\n\"No, I just knew there were ruins there. Oh, it's that famous, huh? That's unexpected.\"\nShirone had been scouring maps for the past few days and found out about the Kergos Ruins on Galiant Island. He had planned to visit them during the vacation anyway.\nShirone glanced at his mother. He had intended to visit at some point during the break, but announcing a trip right after returning home for half a year might disappoint them.\nAs always, Olina was supportive of Shirone's plans.\n\"Go ahead. We fully support you.\"\n\"But Mom, I was planning to help Father with his work after returning from school...\"\nVincent laughed heartily.\n\"You lad! Did you go to a battlefield or something? It's just a school you're returning from. It's okay to go on a trip during the break. Its not good for a young man to stick too close to his parents.\"\nShirone pursed his lips guiltily. Although the magic academy was technically just a school, the risks he faced there were almost akin to a battlefield.\n\"So, can I stay for ten days?\"\n\"Ten days? That's fine, but it seems a bit long for just sightseeing, doesnt it?\"\n\"Ah, actually, I have something I want to research there.\"\nRian looked exasperated.\n\"Youll be studying there too? You really are something, seriously.\"\nConsidering Shirone had devoured every history book in the Ogent family library, studying at a vacation spot would be nothing for him.\nHehe, but it wont be easy this time. Will he really be able to study there?\nThinking of his secret plan, Rian smiled to himself, eagerly awaiting the next day.\nShirone packed his travel bag and went to bed. Rian, who had decided to stay for the night, spread a blanket next to him.\n\"So, tell me. Why didnt you go home?\"\n\"Uh, well, thats because...\"\nRian trailed off. Just as Reina kept tabs on her brother, Rian knew his sister well. She probably sent his report card home to keep him there.\nBut he couldn't tell Shirone the truth. Although he wasn't ashamed of coming last since he tried his best, he found it hard to say it out loud.\n\"Just some minor family issues. Hahaha.\"\nShirone didnt probe further.\n\"Anyway, its good. I was planning to visit there during the break.\"\n\"The Kergos Ruins, right? What do you plan to research?\"\n\"I'm not sure yet. Ill enjoy the vacation and then stay back to investigate.\"\nRian felt something was off. Kergos Ruins was a tourist site. If it was just for research, Shirone wouldnt ask him to return first.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 120: An Unexpected Guest (5)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\n\"But Shirone, if you really plan to do something on the island, there's a problem.\"\n\"Huh? What problem?\"\n\"Actually, this vacation was planned as a couples' trip.\"\n\"Couples' trip? You mean, like, boys and girls paired up?\"\n\"Yes. My partner is supposed to come from this side. I should have mentioned it earlier. I didnt expect you to say you wanted to investigate the ruins.\"\nShirone looked up at the dim ceiling. A couples' trip. That meant he had to bring a partner, too.\n\"Okay, I'll bring someone too.\"\nRian looked at Shirone in surprise. The Shirone he knew blushed even at the sight of women's underwear. Finding a partner seemed like the biggest challenge, but Shirone easily agreed.\n\"You... are popular with girls, arent you?\"\n\"Huh? No, not really. But I have someone in mind. I was considering it, actually. If you hadnt suggested it, I would have asked first.\"\nRian's eyes lit up. Regardless of his intention, Shirone apparently had a girl in mind.\n\"Haha! Our house witch would be jealous, wouldnt she?\"\n\"Reina? Why would she be?\"\n\"Kukuku, no, never mind. But Im dying of curiosity. Who is she? Is she pretty?\"\n\"Yes, shes pretty, but... Im not sure if shell agree to come. She might just turn me down outright.\"\n\"No way, you have to bring her. Go get her consent tomorrow. Meanwhile, Ill head home to prepare.\"\nShirone deferred his response. If Rian was bringing a partner, he had to bring one too.\nBut he wasn't certain. Judging by his usual character, there was a very high chance of being rebuffed and chased away.\nVarious worries constricted Shirone's heart. Yet, part of him was excited.\nIt was his first trip, with friends, to Galiant Island, a famous tourist destination known for its southern charm.\nShirone spent a sleepless night, tossing and turning.\nShirone parted ways with Rian in the noble residential area. With the departure scheduled for tomorrow, he had to find a partner today.\nUnfamiliar with the area, he asked for directions and finally arrived at a mansion too beautiful to be merely a residence.\nSo this is the Karmis main house.\nHe was not shy about talking at school, but the thought of visiting her home made him nervous. The guards at the main gate looked suspiciously at him, increasing his tension.\nUh hello?\nWhat brings you here?\nAs Shirone approached, the guard gripping his sword tensed. It was an involuntary reaction. After overcoming countless challenges, Shirone's aura could overwhelm even criminals.\nIs Amy here?\nThe guard's expression hardened. He knew Amy was a coveted figure among young men. However, it was rare for anyone to visit the main house.\nExcuse me, but may I ask who you are?\nOh, Im Shirone. We attend the magic academy together.\nThe guard looked to his superior, who seemed indifferent. It was a rare occurrence but not new for someone who had lived at the Karmis main house for 20 years.\nAh, the trouble starts right after the holidays.\nNevertheless, unless explicitly instructed not to, he had to report the visit.\nThe guard signaled with a nod and rode off toward the mansion.\nShirone waited anxiously at the main gate while the superior guard glanced at him. Shirone seemed decent in looks and temperament, but entering the mansion seemed impossible.\nMany men had been turned away before, even those of royal blood and distant relatives had left without seeing Amy's face.\nAfter about ten minutes, the guard returned hurriedly on horseback. The superior could guess the outcome just by looking at his subordinates worried face.\nIt was always the guards who had to deal with angry nobles. If they got slapped, there was nothing they could do.\nThe superior made up an excuse to ease the situation.\nWhat happened? I heard there was urgent business to be handled today.\nWell, hes been asked to come in.\nHmm, they must be busy Eh? What did you say?\nThe superior asked incredulously. The reporting guard also seemed baffled by this unusual situation.\nThats Miss Amy asked for him to be brought in.\nAh, so she was home. Thats good.\nShirone sighed in relief. If Amy had been out, there would have been no way for him, a commoner, to enter the mansion.\nSoon, a pink carriage arrived at the main gate. An elderly man using a cane stepped down from the carriage, and the guards turned pale.\nIt was Adel, the head butler of the Karmis family.\nNoticing the person who came out to meet him, Shirone asked the guard.\nMay I enter now?\nYes, of course! Welcome to the Karmis Estate!\nThe supervisor quickly snapped to attention, still unable to comprehend the current situation.\nAlthough he understood the permission to enter, he couldnt fathom why Adel, the head butler of the Karmis family, would come out to greet Shirone. Whether Shirone was of distinguished lineage or not, there was no reason for Adel to personally receive him.\nAdel would only make such efforts for major family events or visits from the head of the household's guests.\nWho exactly is he? He's a friend of the young lady, so not a guest of the head. Is there some event today? No, I havent heard anything of that sort.\nAdel, leaning on his cane, approached Shirone. Despite being the steward of a grand mansion, he had a gentle demeanor.\nYou are most welcome at the Karmis mansion. I am Adel, the head butler.\nHello. My name is Shirone.\nBefore we proceed, I must verify something, if you dont mind.\nOh? What would that be?\nI need to confirm your identity. To ensure that you are indeed Shirone.\nShirone looked at Adel, puzzled.\nThe young lady said this: If it's Shirone, bring him. I interpret this as: only Shirone is allowed entry. Therefore, you must provide evidence that you are indeed Shirone.\nShirone felt a surge of irritation. The young ladys words were nothing more than her usual grumbling, and at most, it meant to check his name for impersonation.\nHow could it be stretched to require proof of identity?\nHow can I prove I am myself? I am Shirone.\nThat alone is not sufficient. As the Karmis family's head butler, it is my duty and authority to clarify the identity of all entrants.\nIf you could just take me to Amy...!\nShirone halted mid-sentence. Adel's previously kind face suddenly seemed intimidating, and an unknown force began to press on his chest and back. It felt like his organs might burst.\nThe Karmis family rejects comparisons with other families, being of the highest nobility. And I, Adel, as the head butler, follow only the orders of the head of the household. Having personally been asked to escort the young lady's guest, I must show corresponding respect.\nShirone realized why Adel was acting so petulantly. Essentially, he was annoyed that he had to do a task usually handled by a regular butler. However, he couldnt openly express his displeasure due to the increasingly intense pressure he was exerting.\nAh... so it begins. Pressing.\nThe guards empathized with Shirone. Known for his strictness, Adel often summoned his subordinates for minor errors and subjected them to Pressing.\nPressing involved transmitting intensely amplified emotions to disrupt the recipient's nervous system. While it didnt cause physical pain, the escalating stress could affect the body, and if severe enough, could even damage vital organs.\nHo, he withstood this too?\nShirone showed no significant change, remaining calm under stress. Adel, feeling challenged, gradually increased the intensity of his Pressing.\nInitially, he hadnt planned to go this far, but he thought it a good lesson for the young man to get a taste of what it meant to provoke the Karmis family.\nShirone realized his heartbeat accelerating, primarily due to anger. Adels hostility was fueling his rage.\nStay calm. Its just an emotion. If I control it, nothing will happen.\nShirone, like someone sinking to the ocean floor with a boulder tied to him, felt the pressure mounting, making breathing difficult.\nBut instead of panicking, he calmly observed his emotions.\nAs the duration of Pressing crossed a lethal threshold, Adel trembled in disbelief.\nSweat trickled down his forehead.\nWhat is this boy?\nTo break free from Pressing, one had to amplify their emotions to a similar intensity.\nWhile a Karmis with crimson eyes could reset their emotions, Shirones ability to endure this long was certainly abnormal.\nEndurance alone doesnt explain this. The only other explanation is complete emotional control.\nAnother method to counteract Pressing, but not an easy feat.\nEven a saint would lose composure under prolonged stress. Yet, Shirone showed no such signs.\nAdel speculated several scenarios based on his experience. Either Shirone was a fool, insane, or a monk.\nNo, not just any monk, but one who had reached the state of a Vajra Monk.\nA Vajra Monk? Is that even plausible? Hes barely an adult.\nThough he didnt admit it, Adel had inadvertently stumbled upon the truth.\nIn the Infinite Realm, Shirone had experienced madness beyond human endurance.\nIt was during these trials that he discovered an absolute center.\nAs long as he held onto it, emotions induced by techniques were trivial.\nAdel released the Pressing. Regardless of how Shirone had endured so far, it was no longer his concern.\nThe boy standing before him was undoubtedly the young lady's friend.\nAdels face returned to its kindly expression, allowing Shirone to finally breathe.\nIts such a terrifying technique. His heart might have burst if he had not reached the state of Indestructibility.\nAdel placed his hand on his chest and bowed.\nPlease forgive the folly of an old man.\nThe guards were baffled. Shirone's expression hadnt changed, but suddenly, the head butler was apologizing humbly.\nPlease reprimand my actions when we return to the mansion. I will accept any punishment. So, I beg of you, do not harbor any resentment.\nDid the family suspect me?\nYes. The decision to interpret the orders broadly and put you in danger was entirely my own. The head of the household did not impose any conditions on bringing you in.\nWhy then? Did I do something to displease you?\nAdel smiled and shook his head.\nOn the contrary. I have been serving Miss Amy since her birth, but this is the first time a man has been invited inside. Curiosity got the better of me, and I acted rudely without realizing it.\nShirone deflated. Had all this been a test to see what kind of person he was?\nBut he couldnt really blame Adel. To visit the main residence of a noble family, especially the Karmis, one must always make an appointment in advance.\nHaving worked at the Ogent family, Shirone knew how grave Adel's responsibilities were.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 121: New Meetings (1)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nUnderstood. So, can I meet Amy now?\nOf course. She is waiting for you. Please, get on the carriage.\nAs the carriage started, a beautiful garden full of roses unfolded outside the window.\nWhile the Ogent family expressed their nobility through grandeur, the Karmis family's style seemed free-spirited. Unique artistic works were placed all over the garden, ignoring standardization and uniformity.\n\"It's truly magnificent. It feels like I've entered a dreamland.\"\n\"I'm glad you like it. The Karmis garden reflects the taste of each family member. Each section is designed to their liking. It represents our familys tradition of valuing individuality. That artificial fountain you see was proposed by Miss Amy when she was ten. We call it the Rainbow Fountain.\"\nShirone leaned out the window. The conically shaped fountain sprayed water, scattering droplets that created a beautiful rainbow.\n\"Haha! A Rainbow Fountain. That's so like Amy.\"\nAdel watched Shirone admiring the garden with a kind gaze. He guessed why Amy, having finished this semester and returned home, seemed brighter than before.\nThe Karmis family possesses a power known as 'Red Eyes,' allowing them to excel much faster than others. Knowing this, our family tends to avoid interfering in each other's affairs. Even with the Arcane incident, once the family head confirmed Miss Amy's safety, he ordered to just leave it be.\"\nShirone gaped in astonishment. To think they would leave it be, even though it was an incident that endangered their daughters life. He felt the broad-mindedness with which the Karmis family viewed the world.\n\"Of course, its not that we lack affection among our family. Its just our nature. Miss Amy, the youngest, sometimes couldnt understand her family. When she was even younger, she went through a phase of wandering.\"\n\"Oh, I know about that. But I didnt know there was such a story behind it.\"\nShirone recalled his first meeting with Amy. Around the age of twelve, he had harbored many resentments when he was bullied in an alley. But now, those days were long gone, and knowing the context behind her past, he felt closer to her.\n\"These past few days, I've noticed that Miss Amy has changed quite a bit since her childhood. Now, she seems to enjoy her life, much like the other young masters of our family. It must be thanks to you, Mr. Shirone. Thank you.\"\nShirone could read sincerity in Adels bow. Naturally, someone who had cared for Amy since her birth would hold more than just an employee's feelings.\nHis strict assessment of Shirone was also rooted in that concern. Of course, a significant part of it might have been jealousy, as if he had stolen his beloved granddaughter.\n\"Im sorry for causing a fuss. It wasnt necessary for the head butler to come out to meet me.\"\n\"Mr. Shirone, you are too kind. But worry not. Miss Amy had permitted your entrance, and I happened to be passing by when the family head ordered someone to go meet you.\"\nShirone wondered about the Karmis family members. If even the butler was terribly fond of Amy, how strictly would the family members assess him? The thought was somewhat frightening.\n\"Uh, Im nervous. I hope I dont get a cold reception.\"\n\"Haha! It will be beyond your expectations. But dont take it to heart; its just their way.\"\nAs they conversed, the carriage arrived at its destination.\nShirone followed Adel into the mansion. A lavish hall adorned with numerous art pieces greeted him. On both sides, spiraled staircases wound their way up to the fourth floor.\nMaster, Miss Amy's friend has arrived\nAaah! Amazing! A real man!\nA woman, identical to Amy, slapped her cheeks and exclaimed. It was Isis, the lady of the house.\nDespite being in her fifties, the former kingdom-renowned dancer still looked youthful. However, perhaps because of that, her every move seemed to lack maturity.\n\"What? Shirone is a man?\"\n\"Me too! I want to see!\"\nTwo men rushed from the corridor connected to the living room. They were the eldest son, Daian, and the second son, Ares.\nIn his mid-thirties, Daian looked surprisingly young, and Ares, with a lush beard, had an indiscernible face.\nThe two stared at Shirone in disbelief. From their shocked eyes, it was clear how confused they were.\nUh, hello I am Shirone, a friend of Amy\n\"Come here, quickly. Dont bother with greetings. Honey, Amy's boyfriend is here.\"\nIsis, undeterred, grabbed Shirone's wrist and sat him on the sofa. Waiting there was a man Shirone knew by name - Shakora, the head of the Karmis family. A man of great influence in politics, he had retired, disillusioned with various corruptions.\nHmm.\nAs Shakora lowered his newspaper, his intellectual appearance was revealed. He was the tallest in the family, and despite his age, his physique was perfectly balanced.\nShirone sweated coldly, feeling like a rabbit in a lion's den. The scrutinizing gaze, as if appraising an artwork, was unbearably overwhelming.\nThe mens eyes glowed red, causing Shirone to swallow nervously. The sight of the three simultaneously activating their Red Eyes was truly terrifying.\nUgh, they remember me. Theyre storing me in their minds.\nAware of their ability to recall self-images, Shirone felt as if shackled. They could likely recall this moment anytime, transcending time and space.\nUm, hello?\nUnable to endure the awkward silence, Shirone, feeling embarrassed, greeted them again. At that, the men's Red Eyes faded, and Isis, as if waiting for this moment, clung to him cheerfully.\n\"Wow, so handsome. Is this for real? Are you really Amy's friend?\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"Oh? So you're in the advanced class too?\"\n\"No, I am in Class Five.\"\nHmm?\nIsis furrowed her brows, and the brothers tilted their heads in confusion. Shirone, feeling uneasy, felt compelled to add more.\nBut I will be in Class Four next semester.\n\"Ah ha!\"\nSuddenly, all three burst into cheerful laughter. The same expressions, the same reactions. Shirone was thrown into a panic. It seemed they never cared about classes in the first place.\n'Where am I? Who are these people'\nShirone suddenly remembered Adels words.\n- Expect the unexpected. Dont take it to heart.\nAdel's advice was no lie. However, the Karmis family exceeded Shirone's expectations in a different way. Were they pleasant yet quirky?\n\"When did you meet Amy? You're dating, right? Huh? Do you hold hands at school too?\"\n\"Uh? No, that's not...\"\nShirone stalled for time. Here, Amy's opinion mattered most, so it was best to be reserved.\n\"What's all the fuss about? Why are you gathering around without the person involved?\"\nAmy's voice descended from the upper floor, saving Shirone, who was on the verge of collapse. She was looking down from the spiral staircase on the second floor.\nAres, the second son, spoke with a wiggle of his beard.\n\"Oh? You changed clothes? When Shirone arrived, you ran to your room in a frenzy.\"\nAmy preemptively cleared any misunderstandings.\n\"So what? Should I meet him in my pajamas? Anyway, disperse everyone. Dad, is it okay if I talk with my friend?\"\n\"Sure, why not? Isn't he the first boyfriend you've brought home? Do whatever you need to, so you won't regret it later. That's the Karmis way. Hahaha!\"\nEven with Shakora's teasing joke, Amy didn't bat an eyelid. It was crucial not to give them an opening, as they'd relentlessly dig deeper.\nAs Shirone ascended the spiral staircase, Isis continued her questioning.\n\"Amy, tell me the truth. He's your boyfriend, right? You're dating, right? Huh?\"\nAmy hurried her steps, ignoring the voice. But her mother, who had passed down her blood, was just as persistent.\n\"Come on, talk to me. What's your relationship? You're dating, right? Right?\"\n\"Ugh!\"\nUnable to hold back, Amy yelled sharply and headed to her room.\nIsis stood with her mouth agape. Even Shakora seemed surprised, looking up the staircase.\nBut by then, the two had already disappeared from sight.\nEntering the room, Shirone and Amy sat awkwardly across a table.\nShirone first surveyed the room. The library was filled with magic books, and in a corner out of sight were a few unread romance novels.\n'Haha! Those must be from Senior Sharelle.'\nAt school, she was known as a tough woman, but her room was surprisingly feminine. Especially the large stuffed animal on the bed caught his eye a fierce-looking bear.\n\"There's a stuffed animal. And it's a bear.\"\n\"So what? Can't I have a stuffed animal in my room?\"\n\"No, I just thought it looked like you. Haha!\"\nAmy clicked her tongue and closed her mouth. Honestly, she was at a loss for words. It was the first time she had shown her room to a man other than her family.\n\"But are you really okay? We might pretend to be dating at school, but there's no need to lie to your family.\"\n\"Don't worry about it. They probably won't care anyway. They're just having fun with it.\"\nTrue to Amy's words, her family was free-spirited and unique. However, Shirone could faintly sense that they were connected by a hidden family love.\n\"Enough with the nonsense. Why suddenly visit my house? Do you have something to say?\"\n\"Actually, that's...\"\nAs Shirone started to speak, the door slid open. Isis's face sneaked in through the narrow gap.\n\"Oh dear, did I interrupt something? You should have some tea while talking.\"\nIsis gracefully moved to the table and set down the tea, her eyes fixated on Shirone.\nAs Shirone tried to speak again, the door opened once more, this time revealing Daian.\n\"I brought some snacks...\"\nDaian's gaze also lingered on Shirone. Walking forward while his head was turned sideways made for a comical scene.\nAmy sighed. Such a thing had never happened before, so it must have been amusing for them.\nHer brothers, usually indifferent to anything but extraordinary events, had never had her boyfriend visit the house.\n\"Fine. Everyone come in. I know you're all waiting outside.\"\nUpon Amy's command, feet pushed the door open. Ares stood there, holding a plate of fruit.\n\"There were some fruits... Haha.\"\n\"Come in already. Might as well introduce him properly now. Shirone, is that okay?\"\n\"Ah, of course.\"\nAnd so, the Karmis family, except Shakora, all sat opposite Shirone.\n\"This is Shirone, a promising student from the Alpheas Magic Academy. And Shirone, this is my mother. She was a dancer in her youth.\"\n\"I see. No wonder she's so beautiful.\"\n\"Hohoho! Amy takes after me. But don't fall for me. I don't want to hurt my daughter.\"\n\"Ah, yes.\"\nShirone nodded in agreement. There really was nothing else he could say.\n\"And this is my older brother, Daian. He's a Grade-5 Swordsman and commands the archer unit in the capital. He's here to consult Dad on some political matters.\"\nAs Amy finished, the family looked at her surprisingly.\nEven for a boyfriend, there was no need to mention internal family matters. It was proof that she, too, was inwardly tense.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 122: New Meetings (2)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\n\"Hehe, so this boy makes my daughter nervous? The unshakable Amy of the Karmis family.\"\nAlthough the Karmis family was known for its open-mindedness, Amy's personality was exceptionally bold. It wasn't just her noble status that allowed her to subdue gangs since her childhood.\nHer brothers seemed to think the same as they stared intently at Shirone. They felt a twinge of jealousy, thinking that their sister, who never listened to them, was now paying attention to an outsider.\n\"Here is Ares, my second older brother. And what he does is...\"\nAmy, seemingly curious, asked instead.\n\"What exactly do you do, brother?\"\n\"Hahaha! I'm an explorer. I excavate ruins and create maps while traveling through uncharted territories. My notable works include the Dragon's Nest in the Alphones Mountains and the Crystal Caves at the northern limit of the Corona Kingdom.\"\n\"Ah, I see. I know about the Alphones Mountains.\"\nKnown as a habitat for various dragons, the Alphones Mountains were filled with danger and adventure, often featured in literary works.\nRian had once mentioned while reading a novel titled 'Knight of the Dragon', that he wanted to visit the Alphones Mountains.\n\"That's really impressive. I heard it's a very dangerous place.\"\n\"There's always a risk in romance. I'm satisfied with my job. The pay is good if I succeed in mapmaking. Amy seems to dislike it, though.\"\n\"Just shave that beard for once. You're not unemployed, yet you lock yourself up at home and don't go out for months.\"\n\"Don't be too harsh. Anyway, I'll be joining an expedition team and won't be back for two years. I've been waiting to see my beloved sister's face till now.\"\n\"Hmph...\"\nAmy turned her head away, dismissing the idea. Shirone chuckled. Despite her complaints about him being unemployed, she was actually worried about her adventurous brother.\nFamily members couldn't help but worry when his adventures often took more than a year, leaving them uncertain about his life or death.\n\"Still, I think it's cool. I'd love to go on such an adventure someday.\"\n\"Once you get into it, you can't get out. Its something ordinary people cant experience in their lifetime. Come find me after you graduate. I'll get you into an expedition team.\"\n\"Oh, stop it! Stop filling his head with ideas and leave if the introductions are done.\"\nAs Amy dismissed them, her family began bombarding them with questions. The interesting part was just beginning, and they couldn't possibly leave without starting it, could they?\n\"But what about Amy do you like? You didn't cross the line set by the adults, did you?\"\n\"Uh? No, that's not...\"\n\"What's your approach with Amy? She's not easy to deal with. Did you sweet-talk her? Or did you man up and sneak a kiss in a secluded place?\"\nAmy's eyes blazed red.\n\"Didn't I tell you to leave?\"\nIn a rush, the room was suddenly empty except for Amy. They had fled so hastily that the door was still shaking.\n'I guess that's her personality at home.'\nThe contrast to the previous chaos was stark with the room now eerily quiet.\nHaving missed his chance to speak, Shirone awkwardly looked around the room, feeling embarrassed.\nAmy, pretending to drink her tea, hid her face and fell into thought. The awkwardness was enough to make her sweat.\n'Why the hell did this guy come?'\nShe had nothing to say. Even if there was an important matter, Shirone coming to her house was totally unexpected.\n\"What? If you've come, speak up! You didn't come just because you're bored.\"\nShirone shifted his gaze from the scenery back to Amy.\n\"Ah, actually, I have a favor to ask. But now that I'm here without prior notice, I feel it's rude. I apologize to your family.\"\n\"It's fine. What's so bad about visiting a friend's house? But what's this favor you mentioned?\"\n\"Do you... have time to hang out? Like going to Galiant Island?\"\nAmy froze, still holding her teacup. The suggestion was beyond her expectations and imagination. Shirone asking to hang out first. And with a girl. To an island, no less.\n\"So, you mean, you and I should go to the island together?\"\n\"Actually, there's this friend, Rian. He suggested it first. He said he's bringing a friend along, so I need a friend to accompany me too. So, it's going to be the four of us.\"\n\"Ho? Is this friend Rian is bringing... a girl?\"\n\"It seems so. Huh? How did you know?\"\nAmy swallowed her tea without responding, quickly processing the situation in her mind.\n'So it's basically a couple's trip. That sneaky Rian. Wait, a couple's trip?'\nA cold sweat ran down Amy's back.\n'He's taking me there? Why?'\nShirone, who had been unmoved even during their pretend relationship, suddenly proposing a couple's trip was baffling. If it was just to make up numbers, he wouldn't have asked her.\nThe Advanced Class, being the final competition of the magic academy, required intensive study even during holidays.\nKnowing this better than anyone, Shirone must have had a special reason to come to her house and ask for this favor.\n\"What's the reason for taking me? You have friends in the Advanced Class, right? You know I'm in the advanced class, right? And how much other advanced class students train during the holidays. Then why me, of all people?\"\nAmy asked the question but was afraid of the answer. It couldn't possibly be what she was thinking.\nYet, it could be. Her hand trembled slightly as she brought the teacup to her lips.\n\"Amy, I can't think of anyone but you.\"\n\"Pffft!\"\nAmy spat out all the tea she was drinking. Shirone, sprayed with the tea, had a dazed expression like someone caught in a sudden shower.\n\"What are you even saying all of a sudden! You idiot, dummy!\"\nAmy yelled as she wiped her mouth with her sleeve. Her face red as a persimmon, she hurriedly left her seat to fetch a towel.\n\"Clean yourself up with this! It's disgusting, really!\"\n\"...You're the one who spat on my face. Anyway, continuing our conversation, do you remember Miro, whom I mentioned before?\"\n\"Miro? The founder of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group? You said you met her during the Immortal Function, right?\"\n\"Right. I have a hypothesis that the Immortal Function is related to superluminal speed. So, I wanted to learn more about her. The headmaster said it would be okay to investigate the Kergos Ruins, so I was thinking of going there since Rian suggested it.\"\nAmy finally regained her composure. The Kergos Ruins on Galiant Island were a famous site and tourist attraction.\n\"Aha, so you want to investigate it together?\"\n\"I don't think it will be dangerous. But from what the headmaster said, it's not just a simple tourist spot. I would feel more at ease if you came along.\"\nSince Rian proposed a double date, the partner had to be female. But even apart from that, Amy was the strongest person Shirone knew among his friends.\nHer unique abilities as a Red-Eye were a tremendous advantage, but her skills honed through daily competition with strong opponents had firmly placed her in the middle rank of the graduation class. She was capable of navigating any danger.\n\"Hmph! Of course! I'm in a different league than those supernatural whatever kids.\"\n\"No, I didn't mean it that way, but anyway.\"\nShirone awkwardly smiled, trying to smooth over the situation. Amy knew too well that Shirone wasn't the type to drag a friend into something just because they were strong.\nShirone had saved Amy from falling off a cliff. That special incident had strengthened the trust between them.\nThat's why he could ask her. Requesting her companionship despite knowing the risks was because of the bond they shared, having risked their lives together.\n\"So, that's what it is\"\nAmy walked over to the window, lost in thought. The trip wasn't just the two of them, so there was no pressure. In fact, she was rather excited to go.\nThere would be much to gain from this trip, but more than that, doing something with Shirone seemed fun.\n'That kid, he does have an eye for things. Alright, I owe him one, so this time I'll do him a favor.'\nAmy slowly turned around. Seeing Shirone's anxious face waiting for her response, she couldn't help but smirk.\nRegardless of the trip's purpose, it was essentially taking a girl out overnight. Even if it was coated in sweet words, no girl would follow if the guy looked as tense as he did.\n'He hasn't changed a bit since he was twelve.'\nWhen will this kid grow up? Maybe all his growth energy was focused on magic.\nAmy nodded cheerfully.\n\"Okay, let's go to the island.\"\n\"Hello! I'm Tess, a friend of Rian!\"\nTess greeted everyone heartily at the Ogent household. Next to her, Rian stood with a nervous look.\nThe reason Rian had been holed up at Shirone's house was to use Tess as a shield to storm his family home.\nNo parents would easily let their child, who came last in the swordsmanship academy, relax.\nBut it was different with a friend, especially if that friend was the top student and a model pupil from the swordsmanship academy. It was calculated to work.\n\"Hmm, I've heard about the fame of the Elzain house. How is your father doing?\"\n\"He practices his sword every day without fail, even when he's stationed in the occupied territories.\"\nIn truth, Tess didn't know or care how her father was doing.\nBut Rian's father, Bischoff, nodded as if it made sense.\n\"As expected of someone who made a name with the sword. I shall pay him a visit if I get a chance.\"\nTess's father, Elzain Baron, was a master swordsman known as 'The Flash'.\nIf Ogent swordsmanship was brutal, Elzain's was chilling and sharp.\nWhich was superior depended on the wielder, but the pride in maintaining the tradition of the sword was incomparable.\n\"Rian, unlike you, you've found a fine girl.\"\n\"We're not dating. Shes a friend.\"\nTess shot a sharp glance at Rian. But what could she do? Thirsty people dig wells, and to go on this trip with Rian, she had to endure.\n\"So, you want to go to Galiant Island for a vacation?\"\n\"Yeah. I thought I was going to die at the swordsmanship academy. I need time to recover physically and mentally. Oh, Shirone will be coming later too. We're leaving from here. Can I go?\"\n\"It's fine for you to go, but did you really work hard? Even with private tutoring, you never listened, so it's hard to believe.\"\n\"Haha! I thought you might say that, so I brought this. I finally opened my Schema!\"\nRian proudly presented his proof. Though the report card was taken by Reina, he had the certificate of passing the muscle strength test.\nAlthough it was essentially useless paper since the placebo effect was revealed, Bischoff had no choice but to believe it, not knowing the whole story.\n\"Hmm, you really passed. Congratulations.\"\nBischoff remained stoic as usual, but his voice trembled slightly.\nEvery parent worries more about their unsuccessful child. To have achieved Schema, which he had struggled to succeed in, Bischoff must have been clenching his fists with pride.\n\"Now, keep your promise. The sword Grandfather said he'd give me once I mastered Schema, I can take it now, right?\"\n\"Of course. Now that you've opened your Schema, you should start learning the Ogent swordsmanship. But where is your report card? You seem confident, so it must be good.\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 123: New Meetings (3)\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\n\"Ah... the report card? Reina has it.\"\n\"Reina? Why? Bring it here.\"\n\"I don't know. She snatched it away, saying she'd show it to Grandfather. How would I know what that witch is thinking? Just give me the sword already. I've wanted it since I was a kid and worked so hard for it.\"\nThe sword Rian desperately wanted was a straight sword specialized for the Ogent family's swordsmanship. It was a greatsword, twice as heavy as ordinary longswords, and its blade was so long that it couldn't be wielded properly without a considerable height.\nRian had set his sights on the Ogent family's straight sword since he began learning swordsmanship. The particular sword he had marked as his own was one that Grandfather Klumph Ogent had used personally.\nKlumph had always wanted to pass the sword on to Rian. Reina and Rian inherited the Azure Hair among his grandchildren, but since Reina was female, Klumph believed Rian was the only one fit to wield his sword.\n\"The sword is in Grandfather's room. But why are you looking for a sword all of a sudden if you're going on a trip? Tess might have her reasons for coming from afar, but still.\"\n\"I have my reasons. Anyway, I'll go get it now.\"\nRian sprinted up to his grandfather's room. The sword was more than Rian could handle without mastering Schema, but he was determined to take it on this trip.\nShirone was clearly intent on exploring the ruins. If Shirone were to rush into danger, wouldn't it be Rian's duty to protect him?\n'This is the Great Straight Sword of the Ogent family.'\nRian gazed in awe at the greatsword hanging in his grandfather's room. The very essence of the Ogent spirit was contained in this form, said to be too challenging to wield without unlocking Schema.\nOf course, Schema was still out of reach for him now. Yet, Rian managed to lift the sword with one hand and brought it in front of him.\n'It's heavy, but not so much that I can't swing it.'\nRian felt a sting when he was diagnosed with a so-called \"Imaginary Schema.\" But true to his never-give-up nature, he took it positively.\nWhether he had Schema or not, he had passed the physical strength test. He might need to unlock Schema eventually, but for now, he could manage.\nThe sword was too heavy to carry in a metal scabbard, so Rian used a net-like scabbard made of cowhide and slung it on his back.\nThis attire would surely attract attention, but carrying a sword wasn't illegal, so it didn't matter.\nExcept for specific zones designated by the city, anyone could carry a sword as long as they adhered to certain rules: commoners in Sector Level C, nobles in Sector Level B, and royalty in Sector Level A.\nRian proudly descended the stairs with the Great Straight Sword on his back. However, he didn't get the chance to draw attention to himself.\nButler Louis opened the door and announced, \"Lord, Master Shirone has arrived.\"\nShirone, who entered the hall with Amy, first greeted Bischoff.\nDespite his stern and reticent exterior, Bischoff was a family man who had even taken leave from work to be home when his son was visiting.\nShirone also respected him as a guardian who had helped him attend the magic academy, ensuring that not only his school life but also his parents' livelihood was well taken care of.\n\"Hello. I hope you've been well.\"\n\"Yes, I've heard you're doing well.\"\n\"I've been promoted to Class Four recently. It's all thanks to your help. Thank you.\"\nBischoff smiled wryly, recalling Rian's past. Class Four, huh? How immense must one's talent be to enter Class Four within half a year of enrolling in the magic academy?\nOf course, he wasn't the type of parent to compare his children. He was just concerned that as a knight and a swordsman, Rian might not live up to Shirone's standards.\n\"It's all because of your hard work. Anyway, it seems worthwhile to have supported you. I heard Rian is going on a trip with a beautiful lady without knowing the first thing about it. Are you going too?\"\n\"Yes, we've decided to go together.\"\n\"And the lady beside you, is she your partner?\"\nBischoff's gaze shifted to the red-haired girl. She seemed familiar but he couldn't quite place her.\n\"Hello. I'm Amy Karmis.\"\nBischoff's eyes lit up. Rian, Tess, and even Butler Louis looked at Amy with curiosity.\nThe Karmis family, though not the most authoritative in the kingdom, was a first-class noble family known for its liberal nature and the talent of the Red-Eyes, which was recognized not just in the kingdom but across the continent.\nTheir achievements, not limited to any one nation, were what truly defined them.\nBischoff also did not believe that the nobility hierarchy necessarily reflected a family's power. There were plenty of nobles who climbed to high ranks through all sorts of flattery and underhanded methods.\nSuch individuals disregard authenticity and even change their family traditions for the sake of advancement. However, families like the Elzains and Karmises were of a different class altogether.\nAuthenticity is established only through conviction. Their pride, having chosen a single path since the kingdom's foundation, could not be bought with money or power.\n\"Alright, alright. Let's save the talk for later and head out. We need to leave now to catch the boat on time!\"\nRian lightened the mood. Although he had received Bischoff's permission, his anxiety hadn't eased.\nBy now, an express post sent by Reina would be flying toward them like an arrow.\nThe moment the report card was revealed, heaven would turn into hell, which was a certainty.\n\"Dad, I'll be off then. It'll take about ten days.\"\n\"Alright. You've worked hard in your training, so have fun. Oh, and use this for your expenses.\"\nBischoff tossed a heavy pouch of gold coins. Rian was shocked upon looking inside. It was the first time he had received so much money from his father.\nIn fact, Bischoff was pleased. He thought he had failed his son when he took the knight's oath, but Rian had not only unlocked Schema but also made good friends.\nMoreover, Shirone, who would become Rian's master, was growing steadily based on his remarkable talent.\nIf training is considered an investment for real battles, isn't it only right to pay half a year's wages?\nRian felt guilty, but even such feelings were a luxury at the moment. The only thought filling his mind was to escape the house alive.\n\"Got it. I'll be back with my friends. Oh, Temuran, could you have a carriage ready to take us to the harbor?\"\n\"Understood. Have a pleasant trip.\"\nTemuran bid Rian farewell with a sympathetic look. The mere act of fleeing, drenched in cold sweat, was enough to guess the situation.\n'I can only hold on for 10 minutes. Good luck, young master.'\nTemuran focused on the envelope in his pocket. It was the express post from Reina that had just arrived from the capital.\nDue to the busyness of the household staff, there wasn't a single leisure carriage available. There was a private carriage, but it would take an hour just to fit the saddle and prepare it.\nRian insisted that they didn't need to bother with such preparations, but he had to agree to at least check the tightening of the carriage wheels. If there were an accident, the carriage manager would bear all the blame.\nThe four waited near the stables for the carriage to arrive.\nFor a while, there was no conversation. It was a common occurrence when people meet for the first time. However, inside, numerous analyses were taking place.\nTess first scrutinized Shirone. Knowing he was a mage aspirant, she had imagined a hot-blooded young man because of Rian's knightly oath. But upon meeting him, he was surprisingly tender and composed.\nAmy of the Karmis family also intrigued her. The Karmises, known as the stars of the continent, made her wonder about their personalities.\nEventually, Tess broke the silence, thinking that there should be no awkwardness at least inside the carriage.\n\"Shall we introduce ourselves? I'm Tess Elzain.\"\n\"I'm Amy Karmis. Nice to meet you.\"\n\"Ah, I'm Shirone Arian.\"\nTess exchanged handshakes with Shirone too. But upon hearing his surname, she tilted her head in confusion.\nBeing from the Elzain family, which specialized in diplomacy, she knew nearly all the noble families. However, she had never even heard of the Arian family.\n\"Ah, Arian, huh? Um... is your family based in Creas?\"\nTess asked circumspectly, trying not to offend. Shirone openly shared his background.\n\"Ah, I don't have a family estate. I'm a commoner.\"\n\"A commoner?\"\nTess's eyes widened in shock. Initially, she thought he might be joking out of nervousness. Otherwise, why would Rian make a knightly oath to a commoner?\nTess turned to Amy. The lack of reaction indicated she was aware of this, too.\n'What's going on? What is Rian thinking? And why Amy? How could someone from the Karmis family accompany a commoner as a partner? Isn't this a couple's trip?'\nUnfamiliar with Shirone, Tess was understandably confused. Rian's decision struck her even more strongly.\nEven if Shirone possessed great abilities, it's not easy to disregard social status.\nEspecially not just any friend, but a knightly oath requiring lifelong service to the master.\n'In a way... it's very like Rian.'\nAs Tess struggled to find a response, Shirone spoke up first.\n\"Sorry. If it's uncomfortable, maybe...\"\n\"No, no, it's my fault for being rude. I was just so surprised I didn't know what to say. But... am I the weird one here? Everyone's so calm, making me feel like the bad one, haha!\"\nTess quickly defused the situation. Whether commoner or noble, Shirone was Rian's lord. She felt she couldn't afford to treat him lightly.\n'Tess, you're a person of integrity.'\nShirone could sense what kind of person Tess was. It was indeed like someone Rian would choose.\nMaking others laugh at her own expense required genuine kindness.\n\"Thanks for saying that. I've heard a lot about you. Rian's girlfriend, they say.\"\n\"What, me? Really? Do we look like a couple? Do we match that well? Haha!\"\nTess began to like Shirone. Meanwhile, Rian's face flushed red. It was a misunderstanding he had to clear up, but he kept quiet because he liked that Tess was being nice to Shirone.\nAmy looked at Rian in surprise. Initially, she wondered what kind of schemer had planned this trip, but he turned out to be more straightforward and considerate than expected.\n'The Ogent family, known for establishing themselves solely through swordsmanship. I heard there's a genius among the black-haired ones, but this one has azure hair.'\nThe nobility rank was second-class, not royal, but that was due to their stubborn and uncompromising nature.\nSuch families are called 'pure' in political circles.\nA term denoting neutrality, it doesn't significantly impact politics in peacetime.\nHowever, in times of national crisis, where the pure's allegiance lies can change the political landscape, making them a force that cannot be underestimated.\nAs Amy pondered this, Tess observed Shirone and Amy.\nBoth had charming appearances and a spark of intelligence in their eyes. Even without knowing their real characters, they seemed to share a similar stubbornness.\n\"So, what's the relationship between you two? You really do seem to match. Are you a couple?\"\nTess pointed back and forth between the two, prompting Amy to bristle slightly. It felt as if they were being matched up like small kids of similar stature.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 124: New Meetings (4)\nWE TRIED TRANSLATIONS\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nDiscord:\nhttps://dsc.gg/wetried\nINFINITE MAGE\nIndeed, Tess had a physique that could match the bulky Rian, with long limbs and a tall stature, giving her a deep waistline.\nIn contrast, Shirone was unmistakably a mage. He was of average height and on the thinner side compared to his peers.\nOf course, physical beauty wasn't the entirety of one's charm, but it was inevitable to feel inferior in front of Tess's imposing presence, who stood a head taller.\n\"No, we're just friends too. She's especially coming along at my request.\"\n\"Ah, I see.\"\nTess didn't quite believe it. The fact that a girl from the first-class nobility was accompanying a commoner as his partner was enough to hint at an extraordinary affection.\nRian thought the same. In fact, his biggest concern while planning this trip was if Shirone couldn't find a partner due to his status and introverted personality, which could potentially hurt him.\nBut to his surprise, even Shirone, who seemed indifferent to girls, brought along a stunningly beautiful girl.\nRian always believed that a girl should evoke a protective instinct, like Amy did with her adorable charm.\nIn contrast, Tess was someone who surpassed him in skill, so it was impossible to feel romantic towards her.\nEven if it was just due to her Schema ability, few men are attracted to women stronger than themselves.\n'Give it your best, Shirone. I'll actively support you.'\nWhile Rian was strategizing, the prepared carriage arrived. The four gathered their belongings and headed towards the carriage.\nThat's when it happened.\n\"You brat! Rian~!\"\nA tremendous decibel voice spread from the mansion. The murderous intent carried by the voice alone was enough for Rian to realize everything was exposed.\n\"Damn it! Run, everyone!\"\n\"What? What about the carriage?\"\n\"If we ride, we'll be too late! Look back! We must jump over the fence at all costs!\"\nThe three looked back towards the mansion. A towering whirlwind of yellow dust was approaching them.\nWithout fully grasping the situation, Shirone and his companions started running.\n\"Rian! What's happening?\"\n\"Damn! The report card must have arrived! I actually came last! Dad's going to kill us!\"\n\"Really? Like, actually kill? Let's just tell the truth and leave. What is this, running away for a vacation?\"\n\"Feel free to try if you're so confident. I'm running. Just so you know, my dad's a certified Grade-4 Swordsman.\"\nThe color drained from the faces of the three. Tess activated her Schema and dashed forward, with Amy following closely.\nShirone, lagging behind, felt his heart pounding. He was running forward, yet the wind blew from behind.\nPushing through the air at such speed meant Bischoff was surpassing human limits.\n\"Rian! We're going to get caught!\"\n\"We have no choice! I'll sacrifice myselft! You guys go ahead and have fun on the island!\"\nIf anyone could pull it off, it was Rian. But leaving friends behind for a vacation was out of the question. Amidst the chaos, Shirone thought of a solution.\n\"Amy! Let's use Teleportation! Rian, don't move!\"\nShirone grabbed Rian and cast a Photonization spell. Their bodies flashed brightly and then shot forward as beams of light.\nExperiencing Teleportation for the first time, Rian felt dizzy. His vision narrowed to an extreme, making it feel like all scenery was rushing towards him.\nIt was the perspective of a mage.\nAmy, understanding Shirone's instructions, grabbed Tess and cast Teleportation.\nTwo streaks of light dashed across the garden at incredible speeds. It was a dangerous situation where they could crash into any obstacle and shatter, but Shirone and Amy didn't allow for any mistakes.\nThinking they had gotten far enough, Shirone looked back. But he had to grit his teeth, holding back tears, as the whirlwind had closed in even more.\nIt was tearing through everything in its path, obstructions and all.\nNaturally, the image of the Great Straight Sword, the symbol of the Ogent family, came to mind.\n\"Amy! This way!\"\nShirone screeched to a halt in the middle of a dense forest and called out. Amy then canceled a turn to close the distance to Shirone.\nThe destructive whirlwind was 100 meters away, tearing through the forest.\nTess stomped her feet in frustration and yelled.\n\"What now? Are we just going to get caught?\"\n\"Hold on to me! We're going to fly!\"\nShirone expanded the radius of his Spirit Zone as much as possible. It wasn't enough to escape the garden, but there was one way.\nIf they couldn't outrun the speed, they could disappear from their coordinates momentarily.\n\"Here we go!\"\nShirone used Synesthesia to search for a safe location as his friends gathered. He hadn't expected to use a spell he thought he wouldn't need for a while in such a practical situation so soon.\nTargeting the outskirts of the forest, he cast Spatial Warp, and their bodies ignited into light before being sucked into the sky.\nSimultaneously, a tremendous wind swept in, carrying shadows with it, erasing their presence as it passed where they stood.\nBischoff clenched his hand that failed to catch Rian, regretting the missed opportunity by a hair's breadth.\n\"Damn it...\"\nPivoting 180 degrees, Bischoff braked with both legs, sliding across the ground as if on ice, pushing back for several meters.\nA mound of earth, weighing twenty times his body weight, rose behind his heels, showcasing the immense physical force his body contained.\nBischoff looked back at the path he had charged down with a heavy heart. The ground was churned up, and trees were snapped randomly.\nAll of this chaos was because of Rian, who dared to deceive his father.\n\"Imaginary Schema?\"\nHe trembled as he pulled out the report card. The more he thought about it, the more sighs it drew from him.\nYet, on the other hand, he felt a pang of sympathy for his inept son. How much training must he have undergone to possess strength akin to Schema?\n\"I suppose it's a consolation prize.\"\nBut then, Shirone had already mastered Spatial Warp, a feat challenging even for professionals, marking incredible progress for just half a year.\nShirone and Rian. Rian and Shirone. Bischoff contemplated the intertwined fates of the two boys.\nDespite their vastly different talents and dispositions, perhaps the steps they took were equally named 'best effort'?\n\"This will make a fine memory, too.\"\nDiscarding the report card over his shoulder, Bischoff headed back to the mansion.\nHaving vaulted over the Ogent estate's fence, Shirone and his companions exerted themselves to leave the noble district.\nThanks to the Spatial Warp, they had escaped Bischoff's anticipated coordinates, but they couldn't yet relax.\nA Schema master's movement, boasting a nearly animalistic range, couldn't be easily escaped with mere Teleportation.\nOnly upon reaching the bustling streets did Shirone and his companions catch their breath, still vividly recalling Bischoff's face.\nThough they doubted he would harm his son, the approaching whirlwind suggested he was capable of more severe actions.\nShirone sighed, \"What do we do now? We've come this far, so there's no turning back.\"\n\"It doesn't matter, right? We've got plenty of travel money. Let's rent a carriage to the harbor.\"\nRian feared nothing but his father. Though retribution was inevitable, gloomy thoughts had no place with an enjoyable trip ahead.\nThey reached a stable on the city outskirts, offering horses for sale and transport services, hiring drivers to destinations.\nWith the ship's departure time looming, Rian hastily rented a four-seater carriage available for immediate departure.\nRian and Tess sat side by side, with Shirone and Amy facing them. The interior, meant for commoners, was cramped, forcing them to sit closely.\nThe carriage set off amidst an awkward atmosphere, but the cool breeze through the window soon eased the tension.\nTess fanned herself, observing Shirone. Though unfamiliar with magic, she understood the difficulty of escaping a dense forest via Teleportation, confirming Shirone's significant magical prowess.\nYet, merely excelling in magic wasn't enough to warrant a knightly oath from Rian, considering the abundance of skilled nobles, leaving her doubts unresolved.\n\"What was that second spell? It felt odd for Teleportation.\"\n\"Oh, that was Spatial Warp. It might have felt disorienting because it bends space along the time axis.\"\n\"What? That was Spatial Warp?\"\nTess was astonished. Even among her friends attending magic schools, none had mastered Spatial Warp.\nIt wasn't a matter of mere theoretical knowledge; it required immense mental fortitude and could only be conquered with time and effort.\n\"That's impressive. Did you come across some fortune? Not to belittle, but Spatial Warp is usually reserved for professionals. Isn't it tough without studying magic from a young age?\"\nTess assumed Shirone had entered the magical world through some childhood fortune, as there seemed no other way for a commoner to learn magic.\nShirone simply nodded. While half right and half wrong, he felt no need to correct the misunderstanding as it wasn't a significant issue.\n\"Right. Without Rian, I couldn't have attended the magic school. The Ogent family helped me enroll.\"\n\"So that was it. But still, I think it's remarkable. Competing with nobles from a young age, not just in studies but in other aspects too, must have been taxing.\"\n\"Haha! It was at first. But it's okay now. Amy has been a great help, too.\"\n\"Hmph, what did I even do? You never told me anything.\"\nAmy snorted and turned away. Despite not showing it, she was frustrated with Shirone's modest response.\nTess seemed to doubt that Shirone, merely a commoner, had mastered advanced magic through his efforts.\nNot knowing him, her reaction was natural, but Amy disliked the assumption that Shirone's arduous journey could be dismissed as mere fortune.\nRian scratched that itchy spot for Amy.\n\"After all, it's only been half a year. Shirone has only been studying magic for that long.\"\n\"What, half a year?\"\nTess's neck nearly snapped as she turned to Rian. Even for her, this was beyond comprehension.\nIt was common knowledge among the nobility that mastering Spatial Warp in just half a year was impossible, regardless of a swordsman's perspective.\nTess discreetly glanced across. Shirone smiled, but Amy, still sulking, wouldn't even meet his gaze.\nTess then realized her mistake.\nSwordsmen and mages often have opposite natures due to their different pursuits.\nIf one speaks and listens as swordsmen do, mages infer numerous meanings between the lines. From Amy's perspective, Tess's remarks could seem demeaning to Shirone.\n\"Oh dear, I apologize. I didn't mean to upset you with my thoughtless chatter. If my partner were treated this way, I'd be furious too.\"\nAmy's face flushed. Mages might excel in language, but direct apologies like this left them defenseless as newborns.\n\"Me, what did I do? I didn't say anything. And we're not lovers, just friends.\"\nThough Amy responded curtly, her expression had softened significantly.\n\"It's natural to be unfamiliar with each other at first. Tess may be blunt, but she means no harm, so please understand. Feel free to speak your mind anytime.\"\nRian spoke straightforwardly, leaving Shirone and Amy at a loss for words.\nAccustomed to weighing and measuring their words, the swordsmen's frankness was overwhelmingly burdensome for them.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 125: The Galiant Island (1)\nTess tried hard to suppress her laughter upon noticing the suddenly quiet demeanor of the two. After being around the robust and straightforward companions from the Swordsmanship Academy, meeting students from the Magic Academy felt like she was dealing with younger siblings, despite being the same age.\n\"By the way, Amy, you're quite impressive too. When did you master your Schema?\"\n\"Before entering the Magic Academy, I had about 2 years of training.\"\n\"Wow, it's rare to master Schema at a young age. There are many who say it's not good for growth, right?\"\n\"It wasn't exactly training. It just happened somehow.\"\nFrom Amy's response, Tess understood. While Spirit Zone prodigies are common due to the mental domain, mastering Schema is challenging at a young age due to the physical strain. However, with the Red Eyes' self-recollection, it's possible to precisely control the body without undergoing rigorous training.\n\"Ah, youre using Red Eyes that way, huh? That's really cool.\"\n\"It's nothing great, really. It's just a bit of enhanced strength without any build. Compared to you, it's child's play. You were really fast earlier. If the acceleration had continued, we wouldn't have been able to cast Teleportation in time.\"\n\"Ah, well, I'm a specialist, but you're a mage, right? And besides, Rian still hasn't mastered his Schema yet. Now I see why the Karmis family is famous across the continent.\"\nShirone, surprised, turned to look at Rian.\n\"Rian, you haven't learned Schema? Then what about chopping wood at my house? I thought you were using Schema because you didn't say anything.\"\n\"Hahaha! Did Rian do that? According to Teacher Kuan, it's just stupidly strong muscles. You should have seen him at the Swordsmanship Academy during the final exam\"\n\"Ah, really! Why are you so interested in other people's private lives?\"\nRian hurriedly cut her off. He didn't mind others knowing, but he definitely didn't want Shirone to find out.\nThe atmosphere lightened thanks to the interruption, and everyone started sharing stories from their school life. Despite being in different fields, they were all students, which kept the conversation flowing endlessly.\nThis way, they were getting to know each other better.\n***\nUpon arriving at the Creas Harbor, Shirone and his companions looked for a ship heading to Galiant Island.\nA large ship docked at Dock No. 6 was ready to set sail, with its sails unfurled.\nSince all the kingdom's schools were on break around the same time, there were more tourists than usual. Swept up by the crowd, Shirone found a spot on the third deck.\nAlthough there were passenger rooms below, it was their first time on a ship, so they wanted to enjoy the scenery along the way.\nThe crashing waves and salty wind welcomed them. It was only after the harbor disappeared below the horizon that they truly felt adrift at sea.\n\"How long will it take?\"\n\"I heard it's about a 5-hour journey by ship from Creas Harbor.\"\n\"I see. We could have had to leave tomorrow if we were a bit late. There are more people heading to the island than I thought.\"\nAs Shirone mentioned, the deck was bustling with people. Half were merchants, but there were also tourists dressed as nobles, and quite a few from places besides Creas.\n\"It seems Rian was right; the island is famous. I wonder what it's like?\"\n\"I've done some research.\"\nAmy, now comfortable with everyone, pulled out a notebook, eager to share. Tess, feeling more at ease, spoke without reservation.\n\"Oho? As expected, very thorough.\"\n\"Indeed. I didn't even think to look it up.\"\nShirone awkwardly scratched his head, which made Amy glare at him disapprovingly.\n\"Didn't you say you were going to explore the ruins? You didn't do any preliminary research?\"\n\"Haha! Well, that's\"\nThere are two types of travelers: those who leave spontaneously and those who meticulously research before departing.\nThe former seeks the romance of the unknown, while the latter values efficiency. Amy belonged to the latter group.\nHowever, Shirone didn't fit into either category. It was his first trip, and everything was new and exciting.\n\"Let me tell you about Galiant Island, where we're heading. Its area is 1,500 square kilometers. The island is crescent-shaped, with a natural cliff on the north side, so ships must dock at the harbor on the south. The west side has residential areas and resorts mixed together, and the Kergos Ruins are on the east side of the island. The Kergos Ruins are ancient temples built by the Kergos people, who had a civilization 2,000 years ago.\"\n\"The Kergos people?\"\n\"Yes. They're extinct now, but a few indigenous people still live in a self-governing district in the center of the island. They're generally dark-skinned, short, with sunken eyes and small pupils. Oh, and they have tattoos praising Ankhara on their faces.\"\n\"Who's Ankhara?\"\n\"The name of an ancient god worshiped by the Kergos people. And, um the indigenous people chew a tough root called Ruph, which causes hallucinations. They call Ruph 'the awakening agent of the gods' and used it for divine communion in a trance. The cause of their civilization's downfall is known to be religious conflicts, but some believe internal strife arose from excessive Ruph use.\"\n\"Interesting. A hallucinogen led to the downfall of a civilization.\"\n\"Abused under the name of a god, most likely. Right, my brother said the site managers are mostly Kergos people, so we'll be able to see them. However, we can't enter the indigenous self-governing district since it's off-limits to outsiders. Oh, but my brother\"\n\"Yes? What did your brother say?\"\nShirone asked, curious. The brother Amy mentioned was likely Ares, the explorer. Having traveled the world, he was likely well-informed about the Kergos Ruins.\n\"He said this: 'The downfall of a civilization is not for scholars to decide. If you wish to know more about them, you must offer something more valuable than the entrance fee.'\"\nShirone nodded thoughtfully.\n\"Hmm, does that mean there's something even more incredible in the self-governing district than in the Kergos Ruins?\"\n\"It's not certain. My brother always talks like that. He thinks he seems more mysterious by being cryptic.\"\n\"Haha! I do find this more exciting. Something more valuable than the entrance fee. What could it be?\"\nShirone's heart raced with excitement. Both from Alpheas and Ares's words, it was clear the Kergos Ruins were more than just a tourist spot.\nAs Shirone could barely contain his excitement like a child, Rian was pleased for a different reason. With his lord full of enthusiasm, the duty of a guardian knight became even more significant. Regardless of the secrets hidden within the ruins, Rian was determined to protect Shirone at all costs.\n\"Shirone, when do you plan to visit? We're not going straight there upon arrival, right?\"\n\"Yeah, we should have fun first since it's a vacation.\"\n\"Then we should find accommodation first. Let's head to the resort area once we disembark at the harbor. There's a place on the west beach where we can swim. It's full of sights to see and famous seafood restaurants.\"\nEager to explore the southern lands, Tess clenched her fists in excitement, trembling with anticipation.\n\"Ugh, I can't wait!\"\nThere were still over 4 hours left until arrival. But the thrill of travel quickly consumed the time, and soon the island they were longing for came into view.\n\"Wow! Look, there's Galiant Island!\"\nPassengers at the bow pointed towards the distant island and exclaimed. Responding to their calls, Shirone and his friends rushed to the front of the deck.\nThe northern cliffs of Galiant Island greeted them. The dense foliage seemed split by a sword, revealing a sheer rock face that jutted out abruptly.\nThe passengers cheered with excitement.\n\"We're finally here! It's really magnificent, isn't it?\"\n\"Wow! The water looks wonderful! I can't wait to go swimming!\"\nHowever, the merchants remained sprawled out with their goods, well aware that the harbor was on the southern side of the island, and they still had a 30-minute journey ahead to circle around.\nThe Galiant Harbor.\nThe harbor was bustling with a sea of people. Merchants disembarking from the ship and island merchants rushing towards it tangled up, creating chaos.\nRelative to the traders, tourists had no choice but to disembark later. Shirone and his group also waited for the crowd to thin before setting foot on land.\nThe warmth of the south was immediately noticeable upon disembarkation. While Creas had already entered early autumn, Galiant Island was still basking in summer.\nAfter the traders cleared out, the harbor was filled with people from other professions. They were hawkers trying to attract tourists to their stores.\n\"Come, come to Dolphin Inn! Enjoy a pleasant holiday with the cheapest lodging rates on the island! And my wife's cooking is to die for!\"\n\"Want to try authentic southern seafood? Come to our restaurant! We also have carriages ready for a comfortable journey!\"\n\"Need help with your luggage? Sturdy porters at your service!\"\nShirone and his group were overwhelmed by the cacophony of hawkers.\nThough no one had approached them directly yet, they were certainly attracting attention. Being young scored them high marks, and their high-quality clothes and weapons made them prime targets for hawkers.\nOf course, not all those eyeing them were honest merchants. Across the dock, in a back alley, a few groups engaged in less lawful ways of making money were scouting for potential victims.\n\"Hehehe, let's see who we can fleece today.\"\nA boy named Zis scanned the crowd with keen eyes. Behind him, two friends were also surveying the area.\nThe difference between these hawkers and those outside was that these boys didn't own shops. They were street urchins making money purely through their wits.\nIsland urchins differ fundamentally from their mainland counterparts. In the vast expanse of the sea, adhering to societal norms won't get you even a crumb of bread; that was their way of life.\nEspecially Zis, who had been rebellious from a young age, enduring all kinds of abuse. His pride had led to numerous beatings by nobles.\nBut those experiences now served as useful tools for making money.\n\"Wow, it's crowded today because of the holiday. Zis, we're going to make a killing today, right?\"\n\"Even so, half of them are penniless. They might look flashy, but you have to choose carefully to succeed.\"\nZis was cautious in selecting his target. However, his friends, needing to earn their daily quota, were growing impatient.\n\"Zis, hurry up and choose. Others will snatch them away.\"\n\"Alright, just wait.\"\nZis's eagle eyes swiftly scanned the harbor but stopped before completing a full sweep. A group of four peers caught his attention, especially a redhead girl who captivated him.\nEven from this distance, her distinct features made her noticeably pretty.\n\"Hey, hey, let's target that group. See? Two guys, two girls.\"\n\"Really? Even with that big guy there? And he's carrying a sword, you know. Let's just pick someone else.\"\n\"You guys, seriously. Who do you think I am? The ruler of the harbor, Lord Zis. The bigger they are, the more cowardly they tend to be. Otherwise, who in their right mind would bring a sword to a tourist spot?\"\n\"Uh, it seems risky. Don't tell me, Zis you're not falling for some girl you just saw, are you? What if he's a mercenary?\"\n\"Look, can't you tell? They're just students. Students can't lay a finger on us. We'll go in strong, so back me up. And don't grovel to nobles, no matter what. You have to dominate such kids.\"\nZis led his two friends out of the alley towards the dock. They were anxious that other hawkers might snatch their prey, but as the girl's face became clearer, all such worries vanished.\n'What's with this girl? She's gorgeous'\nFalling for a girl from afar was a natural romance for an island boy. But this was the first time he felt something beyond love, almost a reverence.\nZis quickly composed himself and approached. If he hesitated, another hawker might steal her away.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 126: The Galiant Island (2)\nShirone greeted with a smile, \"Yes, we came here for a vacation with friends.\"\nIn contrast, Amy openly frowned, having experienced the dark alleys and the underworld in her younger days, she knew why they were being approached.\n\"Looks like you're students. Which school? Must be a prestigious one, right?\"\n\"We're from Alpheas Magic Academy.\"\n\"Ah, I know that place. It's close by, so many students come here to hang out.\"\nAmy regretted revealing not just that they were students but also their school, practically inviting trouble.\n\"But you folks seem pretty built for mages.\"\n\"What? We're from Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy! We're swordsmen, so of course, we're tall, you idiot!\"\nAs Zis had anticipated, Tess snapped back. Proud of her physique, she didn't appreciate being lumped together with Rian as being 'big'.\n\"Haha! Sorry, I'm not good with words. I meant it as a compliment, but I guess you took it the wrong way.\"\nZis thought it was over. Living life on the edge for money meant not adhering to societal norms, even in front of nobility.\nEven if there were trouble, hiding for a month was usually enough, since those from across the sea wouldn't bother coming back for revenge.\n\"Anyway, welcome. I'm Zis, a local guide. Hiring me will take care of everything from tours to meals and accommodation.\"\n\"We're still discussing among ourselves. We'll think about it.\"\nShirone repeated what they had said to other hawkers who had approached them, but Zis's group was different. Having caught their weak point, they persistently pushed their services.\n\"Come on, why like this? You're from prestigious schools, so you must have money, right? We're really in need. You came here to spend money, didn't you?\"\nShirone then realized they were not just simple hawkers. Sensing the same, Rian and Tess's expressions hardened.\nMeeting the swordsmen's gaze, Zis's friends flinched and stepped back, but Zis himself didn't blink.\n'Heh, they can't do anything to us anyway.'\nZis, who had been a hawker since he was young, was well-versed in mainland information.\nAlpheas Magic Academy strictly prohibits the use of magic outside. And needless to say, Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy, which emphasizes knighthood, would not tolerate misbehavior in a tourist spot.\n\"Anyway, I'm Zis, your local guide. Hire me, and I'll take care of everything from tours to meals and accommodations.\"\n\"We haven't finished our discussion yet. We'll think about it.\"\nShirone repeated what he had said to the other hawkers.\nHowever, Zis and his crew were different. Having found their weakness, they insisted on their services persistently.\n\"Ah, why are you being like this? You're from prestigious schools, so you must have money, right? We're really in need here. You came here to spend, didn't you?\"\nShirone then realized they were not just simple hawkers. Sensing the same, Rian and Tess's expressions hardened.\nMeeting the gaze of the swordsmen, Zis's friends flinched and stepped back, but Zis himself did not blink.\n'Heh, they can't do anything to us anyway.'\nZis, who had been hawking since he was young, knew the mainland's information well.\nAlpheas Magic Academy strictly forbids the use of magic outside. And needless to say, Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy, which emphasizes knighthood, would not allow any mischief at a tourist site.\n\"Come on, trust me. I'll show you the most fun way to enjoy Galiant Island. Let's go. What kind of man lacks resolve? Splash some cash in front of these beautiful ladies. Right? You'll go, won't you? Then I'll carry your bags.\"\n\"Hold on! Let us discuss one last time.\"\n\"Phew, okay. But really, it'd be mean to refuse now after coming this far.\"\nZis was already holding the heavy bags in both hands.\nShirone looked at his friends, perplexed. This was a first for him, and Zis's attitude made it difficult to deal with him harshly.\n\"What should we do? Should we leave it to him?\"\n\"He knows our school, that's why. They know we can't act rashly, so they're acting bold.\"\nHearing Amy's words, Tess was irked. It was a mean tactic but effective. Normally, she would have already thrown a punch, but she was still holding back, which proved her point.\nMeanwhile, Rian didn't pay much attention. His only concern was Shirone's safety.\n\"I don't mind. If Shirone wants to, I'll follow. And if they insist, even if he says no, I'll just beat them up.\"\nFor Rian, this trip was not just a vacation. It was the first outing with Shirone since the knightly vow, a preparation for many such future encounters.\n\"Ah, my arms hurt. Can't you decide quickly? Even this waiting is costing money.\"\n\"That bastard!\"\nTess moved to confront Zis, but Shirone stopped her. He wanted to avoid unnecessary violence since the school's honor was at stake.\n\"Okay, we'll hire you. How much do you need?\"\n\"Haha! Good decision. I'll give you a special discount because it's you guys. Just give me 5 gold.\"\n\"5 gold?\"\nShirone's eyes widened in shock. 5 gold just to hire a guide was outrageous. The island's prices were unknown, but it seemed excessive even for an expensive place.\n\"Isn't that too expensive?\"\n\"Hey, what are you talking about? For 5 gold, you won't have to lift a finger. I'll arrange a carriage, find you meals and accommodations, and show you around. It's a bargain for that price.\"\nAmy was frustrated. They didn't want to start trouble right away, but it seemed they were being taken for a ride from the start. Even if they did provide the services, 5 gold was an inflated price, ten times the market rate.\n'Ah, I should have cut them off right from the start.'\nAmy regretted remembering past incidents. Why had she forgotten? Such types needed to be stamped down, or they would only become more demanding.\n\"But even so, 5 gold is a bit much...\"\n\"This is a tourist spot. It's natural for things to be pricier.\"\n\"Um, but still...\"\n\"Forget it. Just give it to them and let's go somewhere else.\"\nAmy rummaged through her purse. Carrying such people around would only backfire. Once they give in, they would be blackmailed for more money using their weakness.\n\"Here, take 5 gold. Take it and leave.\"\nAmy scattered the gold coins at Zis's feet. The shining gold coins bounced around his feet.\n\"Wow, gold! Real gold!\"\nZis's friends scrambled to pick up the coins that had fallen to the ground. Zis, however, remained frozen, unable to move.\nHad someone else thrown the money, he might have scrambled like his friends. But he couldn't bring himself to crawl on the ground under her disdainful gaze.\n\"What are you doing? Are we beggars or something?\"\n\"We don't need a guide or anything, so just disappear from my sight.\"\n\"Really? Is that your final answer?\"\n\"Wait a moment. Let's not get too heated...\"\nShirone tried to mediate with an awkward expression. While it was infuriating to be overcharged, Amy's aggressive response was unexpected.\n\"Shirone, it's okay. Let them come at us. What can they possibly do? They're just scammers, looking to milk more money under the guise of showing us around. They're irredeemable scum.\"\nZis's friends flinched. It was precisely the kind of business they were in.\nShirone turned away, frowning.\n\"Amy, stop it.\"\n\"What do you mean stop? They think we're avoiding them because we're scared. Wouldn't it be better to set an example here...\"\n\"Still, stop.\"\nOnly then did Amy close her mouth. Shirone, not being a noble, might have felt uncomfortable watching the earlier scene.\nBut if not handled this way, these leeches would cling on, draining them dry.\nZis clenched his teeth, holding back his anger. Pride was all he had lived on. Despite the insults from nobles, he never let it break his spirit.\n\"Zis, let's just go. We got the money.\"\n\"Give it here.\"\n\"Huh? What?\"\n\"The gold coins. Give them here. You want to live being treated like this? Don't you have any pride as a man of the island?\"\nZis snatched the gold coins from his friends one by one. The heavy weight of the coins was exhilarating just to hold.\nBut he clenched his fist, suppressing his desire, and looked coldly at Amy.\n\"Hmph, arrogant nobles. It must be nice to throw around 5 gold coins. How does that feel? I can't even imagine.\"\nWith a defiant chin-up, Zis scattered the gold coins at Amy's feet. The coins gleamed as they rolled around.\n\"Ah, so this is how it feels? Fantastic. Let's go, guys.\"\nZis and his friends disappeared into the alley.\nAmy was dumbfounded by their audacity, but by then, the subjects of her ire were gone.\n\"Ugh, just letting them go like that. Shirone, why did you stop me? These types need to be taught a lesson.\"\n\"I know. But if you really disliked it, you could have just said no or shown your anger. There was no need to go this far.\"\n\"What do you mean? Are you saying I'm looking down on people because I have money?\"\n\"I don't think that. But it ended up looking like that, didn't it?\"\n\"Do you even understand what kind of people they are? You've been through it when you were younger, haven't you?\"\nShirone bit his lip. Maybe Amy was right. But no matter the opponent, he didn't want to see her demeaning someone else's dignity.\n\"Let's just go. We should find a carriage first.\"\nWith Shirone remaining silent, Amy turned and walked away first. Tess, watching the scene, scratched her head in confusion.\n\"Ah, this is awkward.\"\n***\nIn the alley besides Dock 3, Zis bickered with his friends. They were supposed to make a fortune with the arrival of the ship, but now with the customers gone, all they could do was argue.\n\"Zis! How could you give the money back! That was 5 gold, enough to avoid paying our dues for days.\"\n\"Do you guys have no pride? Accepting money thrown at your feet like beggars?\"\n\"So what? Money is money.\"\n\"I can't do that. Damn girl! There's a limit to looking down on someone!\"\nZis's fist trembled with rage. But his friends couldn't understand him. Why was he so upset?\nSure, the act of scattering money was humiliating even to them, but the arrogance of the nobility wasn't new.\n\"Zis, be honest. You fell for that girl, didn't you?\"\n\"What? Why would I fall for her?\"\n\"You always act tough in front of girls you like. But she's a noble. It's impossible, and given how easily she gave 5 gold, she must be from a high-ranking noble family.\"\n\"So what? Just because she's a noble? I'm Zis. I'm going to be the ruler of this harbor!\"\nAt that moment, footsteps echoed from the dark part of the alley. The distinctive sound of shoe soles with studs hitting the ground made Zis's hair stand on end.\nHis friends felt the same. In the harbor, there was only one person who made that sound when walking.\n\"Hey, Zis.\"\nIt was a middle-aged man of medium build with a rough appearance and sharp, snake-like eyes. He was Falcoa, the action team leader of the Freeman organization that Zis and his group were part of.\nZis shivered. Falcoa was cruel. True to his violent nature, he wasn't concerned about getting hit. He would rush at 10 or 100 people alike, hitting anyone in his path. He wasn't called the madman of Galiant for nothing.\n\"Ah, Falcoa. Hello.\"\nFalcoa chewed his jaw, draping an arm around Zis's shoulder. The repulsive smell hit Zis's nose hard. An addict, Falcoa never let go of the root he chewed on.\n\"Give it here. You got the money, right?\"\n\"Ah, well... no, we don't.\"\n\"You don't?\"\nA cold light flickered in Falcoa's eyes. Realizing trouble was imminent, Zis's friends prostrated themselves on the ground.\n\"Please, spare us! They said they wouldn't take our carriage! Even though we stuck with them until the end, they threatened us...\"\n\"Really? Then what was that you threw earlier? Was that not money but shit?\"\nZis's heart sank. Falcoa had been watching from the beginning.\nWas this how a frog feels when bitten by a snake? Strangled by fear, he could hardly breathe.\n\"Ah, what to do with you cute things?\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 127: The Galiant Island (3)\np>Discord: https://dsc.gg/wetriedChapter 127: The Galiant Island (3)\nShirone and his companions rented a carriage outside the harbor and headed to a resort on the west side. The beach, with its expansive white sands, was beautiful even from a distance, lined with numerous shops and accommodations built along the mountain like a hillside village.\nRian had rented a villa halfway up the mountain. True to its noble exclusivity, the property was spacious enough for the four of them, and the view of the ocean was satisfying from every angle.\nFrom the terrace, Shirone admired the sea. The blue waves crashed onto the sandy beach, creating foam.\nWatching people leisurely enjoying the beach made it easier to momentarily forget the unpleasant confrontation at the harbor.\nAfter settling in and lighting the fireplace, they gathered in the living room to relax from the journey.\nHaving skipped proper meals since morning, they were all hungry.\nAs Tess pondered over what to eat to make a good impression, an idea seemed to strike her.\nHow about we cook ourselves?\nRian looked at her in surprise.\n\"What? You know how to cook?\"\n\"Of course, I do. Did you think swordsmen can't cook?\"\n\"I was worried it might be some kind of military ration.\"\n\"Don't be ridiculous! I can cook for real, you know?\"\nRian was genuinely taken aback, not having expected the boisterous Tess to be confident in her culinary skills.\nThis was precisely the reaction Tess had hoped for, seeing it as an opportunity to show Rian a different side of her during this trip.\n\"I'll prepare the most delicious meal, so just bring the ingredients. What do you say?\"\n\"Hmm, should we? It does seem a bit much to go out on our first day. Shirone, what do you think?\"\n\"I'm fine with it. Food always tastes better when you're outside, right?\"\nAmy tentatively offered her help.\n\"Should I... help with the cooking?\"\nAll eyes turned to Amy. While her prickly nature might suggest otherwise, no one doubted her ability to cook.\nTess sensed Amy's underlying motive.\n'Is it for Shirone? Despite appearances, she's quite endearing.'\nTess was all for it, hoping this could be a chance for the two to reconcile.\n\"Great. Let's have a cooking showdown! Rian versus Shirone! You guys get the ingredients, and we'll prepare to cook. Sound good?\"\nWith everyone in agreement, Shirone and Rian took the shopping list from the girls and headed to the market.\nOnce the men had left, the atmosphere softened.\nAs they washed dishes side by side, Tess, with a playful glint in her eye, asked Amy.\n\"Is this your first time?\"\n\"First time for what?\"\n\"You know. Your first fight with Shirone? Despite the argument, you seemed flustered, it was obvious.\"\nAmy quickly diverted her gaze to the dishes.\n\"It wasn't a fight. And definitely not our first, nor a lovers' quarrel.\"\nWith a typical mage's triple denial, Tess burst into laughter.\nMages may be cunning and secretive, but in moments like these, they seemed rather adorable.\n\"Still, you were quite thorough with the shopping list. Are you maybe feeling a bit... nervous around Shirone?\"\nFlustered, Amy stopped washing the dishes to ponder. Since it was just the two of them, there was no harm in being honest. Eventually, she opened up to Tess.\n\"Shirone sometimes feels... distant.\"\n\"Distant? That's quite poetic.\"\nAmy chuckled at her own description.\n\"But it's true. It's like he becomes transparent. As if he could disappear at any moment. Maybe it's because he sees the world differently from others.\"\n\"Differently? He doesn't have extra eyes somewhere, does he?\"\n\"Maybe. Most people see the world from their perspective. But some can expand their view to include others' perspectives. Such people are often called paragons of virtue.\"\n\"Hmm, if that's the case, I'm definitely not one. I can't understand others' thoughts at all.\"\n\"Neither can I. But Shirone is different. He's kind, considerate, and I think his unique perspective is the biggest factor.\"\nTess smiled, having an 'aha' moment.\n\"So, you're upset because he didn't take your side against those thugs? Is that it?\"\nAmy awkwardly scratched her cheek.\n\"Well, maybe... But if he were just a simpleton, I wouldn't have thought much of it. Shirone is different. In a way, he has a perspective that even goes beyond that of a paragon of virtue.\"\n\"Beyond that? What else is there besides that perspective?\"\nAmy pointed upwards with her index finger, indicating something beyond.\n\"Is it like an omniscient viewpoint?\n\"Omniscient?\"\n\"Yes. When Shirone starts seeing the world from an omniscient point of view, he becomes faint to us. He becomes different, not just from us, but from any other human. It's probably because he has such an extremely high perspective that even his own existence seems like just a dot.\"\nAmy vividly remembered the moment Shirone had opened the Immortal Function without hesitation to save the entire school. How could he do such a thing? It was different from suicide. Sacrificing one's life for others was thousands of times harder than choosing death due to personal suffering.\n\"When Shirone becomes transparent the boundaries between himself and others dissolve. He becomes just another human among others. What governs Shirone when he looks down upon the world from that point? I think it's balance. If the scale tips even slightly, Shirone would not hesitate to step on the opposite side to balance it, even if that scale represents death.\"\n\"Ah, come on. That's impossible. How could someone like that exist? That's literally a sage.\"\n\"But it's true. Because I'm one of the people who benefited from that balance. No, all the students at the magic academy were saved by Shirone.\"\nTess couldn't close her gaping mouth. One student saving the lives of the entire school how much more astonishing could Shirone's story get?\nA wistful emotion flickered across Amy's face.\n\"I just thought that when Shirone stopped me, maybe I was just another small dot from his high viewpoint. Shirone is different from me, from anyone. That's why he's an exceptional mage, but sometimes it feels disappointing.\"\nTess gently shook Amy's shoulder.\n\"Don't think like that. Shirone truly cares about you. That's why he asked you to come on this couple's trip, knowing well what it was. You're not just another person wandering the streets. You'll always be Amy Karmis.\"\nEncouraged by Tess's sincere words, Amy smiled. However, her thoughts didn't change.\nHow much could Shirone, who could coldly abandon even his own life, truly value the existence of others?\n\"Amy, just tell Shirone. Ask him why he didn't take your side. Tell him you're so upset and frustrated that you can't sleep. Just talk to him about it.\"\nAmy chuckled and shook her head.\n\"Shirone knows. He didn't argue because he understood. Don't worry too much. It'll be resolved soon. It's just awkward because it's the first time.\"\nTess, with her straightforward nature, was frustrated. If feelings were hurt, why not just confront the person involved and settle it?\nBut Amy ended the conversation by saying there was nothing left to discuss since they both understood each other.\n\"Sigh, I can never understand the way mages think.\"\n***\nShirone and Rian arrived at the alley of miscellaneous shops. Since their shopping lists differed, wandering through the maze-like market would likely take until evening.\nShirone thought it best to split up.\n\"Let's part ways here. Once we've bought everything, we can head back to the villa.\"\n\"Are you sure? Can you carry everything yourself? It might be heavy.\"\nShirone looked incredulously at Rian. Surely he wasn't concerned about carrying basic items like garlic, onions, and pepper? While he appreciated Rian's concern stemming from his knightly oath, he didn't need him worrying about grocery bags.\n\"It's fine! I'll manage on my own, so just don't get lost. Remember, it's a cooking competition. The loser does the dishes.\"\n\"Alright! I hope you enjoy doing the dishes with Amy. You'd better hope to lose if you want to make up with her.\"\n\"Make up? We didn't even fight.\"\n\"Didn't you argue at the harbor? And now it's all awkward between you two?\"\n\"Argument doesn't mean fighting. We just had a difference of opinion. It's natural to exchange views from time to time.\"\n\"Ha! You're such a fool. That's what 'fighting' means.\"\nShirone stopped talking. As before, being called a fool by Rian strangely made him feel incompetent.\n\"Anyway, I'm off to buy the vegetables first. See you at the villa.\"\n\"I'll start with the meat. See you there!\"\nShirone watched Rian dash towards the butcher's shop, imagining the amount of meat he would likely purchase.\nChecking the note Amy had given him, Shirone saw nothing particularly difficult to find on the list.\nThough the variety of ingredients was greater than Rian's, he needed to move quickly to keep up with time.\nAfter about half an hour of shopping and sightseeingsince the resort area had many unique and interesting shopsShirone had nearly completed his list.\nThe commercial district was bustling with entertainment, including vending machines offering games and various street performances, indicating a continuous influx of tourists.\nIndeed, the streets overflowed with people, their laughter painting a picture of freedom not found on the mainland.\n\"Wow, there are so many interesting shops here. I should have fun here tomorrow.\"\nWith his shopping done, Shirone headed back to the villa.\nSuddenly, a shop door burst open, and a woman stumbled out, falling to the ground.\n\"Kyaa!\"\n\"Kyaa?\"\nPuzzled by the unusual scream, Shirone tilted his head but quickly approached to help.\nThe woman, in her mid-twenties with bobbed hair and bangs, had an attractive face that didn't seem ridiculous despite her peculiar hairstyle.\n\"Why are you doing this to me? What did I do wrong?\"\nRising, the woman shielded her chest with her arms, wearing a low-cut dress typical of a barmaid.\nHer eyebrows were thin, and her eyes sharp, yet her expression in front of a towering man was meek, like a herbivore.\n\"Come on, why the fuss? Let's have some fun together.\"\n\"I'm not that kind of woman!\"\n\"So what? Wandering around a tourist spot dressed like that, it's obvious. Just come and have fun with me.\"\nThe man intimidating the woman was Gamos, a well-known wealthy figure on Galiant Island.\nHis enormous size was more from fat than muscle, especially noticeable around his abdomen.\nBut his wealth apparently made up for his appearance, as he was flanked by imposing bodyguards.\n\"Come on, while I'm asking nicely. Honestly, you're not in a position to refuse.\"\n\"Help me, please! Someone, help!\"\nAs Gamos dragged the woman by her wrist, no one intervened.\nTourists didn't want to get involved in trouble far from home, and the locals feared Gamos's influence.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 128: The Galiant Island (4)\np>Discord: https://dsc.gg/wetriedChapter 128: The Galiant Island (4)\n\"Hey, stop that!\" Shirone stepped forward and shouted.\nGamos turned to Shirone with a look of astonishment. It seemed a nobody had appeared out of nowhere, but it turned out to be just a boy not yet in his twenties, holding grocery bags in both hands.\n\"What's this? You little brat, where do you get off meddling?\"\n\"Please let that lady go. Everyone is watching, and the guards will be here soon.\"\n\"Gahaha! The guards? Do you even know who I am?\"\n\"Who you are doesn't change anything. If you keep this up, I'll go and call the guards myself.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nAs Gamos loosened his grip, the woman quickly escaped and hid behind Shirone. Though he was just a boy, he was the only one in the crowd she could rely on.\n\"Please save me. That man was trying to...\"\nGamos frowned and approached.\n\"What a nuisance. Kid, I'm a trader on Galiant Island. This woman tried to steal from me. She even broke a valuable porcelain piece.\"\n\"Porcelain?\"\nShirone blinked in confusion. If what the man said was true, then the woman standing behind him was a thief.\n\"Right. I did demand her body as compensation. But since she damaged the goods, she must make amends, right? Calling the guards will only get her arrested.\"\nTurning around, Shirone saw the woman avoid his gaze.\n\"Is what he's saying true?\"\n\"Yes, I'm sorry. But I really needed that porcelain. I'm telling the truth.\"\n\"Hahaha! There's no situation where someone 'needs' porcelain that badly. You mean you needed the money. I was just trying to help her earn some. Now you see, kid? It's best not to get involved with such women. Unless, of course, you're looking for a one-night stand, right folks?\"\nThe crowd laughed along with Gamos, though the situation hardly seemed funny. The tension that had built up among the onlookers suddenly dissipated.\n\"Just go enjoy your meal with your friends. Don't meddle in adult affairs, or you'll end up like this.\"\nThe woman clutched Shirone's arm, pleading.\n\"Don't go, please. If you leave, I don't know what he'll do to me.\"\n\"Maybe you should turn yourself in? The guards can handle this.\"\n\"I can't! He has the entire island under his control. Please, trust me.\"\n\"How much was the porcelain worth?\"\n\"I'm not sure, but it might be around 50 silver.\"\nShirone fell into thought. Paying 50 silver to help the woman wasn't difficult for him. But was it right to pay off someone's guilt just because he had the money? Just as he had no right to judge someone's guilt, he also had no right to pardon it.\nShirone made up his mind and approached Gamos.\n\"I'll pay the porcelain's cost on her behalf. So please, let her go.\"\nGamos raised an eyebrow in surprise. To a noble, 50 silver wasn't much. But what was the boy's intention in standing up to him, Galiant's mighty trader, for this woman?\n\"Oh, so you plan to take her for yourself? I suppose a young lad like you couldn't find such a beauty for 50 silver anywhere else?\"\nShirone's brow furrowed. Gamos' insinuation that he had lascivious intentions annoyed him.\n\"I have no such thoughts. Do you think everyone is like you?\"\n\"Then why step in? She's a thief. Just hand her over to the guards, and it's done.\"\n\"It's not my place to judge what she's done. I'm using the 50 silver because I believe the punishment shouldn't exceed the crime. If you have any other intentions towards this woman, please accept this money and let it end here.\"\nMoved by Shirone's words, the woman's eyes lit up. Gamos, however, scoffed. Why make such a fuss over just 50 silver?\n\"Here's the 50 silver. Now, please forgive her.\"\nGamos stared at the silver coins in Shirone's palm.\nHe wasn't pleased. The woman was too good to let go, and he didn't like Shirone's attitude.\nThere is no need for you to compensate. Money's not important to me. I do have one condition though.\n\"A condition? What is it?\"\n\"You seem to be playing the noble hero for this woman. Then you can apologize to me on her behalf, right? Bow to me, right here in front of everyone.\"\nThe crowd's attention focused on Shirone. It was rare for someone to endure humiliation for another, but Shirone readily stepped forward.\n\"Alright. If that will make you forgive her, I'll apologize.\"\n\"Don't just say it, bow. Offer your apology properly.\"\nShirone deeply bowed.\n\"I apologize on behalf of this lady for the theft of the porcelain. Please forgive her.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nThe man looked down at Shirone with arrogance, then suddenly burst into a sneer, stepping forward and swinging an uppercut.\nShirone reflexively stepped back, avoiding the fist that whooshed past his face, stirring the air.\n\"What are you doing?\"\nGamos pointed at Shirone, chuckling.\n\"See? He dodged. He wasn't sincerely apologizing to me. If he was truly willing to save this woman, he could have taken the hit. But he avoided it because he was afraid. Do you understand now? The world isn't so simple. If you can refute, do so. You're just pretending to be good.\"\nThe crowd agreed with Gamos. If Shirone really wanted to save the woman, he could have endured the punch. But he dodged, which meant his actions were hypocritical.\nWhispers of disdain filled the air.\n\"So it was all an act. You put on quite a show, only to reveal your true colors.\"\n\"These days, kids are too presumptuous. They think they look so great acting all high and mighty.\"\nShirone couldn't comprehend the crowd's reaction.\n\"What's wrong with me dodging?\"\n\"Still playing dumb! Everyone here is disappointed in you. You acted like some great hero of justice, but it was all a facade.\"\nShirone was bewildered.\n\"What are you talking about? Even if it's pretense, doing good deeds is far better than doing harm like you.\"\n\"What? That's...\"\nGamos was at a loss for words. Even those who had jeered were taken aback by Shirone's response.\nThe woman, who had been watching silently, reached her own conclusion.\n'I was right. This kid... he's a mage.'\nMages don't debate 'who is right?' They consider 'what is right?'\nThis boy doesn't justify himself. He acknowledges facts and deduces the truth, a thought process common among mages.\nThe crowd, humiliated by Shirone's retort, was left speechless.\n'Just as I thought. They didn't lift a finger to help, only eager to criticize someone else's good deeds. That's why they fail.'\nIt was time to move. While the crowd's attention was focused on Shirone and Gamos, the best course of action was to slip away.\nThe woman slowly moved along the wall, then quickly turned the corner and disappeared.\nGamos's face was flushed with anger. From his entrance to this moment, the boy had been nothing but a thorn in his side, even challenging his worldview in front of everyone.\n\"Kid, you've messed with the wrong person.\"\nGamos's voice turned grave, shedding his trader's guise for his true, harsh tone. The alert bodyguards unsheathed their swords, the presence of the sharp blades alone enough to invoke fear of death.\n\"Waiting for what? Go on, give him a good thrashing!\"\nAt Gamos's command, the bodyguards charged from both sides, not intending to kill but ready to strike if necessary.\nSuddenly, dust kicked up in the eyes of one bodyguard, followed by a stone hitting the other's forehead.\nShirone turned to see the woman, who had vanished earlier, standing at the entrance of the alley, armed with a pile of stones.\nShe launched a barrage of stones, causing the bodyguards to hesitate. Seizing the moment, she grabbed Shirone's wrist and pulled him into the alley.\n\"Let's run! Follow me!\"\n\"Uh, but...\"\nShirone had been aware of the woman's absence but chose to ignore it, believing it was for the best.\n\"Why did you come back?\"\n\"Hurry! We don't want to get entangled with them!\"\nThey raced through the maze-like alleys, quickly losing the bodyguards thanks to the woman's familiarity with the area.\nFrom the market, Gamos's voice echoed.\n\"Chase them down! I'll make them pay!\"\n***\nThe warehouse was thick with the air of violence. As Zis lay curled up on the floor, Falcoa's relentless kicks landed on his ribs.\nEach blow felt like his heart would stop. Overwhelmed by fear, Zis couldn't even remember where he was hit, feeling only pain and numbness.\n\"Like that, you worm. Feels good, doesn't it? Huh? Enjoying it? So keep taking it.\"\nZis's friends kneeled in a corner, tears swelling their eyes, yet unable to stop crying.\n\"Please, have mercy! We'll go out and earn for you! We're going to die at this rate!\"\n\"Oh, is that so? Then would you like to be the ones getting beaten?\"\nThe friends froze at Falcoa's fierce glare.\nFalcoa could easily kill Zis if he wanted, but he deliberately avoided the face, which only added to their terror.\nFalcoa yanked Zis up by his hair. Despite being limp, Zis stood up at the pull.\nHis eyes were glazed, not from a blow to the head but from the shock. He felt paralyzed by fear.\n\"Please, I'm sorry... I was wrong...\"\n\"Does it hurt? Tell me, does it?\"\nFalcoa slapped Zis repeatedly, each hit causing Zis to convulse, though the strikes weren't particularly strong.\nSeeing Zis's condition, his friends burst into tears again.\n'God, this lunatic's going to kill someone.'\nFalcoa threw Zis to the ground. There wasn't a specific reason; perhaps the effect of the lufa he was chewing on was wearing off.\n\"So you returned the 5 silver because of your pride? You think you're something, Zis?\"\n\"I'm sorry! I won't do it again!\"\nZis felt unjust. He wanted to fight back but was too scared. In front of Falcoa's madness, his pride was worthless. If only he could escape, he was willing to do anything.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 129: The Galiant Island (5)\n\"I lost 5 gold. Taking back what you've given is the worst thing in the world. That woman should compensate for the loss.\"\nFalcoa lifted Zis's face. With his chin raised to the point of breaking his back, Zis couldn't even breathe. A little more, and his spine could have snapped.\n\"Does it hurt? It must hurt. I'm incredibly strong, you know.\"\n\"Please... spare me.\"\n\"Should I make it not hurt? Chew on this. Then it won't hurt at all.\"\nEven in his difficult situation, Zis turned his gaze. In Falcoa's hand was a root.\nHaving grown up on the island, he knew what it was. It was Lupe, the awakening agent of the natives. As a drug used for contacting spirits, its addictive properties were incomparable to other narcotics. Weren't there theories that even the Kergoians perished due to excessive use of Lupe?\n\"Please, I beg you. Anything but that...\"\nZis pleaded earnestly. Once addicted to Lupe, one's life was essentially over.\nHe would lead a life in the gutter, and his only family, his younger sister, would inevitably end up on the streets.\nFalcoa, as if he knew this would happen, put the Lupe he offered to Zis into his own mouth.\nWhat about its addictiveness? If one couldn't live without Lupe, then just enjoy it for life.\n\"What a coward. This is a divine awakening agent. Anyway, what will you do now? Will you bring her?\"\n\"Bring who?\"\n\"That red-haired girl. She looked fresh. Probably could sell her for a high price, heh. Of course, we'd have to offer her as used goods.\"\nZis was appalled. To think of trafficking a noble, no less. But given Falcoa's mental state under the influence of Lupe, it was entirely plausible.\n'He's insane. Not in his right mind.'\nFalcoa was the team leader of the Freeman organization. For a mere underling like Zis, he was the highest-ranking person he could contact.\nAlthough he had never seen Freeman himself, there was a clause in the directives he issued that prohibited human trafficking.\n\"But doing such a thing would get us expelled from the organization. The code of conduct states... Arg!\"\nA shoe with studs turned Zis's jaw. His mind spun, and he couldn't think of anything.\nFalcoa grabbed Zis's head and lifted it. The moment he heard the cold voice, Zis's focus returned.\n\"Or what? Will you bring your younger sister?\"\n\"That, that's...\"\nZis's body trembled. A mix of anger and fear rose, an indescribable emotion.\nHis younger sister was an irreplaceable treasure. He didn't want to show her such a filthy world.\n\"Ah, didn't I say? I actually like your sister. Introduce her to me this time, will you?\"\nA rotten smell came from Falcoa's mouth as he chewed on the Lupe.\n* * *\nShirone and the woman successfully lost Gamos's bodyguards after running through alleys for 30 minutes.\nTrue to their training, they were fast, but psychological warfare using blind spots to run circles around them proved effective.\nThe two leaned against a wall, catching their breath for a while. They had run so much that their mouths tasted of blood, and their legs were shaky.\nThe woman looked at Shirone, who was panting, and smiled.\n\"Heh, you're surprisingly fit? You look so delicate; I thought you'd give up running.\"\n\"If I give up, I'll get caught. I'm dying of exhaustion. But are you... okay?\"\n\"I'm Marsha. I'm seasoned in running away, so this is nothing. Let's go somewhere to rest. I'm so thirsty, I could use a beer. I'll buy you one as a thank you.\"\nShirone was puzzled. Even though they were on the run, Marsha didn't seem tense.\nAnd suggesting to drink beer meant she had money. Then why resort to stealing?\n\"Ah, I should probably get going.\"\n\"We can't wander around now anyway. Let's wait at a bar I know. Gamos might be brutal but he's dumb and forgets quickly. If we hold out for an hour, he'll be too distracted to chase us. And I'm actually scared. Can you just stay by my side for a bit?\"\nMarsha bit her tongue and winked playfully. Shirone wasn't swayed by her cute looks, but he decided to go along with her. After all, getting caught by Gamos now would escalate things irreversibly.\n\"Alright. But I have companions waiting, so I can't stay long.\"\n\"Fine. Let's just wait until Gamos's men give up. Come this way.\"\nMarsha led Shirone through winding alleys to a dingy bar. It seemed unlikely anyone would come here for a drink, yet it was bustling with people.\n\"Hmm, this place never changes, even after years.\"\n\"Weren't you a regular here? You said you knew this bar...\"\n\"Ah, I used to come here often. It's been three years since I've been on Galiant Island. A friend of mine lives here.\"\n\"I see. I thought you were a local because you knew the way so well.\"\n\"Heh, I never forget a road I've seen. Running away is a part of my life.\"\nAs Marsha and Shirone took their seats at the bar, rough-looking men turned to look at them all at once. The sight of a beautiful woman and a young boy together seemed out of place.\n\"People are staring.\"\n\"Don't mind them. This bar is only for the island's troublemakers. If something happens, this place is the first to receive news, so we can find out when Gamos gives up.\"\n\"Isn't that more dangerous? His men could barge in here.\"\n\"Gamos rules the island but he's not a troublemaker. So, this place is... kind of like a resistance. A community of fate, perhaps?\"\nShirone didn't take her words at face value. With so many people coming and going, controlling information perfectly was virtually impossible.\n'It can't be done with just a system. Maybe a pact or rules. But why? They have nothing to gain?'\nAs Shirone stared, Marsha gave an awkward smile, her eyes crinkling.\n\"Ugh, I can't stand it. Yeah, that's right. This bar is colluding with the Galiant self-government. Even the officials turn a blind eye to what happens here.\"\n\"So, it was like that. But why would the government do such a thing?\"\n\"Money. Money laundering, slush fund creation, circulating lobbying funds. It's called the 'Island Gate'. Maybe it's a system created by the insular nature of the island? There was an agreement. In exchange for circulating funds in the underworld, the safety of the criminals is guaranteed. Mutual aid. Well, isn't that how the world works? Hehe!\"\nMarsha flicked the toothpick in her mouth. Her seagull-like curved eyes somehow seemed sorrowful.\n\"It's funny when you think about it, isn't it? Everyone talks about punishing criminals, but in the end, it's the criminals who fatten their own pockets. Breaking down large sums of money into digestible pieces, like the microbes of society. Without microbes, life would perish.\"\nShirone had no response. The social system that goes against human nature was too complex and varied for an 18-year-old boy to judge.\n\"I've been too serious. You said your name was Shirone, right? What brings you to the island?\"\n\"I came to have fun with friends. Wanted to go to the beach and visit historic sites.\"\n\"Kergos Ruins? I've been there before. Ah, I was young back then, but now I'm already twenty-seven. I might end up dying an old maid. How old are you?\"\n\"I'm 18.\"\n\"Oh, older than I thought? You really look young.\"\n\"You look young for your age too. Uh, is it okay if I call you miss?\n\"Of course. Everything starts with miss. Later, if we become lovers, you can call me anything, hohoho!\"\nShirone lifted the corners of his mouth in disbelief. To an 18-year-old boy, a 27-year-old woman was an unreachable adult.\nBut aside from that, Marsha was much more intelligent and rational than expected.\nThe conversation was enjoyable, and with his guard down, Shirone shared the incidents that happened at the port.\nMarsha nodded as if she understood, then said:\n\"Ah, you got caught by a street hawker. They are notorious. But 5 gold was too much.\"\n\"Yes. In the end, it led to a disagreement with a friend, and I'm not feeling good about it. They must be waiting for me now. I'll probably get scolded when I return.\"\nMarsha checked the time and asked the bartender:\n\"What's the situation with Gamos?\"\nWhen the bartender acted as if he hadn't heard and just wiped glasses, Marsha placed a silver coin down.\nThen, as if he had never been silent, the bartender spoke up:\n\"According to the news that came in 10 minutes ago, it has spread all around the main roads. Probably about 40 men blocking all passages.\"\n\"Still? That man is really persistent.\"\n\"Gamos's alerts usually fade quickly. Seems he blew his top today.\"\nMarsha turned to Shirone with a broad grin. Shirone had no words to say, as he was the one who had blown Gamos's top.\nMarsha returned to the original topic.\n\"Anyway, it's best to deal with street hawkers moderately and avoid them. They belong to some kind of organization. Once you get involved, it becomes hard to handle the consequences.\"\n\"I see. I hadn't thought that far.\"\n\"Hehe, why would you need to? You're here to have fun, right? But there's always danger lurking in tourists' fun. The island is small and closed off. To share limited resources, there's inevitably fiercer competition than inland.\"\nShirone took note. He planned to stay on the island for ten days, so he would meet many hawkers.\nThanks to Marsha's advice, he was better prepared; otherwise, dealing with them like today could lead to bigger problems.\nShirone suddenly realized and looked at Marsha.\nFrom their conversation, she seemed like a genuinely good person. Kind, witty, and cautious not to judge others hastily.\nWhy would such a person resort to petty theft? Throwing tips to the bartender as if money wasn't an issue, it didn't seem like she lacked funds.\n\"I'm not sure if I should ask this, but I'm too curious.\"\nMarsha leaned back in her chair and looked up at the ceiling.\n\"Phew, I was nervous about when you'd ask. But Shirone, a woman's measurements aren't to be heard but imagined in the mind.\"\n\"No, that's not it! Why did you steal the pottery?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"You don't seem like someone who would stoop to petty theft. And you said you had no money, which was a lie. It wasn't even a useful item, so why the pottery...\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nMarsha rested her chin on her hand, lost in thought.\n\"I don't know. Just felt like stealing?\"\n\"Is that even possible?\"\n\"It is. It's called kleptomania. Of course, it wasn't like that from the start. I was an orphan. My parents abandoned me when I was four. A man from a mercenary band picked me up and raised me, becoming my adoptive father.\"\nShirone's heart fluttered at the unexpected revelation. Marsha, like him, was abandoned by her biological parents.\n\"But it was far from a comfortable life. The mercenary band was full of strange folks. I think I was eleven when a notorious brute in the band tried to lay hands on me. Luckily, my adoptive father found out first and beat him up.\"\n\"Of course. Any parent would do that if their daughter was almost harmed.\"\n\"Hehe, would they really?\"\n\"What?\"\nMarsha looked down at the bar with sad eyes. It seemed her eyes were moistening.\n\"I was given a piece of bread and a glass of water every day. My adoptive father gave me nothing else. No clothes, no sweets, no toys. In the end, he was just raising me. That's when I started stealing others' belongings. One day, I was caught stealing an apple, but he calmly compensated for it. However, as soon as we got home, he changed and started beating me. Without a word, until I passed out.\"\n\"That's terrible. If he could compensate, why didn't he just buy it in the first place? And why didn't you ask him to buy it for you?\"\n\"He wanted that. Submission to him. The only resistance I could muster was stealing things every day. Of course, I was beaten to death when caught. It was a dreadful routine. Then one day, I gave up on everything. So, I said to my adoptive father.\"\nMarsha supported her chin as if recalling that time.\n\"You can kill me if you want.\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

How much abuse must a child endure to utter such words?\n\"From that day on, those words became a sort of spell. Every time my adoptive father beat me, I would say, 'You can kill me if you want.' Then he would stop hitting me with an angry look and leave. Hehe, I just lived like that. When I was twelve, thirteen, and until I left home at seventeen.\"\n\"That's about my age now.\"\n\"Yes, it's the age to open one's eyes to the world. Then, one day, I finally realized the meaning of what my adoptive father had done to me all along. Or maybe I already knew, which is why I never asked for anything.\"\nShirone could guess by now. Marsha's adoptive father had harbored an unthinkable and terrible thought.\n\"Foolishly. If he wanted to, he should have just done it openly. Then he wouldn't have been entangled in such filth for 17 years. In the end, he was just a pathetic coward who couldn't do anything. Since then, I started carrying a knife hidden on me. One day, I saw the eyes of my adoptive father as he was beating me. Ah, it was so pitiful I couldn't bear to watch. So, I just told him.\"\nMarsha spoke calmly, her emotions restrained.\n\"You can hug me.\"\n\"Did your adoptive father do that?\"\n\"Hehe, strangely enough, there's no twist in such stories. He pounced on me as if he had been waiting, and I stabbed him in the throat with the knife. Honestly, I didn't feel anything. Then I left home and wandered around the world until I ended up here.\"\nShirone's heart was heavy. Hearing the story firsthand from the person involved brought an indescribable sense of outrage, unlike anything he had only read about in books or heard through rumors.\n\"Um, I don't know what to say...\"\n\"It's okay! I'm getting by now. My adoptive father is dead, but the kleptomania doesn't go away easily. I've had my share of trouble because of it. Sigh.\"\nAs Marsha laughed cheerfully, Shirone felt better too. He admired her for being considerate of others despite what she had been through.\n\"If it's an unforgettable pain, embracing it might be one way to deal with it. You're doing your best to overcome the pain, and the kleptomania will disappear soon.\"\n\"Thanks for understanding. If you had any plans to do something to me tonight, you would have been completely fooled.\"\n\"No! I really...\"\n\"I know. No need to blush. Having a brother like you wouldn't be boring.\"\n\"Me too. In fact, I even thought Marsha really felt like my real sister.\"\n\"Hehe! Thanks.\"\nShirone was sincere. Having seen the relationship between Rian and Reina, he had thought it would be nice to have siblings.\nWould it feel like this to have a sister? Her every word and action comforted Shirone's heart.\nIn the meantime, the bartender, who had gone into a room, came out.\nThough Shirone didn't know the details, it seemed that all sorts of information were collected from the room the bartender emerged from.\n\"The Gamos alert has been lifted. Seems he found a woman to his liking and returned to his mansion to throw a party.\"\n\"Phew, it's good it wasn't too late.\"\nMarsha glanced at Shirone with a sly look.\n\"Hmph, seems you really hated being with me? Just a moment ago, you were using your baby voice, begging, 'Marsha sis, please become my real sister.'\"\n\"I didn't say it like that.\"\nShirone felt the same regret. It was the first time he had lost track of time talking to a woman, given he wasn't used to them.\nBut for the sake of the household staff waiting at the villa, holding their stomachs, he had to leave.\n\"Do you think we can meet again?\"\n\"Of course. What, afraid I'll run away in the middle of the sea? If you're bored, come visit. I plan to stay here for a while.\"\n\"Haha! Then, I'll take my leave.\"\nAs Shirone hurried out of the bar, Marsha ordered a strong drink with a relaxed expression.\nAs expected, two men who had been eyeing her approached as if they had been waiting.\n\"You're quite a catch. Because of you, I ended up paying more for drinks than usual.\"\n\"Booking a room? This place isn't safe for a woman alone. How about I join you?\"\nMarsha didn't even turn her head.\n\"Beat it. Before I kill you.\"\n\"What? You done talking? Want to get a proper beating tonight?\"\nOne of the men grabbed a bottle from the table and raised it upside down. As the tension became palpable, people around the bar turned their heads.\nWith all eyes on her, Marsha sighed inaudibly and then suddenly changed her tone, laughing coquettishly.\n\"Hahaha! Fine, let's go to a room. But are just two of you enough? If you have friends, why don't you bring them along?\"\n\"What, what?\"\n\"Bring them. 10? No, even 20 is fine. I'll entertain you all night long. I hate it when things get cut off halfway.\"\nThe men were displeased without even understanding why. But Marsha knew. When sexual competition intensifies, males reveal their inherent weakness.\n\"What, damn. Is she crazy? Let's go.\"\n\"Ah, such bad luck.\"\nAs the men walked away, Marsha watched them with a look of disdain and then turned away.\nThe drink she had ordered was already served. Downing it in one gulp, the fire blazed through her throat, warming her senses.\n\"Phew, this is how booze should be. Bartender, one more.\"\nInstead of serving a new glass, the bartender came over and poured more into Marsha's glass.\n\"Are you Marsha?\"\n\"Hehe, is there another Marsha?\"\n\"I heard you're wanted by the Magic Association and have been evading capture until now. Decided to come in for good?\"\n\"No. I'll leave soon. Just came to settle some things.\"\n\"Preferably, keep it quiet. If someone of your caliber causes a commotion, it'll disturb the island. We don't want the agreement to break. If you promise to cooperate, we'll let you stay here for a while.\"\n\"Forget it. I never planned to stay here in the first place.\"\nThe bartender wiped a beer glass until it squeaked. After a long silence, he casually spoke.\n\"The boy will be disappointed.\"\n\"Hehe. It's okay. At that age, it's normal to experience heartbreak.\"\nI thought you both were getting along?\"\n\"It was fun. Ah, to be honest, it was a bit dangerous.\"\nMarsha hugged her shoulders and looked up at the ceiling.\n\"How can there be such disgusting people?\"\n***\nThe villa was as quiet as if no one was there.\nAmy sat on the sofa next to the fireplace, and Rian and Tess couldn't even bring themselves to start a conversation, wary of her mood.\nShirone was nowhere to be seen. It had already been 2 hours since he went out to shop; unless he was fetching fish from the sea, it was well past the time he should have returned.\n\"Sh-Shirone is late, isn't he?\"\nTrying to thaw the frozen atmosphere, Tess spoke up and was startled by her own voice, which seemed louder than usual.\nYet, Amy remained motionless, staring into the darkness.\n'Ugh, it's like walking on thin ice here.'\nTess shivered, feeling the cold as if Amy's bad mood was palpable.\nOf course, as a woman, she could fully understand. Regardless of the trip being for couples, this was supposed to be an exciting first holiday for the two, wasn't it?\n'Shirone, you were too inconsiderate. I'm disappointed in you too. Tch!'\nBirds of a feather flock together, and Tess sided with Amy.\nShe knew how much Amy had conceded to Shirone, even when there was a conflict of opinion at the harbor. Despite that, she readily offered to cook. Men might think that its a small thing, but from a woman's perspective, it was the most sincere act of wanting to reconcile quickly.\nYet, Shirone was over an hour late compared to Rian. Getting lost might be a reason to worry, but it was Amy's expectation for him to handle even such minor issues responsibly.\n\"Ah, I'm hungry. Why isn't he coming? Should I go look for him?\"\nRian mumbled, holding his stomach without any tact. Not having set meal times, enduring for an hour was already a long wait for him.\n\"Nevermind. We might just miss each other.\"\n\"Really? Then can I eat the potatoes I brought?\"\nTess glared and shouted.\n\"Why are you so thoughtless? Think about Amy.\"\n\"What's so serious? Shirone had more to deal with than me. It's normal for him to be late.\"\nTess was infuriated. Although Shirone wasn't her partner, having empathized with Amy, she even found Rian detestable.\n\"Even if Shirone had more to do, he's smarter than you, so it's only normal for him to return sooner. So, it's a serious issue! You just go munch on potatoes or chew on turnips in the corner.\"\n\"Why are you so angry? What did I do?\"\nRian scratched his head like a bear. Indifferent to the insults hurled at him, he couldn't exactly be called selfish.\nFor the first time, Amy spoke up, trying to smile apologetically for ruining the mood.\n\"Sorry, it's my fault. You guys go ahead and eat. I'll wait for Shirone.\"\n\"We can't do that. It was supposed to be a cooking contest.\"\n\"But Rian is hungry. It's Shirone's fault for being late anyway. Let's just consider it our loss.\"\nTess tried to console Amy with a tearful expression.\n\"It's okay, Amy. Honestly, I'm not even hungry. Just deal with that glutton somehow.\"\nRian was indeed chewing on a raw potato in the corner. Unable to even perform Schema but possessing equivalent physical strength, he required several times the calorie intake of an average person to maintain his massive strength.\nAs silence ensued without a resolution, Amy propped her cheeks on her knees, resting her feet on the chair.\n'Why isn't he coming? Is something wrong?'\nShirone wasn't one to break promises. Nor was he foolish enough to waste time due to a mistake.\nThere must have been an unavoidable circumstance.\nBut no matter how much she tried to compose herself, she couldn't help feeling neglected.\n'You're the one who brought me here. Besides you, everyone else is someone I met today.'\nShe felt lonely. Although she had become friendly with Rian and Tess, their partnership had a level of understanding that Amy couldn't intrude upon.\nThump, thump. Thump, thump.\nSomeone knocked on the door. Tess's face lit up, and Rian clenched his fist, thinking he could finally eat.\n\"Shirone? Wait a sec...\"\nBefore Tess could finish, Amy walked to the door. With her eyes narrowed, she flung open the door and yelled.\n\"Hey! Where have you been all this time... Huh?\"\nAmy blinked, the door wide open.\nIt wasn't Shirone. Nor was it a stranger. It was someone who definitely shouldn't be here.\nZis, who had argued with them at the harbor, stood there.\n\"What? Why are you here?\"\nZis's face turned red. Of all people, he hadn't expected her to answer the door.\nRecalling the day's events made his teeth clench, but seeing her in casual clothes, his heart fluttered again.\nRegaining his composure, Zis looked around the villa with a brazen attitude. Despite the pain in his abdomen from Falcoa's beating, his expression remained unfazed.\n\"Wow, this place is really nice. Nobles are different, aren't they?\"\n\"What do you want? How did you know we were here?\"\n\"I asked around. For the ruler of the harbor, Zis, finding this place was no big deal. Now you know how well-acquainted I am with the island, right?\"\n\"So? You came all this way just to show off that one trick?\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Honestly, I did overcharge. Normally, I wouldn't ask for so much, but I guess I got too greedy. Let me redeem myself. I'll show you something really fun.\"\nTess put her hands on her hips and said,\n\"No way. The mood is already sour enough. Amy, just kick him out.\"\n\"That's that, then. Goodbye.\"\nAs Amy was about to close the door, Zis, looking desperate, shoved his hand in to stop it.\nThere was no scripted scenario, but as someone seasoned in this line of work, words came quickly to him.\n\"J-Just wait! If your friends don't want to come, you can come alone.\"\n\"Why would I? This seems suspicious.\"\n\"Fine! I'll tell you the truth. I... I got in big trouble.\"\n\"From whom?\"\n\"Even the street hawkers have an association. It seems my actions reached the ears of the higher-ups. So, they told me to guide the offended guest around the island. They said if word gets out, tourists won't use the services of hawkers. Can you just stop by for a moment? If not, I'm totally cut off. I might really have to beg like a beggar.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nAmy didn't let her guard down. Zis, already scared, anxiously awaited her decision.\n\"Alright, I'll go out for a bit of fresh air. Wait here while I change.\"\nZis's head perked up. Of course, that was why he had come, but he hadn't expected to get her consent so easily.\nOn the other hand, Tess was flabbergasted. She hadn't expected Amy to fall for the hawker's words.\nThinking Amy's heart was hurt because of Shirone, she hurriedly followed Amy.\n\"Amy! Why would you ever follow him? How can you trust that guy?\"\n\"It's okay. If it feels dangerous, I'll just come back.\"\n\"Let's think about it a bit more. What about Shirone?\"\n\"Forget it. Let him do as he pleases. Rian must be hungry too, how long are we going to wait? It's better this way. I'll eat out, and you can have a cozy time with Rian.\"\nAfter changing and fixing her hair, Amy headed to the entrance. Despite Tess's persuasion, she was determined.\n\"Do you really have to go? Then you have to come back quickly, okay? Just go for a breeze. If you're late, we'll come looking for you.\"\n\"Got it. Rian, I'll be back in a bit. If Shirone comes back, let him starve.\"\nRian was thoughtful. His usual ravenous demeanor was gone, replaced by a serious contemplation of the situation.\nWas it really right to let her go? However, if she wanted to go, it would be ridiculous to stop her.\n\"Zis, was it? Let's go.\"\n\"Eh? Oh, okay!\"\nZis was dumbfounded. He had lost his senses ever since she descended the staircase in a black dress styled like a young girl.\nWith Amy gone, the villa felt desolate. Tess, with a heavy heart, sighed and shook her head.\n\"Ah, how did it come to this? The atmosphere was good just a moment ago.\"\n\"Should I have gone with her?\"\n\"Idiot, don't you understand a woman's heart? How miserable would Amy feel if her partner's escort was someone else? And where on earth did Shirone go?\"\nWalking to the window, Rian watched Amy board the carriage.\nThe stars over the sea sparkled as if they were about to pour down.\n* * *\nZis sat opposite Amy. Having got her on the carriage, he could consider the plan more than 80% successful.\n\"Alright, alright! Then, we're off! Hey, get moving!\"\nAs the coachman nodded and shook the reins, the two-horse carriage jolted forward.\nZis kept talking non-stop. He wasnt a local for nothing; he rattled off even the most trivial facts no one wanted to know. Did it matter if the vegetable store owner had an affair with a widow?\nAmy didn't say a word, just gazing at the night view outside the window, deep in thought, paying no heed to Zis's words.\nEventually, Zis realized this and fell silent.\nIn truth, just looking at Amy's face was his greatest joy. Her calm demeanor now was a stark contrast to her angry expression earlier.\nCould Falcoa really be planning to sell off this beautiful girl? The reality hadn't sunk in until she was seated in the carriage, but now fear crept in.\n\"How long will it take? Where are we going?\"\nAmy spoke for the first time, hitting right at the core of the issue, startling Zis, who scrambled for an answer.\n\"Ah, well... It's a bit far. It's the best place in Galiant. Really, you'll see when we get there.\"\n\"Really? The boss who targetted me wants you to take me there?\"\nZis felt his heart drop.\nSince when did she know? From the beginning? Then why did she get on the carriage, and why had she remained silent until now?\nZis's face froze, unable to muster any more lies, his mind going blank.\n\"Well, that's...\"\n\"No need to lie. I can see it in your eyes. You're pleading out of fear; only a fool wouldn't know. Just do your best. I'm only going to play along this once.\"\n\"Play... along?\"\n\"Yeah. Whatever reason you became a scapegoat, quit it after this. I'm saving you because you're too pitiful.\"\nZis's face flushed with heat.\n\"What! Me, pitiful?\"\n\"Then what, enviable?\"\n\"This, this is really...!\"\nBefore Zis could erupt in anger, Amy asked,\n\"You, you threw a gold coin at me, didn't you?\"\n\"That, that was...\"\nZis averted his eyes. Just recalling the daytime incident made him flinch. That act had earned him a severe beating from Falcoa, a trauma he'd never forget.\n\"People like you don't last long in this line. Those with a lot to protect only get used and discarded.\"\n\"Tch, how would you know? A noble who's lived in luxury thanks to her parents.\"\n\"At least I know more than you. I used to dabble in this world too. Of course, I was at a much higher position than you.\"\nZis bit his lip. In the end, that was the truth. No matter how much he tried to stand tall or raise his voice, it was impossible to stand eye to eye with her.\n\"Are you pitying me?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I don't want your pity. Not at all.\"\n\"Then leave this world behind. This might be your last chance.\"\nZis lowered his head, feeling defeated. She was right. If she hadn't taken pity on him, he and his sister would be experiencing hell by now.\n\"Tch.\"\nAs Zis clicked his tongue, Amy looked out the window. The cool sea breeze seemed to gently soothe her eyelids.\n\"I don't dislike someone like you.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"The part where you threw coins at me. A man should have at least that much backbone. If you were just some backstreet thug, I would never have boarded this carriage.\"\nZis's face turned red as a beet.\n\"Damn it. Are you giving me the illness and the cure? This is why I don't like nobles. Just like earlier. Some mock, others hold back. Completely self-centered.\"\nAmy, propping her chin, cracked a smile.\n\"Ah, Shirone? That kid is also a commoner. That's why he stopped you.\"\n\"What? A commoner? Not a noble, but a commoner?\"\nZis's eyes widened. He had thought it was a joke at first. Otherwise, why would such a beautiful girl be with a man of lower status than herself?\n\"Yes, a commoner. What does it matter? Or, does it matter?\"\n\"But wasn't he your partner? It looked like a couple's trip.\"\n\"Right, he's my partner. The one who brought me to this remote island and then disappeared somewhere... my partner.\"\nAmy smiled sadly, her lips curved like a cat's. Watching her gaze drift into the distance, Zis's mind tangled in confusion.\nMaybe he had been wrong from the start. He should have just picked up the coin from the ground. Even if it hurt his pride, it wouldn't have led to this situation.\n\"Damn it! Cursed be! To think she's taking a risk out of pity for me? Does she even understand what danger means?\"\nShe was taking it too lightly.\nFalcoa was the team leader of the Freeman organization. What was the Freeman organization? A fearsome group of elite fighters ruling over Galiant.\nWhen Zis was young, the island's commerce was divided among several organizations. There were occasional power struggles, but the balance of power was never broken.\nHowever, everything changed when the Freeman organization landed on the island five years ago.\nThey expanded their influence at an incredible rate, and existing organizations were disbanded without a fight. Eventually, a coalition was formed to stand against the Freeman organization, but it was easily crushed.\nThe war ended in just three months.\nThe Freeman organization was a group of monsters that had disbanded all other factions in just three months.\n\"It's not just Falcoa. The thugs up the chain are all terrifying figures. I'm taking her into such a place.\"\nZis clenched his fists. He wanted to stop her but couldn't find the words.\nMaybe she could escape since she was a magic academy student. But his sister wasn't. If Falcoa decided, he could make the street hawker's sister disappear without a trace.\n\"I have to protect her. At least my sister... I must!\"\n***\nAfter parting with Marsha, Shirone reached the beach. He had run non-stop, leaving his legs wobbly, but the real challenge was yet to come. Since the villa was halfway up a mountain, he had to climb the slope.\n\"Whew, why is my luck like this today? It's been nothing but running.\"\nIt was after sunset, so Rian and Tess would be cooking by now.\nIf Amy was still waiting, he had to deliver the unfortunate news as soon as possiblethe news that he had left the grocery basket behind.\n\"Either way, it's like facing death.\"\nShirone gritted his teeth and sprinted up the slope. By the time he reached the villa, he was gasping for air.\nBarely making it to the entrance, Shirone, bent over, knocked on the door.\n\"Rian, Amy, Tess. I'm back. Open up, please. Agh!\"\nAs the door suddenly opened, Shirone fell forward. The response was much quicker than he had expected.\n\"Shirone! Where have you been all this time? Do you know how long Amy has been waiting?\"\n\"Ah, sorry. There was a reason. Let's go inside and talk. My legs are shaking.\"\nThere was no smell of food in the villa. Shirone felt even more apologetic, wishing they had eaten first.\n\"Did you wait a lot because of me? But where's Amy?\"\nTess didn't know how to explain. Should she say Amy went out because she was tired of waiting? Or that she was disappointed in Shirone and followed Zis?\n\"What's with that look? Did something happen?\"\n\"That's... Ah, this is awkward.\"\nTess's hesitation was because she didn't want to stir unnecessary misunderstandings between the two.\nHowever, Rian had grasped the crux of the matter.\n\"Amy went out with that guy Zis we met at the harbor.\"\n\"Huh? Zis? The one who overcharged us? Why would Amy follow him?\"\n\"No idea. He suddenly showed up while she was waiting for you. Said he wanted to make amends for the daytime incident and took her away in a carriage somewhere.\"\n\"Amy just went along without any reason?\"\nTess interjected.\n\"Yes! This is all because you were late. Amy was so lonely by herself. Tell me, what happened?\"\nShirone deferred his answer. Now wasn't the time for such discussions.\n\"Let's go. Do you know where?\"\n\"We have no idea. Why are you so anxious? If you cared, you should have been nicer from the start.\"\n\"It's not because of me she left.\"\n\"What do you mean? Amy was so angry!\"\n\"Amy is quick-tempered but not impulsive. Even if she was angry at someone, she wouldn't do something to worry them. At worst, she would have waited for me to return and then given me a piece of her mind.\"\nTess was stunned. Shirone knew Amy well, so he was probably right.\nBesides, thinking about it, that did seem like her. Quick to anger but tender-hearted, seemingly prickly but deeply considerate.\n\"So, there's really something wrong? It's just a hawker. Isn't Amy outstanding even in the magic academy?\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 132: Priority (2)\nCertainly, Amy's abilities were beyond doubt. However, Shirone had a different concern. Just 30 minutes earlier, Marsha had informed him of how dangerous the island was.\nThe street hawkers had their own power. Especially the ones from the streets were said to be the underlings of a powerful organization.\n\"Marsha warned to be wary of someone like Zis. Even if that's not the case, the island is a closed and dangerous place. Things that can't even be imagined on the mainland can be easily dealt with here. There are many nobles who go missing on the island. We can't just assume Amy is safe.\"\nRian equipped his straight sword in its leather scabbard.\n\"There's no need for a long explanation. Let's go, Shirone. Lead the way. I'll take care of any troublemakers.\"\n\"Thanks. It's actually my fault for being late.\"\n\"There must have been a reason for that too. First, we need to ensure Amy's safety.\"\nTess watched the two boys. This was the conversation of those bound by a knight's vow. Though it was just an imitation for now, it was an enviable sight for her, who dreamed of becoming a knight.\n\"Wait a minute. I'm coming too. It's not just you guys who are worried about Amy.\"\nThe three of them left the villa and headed down to the beach. However, once there, they were at a loss where to start looking.\nFaced with the vast expanse of the sandy beach, Tess's confidence waned.\n\"Where do we start looking for Amy? At this time, the only place Zis could have taken her is the commercial district. Should we split up and search there?\"\n\"That doesn't seem like a good idea. We can't cover the entire commercial district even if we split up. Besides, we don't know the area well enough.\"\n\"Then what do we do? We have no way to find her. We might as well look for a needle in this beach.\"\nShirone pondered with his chin propped.\n\"Let's head to the harbor instead. Marsha said there's definitely an organization. If that's the case, we can ask a member of the organization for Amy's whereabouts.\"\n\"The harbor? That's to the south, isn't it? Wouldn't it be faster to search here than to go all the way there? Besides, Amy won't be at the harbor. It's not a tourist spot.\"\n\"No, heading to the harbor is the right choice. If we break down Amy's situation, there are two possibilities. First, Amy is safe. Second, Amy is not safe. If she's safe, there's no harm in us going to the harbor. But if she's not safe, we must go to the harbor. If Amy is not safe, it means there's a conflict with Zis's organization. So, in any case, we need to head to the harbor first and make contact with the organization members.\"\n\"That... makes sense.\"\nTess nodded as if under a spell, surprised by how much faster he spoke than she thought.\nRian didn't hesitate. The moment Shirone suggested heading to the harbor, he was already renting a carriage.\nAfter paying the coachman, Rian gestured for Shirone and Tess to hurry. They sprinted and jumped into the moving carriage.\nThe coachman laughed heartily and sped up.\n\"Ah, to be young. Got something urgent at this hour?\"\n\"Yes. Please hurry!\"\n\"Alright! Let's give our horses a real workout for a change! Hyah!\"\nThe roads were quiet at night, and with gold as motivation, the coachman drove the horses hard, making the carriage rattle.\nThey reached the harbor in 20 minutes, and the coachman boasted about setting a record for the first time in five years.\nThe trio rushed to the harbor.\nMost ships were docked, and light seeped through the windows, probably as sailors played card games inside.\nAlthough they were suspicious of ships floating nearby, it was too late to check every corner on foot.\nShirone focused on searching the pubs at the harbor. Most looked like organization members, but many were actually sailors.\n\"What do we do? Can we find her like this?\"\n\"We can find her. There must be at least one person here.\"\nShirone persistently inquired at the pubs and finally found a clue in a small tavern.\nThey were unrecognizable at first due to swollen eyes, but they were definitely the hawkers who had been with Zis, drinking.\n\"Those two over there! You were with Zis, right?\"\n\"Looks like it. Leave the rest to me.\"\nRian walked forward, rolling up his sleeves, knowing that in situations like these, appearance is more effective than actual strength.\n\"Hey, remember me?\"\n\"What? Looking for trouble? I'm in a really bad mood right now... Eek!\"\nThe boy, slurring his words in anger, stood up in shock upon recognizing Rian.\nRian's imposing figure was intimidating, but the real shock came from knowing what Zis had gone off to do, having been caught by Falcoa.\n\"Um... well... that is...\"\n\"I know everything. So let's talk somewhere quiet. I tend to get violent in crowded places and calm in quiet ones. What'll it be?\"\nThe hawker glanced at his seated friend. Their eyes briefly met, and without a word, they bolted for the door.\n\"Damn it! Run!\"\nThey ran frantically, but the door seemed to get no closer.\n'What's going on? Is this a dream?'\nIt was only after the adrenaline of the escape wore off that they realized their feet were dangling in the air.\n\"I'll give you one last chance. Come quietly, or do you want to be planted upside down right here?\"\nRian, holding one boy in each hand, extended his arms to show off his strength.\nThe boys were terrified. To hold the weight of two men with arms outstretched was beyond mere strength; it was almost supernatural.\n\"We'll go, we'll go. Please, just don't use your strength.\"\nFrom there, things went smoothly. Rian took the hawkers to the breakwater, where they roughly explained the situation.\n\"So Falcoa told Zis to bring Amy, is that it?\"\n\"Yes. Zis got beaten to a pulp. We nearly died too. You better not mess with Falcoa. That guy's a complete lunatic.\"\n\"Doesn't matter. There's no lunatic who's stayed sane after taking my punch. Where did they take Amy? You know the place, right?\"\n\"Really, I don't know! Please believe me!\"\n\"Is that so? Then I'll ask your friend. You're choosing to let only one survive by giving up the chance for both of you to live.\"\nThe two boys looked at each other fearfully. Honestly, they lacked the mental fortitude to withstand torture. But Rian was only using his words to overpower them, thanks to the interrogation techniques he learned at the swordsmanship school.\n\"Really, we don't know. But we have a guess.\"\nShirone and Tess moved closer. Rian stopped pretending to be a clumsy investigator and shook the hawker's collar.\n\"Where is it? Speak up!\"\nT-The Royal Court.\"\n\"The Royal Court? What are you talking about?\"\n\"It's a tavern's name! The biggest tavern in Galiant! Any carriage will take you there! Please, you mustn't say we told you this! If they find out, we're dead!\"\nWithout a chance to respond, Rian turned around. Shirone and Tess were already prepared to run.\nExiting the harbor, they saw a carriage waiting. Coincidentally, it was the same carriage that had brought them here.\n\"Sir, coachman!\"\nThe coachman, who had been sitting in the cargo area smoking a pipe, turned around. His horses and the thrilling ride they had given these passengers seemed to have impressed him.\n\"Ah, finished sightseeing already? You're quick at running as well as at looking. Hahaha!\"\n\"Sir, we need to leave now! It's urgent!\"\n\"Aye, youth is always in a hurry! Come on, get in!\"\nThe coachman jumped down from the cargo area with youthful enthusiasm.\nOnce the coachman got the horses moving, he looked back, shouting as the wind made his voice louder.\n\"Where to this time?\"\nShirone, Rian, and Tess shouted in unison.\n\"To the Royal Court!\"\n***\nThe Royal Court Tavern.\nThe tavern, grand enough to justify the name 'Royal Court', was one of the most dazzling places on the island.\nThe four-story building was a testament to what real waste of money looked like. Decorated with all kinds of gold and silver treasures that reflected light, and with magical crystal lamps that commoners couldn't even dream of affording, illuminating the place.\nShirone and his companions were overwhelmed by the wealth emanating from the building. It felt like they had arrived at a place they were not supposed to enter.\nAs Shirone approached the tavern, as expected, a bouncer blocked their way.\n\"Hey, you can't carry weapons in here...\"\nRian didn't even wait for him to finish and pushed the bouncer's throat. Though they were similar in size, the bouncer couldn't match Rian's strength.\nGasping for air and flailing about, by the time the bouncer regained his senses, Shirone and his companions had already entered the tavern.\nInside, the tavern was filled with people's voices.\nWomen, barely clothed, danced around, while profanities, obscenities, and lewd jokes filled the air.\nTess frowned in disgust. During the day, Galiant might seem like a peaceful resort, but at night, it transformed into a whirlpool of murky desires.\n\"Could Amy really be in a place like this? It's so crowded, and what's with these women? Aren't they ashamed?\"\n\"Exactly. This certainly isn't Amy's type of place. But since she followed willingly, she must have been prepared for this. And be careful, in places like this, don't expect security to intervene no matter what happens.\"\nHaving heard about the island's situation from Marsha, Shirone was certain. Although the usage differed, this place was also part of a secret deal with the government.\nFailing to find Amy on the first floor, they moved to the second. A tense gambling scene unfolded there.\nThe third floor had a cross-shaped corridor with rooms lined with iron doors, and the fourth was a VIP room reserved for high-ranking nobles.\nHaving scoured each floor, Rian let out a sigh of disappointment.\n\"It's going to be tough at this rate. She's not in the hall or the gambling area. It's impossible to search every room on the third floor, and the fourth is swarming with bodyguards.\"\nIt was time to make a decision. Whether to politely ask for permission to search room by room or to cause a real scene.\nNaturally, their decision was the latter. Knowing Amy was dragged here under a malicious plot, they had no intention of leaving quietly.\n\"There they are! Those guys!\"\nThe bouncer they had roughed up at the entrance pointed at Shirone and his group. Then, a man from the back rolled up his sleeves and approached.\nRian had to tilt his head to meet the man's eyes. The man was a giant, his head nearly touching the ceiling.\n\"A troubleshooter, then?\"\nA shady establishment like this always screened its customers. Normally, the bouncers at the door would handle it, but some customers bulldozed their way in, causing havoc. It was the troubleshooter's job to deal with such people through violence.\n\"What's this? A bunch of baby-faced brats? But wait, this girl isn't just any brat.\"\nThe troubleshooter looked down at Tess, smirking as he wiggled his nose. His high vantage point allowed him a clear view of Tess's ample attributes, unlike ordinary people.\n\"Hehehe, you'd fit right in here. Let's see, shall we? Shall I give you an evaluation?\"\nThe troubleshooter's hand reached out towards Tess. Just the sight of his palm felt like a net being cast in front of her.\nTess quickly grabbed the troubleshooter's middle finger and bent it upwards with all her might.\n\"Aaaaah!\"\nThe giant's frame contorted comically. His arm was fully extended, and the middle finger was bent back to touch the back of his hand.\n\"It hurts! It hurts!\"\n\"Hmph! You should have been more careful. Even if I'm a woman, my arm strength is greater than your middle finger, you know? This is what happens when you rely on your size and act recklessly.\"\n\"Aaaargh! You little brat!\"\nBefore the troubleshooter could finish his cry of pain, Tess released his finger, twisted her body with lightning speed, and swung her elbow.\nA crisp short strike hit the troubleshooter's chin. The timing was so perfect it felt as if he had intentionally moved closer to get hit.\nThe troubleshooter's brain rattled, disconnecting his consciousness. As Tess stepped aside, the giant's body fell like a dead tree, thudding heavily to the ground.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 133: Priority (3)\n\"This is impossible...\"\nGido was dumbfounded. He had never anticipated that the largest fixer on Galiant Island would fall to a woman's strike.\nRian shook his head as he watched Tess dusting off her hands. Was there even a place for a man to squeeze in here?\nElzain swordsmanship is known for its precise attacks. Trained to pierce vital points in any situation, she was a technician capable of nullifying the difference in strength or size in an instant.\n'Getting to the tip of the chin with minimal movement is impossible without murderous concentration. Consider yourself lucky. If Tess had drawn her sword, you'd be dead already.'\nShirone stared blankly at the immobile fixer. Was this the movement of a swordsman that paralleled a mage?\nIf Rian's physical strength was avant-garde, Tess's strike seemed like a perfect work of art.\n\"Wow, that was really cool, Tess.\"\n\"Hehe! Was it okay? Shirone really has an eye for this. Unlike someone standing right there.\"\nRian approached Gido, paying him little mind.\nGido was trembling with fear. When Rian grabbed his neck and lifted him, he made a final struggle.\n\"Ugh! Do you know where you are?\"\n\"I know, that's why I came. Does it look like we're playing hide and seek? Where's Amy right now?\"\n\"Damn it! Who's Amy? How would I know?\"\n\"Should I stop your heart instead of killing you?\"\n\"Damn it all! I really don't know! If you're so curious, find out yourselves!\"\n\"This bastard!\"\nRian's eyes blazed with anger. He was already anxious, and this was just adding insult to injury. Didn't they have no time to search, hence their current actions?\nJust as he was about to intensify the threats, Shirone approached.\n\"Rian, that's enough. What's the point in asking if he doesn't know?\"\n\"Then what? Are we really going to go around every room?\"\n\"No, we ask about what he knows.\"\n\"What he knows? Like what?\"\nGido flinched as he locked eyes with Shirone.\nIt was a different kind of anger from Rian's. A chill surged, freezing his bones.\n\"Ask where Falcoa is.\"\n* * *\nRoyal Tavern. Basement Level 1.\nThose in the know called this place a temple. Of course, no god resided here. But sometimes, one might see a god, due to the hallucinogenic effects induced by Lupe.\nIn the end, the 4th-floor VIP rooms were just for tourists who came based on rumors, but the real deal was all underground.\nThe temple was a space for those addicted to pleasure, where various drugs circulated, and the stimulant Lupe could be enjoyed without limit.\nThe temple was divided into 17 sections, and the total area was 1.5 times larger than the first floor.\nIt was always full, but Room 4 was never open to guests because it belonged to Falcoa, the team leader of the Freeman organization and the boss of the Royal Tavern.\n\"So I asked him. Do you want to be buried after you die, or die after you're buried? You know what he said?\"\n\"Ehehe, what did he say, boss? What did that guy say?\"\nFalcoa screamed as if dying.\n\"Please~ save me!\"\n\"Ahahaha! I'm dying of laughter! Please~ save me!\"\nFalcoa's men burst into laughter, pounding on the table. But Zis couldn't understand it at all.\n'Crazy bastards. What's so funny about this? They're out of their minds.'\n\"Oh dear, why aren't you drinking?\"\nZis didn't even make eye contact with his partner, just shaking his head. Drinking here felt like he'd never see tomorrow's sunrise.\nZis discreetly turned to look at Falcoa's partner. Amy, whom he had brought along, was sitting there.\nOf course, she didn't understand Falcoa's sense of humor either and just stared blankly ahead with an indifferent face.\n'Really impressive. I'm scared to death, but her expression doesn't change at all.'\nNormally, a woman, especially a young girl, would tremble with fear in such a threatening situation surrounded by violent gang members. But there was not a hint of tension on Amy's face.\n'Ah, it's noisy. I'm bored. I want to go back.'\nAmy moistened her lips with the drink in front of her. As a noble, she was taught about liquor, but she wasn't inclined to enjoy it and didn't usually drink. At most, she sipped enough to cover the bottom of the bottle out of boredom.\nBut the alcohol still made her feel light-headed, leading her into a somewhat sentimental state.\n'What am I doing here?'\nOf course, she had come along out of pity for Zis. But upon reflection, that didn't seem to be the only reason.\n'He must have returned by now, right?'\nWhy was Shirone late? Perhaps he was caught up in another needless commotion.\nFrom Shirone's omniscient point of view, how many unfortunate people could there be in the world?\n'Hehe, did I want to imitate that?'\nThinking about it, her reason for coming here wasn't much different.\nShe had heard the screams of a ruffian at the harbor, begging for his life. Of course, he didn't seem completely down and out.\nThe mood at the drinking party grew more heated. The more it did, the more irritated Amy became.\nShe could easily show her power and leave if they were forceful, but contrary to expectations, Falcoa behaved with manners.\nWhat are you thinking? Should I make the first move instead?\nWhile Amy was lost in such thoughts, Falcoa was also aware of her, wearing a sinister smile.\n'I can hear the wheels turning in her head from here.'\nAmy must be a high noble. There was an inherent nobility about her that couldn't be compensated for by mere appearance.\nBut Falcoa was at ease. He had the ultimate weapon to subdue nobility.\nIndeed, with this, even a king would kneel before him.\nThat was Lupe.\nEven now, many high nobles had become slaves to Lupe in the temple.\nTiming it right, gradually training them with Lupe, even the proudest noble couldn't withstand it.\n\"Come, come. Let's toast, to a toast!\"\nAt that moment, a crashing sound came from beyond the plank, followed by the shouts of the staff.\n\"What the! Ugh!\"\n\"Hey! Stop them! That's the boss's room!\"\nThe door burst open, and three people entered.\nZis stood up in shock upon recognizing the faces of the intruders. They were Amy's friends from the harbor.\nFalcoa's expression soured immediately. He could forgive troublemakers if they paid up several times over, but an intrusion into his temple, his territory, was a matter of pride.\n\"What's this? What's going on?\"\nAs Falcoa spoke in a voice devoid of any humor, his direct subordinates jumped to their feet. Seeing their temper, the women around started to discreetly move away.\n\"Shirone? How did you find this place?\"\nAmy asked, her eyes wide in surprise.\nBut Shirone postponed his answer. An unbearable itching sensation was crawling up his spine.\nThe man sitting arrogantly at the high seat, legs crossed, must be Falcoa. He didn't look like a monster, but it was clear at a glance he was not normal.\n'He's strong, that man...'\nIt's easy to show a killing intent. If you truly intend to kill, even an ordinary person can intimidate others. But it's not easy to subtly exude a faint killing intent as if it's barely there.\nOnly a professional killer could emit such an aura.\n'Amy...'\nWhy was Amy sitting next to such a person?\nInstead of tea or coffee, which she preferred, there was a glass of alcohol in front of her. The floor was dirty, the air was stale. Nothing she had in her room was here.\nTherefore... she wasn't here of her own will.\n\"Let's go back, Amy.\"\nAmy felt a surge of emotion. After all this time, the only thing he had to say was \"Let's go back, Amy.\"? He was nowhere to be seen when she was waiting, and now he has this bold attitude?\nAmy was angry at herself for being glad to see Shirone just moments ago. From what perspective was Shirone looking at her now? From the height of a human, or from the high heavens?\nThis wasn't what she wanted. That's why she didn't want Shirone's help. She could leave right now if she wanted to.\n\"You, you guys! Do you know where you are, barging in here!\"\nAll the tavern's staff rushed over. But none dared to enter Falcoa's lair, as if it were the den of a fearsome demon.\nShirone was astounded. A boss that even his underlings feared. How deep and dark was this man's evil?\nFalcoa spoke lazily, as if annoyed.\n\"What are you? Do you know what happens when you enter a room without my permission?\"\n\"We came to take Amy. Let her go.\"\n\"Pfft, sounds like a kidnapping. Even nobles need to be careful, especially in places like this.\"\nShirone's guess was correct. This place was a lawless zone under the protection of the island's government.\n\"What are you waiting for? Send these kids back.\"\n\"Where should we send them back to, boss?\"\nFalcoa exhaled sharply and said,\n\"To hell.\"\nFalcoa's direct subordinates started to advance, loosening up their bodies. They were on a different level compared to the staff they had passed by.\nTess drew her sword, readying herself, and said,\n\"Shirone, be careful. All of these guys are Schema users.\"\nA light flashed in Shirone's eyes. Tess had a keen eye, so it must be true.\nOf course, most students at the swordsmanship school could open their Schema. But it was strange that not a single thug living on this island lacked the ability to use Schema.\n'Who is this person? How can a mere tavern owner command such skilled individuals?'\nShirone stared straight at the underlings blocking the way. At that moment, an overwhelming emotion struck Shirone's heart.\n\"Ugh!\"\n\"Shirone, be careful! It's Pressure!\nThere are many abilities related to the 'eye techniques' in the Schema perception, but Pressure was among the most common.\nIt was intuitive and useful in real combat because it was easy to master if one knew how to release their emotions outward.\nShirone wasn't flustered. He realized it was the same technique used by Adel, the head butler of the Karmis family, the moment the opponent's hostility pressed down on him.\nBut the quality of the emotion was different. If Adel's Pressure was meant to overpower, theirs was solely to take life.\nRian gripped the hilt of his straight sword and took a step forward.\n\"How dare you!\"\n\"Rian! Wait!\"\nShirone shouted, and Falcoa's men looked at him in surprise. It was Pressing from 10 people at once; normally, it would have stopped one's heart, not just halted speech.\nBut Shirone still stood, a faint smile on his lips.\nAmy was the only one who understood the situation.\n'Indestructible. In a way, it's a power that rivals my Red Eye.'\nPressure couldn't sway Shirone. Maybe it could, but not at their level.\nShirone began to walk slowly. As if pushed by the atmosphere, the underlings stepped back with the same pace.\nIt wasn't easy for Shirone to emit emotions either.\nIt was the pressure injected by 10 veterans who had experienced countless battles.\nIt's impossible to put a value on emotions, but it felt like waiting for a carriage to run over you with your hands and feet tied to the ground.\nMore precisely, it was the terror of the moment when the carriage arrived right in front of you, and the massive wheels filled your entire field of vision.\nIn reality, the fear would last only 0.1 seconds because death awaited, but Shirone was experiencing the same emotion for over 20 seconds.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Even a 1% shake in the indestructible state could potentially lead to a cardiac arrest due to a nervous system shock.\nHowever, Amy wasn't worried. The very reason it was called indestructible was because not even that 1% could be shaken.\nShirone finally pushed his way to the table with his subordinates. Falcoa, witnessing this disarray, contorted his face in rage.\n\"What are you all doing! Cut their throats right now!\"\nThe subordinates, swords at their waists, drew them in unison and charged.\n\"Damn it! It's embarrassing to have to use a sword against a kid!\"\nAt that moment, a flash of light burst from Shirone's body. The flash, occurring in a confined space, blinded the subordinates.\n\"Argh! What's this!\"\nAs expected of those trained in the art of vision, their dark adaptation was faster than human limits. But they didn't move. Not the subordinates, not even Falcoa; they just stared blankly at Shirone.\n\"What now? What are you going to do with that light?\"\nShirone flipped his palm, levitating a sphere of light. The golden photons were compressed at an incredible speed, turning pale as they lost color.\n\"Shirone, you couldn't possibly?\"\nIn front of the trembling photons, whose frequency was immeasurable, Amy finally realized.\nA magic that accelerates mass to the speed of light to create a shockwave. It was indeed the Photon Cannon.\n\"Shirone! That's...\"\nIn a confined space, avoiding a Photon Cannon was no easy feat. Inevitably, someone would be hit directly, and that could lead to fatalities.\nBefore Amy could finish her sentence, Shirone lifted the white sphere high and thrust it into the ground with all his might.\nThe moment the flash struck, a thunderous roar spread throughout the room, shaking it violently.\n\"Argh! What, what is this!\"\nThose in the room covered their ears. The shockwave spread along the ground, causing the underground structures to tremble. Dust cascaded from the ceiling.\nThe subordinates, as if surviving a natural disaster, were disoriented. The echo of the roar, trapped underground, still resonated in their ears.\nAfter some time, the members finally looked around the site of Shirone's magic. Surprisingly, the floor wasn't deeply cratered. But the flattened area exceeded a diameter of 4 meters.\n\"What is this place... isn't it underground?\"\nThe subordinaes couldn't believe their eyes.\nThis was a temple in Galiant, considered one of the sturdiest structures. The design focused on durability to create space underground. Indeed, the temple's floor was laid with thick steel plates.\nIf such steel plaes were merely flattened, it made sense that the entire underground shook. It was a level of force not meant for humans to withstand.\nThe veterans didn't cry, but they kept their distance from Shirone, wary.\nFalcoa's expression soured once more.\nIt was one thing to overcome ten pressures, but the magic now was something even he, who had roamed countless battlefields, had never seen before.\n\"Who... who are you? Which line are you from?\"\nThe Mages' vast network across the continent is referred to as 'lines'. However, Shirone was unfamiliar with the term used in the mage society. He simply stated his origin with pride.\n\"I'm Shirone, attending the Alpheas Magic Academy.\"\nZis was startled, turning to look at Shirone. For a noble, origin was a golden thread, but in some situations, it could become a shackle.\nHaving suffered at the harbor, Shirone knew this well. Why then, would he reveal his origin?\n\"A student? Ridiculous. Are you saying a mere student dared to do this? Hey, you know what? If I report you to your school, it's over for you. You'll probably be expelled.\"\n\"Report me if you wish.\"\nFalcoa's eyebrows twitched at the unexpected response.\n\"I don't care about punishment or expulsion. Such things won't control my life. Of course, the school is important to me. But there are things in this world far more important than that. And Amy is...\"\nShirone glared at Falcoa, continuing his words.\n\"...my priority over everything else.\"\nAmy blinked rapidly, her eyelids' speed seemingly reflecting her heartbeat.\n\"I don't mind any punishment. Sue me if you want. But Amy won't stay here for a second longer. If you ever drag my friend to such a filthy place again, I'll really smash everything.\"\nWith a whoosh, Rian's straight sword was drawn, making a sound like water. The sight of the greatsword, as tall as an ordinary person, pointed forward was immensely intimidating.\n\"That's the Shirone I know. I wasn't wrong about you.\"\nRian realized why he hadn't drawn his sword until now. Like a small crack that brings down an iceberg, a minor obstacle like discipline had shaken his conviction.\n\"You're right, Shirone. Afraid of punishment and putting a friend in danger? Must be a joke. Rian Ogent has never lived that way for a moment.\"\nFollowing Rian, Tesss triple sword was drawn.\n\"Ho-ho-ho! Elzain Tess feels the same! We can't leave Amy, the mascot of the Shirone faction, in this thug den!\"\nRian looked at Tess incredulously.\n\"Since when are we the 'Shirone faction'?\"\n\"Oh, come on, just let it slide this time. You really are clueless.\"\nAfter snapping at Rian, Tess turned to Amy. She was still deep in thought, but her cheeks were more flushed than before.\nTesss lips curled into a warm smile.\n'You're lucky, Amy.'\nBeing a woman herself, Tess could guess Amy's feelings.\nTo Shirone, Amy wasn't just a mere point from an omniscient perspective. She was an irreplaceable friend. Perhaps, even something more.\nPushing away the subordinates with his momentum, Shirone walked towards Amy. Extending his hand, he repeated his initial words.\n\"Let's go back, Amy.\"\nAfter concluding her thoughts, Amy lifted her head and spoke.\n\"...Okay.\"\nAs Amy stood up, Falcoa's face turned red with rage. The mob had caused a ruckus and was now leaving as they pleased.\n'Has Falcoa fallen this low?'\nIt had been nearly five years since the entire organization hid on the island, fleeing from the continent's pursuer. Many things had happened, but to him, it was all just tedious.\nHis brain had become dependent on drugs, and his once blood-thirsty mind had become greasy. But five years ago, Falcoa was a man who crossed the continent, cutting down numerous people.\nAt that time, he existed solely to cut down others. Even the boss couldn't ignore Falcoa's skills, which was why he hadn't been expelled to this day.\n\"Hey, you don't think you can leave here unscathed, do you?\"\nAmy halted and turned to face Falcoa.\n\"Causing a commotion here would trouble you too. The guests underground are drug addicts, and they're your main source of income. Sue us if you want, but we won't stay silent. This place might have to close down.\"\n\"You're banking on that? Sorry, but there's no one on this island who can touch me.\"\n\"But it's a different story inland.\"\nFalcoa frowned at Amy. Her eyes were ablaze with a red glow.\n'Red eyes. She's from the Karmis family.'\nFalcoa was aware of the famous Karmis family on the continent. Their ability to store a specific state and restore it anytime made them immune to any drug or substance. The Karmis family wasn't called the invincible in the realm of the mind for nothing.\n'Was it impossible to catch her from the start? That woman, she knew everything from the beginning.'\nFalcoa ground his teeth, expressionless.\nIf it were the Karmis family, ranked first among the nobility, it wasn't impossible for her to demolish the stronghold he had built over five years.\nThe funds earned from distributing the Lupe were enormous. Even Falcoa, out of his mind, was sensitive to money. Without money, he couldn't buy the Lupe.\n\"Haughty girl, I'll make sure to repay this humiliation!\"\n\"Try if you can, but be careful next time we meet. Now that it's come to this, I don't care about the school anymore. I'm going to have some real fun.\"\nAfter firmly putting Falcoa in his place, Amy returned to Shirone and the others.\n\"Sorry for worrying you. Let's go now.\"\nEager to leave this place even for a moment, they hurriedly made their way to the surface. Employees watched from every corner, but none dared to stop them.\nStepping out of the pub, the air felt distinctly different. Tess stretched her arms wide, inhaling the night air.\n\"Ah, it feels great. Thanks to Amy, we had a proper tour. We went from the bottom to the top of the most famous palace on Galiant Island.\"\n\"Hahaha! That's exactly what I heard. Plus, we went to the beach, stopped by the harbor, and even toured the commercial district. Did we cover everything except the historic sites?\"\nAmy was startled by Rian's words.\n\"What? You went all the way to the harbor?\"\n\"Yeah. Shirone said it would be faster to catch a member of the organization and ask. We ran like crazy. If it weren't for the passionate coachman, we wouldn't have made it on time.\"\nAmy glanced at Shirone, then averted her eyes when their gazes met. She still didn't have the courage to look him directly in the face.\nShirone's words from the underground resurfaced in her mind. There was no need to misinterpret them; they simply expressed the importance of a friend.\nWhy hadn't she noticed? At the cliff, Shirone was the only one who called out her name and held her hand as they fell.\nAmy was content with understanding the significance of that moment.\n\"Amy, sorry for being late. I'll tell you all about it when we get back. There was a special circumstance on the way here.\"\n\"Hmph, I'm not even curious! Why should I listen to that?\"\n\"Are you still angry?\"\nShe was no longer angry. But Amy thought it was better to remain upset.\n\"Let's get this straight. You're not having any weird fantasies about today, right? Like the prince on a white horse saving the princess, that kind of thing.\"\n\"Huh? No?\"\n\"Thanks for coming to help, but I wasn't captured. I went there for personal reasons. Those guys are no match for me, even without your help.\"\n\"Haha! I know. I'm in Class Four and you're in the advanced class. Who would worry about whom?\"\nAs Shirone readily agreed, Amy felt somewhat deflated.\n\"Hmph, well... as long as you know. Just saying.\"\nTess laughed heartily, holding her stomach. It felt like Amy had finally returned to her usual self.\nRian turned towards the commercial district and shouted.\n\"I'm hungry! Shall we grab some late-night snacks on the way back?\"\n\"Late-night snacks? Great! I love it! Yay!\"\n* * *\nIt was past midnight when Zis could finally leave the pub after cleaning up.\nAfter being beaten, tense, and then working, his body felt twice as heavy.\nYet, he could endure because the feared incident hadn't occurred.\nAmy had safely escaped Falcoa's clutches. And he himself hadn't suffered any harm.\nHaving done his job properly, even Falcoa had no reason to beat him.\n'If it weren't for that girl, I might have been dead.'\nAmy's face appeared vividly in his mind.\nAmong all the women Zis had met, none were as strong and beautiful as her. Why would such an incredible person bother to help him?\n'Shirone? He said he was a commoner too.'\nZis remembered every word Shirone had said in the pub.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Sometimes, when dealing with arrogant nobles, he even felt lucky to have been born a commoner.\nBut Shirone was also a commoner. And he had the courage to give up something precious for a friend.\nZis remembered the sad smile Amy had on the carriage. Did Shirone understand the meaning behind that smile? No, he would never know. It was a true feeling she showed because it was in front of someone who meant nothing to her.\nThinking about it made his stomach churn again.\n\"Damn it! Why a commoner? There's no excuse to make! What kind of person is he!\"\nHaving vented his frustrations in front of his house, Zis opened the door and entered. Seeing a candle lit deep inside the hallway, it seemed his sister had been waiting for him all this time.\n\"Brother, why are you so late? I was worried something had happened.\"\n\"Yuna, why haven't you slept? How are you going to work tomorrow?\"\n\"How can I sleep when you haven't come home? What happened?\"\n\"Nothing. I was just busy, and time flew by.\"\nZis knelt in front of Yuna. Not just because she was his sister, but she was a person of character. Despite having no formal education, she was wise and kind-hearted.\nYuna was Zis's pride. He couldn't let her live a miserable life like his. He didn't dream of success, but she deserved to meet a good man and have a happy life.\n\"Why do you look so haggard? Tell me the truth. You can fool others, but not me. If you don't, I won't make breakfast tomorrow.\"\n\"Hahaha! Scary, scary. Just some pride-wounding stuff, but I'm okay now.\"\n\"Ugh, that pride of yours is always getting hurt. It's so rotten, can't even eat it. Anyway, go wash up. You reek of sweat.\"\nZis's gaze softened involuntarily. Looking at her, his heart felt at ease. So what if he wasn't great like others? As long as he had Yuna, he envied nothing in the world.\nZis hugged Yuna. The scent of family, sharing the same smell, swept away the day's fears and fatigue.\n\"Ew, the smell! What are you doing all of a sudden? Go wash up first!\"\n\"Just wait, Yuna. I'll definitely become the ruler of the harbor.\"\n\"Tch! Still with that talk? What even is a 'ruler of the harbor'? No one cares about that.\"\n\"Haha! That's true.\"\nYuna smiled and hugged Zis back. She didn't really mind the smell of sweat. After all, not a single drop of it was shed without thinking of her.\n\"I really hope that day comes. You can definitely do it, brother.\"\n\"Yeah\"\nZis looked out the window at the moonlight pouring in. It was a perfect night for sightseeing.\n***\nShirone and his party were busy from dawn. While the girls bathed, the boys cleaned the house, and when the boys entered the bath, the girls sat in front of the mirror, drying their hair and dressing up.\nAfter bathing, Shirone and Rian thought time had stopped when they peeked into the girls' room. Amy and Tess were still in front of the mirror, busy with something.\nThe boys had no choice but to eat breakfast first. They had a simple meal with food bought from the town the night before.\nOnly then did the girls start choosing their outfits, changing every time they walked in and out of the room.\nRian thought Tess and Amy were testing him.\nChanging outfits because they didn't like the previous one was understandable since they were girls.\nBut what was the point of changing into something else only to come back wearing the previous outfit after a while? Was it a real challenge? It seemed like a clear challenge to the observer's memory.\n\"Ah, just wear anything. Are we going to hunt dragons? Why fuss over a piece of cloth with no defense?\"\nTess looked at Rian with eyes filled with horror.\n\"Ugh, so crude! If you guys don't care about your clothes, we have to dress up even more. It's all for your sake, so shut up.\"\nAmy came out wearing a sky-blue dress.\n\"Shirone, does this look weird?\"\n\"No, it's pretty! Amy looks good in anything.\"\n\"Really? Hmm.\"\nAmy didn't pay much attention and went back to her room. Tess envied Amy for that.\n\"Please, learn something from Shirone. Ugh, so annoying.\"\nWhen Tess slammed the door and went inside, Rian pouted. What had he done to deserve that? Speaking one's mind was a virtue and a matter of pride for a swordsman.\n\"Shirone, how do you come up with such words so easily? Teach me.\"\n\"Huh? It's simple. You can't say everything looks weird.\"\n\"Hahahaha!\"\nRian burst into laughter, holding his belly and falling backward.\n***\n11 AM.\nThe girls, now changed, checked their backpacks. They packed emergency food, a knife, a compass, and a rope to prepare for any unforeseen situations.\nTess, satisfied with her reflection in the mirror, clenched her fist and shouted.\n\"Done! Were ready for the ruins exploration!\"\n\"Shall we sleep now? Let's definitely leave tomorrow morning.\"\nTess blushed at Rian's sarcastic joke.\n\"How long do you think I took? And Amy prepared with me.\"\n\"Why bring Amy into this? Is she a hostage or something?\"\n\"Speaking of which, do you think your shabby outing clothes and that stupid greatsword suit you? From afar, you look like a caveman! Know your place.\"\nAmy fulfilled her role as a hostage.\n\"Rian, sorry. It was actually my fault for being late. Tess was ready before me.\"\n\"Haha! It's okay. It shows that Amy took her time to get ready.\"\nTess's eyes turned fierce.\n\"What? So, I don't look pretty at all?\"\n\"Hmm, let me see\"\nRian scanned Tess.\nWell, he had always thought she was pretty. She didn't need to dress up to be beautiful.\nBut she really made an effort today. Even wearing perfume, which was unusual, made it obvious to Rian, who wasn't known for his artistic sense.\n\"Yeah, well. I guess you're pretty enough to say so.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nTess, who had a mountain of retorts ready, was completely disarmed in an instant.\nShe never expected to hear the word 'pretty' from Rian's mouth. Her face turned red, and then redder as she realized her face was red.\n\"I didn't dress up to hear that from you! You idiot! Caveman!\"\n\"Alright. Now that that's settled, can we please leave? We won't be able to see anything if it gets dark.\"\nRian hurried his friends outside. Thus, five hours after waking up, Shirone and his party were finally ready to set off on their journey.\nShirone's initial plan was to explore the ruins alone with Amy. But as his friends became more involved, it was impossible to act separately.\nThey grabbed any carriage lined up on the beach and headed east.\nTraveling from the west end of the island to the east was a tough journey. But the four of them, chatting away in the carriage, lost track of time.\n\"Hey, look over there!\"\nShirone pointed out the window excitedly. A lush forest forming a mountain range was visible about 2 kilometres away from the road.\nThe mountain range stretched like a camel's hump, and according to what they heard, the Kergos Ruins were at the end of this range.\n\"It's Toa Mountain. I heard from my brother that Galiant used to be a volcanic island. The island was formed from lava that seeped out from under the sea and solidified. It's been in a dormant phase since a volcanic eruption 500 years ago, but there's always a possibility it could become active again.\"\n\"I see. Kergos Ruins are also half-buried in volcanic ash, right?\"\n\"Right. The Galiant autonomous government proposed restoring the ruins, but it was scrapped due to opposition from the natives. We might be able to see how much it's buried once we get there.\"\n\"Why would they oppose it? Wouldn't it be beneficial for the natives if the ruins were restored?\"\n\"I don't know. But they must have their reasons. Maybe they have secrets they don't want to reveal. The autonomous government hasn't even been here for 100 years.\"\n\"So, it seems there are many secrets. It's not just an ordinary tourist spot.\"\n\"Apparently. It's rare for natives to manage existing ruins directly. Kergos Ruins have high historical value.\"\nShirone, based on Amy's explanation, took another look at the mountain.\nToa Mountain's jungle belonged solely to the Kergos people. The Galiant government didn't even dare to encroach upon the native autonomous region.\nSuddenly, Shirone felt a chill. Was it just his imagination, or could he feel a wild gaze from deep within the mountain?\nThe carriage stopped 1 kilometre away from the Kergos Ruins. The coachman informed them that it was impossible to go further by carriage from here.\nStepping out of the carriage, Shirone surveyed the surroundings. Numerous stores were visible. There seemed to be an exclusive contract between the horse society and the local merchants.\n\"What the hell! I paid for this carriage ride, and now you're telling me we can't go any further? What about all this luggage?\"\nA middle-aged man with a protruding belly complained to the coachman after alighting from the following carriage. His wife and two daughters also wore dissatisfied expressions.\n\"However, that's the contract with the transport company. There's a paid storage facility for luggage.\"\n\"Such bandits! The road is clear, and you say we can't go? Do you think I'll spend even a dime here?\"\n\"I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it. Have a good trip.\"\nThe coachman, seemingly used to such encounters, responded professionally and drove away.\nEventually, the middle-aged man, carrying luggage in both hands, headed towards the paid storage. When his daughters pointed out a snack shop, he set down the luggage and bought them snacks.\nShirone couldn't help but feel a connection with the middle-aged man's situation.\n\"If we had known earlier, we could have packed lighter.\"\n\"It doesn't matter, does it? It might not be dangerous since it's a tourist spot, but it's still good to be well-prepared. After all, our goal is exploration.\"\nRian looked back at the departing middle-aged man. Cheerful after appeasing his daughters, he laughed heartily and headed towards the ruins.\n\"Smart, though cheeky. Tourists can't help but spend money.\"\n\"That's true, but it's not just about commercial tactics. If the tourism industry isn't vibrant, even the natives can't manage it.\"\nConvinced by Amy's words, Shirone and his friends started walking.\nAs expected of a historically significant site, there were many tourists. The closer they got to the ruins, the more people there were, and by the time they reached the toll booth, it was packed due to a bottleneck effect.\n\"Wow, do you see that? There are people from other countries too.\"\n\"It's a world-famous site. See that man standing by the arch? I think he might be a native.\"\nShirone looked where Amy was pointing. A medium-built man was guarding the entrance. His clothes were civilized, but his gaze, fixed straight ahead, was undoubtedly wild.\nTess looked uncharacteristically scared.\n\"Eek, he looks so scary. And he has tattoos on his face?\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

It wasn't just the tattoos. Their keen senses were picking up on the latent force within the man.\nHowever, Rian thought differently.\n\"Hmph, just because he's glaring doesn't mean he has any real strength. No need to be scared.\"\nRian's senses were less sharp than others. That's why he couldn't open a Schema, but Shirone found reassurance in that. In any frightening situation, Rian would steadfastly be their shield.\n\"Great! Let's start exploring the ruins!\"\nThey passed the toll booth and began their investigation in earnest.\nThe Kergos Ruins were a temple dedicated to a deity, forming a square structure 2 kilometers in length and width.\nCrossing a 200-meter-wide moat via a bridge led to a long gallery, and it was another 500 meters along the pilgrimage route before reaching the central temple.\n\"Wow, it's really huge. Can you believe this was built thousands of years ago?\"\n\"I heard from people earlier that it's only this visible because it's buried under volcanic ash. In reality, it's several times larger.\"\nShirone looked down at his feet. Since the volcanic eruption happened 500 years ago, the volcanic ash would be beneath the surface layer.\nAmy, who was ahead, turned back and shouted at Shirone.\n\"Shirone, what are you doing? We need to check out the central temple too.\"\nShirone didn't respond. He just smiled faintly, deeply engrossed in something.\nAmy approached him, puzzled.\n\"What's wrong? What's happening?\"\n\"Amy, try entering Spirit Zone.\"\n\"Spirit Zone? Why all of a sudden?\"\nRealization dawned on Amy, and she slapped her palm.\n\"Oh, I see!\"\nMages can extend their senses through Spirit Zone. If there was something hidden beneath the ruins, it would surely trigger their Synesthesia.\n\"Got it. I'll give it a try.\"\nAmy entered Spirit Zone. As she probed the underground with her Synesthesia, her brows gradually furrowed. After about 5 seconds, she seemed to have realized something and released the zone.\n\"Shirone, this\"\n\"Yeah. Nothing's being detected. There should at least be some bedrock, but there's nothing.\"\n\"Could it be because the layer of volcanic ash is too thick? What if we go deeper?\"\nThat was the issue they were stuck on. But after a moment of thought, Shirone had an epiphany.\n\"Aha, there's a way.\"\nAmy could do it. Her specialty was the Target Form among the Four Way Formation, known for its long range.\nThe Target Form, also known as the Cross Zone, places the mage at the intersection of two lines, rapidly rotating it to swiftly hit a specific target.\nBut it didn't end there.\nUpon entering the advanced class, Amy specialized her Target Form into Sniper Mode.\nSniper Mode, with a perfectly straight Spirit Zone, places the mage at the end of the zone to enhance range.\nThis directional zone, despite its slow rotation, can achieve at least four times the range of the Target Form.\nEven expanding the zone's radius to just 500 meters makes it surpass 1 kilometer in Target Form. In Sniper Mode, it could hit a target 4 kilometers away.\nAmy's basic radius was 68 meters. In Target Form, it reached 143 meters, and in Sniper Mode, it exceeded 500 meters.\n\"Alright, I'll try.\"\nAmy entered the zone with a Sequence Method. The transformation of the Four Way Formation was swift, and a tilted cross stood erect.\n'Sniper Mode!'\nAmy's zone dove downwards like a cascade. A groan escaped her clenched teeth.\nAs the zone extended, its durability inevitably weakened. Without obstacles, it wouldn't be an issue, but the underground was unpredictable, causing the zone to bend erratically.\nAmy pushed deeper with desperation.\nAnd just when she thought she touched something, her zone shattered, shaking her consciousness.\n\"Ugh! Ugh!\"\n\"Amy! Are you okay?\"\nShirone quickly supported her. Sweat beaded on her forehead.\n\"I'm fine. But this seems tough. I penetrated up to 300 meters, but beyond that, it's impossible. It's like tossing a thread into the ocean; it just drifts aimlessly.\"\nShirone could guess the immense force at play. Amy's zone was not weak, yet she compared it to a fragile thread.\n\"Still, we discovered something might be there. That's significant.\"\n\"It's a result, but it's not enough. We need someone capable of maintaining durability while expanding the zone. At least a top-level Zoner, or else Spirit Zone exploration is impossible here.\"\nIt seemed to Shirone that without such expertise, the underground of the ruins would remain unexplored.\n\"If only we'd talked to brother Ares. His exploration team might have a Zoner capable of investigating this place.\"\n\"Or we could ask Professor Ethella.\"\nEthella, true to a monk, was a Zoner specialized in durability, perfect for exploring such terrain.\n\"If it's Professor Ethella, it might be possible. I'm not sure how deep it is, but she could easily break through where I reached.\"\nRian chimed in.\n\"But if that's the case, we don't need to investigate ourselves, right? I heard the headmaster gave you a hint. Maybe he meant for you to figure it out on your own?\"\nShirone and Amy exchanged glances, their mouths sealed. Sometimes, in pursuit of efficiency, they forgot the meaning behind their actions.\nAmy candidly admitted.\n\"Rian's right, but it's such a waste. If we just break through here, we wouldn't even need to explore the ruins. How about we keep thinking this way?\"\nShirone understood Amy's feelings. This journey was to find a hint for the maze, not just to play around in the ruins.\n\"Let's consider various options for now. It's not something we can do right away. It's even more intriguing now. I feel like I won't be satisfied until I see it with my own eyes.\"\nLeaving their vague imaginations about the underground, Shirone and his friends continued their exploration.\nBut the Kergos Ruins were truly just an ordinary tourist spot.\nAs they earnestly investigated, groups of men chatting and children running around with windmills seemed to mock their efforts.\n\"Amy, are we really doing the right thing?\"\n\"Don't ask me. I'm feeling like self-loathing right now.\"\nAfter checking the central temple, the last route, the group eventually halted their investigation. They couldn't find anything unusual in the surface ruins.\n\"I don't get it. The headmaster said we'd understand once we got here. But what does an ancient ruin have to do with the maze?\"\n\"Anyway, something's definitely down there. Looks like we have no choice but to explore with Spirit Zone, right?\"\nRian suddenly lit up with an idea.\n\"I've got a good idea. If we can't break through with Spirit Zone, why not dig into the ground directly? Maybe we'll find something.\"\nShirone and Amy looked at Rian incredulously before resuming their conversation.\n\"How about contacting the natives? Since they live here, there must be someone who speaks the common language.\"\n\"Hmm, that's a good point. But I doubt those people would know anything important. Maybe we should find an interpreter...\"\nRian protested, feeling slighted.\n\"Hey! Why aren't you responding to me? I said, let's dig!\"\nTess interjected.\n\"Idiot, it's a heritage site that even the autonomous government doesn't touch. You'll end up with a heavy sentence for cultural heritage destruction if you try anything like that.\"\nAfter reprimanding Rian, she turned to Shirone.\n\"What now?\"\n\"I'm not sure. Asking around seems like best bet, but that's difficult for now. We need to find an interpreter and get permission to enter the native autonomous zone.\"\n\"Really? Then, I have an immediate solution. Want to hear it?\"\n\"Yeah, definitely! What is it?\"\nRian, not wanting to be the only one embarrassed, grumbled.\n\"You're not suggesting we dig secretly, are you?\"\nTess struggled to contain her anger before continuing.\n\"Anyway. Here's my idea. While you guys were focused on the ruins, I took a look around. And I noticed something odd.\"\n\"Odd? What is it?\"\nTess scanned the surroundings.\n\"Look at the people. Most are tourists, but some aren't. They move in groups, are armed, and seem uninterested in the ruins.\"\nThe three looked around. Indeed, there were armed individuals, albeit not many, wandering about.\n\"Aha! I see!\"\n\"Yes, they're mercenaries. Why would mercenaries roam a tourist spot? Some look quite strong. There must be something in these ruins.\"\n\"And the mercenaries know about it?\"\n\"Exactly. Contacting the natives might take time, and they might not talk. But mercenaries are different. Just being here means they know something.\"\nShirone admired Tess's insight. While others focused on the ruins, she alone observed the external situation.\nIt made sense, considering Tess's background. The Elzain family had a history of producing commanders and diplomats, but their true power lay elsewhere.\nThey were spies.\nTo enemies, they were spies, but the information they sent from infiltrating various countries significantly contributed to the Thormia Kingdom's diplomatic strategies.\n'It's definitely a good idea. No, it's the only idea we have right now.'\nShirone decided to go with Tess's strategy.\n\"So, we just need to tail the mercenaries now?\"\n\"Tail them? Hmm, I'm not so sure. If we get caught by high-level mercenaries, especially those with sensory Schemas, it'll be troublesome. I might manage alone, but...\"\n\"That's a problem. I don't even know how to hide my presence. What should we do then?\"\n\"Hehe, do we really need to go looking for them? There's a place where mercenaries are common, right?\"\n\"Really? Where?\"\nTess winked and pointed somewhere.\n\"Fancy a drink in the afternoon?\"\n* * *\nOn the southwest inner wall of the ruins, several shacks made of planks lined up, including restaurants, bars, and provisions stores. While these were modest compared to regular shops, they did much better business.\nDespite being inside the ruins and having high prices, people visited for the convenience.\nShirone and his group entered a bar. They wondered who would drink in the middle of the day, but except for two tables, it was fully occupied.\nThey chose a corner spot. Amy sat next to Shirone, with Rian and Tess across from them.\n\"Are we drinking?\"\n\"We probably should order something; it is a bar, after all. But let's focus on the snacks. It's better to have our lunch here.\"\nTess ordered. Traditional Galiant island liquor came with hot noodles and minced meat.\nAfter a skimpy breakfast, the four momentarily paused their conversation to eat.\nThen, snickering sounds came from the side. Initially ignoring it, the continuous mocking laughter eventually got on their nerves.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

They're just drunk and messing around.\"\nTess tapped Rian's leg to calm him down. Although brawls among mercenaries in a tavern were common, given their profession, they seldom ended well.\n\"They're still not reacting. Surely they can hear us. They're laughing at you, idiots.\"\n\"Look at that guy's sword. It's ridiculously big, isn't it? And the woman next to him is no joke either, though I won't say where. Pff, haha!\"\nRian clenched his fists. He could tolerate insults directed at him, but mocking his friends was unforgivable.\nThen, Tess grabbed Rian's wrist. Left to his own devices, he looked ready to flip the table at any moment.\nShirone slurped his noodles, recalling what he had seen upon entering.\nWhen they had come in, there were four mercenaries at the other table: three men and one woman. It seemed one of them was an archer, and since the woman didn't appear to have a weapon, she was likely a mage.\n'An archer and a mage. That's a solid group.'\nThe mercenaries continued their jeers unabated.\n\"That blonde is pretending to eat now? Just turn around once, will you? I'm ready to throw a bottle. I'm in a really foul mood today, looking to see some blood.\"\n\"Oh, stop it. Is it fun to pick on kids?\"\nAlthough the woman tried to stop them, her heart wasn't in it. It seemed she preferred to enjoy the situation this way rather than outright mocking.\n\"Hey, kids. Don't have the guts to fight? Not ashamed in front of the girls, are you? Those guys must've been bragging about how strong they are.\"\n\"Hello? Can you hear me? If you can, answer me, or should I come over there myself?\"\nRian couldn't contain his anger. He understood it was part of the strategy, but he didn't want to endure such insults.\nYet, ultimately, Rian didn't move. His gaze met Shirone's, who looked at him with a calm expression.\n'Shirone...'\nBound by a knight's oath, Shirone remained silent. If Rian couldn't endure this level of humiliation, it would only tarnish Shirone's reputation further.\n'Right, this too is a test. As a squire, I joined this trip. It's a good opportunity to test myself.'\nOnce he resolved himself, it surprisingly became bearable. Rian had another chance to contemplate the futility of words.\nAfter about ten minutes, the mercenaries prepared to leave, believing they had achieved a perfect victory. To them, the timid boys made an excellent target for their amusement.\n\"In all my life, I've never seen such cowardly fools.\"\n\"Really, you're not even a bit sympathetic? They must have been scared, being so weak.\"\n\"Hey! You guys are lucky. You don't have to get hit. Live like that forever. You'll live long.\"\nAfter paying for their drinks, the mercenaries left. Then, the tavern owner, who had been pretending not to notice, hurried over.\n\"Are you guys okay? Damn those scoundrels. Bullying innocent kids with their foul words.\"\n\"Do you know those people?\"\n\"They've been coming around lately. They drink their fill and then harass those who don't want to fight, like you. I'd tell them not to come, but who knows what trouble they'd cause. Anyway, you did well to endure. Sometimes, enduring is winning.\"\nShirone's eyes sparkled. If there wasn't something in the ruins, a party with a mage wouldn't have come.\nTess soothed Rian. Unlike Shirone, they didn't have the skill to deceive even themselves. They had endured purely through grit.\n\"Good job, Rian. I was so nervous you'd cause a scene.\"\n\"It was risky. But we'll meet them again, right? That's why you endured.\"\n\"Right. Let's get going.\"\nShirone stood up, saying. After paying for their drinks, they left the tavern. The mercenaries were heading toward the central temple.\nInstead of tailing them, Shirone and his friends chose to observe from a high vantage point. Since an archer's Schema build often includes sensory skills, getting too close might risk detection.\nFrom the fourth floor of a temple building, Shirone watched the mercenaries. Surprisingly, they were a young party, none over thirty.\nThe well-built swordsman seemed to be the leader. The sword at his waist was so renowned that Tess could recall the craftsman's name just by its design.\nBeside him stood a man wielding a club, and behind them were a long-haired man and a woman in robes.\n\"Two warriors, one of them a swordsman. One archer, one mage. That sums it up. Even in a tourist spot, they maintain formation. They're an experienced party. Not tailing them was the right decision.\"\nThe mercenaries walked toward a stepped altar on the east side of the central temple. Shirone remembered the place. It was odd because it was guarded by a native, which had struck him as peculiar.\nThe mercenaries approached the native, with the archer gesturing and speaking, likely in the Kergos language.\nThe native looked around brusquely, clearly conscious of the onlookers. Realizing the timing was right, Shirone's group descended the stairs.\nAs the native operated a mechanism, a rectangular fissure formed on the altar, sliding inwards. A thick stone door moved aside, revealing a dark entrance.\n\"Wait! We want to go in too!\"\nThe mercenaries turned back with stiff expressions, which quickly turned to annoyance. The same kids they had tormented in the tavern were approaching.\n\"What? When did you follow us?\"\n\"Sir, can we come in with you?\"\n\"Get lost! This is a place we found! Do you even know what this is?\"\n\"Please, just...\"\nAs Shirone pleaded again, the leader drew his sword. The speed wasn't particularly fast, but it was so natural after countless repetitions.\n\"Do you want to die? Do you think we're easy? If you don't leave, I'll cut all your throats right here.\"\nShirone didn't back down this time. Unlike in the tavern, where he couldn't even turn his head, now he looked straight into their eyes. The contrast only irritated the leader further.\n\"You little...!\"\nThe native guarding the altar spoke up.\n\"Are they with you?\"\nThe leader sheathed his sword and looked at the archer, the only one who could translate.\n\"What's he saying?\"\n\"He's asking if you're together.\"\n\"Hmph! Together? Wait here while we deal with this.\"\nAs the archer relayed the leader's words, the native's eyes widened with anger. It was as if he had been insulted. He spoke authoritatively.\n\"Warriors do not fight just anywhere. Those who stain this sacred altar with blood will never enter.\"\nThe archer, licking their lips, translated.\n\"Maybe we should stop. He says we won't be allowed in if we fight here.\"\n\"Damn! Lucky brats, saving your necks twice.\"\nThe leader, no longer interested in dealing with them, sheathed his sword and entered the altar. The rest of his party followed him into the dark passage.\nShirone's group hesitated for a moment. If they had entered together, there wouldn't have been any issues, but given the current situation, the piercing gaze of the native was unsettling.\n\"If you wish to undergo the trial, then enter. The Eye of the Angel will watch over you.\"\n\"What did he say?\"\n\"I'm not sure. Maybe he's telling us to enjoy ourselves since we've come all this way? If he wanted to kick us out, he would have closed the door by now.\"\nCautiously, Shirone moved forward. The native didn't react, so the four of them, now confident, entered the dark doorway.\nIn an instant, all eight of them had disappeared, unbeknownst to the other tourists.\n***\nUpon entering the altar, Shirone first assessed the structure. Contrary to the exterior appearance, the interior was not dark, thanks to lit torches.\nA square hole led down into the ground, with stairs spiraling down along the inner wall in a right-angle spiral.\nLooking down, they could already see the mercenary party, having descended two full spirals.\nShirone quickened his pace. There might be a second gate, and it wouldn't be wise to distance themselves from the mercenaries.\nEventually, all eight of them formed a group and descended the staircase.\nThe leader was annoyed at the freeloaders who had hitched a ride on the information he had paid a hefty sum for.\nHowever, achieving their goal in this place was the priority, so any thoughts of confrontation were put aside for now.\nThe archer, who was bringing up the rear of the mercenary party, asked Shirone, who was following them, \"Are you guys out of your minds? Why are young kids like you wandering around here?\"\n\"Why are you here then?\"\n\"What, did you come here without knowing anything?\"\n\"Yeah, we don't know.\"\nThe archer was baffled by Shirone's response. Perhaps it was possible. The existence of a hidden door in the ruins was a well-known secret.\nThere was something beneath the ruins, but what it was remained unknown. This was the limit of what ordinary people interested in the ruins could speculate.\n\"Since we're here, can't you tell us? Why have you come to this place?\"\nThe archer pondered. He had scoured the information market to find the hidden door, even paying a hefty 20 gold for a high-grade cipher.\nBut now that they had passed through the door, the information had essentially lost its value.\nConsidering this, the archer, with a gleam in his eye, proposed, \"How about this? Since you've come through the door, you must have cracked a high-security cipher. That's worth at least 100 gold in monetary terms. So, I'll sell you information. Five gold per question. What do you say?\"\n\"That's okay. We'll find out when we go down anyway.\"\nShirone's dismissive reply frustrated the archer, feeling mocked by a child.\n'This insolent brat...'\nAt that moment, the leader halted. As he stopped, those following behind gradually slowed down as well.\n\"Actually, thinking about it, that might be a good idea. Do you have any idea how much trouble we went through to find this place? We can't just let you take advantage of that. If you want to go down, you'll have to pay us.\"\nShirone glanced at Amy, who shrugged, indicating agreement with whatever decision he made.\n\"Then we won't go down. We'll stay here, so you go ahead and do your business.\"\n\"This damn...!\"\nThe leader couldn't help but flare up.\nHe should have realized back in the tavern when they couldn't even turn their heads. These spineless fools were all talk.\n\"But if it's one gold per question, we might consider it.\"\n\"One gold?\"\nThe leader quickly thought it over. They couldn't get their investment back from them anyway. So, taking whatever gold they could was beneficial.\n\"Fine, one gold per question. Pay up first.\"\nShirone rummaged through his coin purse and pulled out a gold coin. Although they could have investigated separately from the mercenaries, his friends respected Shirone's judgment.\nShirone believed there was value in this situation for one gold. They knew nothing about what lay below. If one gold could prepare them in advance, it was no loss.\nFor instance, if the mercenaries knew of dangers only they were aware of, they could be led into a trap without any chance of escape. But with some explanation, they could roughly estimate the risks and difficulty of exploring the underground.\n\"Why have you come here?\"\nTo avoid broad questions that could lead to fabricated answers, Shirone targeted the core issue.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Labyrinth of time and space (1)\nHowever, the leader was also not an easy opponent.\n\"We came to meet the natives. Is that enough?\"\n\"That could be an answer, but you have to explain it. It's a breach of contract. If this continues, I won't ask more.\"\nThe leader regretted it. He intended to provoke Shirone, but ended up closing the deal too quickly.\nThe cunning magician explained further.\n\"We don't know anything else either. Because we really came just to meet the natives.\"\n\"I see.\"\nShirone looked at his friends and nodded. If they also didn't know what was underground, the risk of falling into a trap was eliminated for now.\nThinking it was a fair trade, Shirone took out an additional gold coin.\n\"Why did you come to meet the natives? Here's one gold coin.\"\nThe archer who received the money clicked his tongue as if in conflict. To be honest, it was embarrassing to tell others.\n\"We came to look for Loop. It's also distributed in the market, but we can buy it in bulk here at a much cheaper price. We plan to sell it and finance our adventures. Now, is that an answer?\"\nShirone was surprised for a moment. It was a Loop trafficking place that had nothing to do with the secrets of the ruins.\nBut the mercenaries had also found this place with fragmented information, so it was premature to conclude.\n'What is this? Completely different from what I expected? A drug trafficking place? No, I shouldn't think that way. It's a drug for ordinary people but a ritual tool for the natives. Therefore, it must be a sacred object. That means, ultimately...\nAfter finishing his thoughts, Shirone asked.\n\"By any chance, is this place connected to the autonomous area of the natives?\"\n\"What? How... Oh, damn!\"\nRealizing his mistake, the archer frowned. He had answered without receiving money.\nSo Shirone rummaged in his pocket and took out a gold coin. He had hurriedly asked, but he had no intention of playing a trick.\n\"Oh, here's one gold. Sorry for asking first.\"\nThe archer stared at Shirone's outstretched hand.\nOf course, a gold coin wasn't easy to earn, but it wasn't an amount that would terrify a mercenary who had built their own career.\n\"Darn it! Never mind. It's my mistake.\"\n\"It's not a mistake. That's how contracts work.\"\n\"I know! It's just that my pride won't let me accept it. Damn it, I can't believe I made such a mistake. I still have a long way to go.\"\n\"Then I'll consider the last question as a free service.\"\nShirone returned the gold coin without hesitation. It wasn't the attitude of a prudent student to waste it when he didn't want to accept it.\nThe archer was in trouble for no reason. At some point, he felt like a child was playing with him.\n\"Instead, let me ask you something. How did you find out? Indeed, that information is top-secret.\"\n\"Because Loop is sacred to the natives. Also, if the profit margin is large enough to make a lot of money selling Loop, it wouldn't be easy to free it. Ultimately, you'd need permission from a person with authority among the natives, and the only place where that person could be would be an autonomous area.\"\nThe archer had nothing to say. While they wondered if there was anything worth doing with the money, what they found were the ruins of Kerugo.\nShirone's brief words contained all the conclusions he had reached after spending several days and nights investigating Loop and examining the information market.\n\"Tsk! What an incredible brain this brat had. Any more questions?\"\n\"No, that's all. Now, let's go down and check.\"\nThe archer smiled bitterly. He guessed why Shirone wasn't asking. Probably, he noticed that no matter what he asked, he had nothing more to say.\nShirone and the others descended for 20 minutes. Although it spiraled, it still had great depth.\nWhen they reached the end of the stairs, a one-way corridor continued. Two natives stood at an iron door installed 10 meters ahead.\nUnlike the natives outside, they were bare-chested and barefoot beneath their pants.\nThe tattoo, starting at the navel, branched out to their faces and looked intimidating even from a distance.\nShirone didn't believe that place was an autonomous district. They would have to walk at least a few kilometers to delve into the Toa Mountain jungle.\nThe mercenaries also showed signs of tension. The archer acting as an interpreter shifted his position to the leader's side.\nAfter exchanging some coded words in the Kerugo language, the native pressed the switch.\nWhen the iron wheel turned, the door opened sideways.\n\"Wow...\"\nShirone's eyes lit up as if he had landed in a strange world.\nIt was an octagonal room carved in stone walls. On the other side of the entrance, they could see an iron door, and three men were standing guard there.\nIn the center was an octagonal altar, identical to the shape of the room, flat, and floating above each of its eight corners were spheres about 30 centimeters in diameter.\nShirone's eyes lit up as if he had landed in a strange world.\nIt was an octagonal room carved in stone walls. On the other side of the entrance, they could see an iron door, and three men were guarding it.\nIn the center was an octagonal altar, identical in shape to the room, flat, and floating over each of its eight corners were spheres about 30 centimeters in diameter.\nShirone recalled from his memory. It was a sphere he had certainly seen somewhere before.\n\"Hey, what's that?\"\nThe archer looked at Shirone with a puzzled look. He didn't even know what it was until they arrived here, and the chances of anything being familiar to him were extremely slim.\n\"Why, do you know what that is?\"\n\"That, it's definitely from Miro...\"\nThe leader moistened his lips.\n\"Hey, who do you think you are pretending to know? Do you think you remembered some bells hanging from your behind?\"\nThe leader didn't like Shirone from the tavern. He despised men who lacked the courage to fight but were boastful in front of women. Because he had no woman to impress.\n\"Miro? Did you just say Miro?\"\nAsked a native guarding the entrance. Even Shirone, who didn't know the native language, could understand the word Miro.\nThe archer, curious about the situation, reluctantly translated further.\n\"Is he asking if you know Miro?\"\n\"Yes. I met her once.\"\nWhen the archer said that, the eyes of the native distorted. When the tattoo twisted, it was like seeing a creature from a legend.\n\"You met? There can't be such a thing. That's a lie.\"\n\"No, it's not. I really met her.\"\nThe native sank into deep thought. However, as if he had reached a simple conclusion, he quickly returned to having an empty look.\n\"I judge nothing. Only the eyes of the angel will watch over you.\"\nAfter leaving behind incomprehensible words and closing the iron door, Shirone put aside his regret and turned around. He thought the beginning was from now on anyway.\nAs the mercenaries walked towards the center, a native arrived from the other side of the iron door.\nApparently, of the three natives, two were gatekeepers, and only the man approaching seemed to have a different role.\nIt was clear just from the color of the tattoo. While common people in Kerugo have red tattoos, this man's tattoo was white.\n\"This is a room of achievements and sacrifices. The eight eyes of an angel will judge you. To enter Kerugo, you must traverse the labyrinth of time and space.\"\nUpon hearing the word labyrinth, Shirone quickly turned his head. But the archer kept his mouth shut, as if he had no intention of interpreting further.\n\"Labyrinth? Did he just say labyrinth? What did that man say?\"\n\"Hey, don't misunderstand. I'm not your interpreter, why should I explain everything to you?\"\n\"You're going to tell your colleagues anyway. Tell me quickly.\"\n\"I don't want to. From now on, let's not worry about others. We came here with something to do as well.\"\nThe man with white tattoos looked at them with crossed arms. Shirone could tell just from his gestures that he was asking for a translation.\n\"Is there anyone among you who knows the ancient language?\"\n\"Oh, I know a little.\"\n\"Then translate. The opportunities are the same for everyone. The eyes of an angel watch over everything in the labyrinth of Time and Space.\"\n\"Why should I do that? They're not our companions. I don't know what you're judging, but please separate them.\"\n\"No. From the moment you entered the room of achievements and sacrifices, you are one. Will you achieve or sacrifice? That is the only choice you have.\"\n\"Damn it! We had bad luck. What are we going to do with these kids?\"\nAs the conversation dragged on, the magician moved forward.\n\"What is he exactly saying? Tell me now.\"\nWith no other choice, the archer conveyed the conversation they had heard so far.\nThe mercenaries who heard everything were irritated. If they knew this was going to happen, they should have gotten rid of Shirone's party before coming here.\n\"Will the Angel's eyes judge us? Does that mean they assess our abilities? And group us with these brats? Isn't this too unfair for us?\"\nAmy's eyes narrowed as the magician complained.\n\"Hey, you keep calling us brats, how do you know if we have skills or not?\"\n\"Ho Ho Ho! Ah, so it's like that? Do you want to cling to us after taking advantage? Just so you know, if we mess things up because of you, you better be prepared.\"\n\"Hmph! Do whatever you want. We never planned to team up with you anyway.\"\nThe magician smiled coldly. Who did they think they were? She was a novice mage, one of the most promising newcomers in the mercenary world.\nShe didn't get along with inferior mercenaries, so her colleagues were only formed by people of similar age and level.\nOn the other hand, those ignorant children were obviously students who learned swordsmanship and magic somewhere.\nWhat you learn in the academy is a world apart from real combat. For mercenaries who easily risk their lives, she could be sure they wouldn't hold her back, even compared to a certified mage.\n'Ha, just wait and see, brats. I'll make you cry and beg once we've passed through here.\nThanks to the women's disputes, they were able to bury petty feelings.\nAs the eight awaited further instructions, the man with the white tattoo began to explain.\n\"There are two conditions to pass through the door. You can test your ability or send a person through the sacrifice of another.\"\nAs soon as Shirone heard the translation, he asked a question.\n\"What do you mean by testing? What do we need to specifically test?\"\n\"Hey! Stop meddling! I'm not going to translate for you!\"\n\"He said we have to do this together. Ask him already.\"\nThe archer, who had nothing to say, gritted his teeth and translated. The man with the white tattoo nodded and continued speaking.\n\"Descendant of a warrior, ascend to the altar of judgment and cast your spell on one of the eight orbs. The divine language will respond. If a red light lights up, you have failed. If a white light comes out, you have passed.\"\nShirone kept asking questions, as if he had hired the archer as his personal interpreter.\n\"Is there a limit to the number of attempts? For example, can a person try as many times as they want?\"\n\"You can keep trying until you're exhausted. If a passerby comes out, everyone can go to Kerugo. If no one passes, everyone must return. This is the will of the labyrinth and the mission of the people of Kerugo.\"\n\"You said achievement and sacrifice. What does 'sacrifice' mean?\"\n\"A person can pass with the blood of another.\"\n\"Do you mean someone has to die?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nUpon hearing that, Shirone lost himself in his thoughts. It is possible to challenge as many times as one wants, and even if only one person succeeds, everyone can pass.\nBut what if nobody succeeds? They would have no choice but to pass through the door with the sacrifice of a companion. And it was one life for each passage.\n'Something is strange. Was it necessary to go to Kerugo with such cruelty? It doesn't make sense to kill a comrade just to get to Loop. There must be something more in Kerugo. The mercenaries must have come here without knowing the true secret of this underground place.\nShirone indicated to continue the interpretation. The information gathered so far was useful, so the archer agreed without a word.\n\"Is there any restriction on the sacrifice? Like bringing someone else from outside or using the corpse of a dead person?\"\n\"No. From the moment you entered the room, you are one. The door will never open until everyone agrees. Therefore, that question is meaningless.\"\ncomment 2 comment\nVote",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Labyrinth of time and space (2)\nShirone realized the situation. The rule was more restrictive and dangerous than expected. It was much more difficult than he thought to unify most opinions.\nHe didn't know what was in Kerugo, but if there was something worth risking his life for, there was a possibility of an internal struggle.\n\"What? Was it that simple? How about this? We'll take care of the four kids and go in. I never knew there was such an easy way.\"\nThe leader looked back at Shirone and pursed his lips. It was a look expecting a fearful expression, but for Shirone, it was pitiable.\nOnce the rule was heard, it was the right way to cooperate, even if they didn't like it.\nA leader who led with excitement from the start could not only ruin the organization but also endanger the lives of their comrades.\n\"This person is not qualified to be a leader. The other people seem at least halfway decent.\nAs expected, his comrades intervened to dissuade him. If they achieved success, they could pass unconditionally, so considering sacrifice was a later issue.\n\"Let's start. How long are we going to stay here?\"\n\"Tch! You're a lucky kid.\"\nThe man with the white tattoo headed to the side of the altar. He crossed his arms where he could see the eight spheres.\n\"My explanation ends here. Come out one by one and demonstrate your abilities.\"\nShirone's group and the mercenaries exchanged glances. They were calculating who would benefit from going first.\nThe leader unsheathed his sword and pointed at Shirone.\n\"Hey, you go first. Of course, I don't expect much, but do your best so we can have an idea. You never know. Maybe it'll take you to Kerugo.\"\n\"I don't want to. Why do you decide that unilaterally?\"\n\"What's wrong with that? I really don't like you! Should I kill you right now? Should I kill you and go in?\"\n\"You keep causing trouble. From now on, we need to integrate opinions. Didn't you hear that if a single person refuses, we can't leave? Although there's no limit to the number of attempts, disadvantages can be applied. For those who have attempted it, traps like anti-magic can be triggered. Since we're all novices, we must make careful decisions and determine the order.\"\n\"This, this little impudent brat...!\"\nThe leader was about to lose his temper. He probably hated that the kid answered him back, but the fact that he couldn't refute was most annoying.\nBut the mage had a different idea. Of course, there might not be particular restrictions, but unless one could see the future, it was good to consider all conceivable variables.\n\"The kid is right. Let's decide the order. How will we do it?\"\nShirone looked back at the Time and Space Maze on the altar. Having experienced the phenomenon called 'spot', he could approximately predict the current situation.\n\"That sphere could probably absorb almost infinite energy. It's standard to send back powerful mages and let the warriors go first.\"\n\"Does it have to be so violent? Why the conclusion?\"\n\"It's the best skill that warrior descendants can test. Besides, looking at the altar, it has a structural characteristic that something is implemented towards a specific target. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the device was made with the goal of striking.\"\n\"I'm convinced. Then let's decide the order. Do we start with the swordsman first?\"\nSaid the mage, looking back at the leader. But he shook his head as if he were annoyed.\n\"No, I'll go later. What does that kid know how to talk about? It's a simple game. Just go out and destroy it.\"\n\"Huh, our leader is like this, what should we do?\"\n\"It doesn't matter. Then we'll send a swordsman from our side.\"\nShirone looked back at the swordsman on his side. Both Rian and Tess were sword warriors. But it was predictable who would go without looking.\nOnce the first attempt was over, a lot of information could be obtained. It was such a heavy mission and such a dangerous role that there was no way Rian would send Tess first.\n\"I'll go first. Of course, it might end on my turn. Haha!\"\n\"Well, baseless confidence is... Anyway, be careful. Don't be complacent.\"\nSupported by Tess, Rian looked around at the center of the altar.\nThe feeling was definitely different from when seen from the outside. It felt like the spheres in all directions were watching him.\n\"Hey! Hurry up! Are you scared already?\"\nRian couldn't even hear the leader's words. He had been figuring out what to do since Shirone designated him.\n'In a way, I'm at the forefront. I must gather all the information I can on my turn. Right, Shirone?'\nRian walked towards the northern sphere. It wasn't as transparent as it seemed from afar. Should I say it was filled with a misty fog?\n\"Hmm, you said there's no limit to the number of attempts, right?\"\nRian leaned towards the sphere and tapped it with the back of his hand. When there was no particular response, he gradually increased the force and repeated it.\nAt some point, the mist within the sphere dissipated, and the transparent sphere displayed the number 1.\n\"Eh? Is that a number?\"\nShirone recalled the explanation heard from the man with the white tattoo.\n\"Oh, so the language of God means numbers. Rian, just in case, let's step back.\"\nRian calmly took a few steps backward. Shortly after, the sphere emitted a red light, illuminating the room.\nThat meant failure.\nEveryone wondered what would happen next, but that was it. They observed for about three more seconds, but nothing particularly threatening occurred.\n\"Ah, so if a white light rises, that means a pass, right?\"\nAfter grasping the rules, Rian returned to the center of the altar and finally drew his straight sword.\nWhen the size of the sword hidden by the giant Rian was revealed, the mercenaries were startled. If all of that was iron, it was a weight that couldn't be lifted unless it was with Schema.\n\"Rian! Hit it with all your might!\"\nTess, somewhat relaxed, waved her arm and cheered. Just knowing that the attempt didn't harm the person was a great success.\n\"Don't worry. I'll crush it in one blow.\"\nRian lowered his stance as he held the sword with both hands. Embarrassingly, his heart was pounding hard.\nBut wasn't this the best situation to start with the sword his grandfather granted him? Moreover, it was a two-handed swing attack with all his heart.\n\"Alright! Here I go!\"\nRian charged at full speed and brought down his greatsword. Instead of the powerful blast everyone expected, a low sound wave was heard.\nThe Labyrinth of Time and Space didn't tremble, and there was no reaction. It would have been impossible without absorbing all the force.\n\"Phew!\"\nRian maintained the posture of striking the Labyrinth of Time and Space. He could clearly feel the energy draining from his entire body.\nBut more than that, he was curious about the number that would appear on the sphere. Was it a pass or a fail?\nThe sphere turned transparent, revealing the number 241. Considering the impact when the number 1 appeared, it seemed like he did fairly well.\nUnfortunately, however, the sphere emitted a red light.\n\"Oh, it's a real shame! Shirone, can I try it once more?\"\nRian became enthusiastic. Initially, he thought it would be okay to just explore, but when he received a judgment failure, it felt like he was being ignored, and his gut churned.\n\"Are you okay? Your legs look shaky.\"\n\"Oh, this? It absorbs all the power. It's not dangerous because it doesn't put too much strain on my body. I'll recover in a while.\"\nShirone nodded at the new information.\n\"Ah, I see. It's a disadvantage, but not severe. Hmm.\"\n\"Anyway, I'm really upset. If only I could have used Schema, I would have been able to pass.\"\nAt Rian's words, the warrior from the mercenaries' group burst into laughter.\n\"Hahaha! Have you been complaining even though you can't use Schema? This is ridiculous. Step aside, I'll try it this time.\"\nWhen the warrior intervened, Rian had no choice but to leave the altar. But even as he walked away, he murmured.\n'Just one more time.'\n\"The kid got 241, right? So, should I aim for around 2000?\"\nThe warrior rolled up his sleeves and wielded his main weapon, a mace. He also had an axe at his waist, but seeing Rian's attempt, a mace seemed an easy way to deliver a blow.\nThe warrior took a deep breath and tensed all the muscles in his body. Although the muscle fibers didn't significantly thicken, when those changes took place throughout his body, his size increased noticeably.\n\"Tess, that guy...\"\n\"That's right. He's a Schema user. He probably has a structure that enhances strength. Well, it's a natural choice for a warrior.\"\n\"Yaaaaaa! Here I go!\"\nThe warrior let out a roar as loud as his size and charged. At the same time, his hand spun the mace rapidly.\nAlthough it's not a two-handed weapon, adding rotational power could produce comparable destructive force.\nThe warrior swung his mace downward as if he were going to kill the world's enemy.\nThe action stopped with a low rumble. Like Rian, the feeling of power deprivation paralyzed his entire body.\n\"Huu! Huu! It's over! I did it right!\"\nThe warrior stepped back, breathing heavily. Because the technique seemed impressive, those who watched were expectant.\nThe number 248 appeared.\n\"What—What? Nonsense! 248? Only 7 points more than that kid? Is this thing broken?\"\nTess walked towards the altar, assuming a stance.\n\"Do you think this is a cheap toy from a corner store? Get down quickly! The red light is already on!\"\n\"No, I can't accept this! Just once more, I'll try once more!\"\n\"Alright, then come out! Whether you want to challenge again or not, first you need to regain your strength!\"\nThe warrior wrinkled his face as if facing an injustice and turned his body. He couldn't understand it at all.\nHe had never lost in terms of strength since he was a child. It's 248 even with a strength-enhancing build.\n\"Eh? Wait a second.\"\nThe warrior looked at Rian as if it were absurd. Didn't that boy say he couldn't use Schema?\nBut 241 points? In other words, only with his physical strength, he showed the same power as the warrior who had Schema a moment ago.\n\"What-What? This makes no sense! You can use Schema, right? You lied, didn't you?\"\n\"Why would I lie about something to brag about? If you fail, just wait silently for the next turn.\"\nRian didn't want to chatter about his disqualification. His current interest was how far his friend Tess could go.\nTess stood at the center of the altar and unsheathed her sword. There was a fresh sound like sliding on ice. People were mesmerized by the elegant movement, a textbook-perfect motion.\n\"Hmm, I'll try it, but wouldn't it be a disadvantage for my rapier?\"\n\"No, not necessarily. It absorbs all the power. I didn't even feel a recoil when I swung it down. I doubt the sword will bend.\"\n\"Really? Then, should I stab it with all my strength?\"\n\"If you're worried, do you want to use my sword? It's heavy, but you can handle it with Schema, right?\"\nTess raised her sword and bent it with her fingers. The rapier bounced with a tinkling sound, vibrating rapidly like the flapping of a hummingbird's wings.\n\"No, I want to test it with my own sword skill. To be honest, this is quite interesting.\"\nTess walked to the end of the altar and stopped at a point from where she could see the Labyrinth of Time and Space diagonally.\nAcceleration of concentration through Schema. There won't be vital points on the sphere, but the speed generated by compressing body movement becomes power entirely.\nTess charged in a silence more terrifying than a scream. As expected from her, who scored the highest in the balance test, her angle made her almost level with the ground.\nThe moment she reached the target, her body trembled as if creating a residual image, and the rapier grazing the ground soared.\nAs she stabbed the sphere with a perfect thrusting motion, there was a flash of light that burst at the tip of her sword.\nWhile ordinary sword handling reaches maximum acceleration in the middle point, Tess's stabbing-focused sword handling reaches its peak in the sword's \"final speed.\"\nAs these characteristics are maximized through Schema, an exciting optical illusion occurs.\ncomment 0 comment\nVote",

All eyes were focused on the sphere as the number appeared. 442. It was the first time someone had broken into the 400s.\nThe result, however, remained to be seen. Tess looked on without showing any emotion. After a moment, the number vanished, and the sphere turned red.\n\"Sigh, it didn't work. What a pity.\"\nTess turned around without hesitation, understanding the frustration of the others who had insisted on trying again, but deeming it beneath her dignity to do the same.\n\"Damn it! Is this thing really broken? How could a sabre thrust score higher than a bludgeon?\"\nThe warrior raged. It might wound their pride to be bested by a woman, given their reliance on brute strength, but from Tess's perspective, it was nothing short of pathetic.\n\"Why bother arguing over the same failures? And managing strength is completely different from merely increasing it! Instead of just lifting rocks, maybe practice some technique?\"\n\"What? Are you mocking my strength? Can't you see these muscles? Do you have anything like this?\"\nTess turned away as if disgusted by the sight.\n\"Is it the end of the line for the swordsmen? Then it's my turn.\"\nThe archer stepped forward, drawing his longbow.\nGiven the results so far, it seemed unlikely that physical force alone would yield high scores.\nAlthough arrows were also a form of physical attack, the archer was confident. Despite the cost, not demonstrating his skill would invite ridicule.\n\"You're planning to use that, I see.\"\nAs the mage noted, the archer removed the arrowhead from one of his arrows and took out a distinctively shaped arrowhead from a sturdy leather pouch at his waist.\nThe tip wasn't sharp but rounded like an almond, and it wasn't the usual steel color but a violet hue.\n\"Hmm, good. Shall I give this a try?\"\nAmy's eyes lit up at the sight of the unique arrowhead. It was clear that this arrow could deliver a much stronger impact than ordinary ones.\n\"Look, Shirone, it's a Magic Energy Bullet.\"\n\"A what?\"\nShirone was familiar with Magic Energy Bullets from his lessons. They were made by infusing magic into Magistone, a rare mineral extracted in tiny amounts from nature.\nThe principles behind Magistone's formation remained a mystery, but its chemical reaction to specific natural phenomena was well established. For example, Magistone related to lightning could be collected from dry highlands or rainforests where thunderstorms were common.\nOnce harvested, the mineral exhibited an affinity for certain phenomena, and magi-engineers had succeeded in storing magic within it.\nHowever, such achievements were merely lab science, far from practical application.\nTo utilize Magistone in everyday life required material science to convert it into energy and mechanical engineering to consume it in various forms.\nThe entire process from mining to consumer use represented a significant industry, employing numerous people and vast capital.\nAnd among the top fields in this industry was the creation of lethal weapons, such as Magic Energy Bullets.\n\"How does it compare to the magic we use?\"\n\"It's not particularly powerful. The real advantage is that it allows non-mages to use magic. Each of these probably costs about 1 gold, even though the Magistone in an arrowhead weighs only about 10 grams.\"\nShirone was astounded. Just one shot cost 1 gold. How much money was spent on the 3,000 archers' barrage of Magic Energy Bullets mentioned in history books?\n\"Amazing. I wouldn't dare to use something that expensive.\"\n\"We're mages, so it's natural to think about cost. But in a real battle, having Magic Energy Bullets can be a matter of life and death. A single shot could save you from a hopeless situation.\"\n\"I see. But you seem to know a lot about it. They don't teach us this in class.\"\n\"I only found out recently. My eldest brother visited home because of a deal involving archery units and Magic Energy Bullets. He's been suspecting corruption in the deal for over a year but couldn't pinpoint where the money was leaking. Out of curiosity, I asked Nade, and he knew everything from the process to the technology.\"\n\"Nade? When did you ask him about that?\"\n\"You were unconscious, and school was suspended. I heard rumors he created an Invisibility Cloak. If he could do that, it's quite a feat. Nade could probably make Magic Energy Bullets too.\"\n\"What? He can make those expensive things himself?\"\n\"Didn't you know? Are you really best friends?\"\n\"Ha, well, Nade always shows me weird stuff. Like a never-stopping carriage or a doll that dances twelve funny dances.\"\n\"Having the technology doesn't mean you can use it. It's a state monopoly, so without a license, it's illegal arms manufacturing. Still, ask him to make one for you when you're bored. If you ask, he'll probably do it. Magistone can be bought cheaply from the Alchemy Foundation.\"\nAs Shirone and Amy conversed, the archer disengaged the safety on the Magic Energy Bullet.\nImpact-reactive Magic Energy Bullets must always be secured with a safety device when not in a danger zone. An accidental activation from, say, being hit by a carriage could blow off a leg.\n\"Hey, I'm going to use a Magic Energy Bullet now. It's called a Lightning Arrow. Stay back, or you might get hit.\"\nShirone and his group retreated as far as possible within the viewing range. They anticipated the Mysterious Sphere to absorb the magical power, but caution was warranted.\nAs the archer drew the bowstring taut, the tension in the air seemed to rise. Then, with a twang, he released, and the arrow whistled as it struck the Mysterious Sphere.\nThe Magic Energy Bullet reacted, unleashing a powerful lightning bolt.\nHowever, the blue electricity occurred only within the sphere. As expected, it absorbed even the magical power.\nAfter about 3 seconds of flashing, the sphere calmed down. Everyone awaited the score, thinking it was worth the cost.\n1,020.\nA four-digit score appeared, and the archer's lips curled up.\nYet, the outcome was still a failure. Despite scoring over a thousand, the archer descended from the altar, lamenting the wasted money.\n\"Damn! What a waste of money, huh?\"\n\"It's not entirely a loss. You seem unharmed, at least. Are you okay?\"\nPrompted by Amy's question, the archer checked his condition. Unlike the swordsmen who felt weakened in their legs, he felt fine.\n\"Huh? Right. It seems the Mysterious Sphere doesn't drain an archer's strength. It must only measure impact damage.\"\n\"That's another piece of information. Will you try again?\"\nThe archer eyed the sphere intently. He was pleased with the high score but was not keen on wasting more money.\n\"No, thanks. Using different attributes doesn't seem to make much difference, and it's unlikely I'll pass with this. Just a waste of Magic Energy Bullets.\"\nAmy easily agreed.\n\"Then it's the mages' turn, right? Shirone, who should go first? You or me?\"\nThe mercenary mage smirked and pointed at Amy.\n\"Why don't you give it a try? I'm next, so we can clearly see who's stronger.\"\nAmy accepted the challenge without hesitation, remembering she still had scores to settle with that woman.\n\"Alright. Shirone, I'll go first then?\"\n\"Yes, show your skills. Good luck!\nShirone believed Amy had a chance. Her specialty was attack magic, particularly the fire element, and her Target Type emphasized single-shot power.\nFire element magic has always been a powerhouse in the magic world due to its destructive capability, despite the myriad of magic types and trends.\nHowever, Amy proceeded with caution, calculating which spell to cast while standing at the altar.\n\"It's trickier than I thought. Sniper Mode is too close for comfort. Should I just go with a Target Type attack? But that might reduce the power.\"\nUnlike the Absolute Zero limit of the Ice element, the Fire element had no upper limit on temperature increase.\nMany mages chose fire for its limitless potential, but even high-level ones struggled to breach the 1,000C barrier.\nYet, fire remained powerful because most things on the planet were under its dominion.\nLife, trees, and most metals except iron succumbed to heat energy.\nHowever, no element is perfect, and fire magic had its downside: lightness.\nDespite its enormous energy, its impact was lacking. This is often compensated by incorporating Air elements to enhance impact, with Flame Strike being a prime example.\n\"But Flame Strike becomes more powerful with distance. Maybe focusing on fire would be better in this case?\"\nConsidering the Mysterious Sphere measured both impact and magical power, opting for a Pure Type that could purely increase temperature might be a strategic move.\nDeciding on her approach, Amy settled on \"Fireball.\"\nTwo flames ignited in her palms. Originally spherical, they took on a droplet shape due to the nature of fire, soaring upwards.\nThe density of magically created fire differed from real fire, allowing fire mages to control its density and thus its temperature. Higher temperatures also meant a wider range of the flame.\nAmy twirled her wrists, holding the flames, and launched a lava-red fireball, trailing like a comet.\nAs the fire engulfed the Mysterious Sphere, it seemed to inhale the blaze, creating a whirlwind of flames within.\nThe score finally appeared, drawing gasps from the crowd.\n3,270.\nIt was a record-breaking score, and it seemed unlikely to be surpassed given the results so far.\nThe archer realized Shirone's group was not just ordinary students. His Lightning Arrow, enhanced by a Magic Energy Bullet, scored 1,020. But a basic spell like Fireball tripled that power, indicating a significant difference in magical levels.\nBut Amy frowned deeply. Despite the high score, the Mysterious Sphere fiercely emitted a red light, indicating failure.\n\"What the hell? What more does it want?\"\nFrustration boiled over at the unexpected failure.\n\"Ho ho ho! Is it my turn now, after the kid?\"\n\"Hold on! I'll try Sniper Mode. I'll settle this once and for all today.\"\nShirone approached with a sympathetic smile, knowing Amy's competitive spirit would not allow her to step down without a direct intervention.\n\"Calm down first. Anger will only scatter your focus and lower your score.\"\n\"Argh, seriously! Shirone, I'm definitely trying again, okay?\"\nAs Amy returned to the altar, the mercenary mage looked back at her.\n\"How coincidental, another fire mage? I specialize in fire magic too. To match your level, I'll also use Fireball.\"\nHah, as if you had a choice.\"\nAmy snorted dismissively. After all, losers shouldn't talk back. She was annoyed even at the thought of responding.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 141: The Labyrinth of Time (4)\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nChapter 141: The Labyrinth of Time (4)\nThe mage returned with a serious expression and conjured a sphere of fire between her palms.\nUnlike Amy's multiple spheres, having just one made it easier to increase its density.\n\"He's focusing the firepower, isn't he? Desperate to win.\"\nAs Amy predicted, the mage was tense. Of course, she had never quantified the power of her magic, so it was uncertain how high she could score.\nBut it seemed unlikely that she would struggle to triple the output of a Lightning Arrow.\n\"Ta-ha!\"\nThe mage thrust her hands forward vigorously.\nUnder the control of the mage's Spirit Zone, inertia was ignored, so there was no need for special motions to cast magic.\nYet, adopting a shooting stance was the mage's flailing attempt to increase her focus even by a bit.\nAmy followed the Fireball with her eyes. The fabric of the maze absorbed the fire, creating a whirlwind of flames.\nThe mage looked at the orb with hopeful eyes, but soon her face fell.\nThe score was 1,330. Just 310 points higher than the Lightning Arrow.\nA significant difference for a swordsman judged solely on physical prowess, but in the realm of magic where phenomena were manipulated, it was much of a muchness.\n\"How could this be? No! It's because the firepower was dispersed. It should have exceeded 2,000.\"\nNo one responded to the mage's voice.\nThe difference was too great. No matter what, she couldn't surpass Amy's score.\nThe archer thought it was already hopeless to pass through here. The girl who scored over 3,000 points must be the highest level here.\nEven a mage revered as sacred in the mercenary world scored only 1,330. That she exhibited more than double that magical power meant she was at least the most talented of her age group.\nRian and Tess thought similarly.\nNot to belittle Shirone's skills, but Amy was his senior at school. If she, an advanced student, failed, it was expected that Shirone would struggle to surpass her.\nAmy alone didn't think this was the end.\n\"Shirone, you need to take this seriously. It might just be a narrow miss.\"\n\"Got it. I'll give it my best.\"\nThe leader snickered, dripping with sarcasm.\n\"Ha! What good is giving your best? It's about the results. It's over. Let's pack up and go.\"\nShirone realized something from the leader's readiness to give up without trying. The fabric of the maze, known as the Eye of the Angel. What was her purpose in creating such an altar?\nThe fleeting insight had to be shelved for now. The priority was to focus on the task at hand.\nShirone closed his eyes and performed the Sequence Method. A faint point of light emerged in front of him. Then, countless photons swarmed towards the center, increasing in size.\n\"What, what's this? Photon Output? How is that supposed to make an impact?\"\nThe mage exclaimed in disbelief. Yet, she couldn't take her eyes off Shirone due to the unusual force not typically seen in regular Photon Output.\nAs Shirone opened his eyes wide, a fist-sized white sphere vibrated as if furious.\nGritting his teeth, Shirone fired the Photon Cannon. The beam of light stretched at near-light speed, striking the fabric of the maze as if to shatter it.\nEven the mercenaries, who initially had low expectations, were captivated by the brilliance of the flash, anxiously awaiting the score.\n4,783.\nThe unexpected number made everyone's eyes widen.\nEspecially the mage and archer, who were appalled, as Shirone had used Photon Output.\nLight holds no special firepower. It's defined solely by the product of speed and mass.\nYet, the score was 4,783. To put it in perspective, it was akin to the impact of 20 warriors, each opting for a strength-enhancement build, striking with all their might.\n\"What in the world are those?\"\nThe mercenaries began to feel uneasy. They didn't know the principle behind Shirone's magic, but it was clear that none among them could withstand it.\nHowever, there was no time to ponder further thoughts. Despite the tremendous impact, the fabric of the maze proudly emitted a red light, indicating failure.\nShirone felt drained. What kind of orb was this?\nPerhaps 5,000 points were the passing threshold. But it seemed unlikely that the Photon Cannon could be more powerful than this.\n\"I wish I could try one more time.\"\nAmy covered her mouth, chuckling as if she had been waiting.\n\"Ho-ho! Do you understand how I feel? I felt the same. But really, how many points are needed to pass?\"\n\"I don't know. Maybe a laser would work.\"\n\"Oh, right! A laser can accumulate energy.\"\nShirone's laser vibrated molecules, increasing its destructive power over time. Theoretically, it could destroy anything, making it perfect for this kind of assessment.\nThere's a next turn. We'll have to try after a full round. What about you? Are you not going to try?\"\nShirone addressed the leader, but he just stood there, grimacing.\nAs the scores escalated with each turn, the thought of stepping forward seemed impossible. As a swordsman, his best score might barely reach around 200 points.\n\"Damn it! It's over! We have nothing left but to go back.\"\nThe leader walked towards the entrance with urgent strides, but no matter how much he twisted the doorknob, the iron door wouldn't budge.\nThe group turned around in confusion to see a man with white tattoos saying,\n\"You are one. If one receives an assessment, all must be assessed. You cannot leave before that.\"\nUnderstanding dawned on the group with the archer's translation. The rule wasn't just about unifying will but also about actions aligning.\n\"Ah! This is so annoying! Why keep insisting on something so obviously futile?\"\nComplaints poured from the leader's mouth, but to leave, he had no choice but to prove his worth.\n'So it is. This rule is truly cruel.'\nShirone felt a chill.\nWhy hadn't he realized it until now? All the rules explained by the man with white tattoos were based on one premise.\nTrust among comrades.\nIt was a peculiar evaluation method. In terms of firepower alone, mages had an advantage over Swordsmen.\nBut that didn't mean Swordsmen were weaker than mages. Even if a mage could shatter rocks and cleave the earth, a Swordsman specialized in biological combat could slice through that mage in one stroke.\nMoreover, measuring the power of magic was problematic. If Amy, specializing in long-range magic, had attempted Sniper Mode, she might have scored much higher. But this place didn't consider such variables.\nThe narrow octagonal altar and the eight orbs.\n'Why eight? Just for aesthetic balance? But in reality, didn't we all evaluate using just one orb?'\nWhat was most peculiar was the divine language. The fabric of the maze measured impact and displayed it numerically.\nWhy? What was the meaning behind it?\nIf it was to distinguish those heading to Kergos, indicating pass or fail would suffice.\nThe score variance according to one's specialty could be vast. In such a situation, requiring everyone to be evaluated created a single emotion.\n'Obsession with scores. Anxiety when a comrade scores higher. Disdain when scoring lower. Without a perfect understanding of each other's roles, discord is inevitable. And what awaits at the end of that rule is...'\nThe sacrifice of one to send another.\nShirone took a deep breath. What was the maze thinking? This evaluation was designed to pit them against each other.\n\"Shirone, let's just leave after this guy's done.\"\nAmy whispered, tension evident in her eyes, perhaps sharing the same thoughts.\nRian and Tess also wore grave expressions, sensitive to the atmosphere emphasizing comradeship, and quickly grasped the intention behind the rule, which clearly disadvantaged Swordsmen.\nAs expected, the leader was at a loss. He could sense a change in his fellow mercenaries' gaze.\n\"Huff, huff, aaaaah!\"\nWithout pausing to breathe, the leader charged. Although he was sprinting, to Shirone, it seemed as if he was fleeing from something.\nWas his Schema fully opened? Where was his sword positioned? How far was the target? Without knowing any of these, his steps faltered, and he stumbled.\nGasping for breath, he swung his sword in a fall, and the imprecise blade struck beside the orb, bouncing off.\n\"Damn!\"\nThe leader, attempting to escape the maze and the altar, hurriedly regained his balance and turned back.\nThe number 32 floated there.\nBut no one laughed. The comrades' expressions were as if they had faced a tremendous humiliation.\n\"So what! It wouldn't have passed anyway! I did it, so let's just leave!\"\nThe leader exited the altar with a forced bravado, but his steps were directed away from his comrades.\n'That party is over. They'll probably disband once they leave here.'\nShirone thought it was time to give up. It was regrettable not to try again, but he couldn't do more with the trust among the mercenaries broken.\n\"Could you translate for me, please?\"\nShirone asked the archer. Even if they were to leave, he wanted to confirm one thing.\nThe archer, seemingly disillusioned by the current situation, readily agreed.\n\"Sure. What do you want to ask?\"\n\"Has anyone ever passed through this gate before?\"\nThe man with white tattoos nodded firmly.\n\"It's a gate meant for passing. Its not a trap.\"\n\"How many points are needed to pass through the fabric of the maze?\"\n\"The eight eyes of the angel will judge you.\"\nThe man repeated his initial statement. It all came down to the fabric of the maze's decision.\nAfter pondering for a moment, Shirone asked one last question.\n\"What's the passing rate of those who've come here?\"\n\"I don't know exactly. Sometimes many come, sometimes just one. From what I've seen, about one in ten pass. The rate seems higher when they're alone.\"\nShirone was startled. The rate was much higher than expected.\nHe had thought there might be no passers at all, assuming the maze's design by Miro wasn't just about assessing skills.\nOf course, that view hadn't changed. But the man with white tattoos clearly stated there were passers, at a significant rate of 10 percent.\nShirone's smiling lips quivered. A shiver ran up his spine.\n\"Shirone, why the sudden change?\"\nHeadmaster is really a trickster.\"\n\"Huh? What are you talking about all of a sudden?\"\nAlthough Amy was puzzled by his words, Shirone was too absorbed to respond. Alpheas's voice seemed to echo in his head.\n-Miro's world can be roughly understood.\nNot roughly, but clearly. If one couldn't overcome such a challenge, they weren't meant to learn about Miro.\n'Sorry, Headmasterr, but I've come to know.'\nShirone hadn't given up. He was determined to pass through here during the trip.\nAmy, noticing Shirone's silence, guessed his thoughts.\n'Shirone hasn't given up.'\nThen she wouldn't either. Initially, she followed just to aid Shirone, but now she genuinely wanted to know about this woman named Miro.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Hey, open this iron door!\"\nThe leader banged on the iron door. His pride was crushed, and he could no longer bear the cold stares of his comrades.\n\"Does everyone agree?\"\nThe man asked, but no interpretation was needed. The mercenaries nodded without a word and headed towards the door.\nThey were in a miserable state. Entering this place was truly a bad decision. They tried to make a quick profit through a loophole but ended up damaging their morale and wasting their money.\n\"Come on, let's get out of here. This way.\"\nThe mercenaries' attitude had changed from before. They felt a huge sense of defeat, but given the extraordinary skills of the children, it was best to be cautious around them.\nHowever, Shirone and his group didn't move and just watched the mercenaries.\nThe mage became slightly anxious. A bad premonition always seemed to come true, as Amy coldly stated,\n\"We don't want to leave yet.\"\nThe mercenaries all turned their heads at once. Their eyes flickered with a mix of anger, confusion, and fear.\nThe relatively quick-witted mage swallowed her anger and tried to appease with a soothing tone.\n\"Why don't you want to leave? It's over, isn't it? We're too tired to do any more.\"\n\"That's your problem. Once we're in here, we're all in this together. Didn't you know? It's not okay to just leave on your own without considering our opinion.\"\nThe mage was upset but had no choice but to appease Amy for the time being.\n\"Alright, I didn't consider that. Let's leave then.\"\n\"Sorry, but we can't do that. We need to pass through here and head to Kergos.\"\n\"But there's no way to go! Ah...!\"\nThe woman's face turned pale. There was a way.\nThis was a room of achievement and sacrifice. It wasn't necessary to only prove achievement.\nThe man with white tattoos softly said,\n\"Will you leave or stay? If you wish to prove your skill, pass through the fabric of the maze. If you want to prove sacrifice, 4 sacrifices will send 4 through.\"\n\"Eh? What did he say?\"\nBefore Rian could even ask, the archer translated. Of course, the translation was completely distorted and transformed.\n\"Ah, if you're done, just go already.\"\nAmy smiled and said,\n\"Strange, I heard it clearly. '4 sacrifices will send 4 through.'\"\nShock filled the archer's eyes.\n\"You... you knew the native language?\"\n\"What are you talking about? It's something I heard when we first came here. Do you think we're fools who can't even remember what we heard once?\"\nThe archer stood dumbfounded. Ah, so that's it? No, but isn't it strange to remember something you heard for the first time?\n\"Anyway, 4 sacrifices. One, two, three, four. That makes 4 of you.\"\nThe mercenaries' faces drained of color. The girl was seriously considering sacrificing someone.\nRian and Tess also felt the tension as if in real combat. Especially Tess, who was hopping mad at the sudden ferocity of the cute Amy.\n\"Shirone, is this really okay? Eek, Amy is so scary.\"\n\"It's fine. She's doing it on purpose.\"\n\"On purpose? It doesn't seem like it.\"\n\"Just wait and see. Amy will handle it well.\"\nThe mercenaries looked at each other. If it came to a fight, they would surely lose. Rian and the warrior were evenly matched, and Tess was stronger than the leader.\nMoreover, they were overwhelmed in the mage's combat, and the archer's presence was useless in front of Shirone's photon magic.\n\"Come on, if you dare. You all seem reluctant to be sacrificed. Anyway, you have to do your best.\"\n\"Why are you doing this? Is it because of what we did in the bar?\"\nAmy tilted her head teasingly.\n\"Uh-huh?\"\nThe archer realized that a half-hearted response wouldn't diffuse the situation. He walked over to where Shirone and his group were and bowed politely.\n\"I'm sorry! We underestimated you and made a mistake. Please forgive us this once. Hey, you guys come and apologize too.\"\nAs the archer turned back with his head bowed, the other three came forward reluctantly. But given the stakes, their apologies were sincerely polite.\n\"I'm sorry! I was too arrogant. Please forgive me.\"\n\"We won't do it again. We've learned a lot from this incident. Can we forget the mistake we made in the bar?\"\nAmy frowned and said,\n\"Hmm, I really can't tell. What exactly did you do to us? Wait, the bar? Were you there? Strange, why didn't I see you?\"\nThe mercenaries' faces turned red with embarrassment. Their pride was not just crushed but thrown to the ground and trampled.\nThis time, even Shirone couldn't help but shiver at Amy's persistence.\n'If you anger Amy, this is what happens.'\nAmy and Tess were the ones who received the most ridicule in the bar.\nThey were subjected to all sorts of insults and humiliations just because they were women. Amy was not someone who would forget such an incident, even if decades passed before she could get her revenge.\nBut in a way, it was a classic example of a mage's obsession with efficiency.\nEven if it wasn't necessary to go that far, a mage would be annoyed by not utilizing a given advantage to its fullest.\nThat's why people often say mages are quirky. Indeed, many mages lack humanity.\nHowever, it was this relentless pursuit of efficiency that allowed magic to develop to this day and will continue to do so in the future.\n'What the hell are they asking us to do? Damn it.'\nThe mercenaries were at a loss, merely bowing their heads. The sound of grinding teeth seemed almost audible.\nAmy finally got to the point.\n\"Let's make a deal. If you accept, we might leave together.\"\n\"What kind of...?\"\n\"You said we need a password to enter here, right? What's the password?\"\nThe archer realized. These kids planned to attempt again. They would conduct numerous investigations and ensure sufficient possibilities before returning here.\n\"Kertias, ro haima. Acrasias, widmias benshen. That's the password.\"\n\"What does it mean?\"\n\"Knock on my door. And it shall be opened.\"\nAmy turned to the man with white tattoos and repeated the ancient language he had provided without missing a beat.\n\"Kertias, ro haima. Acrasias, widmias benshen?\"\nThe natives guarding the exit nodded in recognition of Amy's intention.\nThe archer felt a mix of annoyance and admiration. How meticulous she was!\n\"Damn it! Trust me a little! Would I lie in this situation?\"\n\"No one's accusing you. It doesn't hurt to be sure. Anyway, thanks.\"\nAmy, as if nothing had happened, cheerfully returned to her friends. Tess clicked her tongue at the chameleon-like change in emotions.\n\"Was all this just to get the password? I was so nervous, thinking we were really going to fight.\"\n\"Hehe, if we're coming back anyway, it's good to know. Let's leave now.\"\nShirone and his group, as well as the mercenaries, expressed their intention to leave, prompting the man with white tattoos to pull a lever next to the iron door.\nThe entrance vibrated violently, leading the way out.\nAs when they entered, the mercenaries went up the stairs first.\nBut the atmosphere was entirely different this time. They all hung their heads like defeated soldiers, and no one spoke.\nShirone's group was also silent.\nThey didn't manage to enter the autonomous district, but strategizing for that would come later.\nMore pressing were their thoughts on the day's experiences with the fabric of the maze.\n'The fabric of the maze. What was Miro's purpose in creating this device? And why such a cruel rule? What lies in Kergos that warrants this? Was there always a connection between Kergos and Miro? I want to know. Perhaps Miro is...'\nAs Shirone analyzed Miro, Amy was lost in her thoughts.\n'There's not just one way to investigate a ruin. Let's devise all possible strategies. Shirone seems to have his own ideas, but we can't rule out exploring underground with the Spirit Zone. Even if we pass, there's the issue of interpretation. Once we're outside, we need to find someone who can interpret. There must be someone local.'\nTess was also impressed by the place, especially the ability to quantify one's power.\n'The impact of a triple-bladed sword is indeed stronger than a blunt weapon. But ultimately, it couldn't match magic. Can a swordsman pass through that door? If so, to what extent? Shirone's magic approached 5,000, which is about ten times my strike. If the pass mark is roughly doubled, could Father make it? Ugh, if only I knew the cut-off, I could set a goal. Since Shirone said he'd come back, I'll investigate more then.'\nRian, bringing up the rear, was also silent, deeply furrowed in thought.\n'What should I eat when I get out?'\nAfter about 30 minutes of walking, Shirone and his group arrived at the surface altar.\nKnocking from the inside, a native opened the door, but the learned inertia from below made them tense.\nStepping outside, the fresh air cleansed their lungs. It felt as though the sun hanging in the sky wasn't the same one from just a few hours ago.\nShirone's group and the mercenaries split in opposite directions, but they didn't lose sight of each other. Shirone's group wanted to savor the aftermath, while the mercenaries were on the brink of collapse.\nShirone summed up the day.\n\"What should we do now? We got more results than expected, so shall we end today's exploration here?\"\nAmy was in full agreement.\n\"Let's do that. I'm tired after using some strength for a change. We should go back early and plan our next move.\"\nRian, as if he'd discovered something great, suggested,\n\"How about a bowl of noodles before that? That place earlier was delicious.\"\nTess glared at Rian.\n\"Do you only eat noodles? At least offer something like buckwheat noodles. That's why you're so simple.\"\n\"What's wrong with that? I've given it a lot of thought!\"\n\"What's the use? You're just going in circles.\"\nWhile Rian and Tess argued over the menu, the mercenaries approached. Shirone's group stopped their conversation and turned to look at them.\nThe warrior, the mage, and the archer were there, but the leader had disappeared.\nThe mercenaries exchanged glances, unsure of what to say. Finally, the mage, deemed the most suitable, was pushed forward, though she seemed awkward about the situation.\n\"Um... would you like to join our mercenary group?\"\n\"Mercenary group?\"\n\"Yes. Being a mercenary has its perks. Not just honor, but also a lot of money. Especially with your skills, you'd become stars right away. As you saw, our leader has left us... Oh, you could be the new leader if you want. We'll follow any orders, and if others join, we'll treat them really well. What do you say?\"\nShirone stared intently into the mage's eager eyes and immediately responded without a second thought.\n\"No, thank you.\"\nWith that, he turned and walked away, his friends following without hesitation.\n\"Let's just go for the noodles. It was delicious, wasn't it?\"\n\"No. You just want to fill your stomach no matter what. If we wait a bit, we can eat something much better.\"\nThe mercenaries watched Shirone's group walk away, dumbfounded.\nThe mage's face fell, and she let out a sigh filled with sorrow.\n\"Ah, the misfortune of my life.\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 143: The ‘Parrot’ (1)\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nChapter 143: The Parrot (1)\nIn the royal tavern, there was a secret space accessible only to Falcoa, even within the Freeman organization.\nThis place was the Lupe manufacturing site.\n\"Those insolent brats! Think this is the end?\"\nStanding beside Falcoa, Zis's heart was racing. He had witnessed Falcoa's eccentricities for a long time, but the current situation was far from normal.\n'What is he planning? Why did he suddenly bring me here?'\nZis, who had just finished his usual day of beckoning customers at the port, was grabbed by Falcoa's men and brought here.\nA day had passed since Shirone's group caused a stir in the tavern and left, yet Falcoa's anger seemed to have not subsided.\n\"Ha, just wait and see. I won't let them get away with this.\"\nFalcoa laughed ominously, his face twisting into a grimace. The faces of the infuriating Shirone and his group haunted his mind.\nAmy was, of course, the one he despised the most.\nFalcoa nearly drew his sword on the spot when Amy defiantly downed the drink laced with Lupe and flaunted her red eyes.\nZis glanced at Falcoa, feeling terrified.\nFalcoa was fiddling with a device that ground Lupe into powder.\nBy compressing the roots of Lupe and extracting the juice, then grinding it until all moisture evaporated, only a fine powder remained.\nBut could this really be called a drug?\nTraditionally, the proper use of Lupe was to chew the root and neutralize it with saliva. However, what Falcoa was creating was nothing short of a potent chemical toxin, designed solely to maximize its effects.\n\"Zis, we need to make another visit.\"\n\"Where to?\"\n\"To that girl, Amy. It worked once, so it should work again. Don't tell me it's impossible. You've seen my condition; you know what I'm capable of.\"\nZis swallowed hard. He had anticipated Falcoa's desire for revenge, but he hadn't expected it to go this far.\nZis suspected Amy belonged to a prominent family. If Falcoa targeted her, it wouldn't be long before Galiant Island itself faced dire consequences.\n\"Are you planning to get her addicted?\n\"Addiction? Foolish boy. That girl will never become addicted. As if the Red-eyed Ruler of the continent would fall to something as trivial as Lupe.\"\n\"Then why bother? It's just stirring up trouble for nothing.\"\nZis tried to persuade Falcoa, clinging to a sliver of hope.\nBut Falcoa seemed beyond reasoning.\n\"You imbecile. Can't you see? Because she won't get addicted, this plan will succeed.\"\nFalcoa packed the refined Lupe powder into greaseproof paper and poured it all into a pre-prepared cup of water.\nZis's breath caught in his throat.\nHe had never used Lupe, but he knew how it was consumed.\nTypically, one root was enough for two hours of chewing. But Falcoa had just mixed in three times that amount into the water.\nMoreover, being in a liquid form meant that the effects, which would normally take six hours to manifest, would hit all at once.\n\"You can't mean...\"\n\"Yes, that's exactly what I intend. I'll make her drink this again. She'll confidently accept it, thinking it's harmless. But with this amount of Lupe, she won't stand a chance. You understand, don't you?\"\n\"Why would you do that? If she dies, you can't sell her.\"\n\"Haha, it doesn't matter. Just bring me her corpse.\"\nFalcoa bottled the Lupe solution. When the solution mixed with the soda in the bottle, it took on the appearance of a pretty jade-colored cocktail.\n\"Here, take it. It's simple. Just lure her out saying you have something to discuss, then make her drink this. Load her into the carriage and bring her here. Can you do that?\"\nZis stared at the glass bottle with bloodshot eyes, trembling with fear.\nAmy wouldn't refuse it. And if she took even a sip, it would be over.\n\"What are you waiting for? Don't want it? Or do you want to drink it yourself?\"\nFalcoa's murderous intent weighed heavily on Zis, feeling like a tangible hand gripping his throat.\n\"Stop it, you filth.\"\n\"What?\"\nFalcoa doubted his ears.\nWas the effect of Lupe still lingering? That couldn't be. He had become desensitized to Lupe's effects, thanks to his constant use.\n\"What did you just say? Say it again.\"\nSometimes, when faced with an utterly absurd situation, one might find themselves eerily calm. That was Falcoa's state now.\nHis anger was secondary; first, he needed to confirm if this greenhorn really meant what he said.\nZis found himself unable to repeat his words.\nThis might have been his last chance. If he apologized now, he might get away with just being half-dead.\n'But...'\nZis couldn't bring himself to kneel before Falcoa.\n\"I don't dislike kids like you.\"\nThe words Amy had said to him in the carriage, smiling, rendered Zis immobile.\nWhy? All he had to do was admit his weakness.\nThe moment he begged Falcoa for forgiveness, it felt as if he would be betraying Amy, turning her into a liar, so the words wouldn't come out.\n\"Stop it, you disgusting creature. You're not even human anymore, drugged up and unable to distinguish right from wrong! You're such a piece of trash that calling you trash would be a compliment!\"\nZis felt dizzy. The mix of euphoria and fear was overwhelming, making it impossible to maintain his composure, and his consciousness began to fade.\nYet, he spoke out.\nJust like Shirone would. Like someone who believed they had no future.\nFalcoa's fist swung towards Zis's delirious face with lightning speed.\n\"Ugh!\"\nDarkness enveloped him, and he finally grasped his reality. A grim future awaited Zis, one that could only be described as hellish.\n\"You crazy bastard! What's wrong with your head!\"\nFalcoa finally showed his true colors, brutally beating Zis.\nIt wasn't just a beating to intimidate; he was kicking Zis's body as if he truly intended to kill him.\nHad Falcoa activated his Schema, Zis's body would have been mashed like meat hanging in a butcher's shop.\n\"Die! Die! Die!\"\nZis couldn't even scream.\nThe feeling of his body being smashed was fleeting; soon, he felt nothing. Only the shock beyond the realm of pain reached him.\n\"Huff, right. Killing someone like you wouldn't even be fun.\"\nFalcoa regained his composure, but this only signaled greater misfortune for Zis.\n\"Cough! Cough!\"\nFalcoa grabbed Zis by the hair and lifted him up. The sensation of his neck vertebrae cracking was the least of his concerns, given his battered state.\n\"Alright, then I have a plan too.\"\nWithout Zis, Falcoa couldn't trap Amy, but he had grown tired of considering such trifles.\n\"Touching, Zis. To think a lowlife like such courage. Seems like you've taken a fancy to that girl, but I'll grant your wish. I won't touch her. How about that? Are you happy now?\"\n\"Please... just this once, have mercy.\"\nZis was in tears. He knew what Falcoa was planning.\n\"Yuna, was it? Your sister's name. From now on, you'll regret the decision you made today for the rest of your life.\"\n\"Please, not Yuna... just spare her... Cough!\"\nFalcoa threw Zis's head to the ground as if he were discarding a useless toy. Zis's face bounced off the floor with a thud, then plummeted down again. That single blow knocked him unconscious.\n\"Ha, this turned out to be quite entertaining.\"\nFalcoa had no intention of sparing Amy even though he had shifted his target to Yuna. He planned to bring Yuna to his hideout and torment her, then use her to blackmail Zis. Threatening him with his sister's life would leave Zis with no choice but to comply.\n\"Bring that girl Yuna to the hideout, now!\"\nFalcoa roared at his subordinates with rage, then bit into a whole root of Lupe, chewing it viciously.\n***\nBy the time Shirone and his companions arrived back at the villa, midnight was drawing near. Given the distance, they had stopped for dinner on their way back.\nAlthough they didn't achieve their primary goal in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, they learned a lot.\nTheir conversation never waned, and soon they began to share stories close to their hearts.\n\"Oh, you want to become a soldier?\"\nHearing about Amy's aspirations, Tess was surprised, having never imagined that Amy would aim for a military career.\nGiven that Amy was a fire mage and had honed her sniper mode, she was perfectly suited for a combat mage role.\nHowever, Tess knew Amy as someone who, contrary to appearances, was delicate and kind-hearted. The thought of such a person heading into battle and taking down numerous enemies was unimaginable.\n\"I'm actually worried. I thought Amy would be more suited for a feminine profession.\"\n\"Eh? Me in a feminine job? I've never heard that before, not even in school.\"\nTess could guess how spirited Amy must have been in her school days. But being good at reading people, she knew Amy's true nature.\n\"Hehe, I have a knack for espionage, you know. The girl Amy is actually very delicate and feminine.\"\nAmy smiled subtly. She had never considered herself feminine, but she couldn't completely deny it either.\nNo matter how spirited she was, the military was predominantly male, and she wasn't sure she could adapt.\n\"To be honest, I'm not sure. I chose fire magic because targeting is my strength. That led me to the most suitable profession given my major. Of course, I have a positive view of the military. Being a soldier isn't just about fighting on the battlefield.\"\n\"That's true. There are supply officers, and if you join the strategy command, your future is bright. Wait! What about this?\"\nTess clapped her hands as if struck by an idea, and Amy looked at her curiously.\n\"Yes? What is it?\"\nTess extended her index and middle fingers, mimicking someone walking on a beach at night, targeting someone.\n\"What about becoming a spy? With your cognitive skills and long-range attacking as your forte, Amy? Plus, you have the most important weapon for espionage.\"\n\"The most important weapon? What's that?\"\nAmy's eyes sparkled with curiosity. Considering her career worries, learning about an unknown strength was exciting.\n\"Your beautiful face. For a female spy, beauty is essential. No man in the world dislikes a beautiful woman.\"\nTess teased with a mischievous smile, causing Amy to turn her head away, looking dejected.\n\"Ah, that's it? I got my hopes up for nothing.\"\n\"Hehe, sorry. But it wasn't entirely a joke. Appearance is a priority when selecting national spies. Your look would definitely work in dealing with people. So think about it seriously. I'll strongly recommend you to our family.\"\n\"No, that's okay. I'll trust in my magical abilities.\"\nAmy's face flushed red. Though she responded gruffly, she didn't seem entirely displeased by the compliment.\n'Aw, how cute. See, how feminine she is?'\nTo Tess, Amy was a friend who provided endless amusement. She pondered how to tease her more when a genuine question crossed her mind.\n\"But what happens after graduation?\"\n\"Ah? We take the official exams and look for jobs, of course.\"\n\"No, I mean Shirone.\"\n\"Shirone? Why bring him up?\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 144: The ‘Parrot’ (2)\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nChapter 144: The Parrot (2)\nAt first, Amy blinked, not understanding, then, catching on to what Tess meant, she turned her head away with an embarrassed look.\n\"Suddenly talking nonsense. What does Shirone have to do with my graduation?\"\n\"But it's true. Shirone is still in Class Four, and you're in the Advanced Class. Plus, with your skills, you'll definitely be able to graduate next year. Then, won't you leave for the capital?\"\nAt the mention of leaving for the capital, Amy's heart suddenly started racing.\nShe had never thought about it before. But realistically, it wasn't something that would happen in the far-off future.\n\"It has nothing to do with me.\"\n\"Oh, is that so?\"\nAmy spoke in a cold voice, but Tess couldn't feel any sincerity in her tone.\nAfter a moment of silence, Amy, as Tess had expected, spilled what was on her mind.\n\"Still... we made a promise. That he would definitely catch up to me. That was the condition for speaking comfortably to each other.\"\nTess pursed her lips in surprise and let out a 'Hooh.' If they had gone as far as making such a promise, their feelings for each other couldn't be taken lightly.\n\"Hmm. Of course, Shirone is amazing. But he moved up to Class Four in just half a year, right? No matter how much of a genius he is, it can't be that easy to graduate, can it?\"\nAmy knew too. The achievements Shirone had made so far were something ordinary people couldn't even imitate.\nAn 18-year-old boy who had lived without knowing magic had reached Class Four in just half a year.\nIt might be greedy to expect more from him.\nAmy looked at Shirone's back, who was ahead. Had he ever thought about this? If he really graduated, would Shirone miss her?\nIt was difficult to take a step ahead among people who were doing their best. But Shirone had already taken several steps ahead. Maybe he was running, burning all his talent to its limit.\nKnowing this, Amy couldn't help but feel upset. She glared at Shirone's back with a piercing gaze and conveyed in her heart.\n'Hurry up and catch up. If you fall behind, I really won't let it go.'\nAfter finishing their secretive conversation, the two hurried their steps to catch up with Shirone and Rian.\nReunited, Shirone's group shared various stories as they climbed the hill towards the villa. Suddenly, Tess stopped and warned in a low voice.\n\"Shh. Quiet.\"\n\"Why all of a sudden...?\"\nAmy looked back at Tess, initially thinking it was another one of her pranks. But seeing her serious expression, she immediately kept quiet.\nTess, who trained in saber techniques, focused on the sensory build among the Schemas.\nThough not as much as an archer, her sensitivity to stimuli far exceeded that of an ordinary person.\nShirone and Rian, catching the atmosphere belatedly, approached her. Tess gestured for them to be quiet with a finger to her lips.\n\"There's someone in front of the villa. Judging by the lung capacity, it's a man. If he's of average build, then probably between 170 to 175 cm tall.\"\nRian grasped the hilt of the straight sword on his back. Having caused a commotion at the palace the night before, the possibility of an intruder was high.\n\"I don't feel any hostility, but better be prepared just in case.\"\nTess walked silently like a cat, and the others slowly followed her.\nUpon reaching the villa, they saw someone standing in front of the door. The silhouette, seen only in outline, stood motionless, looking elsewhere.\nShirone's group advanced without letting their guard down. But before they took a few steps, the silhouette collapsed to the ground, losing strength.\nThe group exchanged glances and hurried to the door.\nThe nighttime visitor was Zis. His face was so battered it was hard to find a spot that wasn't injured.\nShirone supported Zis by the side. Just the touch made Zis cringe in pain.\n\"Ugh! Ah, it hurts!\"\n\"Are you okay? Who did this to you?\"\n\"Get, get away!\"\nZis pushed Shirone away. He didn't want to show weakness in front of Amy, at least. Knowing who had put him in this state, he couldn't get angry.\nZis slumped down with his back against the door. As Shirone approached to support him again, Zis forced a painful smile and chuckled.\n\"Out playing till this time? You're really living the life.\"\nDespite Zis's critical condition, Tess remained on guard until the end.\nHe was the one who had lured Amy into danger with a strange method the night before. Even if he was injured, she had no intention of trusting him.\nOn the other hand, Amy approached without hesitation. More than trusting Zis, she had some idea of the situation as someone familiar with the rules of this world.\n\"What happened to you? Tell me. Did Falcoa do this?\"\nInstead of answering Amy, Zis raised his head and glared fiercely at Shirone.\nHe felt good being able to stare down Shirone confidently.\nIt was Amy's life he had protected by hitting rock bottom in his life. Wouldn't it be okay for him to be the protagonist for at least a minute to explain the whole story?\n\"Hey, you. Listen carefully. Take good care of your woman.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nShirone tilted his head in confusion, but Zis scowled fiercely. He had been suspecting since the conversation in the carriage. The fact that he couldn't clearly define the relationship between the two.\nThat made him even angrier. He didn't understand why he had to suffer because of Shirone, who had everything he didn't.\n\"It's about Amy, you bastard! If you've messed up like that, see it through to the end!\"\n\"I have no idea what you're talking about. Amy and I have been together all day today.\"\nZis recalled Falcoa's orders. Even now, it seemed absurd, making him involuntarily chuckle.\n\"Bring her, even if you have to kill her. Mix the Lupe of Mortality into a drink and give it to Amy. She'll have to drink it anyway.\"\n\"This is insane...!\"\nRian clenched his fists like a tiger, his eyes wide with rage. The others felt the same anger.\nOf course, Amy wasn't foolish enough not to know Falcoa's trickery. But considering her pride and the abilities of the Red Eye, it could have led to a terrible situation.\nTess shuddered with a chill at the thought.\n\"Crazy. I knew he wasn't normal, but he really went too far.\"\nShirone's voice trembled like never before.\n\"So, that drink...\"\n\"I threw it in the trash. I told him I couldn't do it. Do you get it now? I was the one who protected Amy. Not you, but me! I risked my life to protect her! Do you understand, you idiot?\"\nShirone's group was silent, unable to retort, not even wanting to.\nShirone knelt to be eye-level with Zis.\n\"Zis, we are...\"\n\"That's why!\"\nShirone's words, screaming at the top of his lungs. Shouting with all his might, he felt a pain as if his ribs were breaking. But the reason for his tears pouring out like a waterfall wasn't the pain.\n\"That's why...\"\nZis collapsed flat on the ground. Then, pressing his forehead to the earth, he sobbed out his plea.\n\"Please, help me.\"\nShirone's group couldn't say a word, merely looking down at Zis prostrate before them.\n\"My sister... I think she's been taken. When I came to my senses and went to the shop, they said she'd gone home, but she wasn't there either. So I've been looking for her... but no one would help me. Please, find my sister. I beg you.\"\nZis, having made his plea to Shirone's group, burst into tears, repeating 'please' over and over.\nShirone watched, feeling both anger and sorrow seep into him.\nHow long had he wandered the streets in such a mess? Who would care about a back-alley girl? He could vividly imagine Zis calling out his sister's name, ignored by everyone's indifference.\n\"My sister. My everything...\"\n\"Do you have any idea where they might have taken your sister?\"\nZis lifted his head. He had come seeking help because there was no one else, but even wanting to help, they'd have to confront the Freeman organization, the rulers of the island.\nIt wasn't easy to promise help in a situation where even magicians couldn't guarantee their own lives, so he had pleaded with the readiness to give up even his life.\nBut Shirone didn't hesitate to ask where his sister had been taken.\n\"Thank you! Thank you so much!\"\nZis bowed his head repeatedly, expressing his gratitude in the only way he knew how.\nWatching with disapproval, Amy grabbed Zis's arm and helped him to his feet.\n\"Enough. Do it as you usually do. Acting like this suddenly makes us look even weirder. Let's go inside. We'll start by treating your wounds and talk.\"\n\"But my sister...\"\n\"Idiot! If we rush in recklessly, we'll be the ones in trouble! If she was taken on her way home, we still have plenty of time. If necessary, we'll fly there, so let's start with the treatment.\"\nAmy led Zis into the villa, holding him up. While the girl, Yuna, was a concern, attending to the wounds came first.\nAs Zis lay on the bed, Tess began to remove his clothes. With her extensive training in various combat support skills, she could tell Zis's condition at a glance. Judging by the pattern of the bruises, his ribs were definitely damaged.\nTess pressed on various parts of Zis's body.\n\"Ugh! Ah, it hurts.\"\n\"Of course, it hurts. You've been beaten up like this. They really didn't hold back. Just bear with it a little. I need to check your organs too.\"\nTess pressed down hard on Zis's abdomen. The organs, protected by skin and muscle, couldn't be checked unless pressed down with such brute force.\n\"Ughhhhh!\"\nIt must have been excruciating, but Zis endured desperately. He knew the faster the treatment finished, the sooner he could go to save Yuna.\n\"Lucky. There's a crack in the ribs, but the rest are just simple bruises. The organs are safe too. You're surprisingly tough.\"\nZis smiled bitterly. Although he wasn't good at fighting, years of being attacked by various nobles had made him quite resilient to beatings.\nAs Tess wrapped the bandages, Zis explained the situation.\nConsidering Yuna's work hours and the time she would have returned home, the abduction would have occurred around two hours ago.\n\"They must have taken her to their hideout, so she wouldn't have arrived yet. But I'm not even hoping for us to be on time. I just... if only Yuna is alive...\"\nAmy interrupted Zis's words.\n\"No, it's okay. They'll be moving by carriage, so if we borrow horses and ride, we can easily catch up. Where exactly is their hideout? It seems quite far from here.\"\n\"I've never been there myself. I heard it's on the north side of the island, but I'm not even sure about that.\"\n\"No, it must be there.\"\nShirone was certain that place was the hideout. The north side of the island boasted a natural cliff. When they first arrived, they had to navigate around the island to dock at the southern port because of it.\nMoreover, being close to the Kergos Autonomous District, it was a place beyond the government's reach. There couldn't be a better environment for a hideout.\n\"Alright, then let's go. Can you stay here alone?\"\nZis nodded. Even if his condition worsened, he was determined to send Shirone off.\nHis expression remained grim, however, burdened by the guilt of pushing unrelated people into danger.\n\"Are you sure you're okay? I know it's ironic to say this after asking for help, but those guys are really strong.\"\nAmy snorted. Even if Zis's sister wasn't involved, she had been planning to deal with Falcoa eventually.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Don't worry and just wait for us to return.\"\nZis shared what he knew. He didn't want to scare them off, but he couldn't bear the guilt if he let them go without warning.\n\"They appeared out of nowhere and took over the island in just three months. They're not just any organization. From what I heard from one of Falcoa's direct subordinates, they were called the Parrot Thieves' Guild before coming to this island.\"\n\"The Parrot Thieves' Guild?\"\nShirone's eyes widened. Amy also seemed surprised by this revelation.\nThe Parrot Thieves' Guild was the same band that Lucas, who had stormed the school with Arcane, belonged to.\nAmy had witnessed Lucas's prowess. Memories resurfaced of him, unfazed by the combined attacks of Yiruki and Nade, thanks to the effect of Abyss Nova wearing off.\nHad it not been for Siena's unexpected intervention, it would have been impossible for all the students to remain unharmed.\nRegardless of their identity, the situation remained unchanged. With an innocent girl's life at stake, it was crucial to leave as soon as possible.\n\"It's okay. We've even fought and won against the vice leader of the Parrot Thieves' Guild.\"\nZis bit his lip, holding back tears.\n\"Thank you. To go to such lengths for someone like me...\"\nThe nobles Zis had encountered until now never considered back-alley scum as humans.\nPerhaps it was to be expected. Why would those who monopolize the world's wealth and fame pay any attention to the denizens of the dark?\nBut these people were different. They were willing to fight for him, someone they could have easily taken advantage of with mere words.\n\"How can I ever repay this kindness...\"\nAs Zis continued to express his gratitude, Amy, slightly embarrassed, placed her hands on her hips and sighed.\n\"Enough already. If you think about it, you saved me. If anything, we're the ones who should be thanking you.\"\n\"But to go to such lengths for something so dangerous...\"\n\"No need to overthink it. We're not strangers anymore. And since you've manfully asked for help, we're obliged to respond.\"\nZis looked at Amy with a baffled expression.\nHow could his actions be considered manly in this situation? If anything, shouldn't it be the opposite?\n\"Stop it, I don't need your pity. Manly? What man would beg so abjectly? My pride is completely shattered.\"\n\"What are you talking about? You set aside your pride to ask for help for your sister.\"\n\"Well, yes, but...\"\nAmy smiled and gently pushed Zis's forehead.\n\"That's exactly what makes you a real man, you fool.\"\nAs Amy walked away, leaving those words behind, Zis felt a lump in his throat and tears threatened to spill, but he felt he needed to hold back, not wanting to dampen their resolve.\nRian patted Zis on the shoulder and followed Amy.\n\"Don't worry. Since you saved my friend, we'll definitely save your sister.\"\nTess added,\n\"But when we return, you owe us a proper tour. We'll make sure to collect our dues for the hard work.\"\nShirone turned back to Zis at the door and said,\n\"Trust us. We'll bring your sister back safely.\"\nUnable to hold back any longer, Zis burst into tears. Ignoring his bandaged wounds, he ran to the door and shouted after Shirone's departing figures.\n\"Be careful! Really, you must be careful! I won't forgive you if you don't come back safely!\"\nShirone's group didn't look back, but their quickening pace was a more potent response than any words could convey.\n* * *\nShirone's group rented four horses from the western commercial district. Tess had argued that chasing in a slow-moving carriage would make it impossible to keep up with the time.\nDespite the bold promises to Zis, the actual situation was grim.\nThe revelation of the Freeman organization's true identity weighed heavily on their minds.\nLucas, a member of the Parrot Thieves' Guild, was a B-class criminal.\nCriminals' classifications aren't just based on the severity of their crimes but also on their combat abilities.\nEven a serial killer causing chaos in the city wouldn't be confined in the western prison, Inferno, if they were a mentally unstable individual without significant physical strength.\nShirone sensed they were entangled in a serious matter.\nSomething had definitely been off. After the Arcane incident, the Parrot Thieves' Guild's leader was said to be an A-class criminal currently on the run.\nSo who were they up against now, if not Freeman, the leader of the organization they were about to confront?\n\"Amy, are you sure it's the Parrot Thieves' Guild? Doesn't something feel off?\"\n\"I had the same thought. How could a wanted organization set up base in a tourist destination? Especially since the pursuit of the Parrot Thieves' Guild would have intensified after the Arcane incident.\"\nTess, riding alongside them, joined the conversation.\n\"It's not the Parrot Thieves' Guild.\"\n\"Huh? Do you know something?\"\n\"It's likely that 'Parrot Thieves' Guild' is just the name they adopted after crossing into the Thormia Kingdom. Their original name was the Parrot Mercenary Band.\"\n\"Mercenary Band? They were mercenaries? Then Lucas too?\"\n\"I can't be certain about him, but I do know how they ended up becoming a band of thieves.\"\n\"Why is that?\"\nShirone asked immediately, but Tess was hesitant to share.\nIn essence, it was a common tale, yet she feared that revealing information about their adversaries could demoralize Shirone in the face of the upcoming fierce battle.\n\"Tess, if you know something, please share.\"\nUrged by Amy's curiosity, Tess reluctantly began to explain.\n\"There was a significant incident related to the Parrot Mercenary Band on the continent about seven years ago. Have you heard of the Flower Vase Incident in the Iron Kingdom?\"\n\"Oh? I know about it. We learned about it in school.\"\nShirone recounted what he knew. At a noble gathering in the Iron Kingdom, a senatorial noble named Baltes declared that he would give his cherished vase to anyone who could prove they were braver than him.\nA commoner noble named Moos took up the challenge. His method was to throw the vase, which was the prize, against the wall.\nOn the surface, it seemed like a trivial incident among drunk nobles, but digging deeper revealed a long-festering political conflict.\n\"The Iron Kingdom's noble system is bicameral. The Senate conveys the king's will, and the House represents the commoners. While this made Iron a wealthy kingdom, it also led to severe conflicts among the nobles.\"\nInvolving commoners in politics weakens the authority of the nobles. However, as the number of empowered commoners increases, the nation's wealth grows exponentially.\n\"The Senate's power comes from authority, and the House's power from taxes. Ultimately, a conflict between the two factions was inevitable. When Moos, a commoner noble, acted arrogantly, Baltes was seething. Although the situation was brushed off at the time, the resentment likely lingered.\"\n\"But how does that relate to the Parrot Thieves' Guild, or the Parrot Mercenary Band?\"\n\"Three months after the vase incident, a civil war erupted in Moos's territory. An unidentified army invaded. From intelligence reports, the instigator of the civil war was Baltes. He hired mercenaries instead of his soldiers to attack Moos.\"\n\"So, could it be that among those mercenaries...\"\n\"Exactly. They were part of the Parrot Mercenary Band. Although many mercenary bands participated, the Parrot Mercenary Band demonstrated overwhelming power and breached Moos's defenses. However, just as they were about to break into the inner city, Baltes's soldiers suddenly poured in from the rear, ambushing the mercenaries.\"\nShirone could imagine the situation at the time.\nHire mercenaries to attack the enemy and then use your soldiers to attack the mercenaries. This strategy allowed one to claim both victory and innocence.\n\"From the start, Baltes never intended to annihilate Moos. The power of the House, backed by the commoners, was stronger than anticipated. He just wanted to teach Moos a lesson. The mercenaries were disposable from the beginning. Attack the territory with them, then eliminate them, a perfect plan.\"\n\"But wouldn't the commoner nobles not just stand by after that?\"\n\"Of course, but they couldn't make it public. After all, the Senate is composed of nobles under the king's protection. There must have been some agreement. The fact that Moos hasn't mentioned the incident even after seven years suggests he received some compensation from Baltes.\"\nRian frowned, clearly displeased.\n\"So the mercenaries were the only ones abandoned? I can't understand the thinking of politicians. It goes against the code of chivalry.\"\n\"It's natural to feel that way. But I've been exposed to far worse intelligence within my family. The world doesn't always operate according to our beliefs.\"\nEveryone fell silent at Tess's words. They knew that someday they would have to step into the world where colossal forces were at play. The Flower Vase Incident wasn't their affair, but it wasn't entirely unrelated either.\n\"Regardless, they were abandoned. The mercenaries who attacked Moos's territory were all executed under the guise of treason, and naturally, the Parrot Mercenary Band disbanded.\"\nAmy spoke up.\n\"But they survived in the end. That's why they must have sought asylum in the Thormia Kingdom.\"\n\"Right. The mercenary band disbanded, but a few skilled members escaped the battlefield. It's conjecture from here, but perhaps it was difficult for those branded as traitors to maintain a mercenary band? So they degenerated into a band of thieves and eventually, being labeled as criminals, they drifted to this island.\"\nTess's reasoning was sound, but Shirone felt uneasy.\nAbove all, for those fleeing under the charge of national treason to maintain the name \"Parrot,\" they would need considerable capital, power, and an exceptionally capable leader.\n\"Maybe it's just a coincidence in name? After all, there are numerous guilds in the world, and 'Parrot' isn't an uncommon name.\"\nTess hesitated to respond. The situation she had feared was unfolding.\n\"Shirone, remember the girl you mentioned last time?\"\n\"Huh? Marsha?\nAfter rescuing Amy from the palace and eating late-night snacks, Shirone had briefly mentioned Marsha.\nOf course, he hadn't divulged every detail.\nEspecially the story of how he was nearly harmed by his foster father was something he intended to take to his grave.\n\"I thought it was speculation when I heard Zis's words, but there's a reason it can't be. The name of the mercenary band's leader at that time came to mind.\"\n\"The leader's name? Not Freeman?\"\n\"Clay Marsha. That was the leader's name.\"\nAs Tess finally revealed this, Shirone's expression turned blank. The kind Marsha, like an older sister to him, and the mercenary band's leader Marsha didn't align in his mind.\n\"I initially thought it was a coincidence but the story of being raised by mercenaries made me wonder. Then, hearing Zis's words, I became certain. The ones ruling this island are the remnants of the A-class mercenary band betrayed seven years ago in the Iron Kingdom.\"\n\"That's impossible. How could miss Marsha...? I explained before. She's not the kind to do such bad things.\"\n\"Is that really what you think? The Marsha you're thinking of.\"\nTess glared at Shirone with an intense look, different from her usual self. It was the gaze of an intelligence agent, piercing through a person's psyche.\n\"Are you really thinking that? About the Marsha you know.\"\nShirone bit his lip. Deep down, he knew. Despite his desire to trust her, his intuition had already begun to doubt everything.\n\"I'm sorry. You must be right. It seems likely...\"\nPiece by piece, everything fell into place. The reaction she had when discussing the collusion between nobles and criminals, smirking with sarcasm, now made sense.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 146: The ‘Parrot’ (4)\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nChapter 146: The Parrot (4)\nTess was uneasy about Shirone's quick change of stance. He knew well enough how rationally Shirone viewed the world from their past experiences.\nShirone wasn't someone who adjusted his actions based on his feelings but that didn't mean he was cold-blooded either.\nHe simply knew how to control his emotions, though it was likely that numerous conflicts were raging within him.\nTess saw Shirone's current state as potentially detrimental to the battle ahead.\n\"Shirone, don't worry about it. We're not going to fight; we're going to rescue Zis's sister. We'll find out what kind of person Marsha is when we meet her.\"\nShirone forced a smile, understanding Tesss concerns, but his resolve only strengthened.\nIf he found her to be truly evil, he was prepared to forget all his past feelings and bring her down with all his might.\n\"Don't worry. I won't make any mistakes.\"\nShirone spurred his horse and swiftly cut through the night air.\n***\nThere was no direct path from the west to the northern hideout due to the indigenous autonomous region in the center.\nThe kidnappers of Yuna had taken a long detour around Mount Toa to reach their destination, arriving at dawn.\nInside a dilapidated building resembling a warehouse, Falcoa sat on a chair, his pupils half-dilated as he stared blankly ahead, surrounded by spit-out lupf husks.\nHis men entered, bowed to Falcoa, and threw a sack containing Yuna onto the floor with a thud. Though no screams escaped, the intense trembling from within the sack indicated her sheer terror.\nAt Falcoa's nod, one of his men drew a knife and sliced the sack open, revealing Yuna, drenched in tears and sweat, trembling in fear.\nYuna's eyes filled with despair as she looked around, realizing she had been brought here overnight. A man with an unhinged look in his dilated pupils stared down at her, while intimidating men at the entrance blocked any escape.\n\"Pl-please, spare me.\"\n\"Leave us,\" Falcoa ordered his men, who quickly exited, knowing well the consequences of disobeying him.\nLeft alone with Yuna, Falcoa approached, chewing on Lupe.\n\"You're much better than I expected. Do you know why you're here?\"\n\"I-I don't know. Please, just let me go home.\"\n\"Sorry, but that's not possible. I plan to make you the most miserable person in the world because your brother sold you to me.\"\nYuna froze in shock, but deep down, she still believed in Zis. How could a brother sell his own sister to such a man?\n\"That can't be true! My brother cherishes me the most!\"\n\"Is that so? Then why are you here? I gave Zis something incredible in exchange for you.\"\nFalcoa didn't consider his words a lie. After all, sparing her life was worth a fortune, wasn't it? Plus, he had given Zis the luxury of missing Amy.\n\"That's impossible! My brother wouldn't sell me!\"\nYuna screamed, clutching her chest to overcome her fear. The shock of being sold by her brother was more devastating than being kidnapped.\n\"Let me see my brother! I'll ask him myself!\"\n\"Hey, little lady, you don't seem to grasp the situation. You can't go home. You'll never be able to. You have two choices: die by my hand or take your own life.\"\n\"No, that can't be! Aaah!\"\nFalcoa suddenly grabbed Yuna's wrist with an overpowering grip, pulling her into his embrace.\n\"Get away from me, you bastard!\"\nFalcoa savored her frail resistance for a moment before twisting her arm and turning her around, gripping her cheeks threateningly.\n\"Don't waste your strength too early. You'll have plenty of opportunities to scream.\"\nJust then, the warehouse door opened, and a cold voice filled the room.\n\"Falcoa. Human trafficking is against the rules.\"\n\"Freeman.\"\nFalcoa scowled, displeased. The only man in the Parrot Mercenary Corps ranked above him, Agado Freeman, observed the scene with a subdued gaze.\nStanding over 190 centimeters tall in a white long coat, Freeman's appearance was ghostly. His eyebrows were completely shaven, and his lips looked unhealthy.\nA master of Schema and skilled in using magic bullets, Freeman was known within the organization to surpass even Lucas in sheer physical prowess.\n\"What brings you here all of a sudden? Haven't seen hide nor hair of you until now. Run out of money?\"\nFalcoa's displeasure was evident. Although Freeman had always been the de facto second-in-command since their mercenary days, Falcoa had a unique role within the organization that allowed him freedom.\nThe conflict between the vice-captain and the action team leader had intensified since their arrival on the island. The downfall into a band of thieves, yet Freeman's insistence on adhering to the old mercenary codes, fueled the discord.\nSustaining the dozens of followers branded as traitors required substantial funds, but Freeman had offered no viable solutions.\nFor five years, Falcoa had led the organization, driving out the island's influential figures with force and sustaining the group with the profits from lupf trade.\nFreeman had turned a blind eye to Falcoa's misdeeds for these reasons.\nHowever, this time, Falcoa had crossed a line. There were certain boundaries that should not be crossed, even in the name of the Parrot.\nFreeman, though merely a vice-captain, was adamant about condemning human trafficking and violent plundering.\n\"You know the organization's rules. Human trafficking tarnishes the Parrot Mercenary Corps' reputation.\"\n\"Parrot Mercenary Corps? Since when did we start living in the past, clinging to former glories? Look at us now. Do you think the organization would have survived this long without the money I bring in?\"\n\"You're insane, Falcoa. I'll acknowledge your efforts for the organization, regardless of the methods. But make no mistake. I am the one leading this organization.\"\n\"I don't care about that. I don't recognize you. Wasn't that decided from the start? You can't start acting like the boss now.\"\nA chilling intent emanated from Freeman as he watched Falcoa's brazen demeanor. To a weaker creature, such a presence could be lethal.\nBut Falcoa absorbed that murky energy as if stabbing himself with a knife. It was painful, but he showed no change in expression.\n\"Ha, how terrifying.\"\nFreeman was at a loss. Pain and anger were merely catalysts that worsened the situation with such an aggressive person.\n'Has he become such a wild dog?'\nEven without Lupe, Falcoa was always driven by desire. His penchant for combat and killing had made him a good fit for the mercenary corps.\nBut now, as a bar owner on the island, he was frustrated. Lupe, alcohol, and women weren't enough to quell his innate madness.\n\"Please, spare me.\"\nAs Yuna pleaded, trembling, Freeman turned back to Falcoa and said:\n\"Do we really need to go this far? Have we abandoned the Parrot's pride as well?\"\n\"Pride? Hey, let me tell you something. The Parrot Mercenary Corps is over. The captain's gone, and the men are at their limits. You might as well give up and join us.\"\nAs he spoke, Falcoa boldly buried his face in Yuna's neck, but Freeman remained motionless, now revealing his own readiness for combat.\nThe moment one of them moved, a fight would inevitably break out, potentially destroying one of the two pillars that had been supporting the Parrot.\nA clash between them was unpredictable, but Falcoa was confident Freeman wouldn't dare to act against him.\n\"Why don't you just leave? I'll tell the men to give you some money. It's time you learned to accept things and have some fun.\"\n\"Oh, what a joyous occasion this is.\"\nA woman's voice rang out as the door opened. Falcoa quickly turned his head, but before he could focus, a fist struck his jaw, whipping his head around.\n\"Ugh!\"\nA powerful kick then landed in Falcoa's abdomen, sending him crashing to the floor, while Yuna, her legs giving out from shock, collapsed.\n\"Damn. Talk about bad luck.\"\nSpitting out, Falcoa slowly rose to his feet. His failure to dodge the two blows was due to his unconscious restraint from retaliating.\nClay Marsha, the former leader of the Parrot Mercenary Corps who once commanded hundreds of mercenaries, stood before him.\n\"The real boss?\"\n\"Is there a fake one? You've really lost it, haven't you, after being let loose for a few years?\"\nFalcoa didn't show anger. In fact, he didn't even display hostility.\nTo the members of the mercenary corps, Marsha was such a figure.\nAs the first leader of the Parrot Mercenary Corps, she had elevated the group to A-class status within a few years, requiring more than just brute force.\nAnd Marsha had achieved that with her exceptional skills. Moreover, her strength was so formidable that she was the only one in the organization to be listed as an A-class criminal.\nBut Falcoa didn't follow Marsha for such trivial reasons.\nHe saw her as a \"fallen Madonna.\"\nKind and gentle, Marsha embraced a crowd of humans, most of whom were far from normal.\nThose abandoned by their families, born with an innate thirst for blood, or societal outcasts with no other means to express their existence outside the battlefield.\nFalcoa was one of them.\nWhen everyone else tried to cure his mental illness or push him out of society, Marsha was the only one who embraced him.\nIn the Parrot Thieves' Guild, Marsha was both a sister and a mother, a leader who could be trusted and relied upon in any situation.\nBut even with such a leader, it was infuriating. After years of no contact, she had suddenly appeared, causing havoc.\n\"Damn it. Where have you been hiding? You're not the leader anymore. In all this time, we...\"\n\"You've become a junkie, haven't you?\"\nFalcoa's face hardened. His pupils, usually dilated, sharpened for a moment.\nHe had heard it countless times over five years, but for some reason, it felt like he was hearing it for the first time.\nA junkie. Had the one known as the battlefield demon really become a junkie?\nFreeman approached and bowed to Marsha.\n\"It's been a long time, Captain. When did you return?\"\n\"I came as soon as I heard Lucas was taken down. He's bound to have blown up his hideout by now. Looks like we'll need to clean up here soon.\"\nAfter explaining to Freeman, Marsha approached Falcoa, who instinctively averted his gaze as she drew near.\n\"Falcoa, I'm sure I told you. Human trafficking is not allowed.\"\nFalcoa's brow furrowed. Upon reflection, he realized he had nothing to be ashamed of. All the blame lay with Marsha, who had abandoned the organization.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

I'm dying to see the expression on that brat's face when he sees me.\"\n\"Please, let me go. Send me home.\"\nYuna knelt before Marsha, pleading. The attitude of the subordinates alone made it clear she was the top authority in the organization.\n\"It's okay, don't be scared.\"\n\"Does that mean you'll send me home?\"\n\"Of course. It's chaotic outside right now, so I'll send you home once everything settles down. But, I have a small favor to ask, could I?\"\n\"What kind of favor?\"\nMarsha approached Yuna and gently stroked her head, causing Yuna's eyes to gradually close and her focus to blur.\n\"What? What's happening?\"\nYuna didn't even realize she had closed her eyes as she lost consciousness to the ringing in her ears.\nCatching Yuna as she was about to fall forward, Marsha looked down at her tenderly, then turned away with a cold smile.\n\"Let the fun begin.\"\n* * *\nFalcoa's men were rough and violent. It seemed fear was foreign to them as they took hits with their bodies while swinging their swords recklessly.\n\"Attack with the Wind Force Formation! Charge!\"\nTheir main strategy was guerrilla warfare. They alternated offense and defense in a zigzag pattern, distributing their stamina efficiently, which was horrifying for Shirone's group, who had no experience in war.\nHowever, the essence of guerrilla warfare lay not in ambush but in retreat. It seemed they had no intention of engaging in direct combat.\n\"Disengage the Wind Force Formation! Retreat for now!\"\n\"Where do you think you're running to!\"\nAmy hastily unleashed a series of Flame Strikes. In an instant, the enemies lit up and transformed into flashes of light, soaring into the sky as the air tore with a high-pitched sound.\n\"Ugh, so annoying! We lost them again.\"\nAs Amy stomped her feet in frustration, Rian comforted her by patting her shoulder.\n\"But they're also fighting with all their might. Their numbers are increasing, so Yuna should be safe for now. That's good for us.\"\nShirone turned to his friends and said,\n\"Let's assess our condition first. Anyone injured?\"\nIt was crucial to visually confirm any injuries. In a neighborhood scuffle, a bloody nose might be noticeable, but in life-threatening combat, the abundance of endorphins could mask the pain.\nAfter checking each other's physical state, they all breathed a sigh of relief, realizing there were no significant issues.\nBut the enemies were also unharmed. Despite their best efforts, the enemies would vanish like ghosts at crucial moments.\n\"We haven't taken down a single one yet. This will disadvantage us in upcoming battles.\"\nAmy shared her analysis so far.\n\"I've been watching, and I think there's a secret to the bracelets they're wearing. They must be magical devices that trigger spatial movement.\"\nShirone skeptically asked,\n\"Is that even possible? It's different from magic bullets. Spatial movement is a magic that moves the mage. Without a Spirit Zone, setting a destination and even activating it would be impossible.\"\nAmy also had her doubts about this. But strictly speaking, it wasn't entirely impossible.\n\"Maybe... it could be linked with magic circles.\"\nMagic circles are diagrams that imprint special images in space to emanate magical power independently. Thus, even non-mages could utilize magic with the help of magic circles.\n\"Of course, it's impossible to cast spatial movement with a magic artifact alone. But if it's linked with a magic circle recorded in a specific location, it's theoretically possible.\"\nUnderstanding the concept of magic, Shirone nodded. However, Tess was concerned about something else.\n\"Is this feasible for a fallen mercenary group? From what I know, magic circles require a tremendous amount of manpower and money. Plus, spatial movement is a high-level magic, right?\"\n\"That's correct. It's probably a mid-level magic circle. Drawing just one requires the labor of at least five mages working all day, but they could manage it. Falcoa monopolizes all the Lupe. The mercenaries we met at the ruins said the same. The profit margin of Lupe is enormous. They fortified their base by selling drugs. If that's the case, then all this makes sense.\"\n\"How much did those bastards earn by selling drugs? A single magic circle wouldn't cover such a range.\"\nTess's point was valid. Based on her question, Shirone reviewed the battles they had fought.\nThe first battle took place in a valley where they first saw the enemies retreat. There was also a retreat in the forest, and now, here, they used spatial movement again.\n\"In my opinion, to cover the distance we need to travel, there must be at least hundreds of magic circles drawn.\"\n\"Hundreds?\"\nTess was stunned. A mid-level magic circle that requires a day's work from five mages. If there were hundreds, how much gold had been scattered on this land?\n\"Would they really waste so much money? Just a few circles would suffice based on the distance. If there are indeed hundreds of magic circles, we'll never be able to catch them.\"\nTess's realization hit her suddenly.\n\"Ah! I see!\"\n\"Exactly. Now you get it? They've made it impossible to catch them under any circumstances. They've networked the entire northern forest. If we continue like this, we, being outnumbered, will tire first. We won't even reach the summit before collapsing.\"\nTheir disdain for those who fortified their base with drug money grew stronger. Yet, now was the time to find a solution rather than dwell on emotions.\n\"So, what do we do now? How about erasing the magic circles as we go? If the enemies keep escaping no matter where we fight, charging in recklessly won't help.\"\nAmy shook her head. Tess's suggestion was logical, but another issue remained.\n\"That's difficult. A magic circle is a record etched in space. To remove it, you can't just erase the drawing; you have to obliterate the space. If we do that for hundreds of circles, it could take days.\"\nUnderstanding the situation, Tess bit her lip. It's crucial in a fight against a group to reduce their numbers. But the enemies had preemptively blocked that strategy.\nShirone, surprisingly, supported Tess's suggestion.\n\"Let's try destroying one. I'll give it a shot.\"\n\"Even if we destroy one out of hundreds, what difference will it make?\"\n\"Our position might not change, but their thoughts could be different. If they went through so much effort to build this network, wouldn't they consider even the loss of one magic circle significant? They might even gather to defend that spot.\"\n\"Ah, a high-level psychological strategy!\"\nTess quickly grasped Shirone's plan. War is often seen as a power game played with money, but the side with more funds isn't always the winner. Human psychology plays a complex role in warfare.\nThe more one has to protect, the weaker their resolve. For instance, investing 100 gold to train an elite soldier is futile if they're not utilized, ending up as a waste.\nThis scenario often plays out in real wars.\nDespite pouring money into preparation, the fear of losing their investment prevents the use of elite soldiers, leading to defeat by cheaper forces.\nAmy analyzed Shirone's strategy. If they can't chase the enemies, then draw them in. This was the most plausible strategy given the circumstances, though it didn't solve the original problem.\n\"We're in a situation where we have to consider efficiency. I didn't mention it because I thought destroying magic circles wasn't an option, but neutralizing their effect is much more complicated than you might think.\"\nRian thrust his sword into the ground with force.\n\"Can't I just tear the ground apart with my sword until the magic circle disappears?\"\n\"That wouldn't be enough. The magic circles we see are just symbols representing concepts.\"\nRealizing what Amy was trying to say, Shirone defined it clearly.\n\"So unless we destroy the space to the extent that the magic circle's concept disappears, it won't vanish?\"\n\"Exactly. That's why there are mainly two ways to destroy a magic circle. Use Pure Magic to neutralize the concept itself, or smash the magic circle until the concept breaks down. The former is impossible for us, and the latter requires time.\"\nTess understood why Amy was skeptical about this approach.\n\"So it comes down to this. The effort to destroy one magic circle is less efficient than just pushing forward?\"\n\"Right. It's better to continue towards our destination as is if we can't destroy one within at least 10 minutes. The basic intention of using the enemies' psychology is good, though.\"\nAs the necessary information for the strategy was shared, they became more silent. In such cases, it was best to follow one person's decision. Rian looked at Shirone, seeking his decision.\n\"What do you say, Shirone?\"\nShirone was inevitably conflicted. With a hostage involved, it was best to move quickly, but being too eager could jeopardize the rescue mission itself.\n\"Let's destroy the magic circle. I'll try.\"\nAs Shirone voiced his decision, Amy looked at him in surprise.\nShirone, known for his insight, wasn't one to gamble on low odds, but he didn't ignore chances either. In her view, the probability of destroying a magic circle within 10 minutes was less than 10%.\n\"Are you sure? We don't have magic that can do it in time.\"\nShirone's most potent spell was undoubtedly the Photon Cannon. But even embedding mass into light wasn't enough to handle the weight of the earth.\nPotentially, rapid-fire could destroy one within 10 minutes, but the mental energy expended would disadvantage them in future battles.\nAnother possibility was laser magic, but Amy was skeptical about that too.\nLaser magic, which concentrates energy locally to induce molecular vibrations, has the advantage of destroying material regardless of durability but is limited in scope.\n\"I'll try. I have an idea.\"\nAmy couldn't imagine how Shirone planned to destroy the magic circle, but it was best to trust him. His intuition rarely led astray.\nIf someone like Yiruki was here, perhaps a more accurate conclusion could be reached, but in his absence, any deviation from Shirone's expectations could only be deemed as force majeure.\nWith that realization, Amy nodded and said,\n\"Alright. Then Tess and I will move as one team, and Shirone and Rian as another. We'll maintain a 50-meter distance between us. Let's use Teleportation to scour the surroundings for the magic circle.\"\n\"Got it, but be careful. Focusing too much on the distance might lead to collisions with other obstacles. Teleporting through the forest is dangerous.\"\nEven Shirone, a Teleportation specialist, needed high concentration to traverse the forest. However, Amy retorted somewhat brusquely, annoyed by Shirone's caution.\n\"Who are you worrying about? You're not equating me with those Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group kids, are you?\"\nAlthough her words were meant to ease Shirone's concerns, they weren't entirely incorrect. Amy, having mastered The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed and possessing Red Eyes, was unlikely to encounter accidental collisions.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Yet, how could there be no message from them at all? Had I not taught my subordinates the taste of money, our organization would have crumbled by now.\n\"Cut the crap! You're not in a position to tell me what to do, are you? We're neither the Parrot Mercenaries nor a band of thieves. We're just a gang stuck on this island!\"\n\"So... you intend to act like a hooligan to the very end?\"\n\"Hmph! I earned it! I earned it and kept the organization running! And you dare to criticize me instead of offering praise? Then what have you been doing all this time?\"\n\"You don't need to worry about that. If you're not going to follow the rules I've set, then abandon the name 'Parrot' right now.\"\n\"Ha, threatening me with that? Fine, I'll abandon it! Parrot? We've been a freeman organization ever since you ran away!\"\n\"Alright. From this moment, you are no longer a Parrot. I don't know how much you've earned, but take it all and leave this place.\"\n\"Falcoa burst out in a roar of rage. Even Marsha couldn't have expected such a reaction. The honor of being the strongest mercenary group was not something that could be exchanged for mere money, her blood was mixed in with the Parrots as well.\n\"If you can't give up being a Parrot, then follow my words. I won't tell you to live a good life, but if you want something, fight for it. I can't tolerate exploiting the weak.\"\nFalcoa was fuming. He hated Marsha for using him even though she knew he couldn't leave the Parrots.\n\"I always get what I want. You'll be the same. Someday, you'll belong to me.\"\nInstead of getting angry, Marsha soothed him with a gentle smile as if she was calming an unruly child.\n\"It's refreshing to hear that after a long time. Anyway, do your best. I don't block men coming to me, nor do I hold back those who wish to leave.\"\nFalcoa clenched his fist and glared at Marsha, his eyes blazing with fire.\nHe was indeed using a powerful eye technique, but Marsha's expression didn't change, showing her strong mental fortitude.\n\"Tch, you're as annoying as ever. I'm done here. I'm going out for a drink.\"\n\"Stay put in the hideout. There's going to be a meeting with the commanders and above. And from this moment, drugs are prohibited. If I catch anyone, they'll really have to face my wrath.\"\nWithout responding, Falcoa stormed out of the warehouse, but Marsha knew. He would attend the meeting and wouldn't touch drugs. The one who could lead him back to the blood-soaked battlefield had returned.\nAfter the subordinates left, Freeman returned to being Marsha's hometown friend and greeted her anew.\n\"It's good to see you back safely. I was worried when I couldn't contact you.\"\n\"I couldn't contact because I was running. Don't you have any sense? Did you think I'd be caught that easily? But what's up with Falcoa? Can he even be used in this state? He was a whirlwind with a sword in his hand, even if he was mad.\"\n\"It's not just Falcoa's fault. It's us who took the battlefield away from him.\"\n\"Huh, well, it's me, actually.\"\n\"But it's thanks to him that we've managed to gather funds so far. I've prepared everything so we can flee to another country anytime now that you're back.\"\nMarsha puffed up her cheeks, seemingly displeased. She knew how Falcoa had managed to bring in funds.\nIn the end, are humans bound to conform to reality? The glory of the once fearless Parrot Mercenaries was now a thing of the past.\nWhen I left home at seventeen, it was the mercenary group I formed with my hometown friend, Freeman.\nFooled by politicians, I lost the foundation of my life, but I wanted to preserve the value of the Parrot.\nBut now, aren't we no different from them? We had to scheme and look out for those with power before fighting for our beliefs, just to make money.\n\"Ah, when did we become like this?\"\n\"We've been betrayed by the state. It's inevitable if we want to survive.\"\n\"Yeah, I guess so. But Freeman, you haven't gone bad, have you?\"\nFreeman remained silent. He felt no prick of conscience. It was just disappointing to be doubted by a friend he had admired since childhood.\n\"The organization, the name Parrot, none of that matters to me. I only wish for your safety.\"\nMarsha shivered, feeling creeped out. Even a dog wearing a Parrot tag would know Freeman's feelings. It wasn't particularly moving, yet he always appealed in this way, which was infuriating.\n\"You only wish for my safety? Why on earth?\"\n\"You are...\"\nMarsha asked, knowing the answer, just to rebuff him. Freeman struggled to find the right words among many that came to mind.\n\"Because you're our leader.\"\nMarsha snorted. Hearing his answer, it seemed there was no need to worry about Freeman. His annoying nature hadn't changed, whether in the past or now.\n'Anyway, now that I'm back, we need to reorganize.'\nMarsha intended to lead the organization and seek asylum in another country for a fresh start, but first, she had to clean up the mess her subordinates had made.\n\"Sob! Sob!\"\nMarsha turned at the sound of weeping. Yuna was crying pitifully, unable to even think of escaping.\nAlthough she was spared from a terrible fate, Marsha could understand. Just the fact of being mishandled by an unknown man was enough to wound a woman's heart deeply.\n\"What happened? Where did this child come from?\"\n\"One of Falcoa's men had a street solicitor brother. This is his sister.\"\n\"The madman. He's now laying hands on his subordinate's sister?\"\n\"Who knows? His head was shaped like money.\"\n\"Is there something I don't know?\"\nFreeman relayed the stories he heard from his subordinates, from the anecdotes between Zis and Amy to Shirone storming the palace, and how they ended up bringing Yuna here.\nMarsha, who had been listening with interest, lit up when Shirone's story came up.\n\"Ah, now that I think about it, I know this story too.\"\n\"You know? How could you know about this incident?\"\nMarsha smiled and touched her lips.\n\"I told you, I'm a genius. Life is entangled in such ways, after all.\"\n\"What happened? Tell me.\"\nIf Marsha wouldn't say, Freeman had no intention of pressing. She had always stirred things up when bored, and that was her only escape in this world.\nMarsha received numerous agendas from Freeman.\nThere wasn't anything particularly troubling. The funds Falcoa had gathered were more than enough for a fresh start in another country, and Freeman's troops were not lacking in combat strength.\n\"It's all good. Well done. But should we just leave the assets as they are?\"\n\"Are you bothered by the funds Falcoa gathered?\"\n\"It's a bit... you know? It's time for Parrot's resurgence, but starting the organization with money earned from selling drugs.\"\n\"That's unlike you. Money is money, after all. I don't like how it was earned either, but burying money just because of that seems childish.\"\n\"I know. Anyway, let's leave this matter for the meeting later. For now...\"\nAt that moment, a member burst into the room. Marsha and Freeman looked at him, puzzled.\nThis place was beyond the reach of government influence, so there shouldn't have been any reason to rush in gasping for breath.\nMarsha smiled and said, \"What's wrong? Got a stomachache? There's no bathroom here.\"\n\"Oh? Leader? You're back?\"\nThe member was surprised to see Marsha but immediately reported the urgent matter without any delay.\n\"Leader! It's a disaster! We're under attack!\"\n\"Attack? What sudden attack? Is it the government?\"\n\"It doesn't seem so. They're just kids, a group of four. According to the report, it seems like two mages and two swordsmen.\"\nMarsha knew who they were just from hearing this. It was odd that they would come to rescue the street solicitor's sister they had fought at the port, but Marsha couldn't deny one possibility.\n\"Huh, if it's that detestable brat, it's quite possible. Is there a kid named Shirone among the attackers?\"\n\"I'm sorry. I don't know the names...\"\nFreeman, suddenly changing his tone, politely suggested.\n\"Leader, wouldn't it be better to just hand over the girl? It'd be troublesome to stir up a commotion while we're trying to regroup.\"\nMarsha thought about it, considering the earnest man's words.\n\"Hmm, handing over the girl. Wouldn't that be a bit absurd? Kidnapping her and then returning her when they come looking. Or what, you think they might actually breach this place?\"\n\"There's no chance of that. While you were away, I've fortified this place thoroughly. The magical formations and magical artifacts are strategically placed. Unless they're quite skilled, they'd die before even reaching the first barrier.\"\n\"Then there's no problem, right? Go and kill them. I'll take care of this girl. Have you lost your touch after a few years off? You're completely clueless.\"\nAs soon as Marsha spoke, Freeman immediately ordered his men to prepare for battle.\nIt was embarrassing to show a lack of discipline in front of the leader, especially when he thought he had prepared well.\n\"Everyone to your training positions. This is a real combat situation.\"\n\"Yes! I'll relay the message right now!\"\nFreeman's men moved swiftly, gathering their arms and forming units. It took less than 5 minutes for everyone to move to their positions.\nMarsha then sat down with a satisfied smile.\n\"You've worked hard, at least. I thought you'd been slacking off all this time.\"\n\"Everyone's been waiting for today. They're working harder because you're back.\"\n\"Hmph, how long do I have to baby you? It's time for you to manage on your own. What about you? Aren't you going to fight?\"\n\"I'll stay here. Protecting your side is my duty.\"\nMarsha looked up at Freeman with an incredulous expression. True, as an initial member of the mercenary group, he had performed bodyguard duties. But every time, Marsha had to brush off the goosebumps on her arms.\n\"Seriously, you're so pathetic. You think I find you impressive with this?\"\nFreeman, having made up his mind, didn't seem to plan on leaving Marsha's side.\nMarsha's face turned red with anger. She had always disliked this about him since childhood. His inability to express emotions and his stubborn behavior had irritated her more than once.\n\"Hey! Don't just stand there, get out! What, you think you're my husband or something?\"\nSitting in her chair, Marsha lifted her leg and kicked Freeman's buttocks.\nWith that, as if propelled by inertia, Freeman moved. He kept silent till the end and quietly left the warehouse.\nOnce everyone had gone, Marsha stretched leisurely, as if nothing had happened, and smiled freely.\nThe anticipation of battle was real, but she was more curious about Shirone.\nShirone was the kind Marsha despised the most. Those who truly embrace others' pain do not exist in this world.\nHer adoptive father had also revealed his true nature in the end. The mercy shown to an orphan was in fact the footprints of vile desires, and when Marsha realized this, she awoke.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Before we start, there's something I need to confirm.\"\n\"What is it you need to confirm?\"\n\"If this operation succeeds, there's a high chance we'll end up in direct combat with the enemies. That's why I have something I want to ask Rian.\"\n\"What is it? Do you see a problem with me?\"\nRian looked puzzled, prompting Tess to look at him with an unusually serious gaze and ask,\n\"Rian, have you ever killed someone?\"\nSilence enveloped the group. Rian blinked, his hand resting on his sword.\nTruthfully, he had never really thought about it. Or rather, was it something that needed to be thought about?\nEvery knight, at some point, tacitly resolves themselves to the nature of their weapon. A sword is meant to cut people. With a lifetime commitment to wielding such a tool, Rian believed that other considerations were secondary.\n\"No, I haven't. What about you?\"\n\"A few times. When I went with my father to subdue bandits.\"\n\"Really? But why is that an issue?\"\n\"Rian, being prepared to die and prepared to kill are entirely different things. It's the same for mages, but especially for us, we have to take lives with these very hands.\"\nThe foes Shirone's group was contending with were not mere local thugs but the Parrot Mercenaries, renowned across foreign lands. All of them were seasoned professionals who had experienced countless battles.\n\"Of course, I trust your courage. It's unthinkable for a swordsman to go through life without ever staining their sword with blood. But if today is your first time, you might waver during the battle.\"\nRian exhaled thoughtfully, considering this.\nWavering during battle... Naturally, taking a life wasn't particularly pleasant. But, on the other hand, he felt it didn't really matter.\n\"Tess, murder is a complex and dangerous issue. I understand why you're concerned, but I will never waver.\"\nIdiot, that's exactly what I'm saying it's not that simple. Killing someone...\"\n\"I have always killed.\"\nTess's gaze wavered. Rian looked at his reflection in the blade of his straight sword and continued,\n\"And... I have died countless times.\"\nIn that moment, Rian's intense gaze met Tess's.\n\"Even when they said I had no talent, when they told me to give up the sword, even when I really wanted to give up, I kept swinging my sword. In the process, I killed countless foes and was killed by countless foes.\"\nRian pointed his straight sword northward. If Rian were a statue, he might have fallen forward under the weight of his sword, but he stood firm, as if his feet were rooted to the ground.\n\"Tess, do you understand? Throughout my life, I have never wielded my sword with a half-hearted resolve. Whether or not there was an enemy before me, I always swung my sword with all my might.\"\nEveryone could sense the determination in Rian's words. As if nothing had happened, Rian smiled and sheathed his straight sword behind him.\n\"I will not falter. I am Shirone's sword. I exist solely to cut down whatever Shirone desires. So, there's no need to worry.\"\nThis was why Tess chose Rian over countless others with sword talent.\nRian was blunt. That's why he hadn't been able to open his Schema, but the weight of human resolve, derived from the essence of life itself, couldn't be produced by talent or skill alone.\nAfter watching Rian for a moment, Tess smiled contentedly and looked around at everyone.\n\"Alright! My worries have been alleviated. Let's get started.\"\nEncouraged by Tess's words, Shirone and Amy were also fired up. Rian's speech had ignited their fighting spirit.\n\"Then Amy, let's go first.\"\nShirone grabbed Rian and cast Photonization. A flash of light enveloped the two, who then disappeared into the forest, followed closely by Amy and Tess.\nThe sight of two streaks of light traversing the dense forest was the epitome of dazzling. Reflecting off each other like in a mirror, they moved erratically, zigzagging through the woods.\nThough the location of the magic circle was unknown, they could roughly estimate the distance based on the enemy's movements.\nAfter about 10 minutes of searching the forest, they located the first magic circle.\nBeing a magical entity, the magic circle became clearly perceivable within the range of their Spirit Zone.\nStealth magic, if applied, would significantly increase the difficulty of detection. However, even for a wealthy mercenary group, maintaining such a setup was impractical.\nThe cost of hiring stealth magicians for all the mages involved in a mid-level magic circle wouldn't even amount to one-tenth, making it an unviable investment.\nRian cleared a path through the dense brush with his straight sword, revealing a magic circle on a grassy clearing.\nShirone, seeing a magic circle for the first time, was surprised by its scale, much larger than he had imagined.\nAmy surveyed the surroundings and nodded.\n\"Indeed, it's a mid-level magic circle. They must have gone through a lot of trouble to create it.\"\nThe circle, over 5 meters in radius, emitted a crimson light in response to their Spirit Zone. Inside, the complex and beautiful designs etched within the concentric circles could have been mistaken for works of art.\n\"Wait, let me take a closer look.\"\nAmy, with some knowledge from her advanced class, examined the magic circle closely.\nMagic circles could be assessed based on three criteria.\nFirst was the color representing the strength of the magic. Second was the density of the functions, and third was the interconnectedness of the magic circles drawn within.\nTo Amy, this magic circle seemed slightly lacking in color and density but excelled in interconnectedness. This likely meant it was produced by a formal entity.\n\"Trouble's brewing. It seems like it was inscribed by a formally registered magic company. I thought they might have hired shady magicians with their illicit earnings.\"\n\"Is that a significant issue?\"\n\"The hallmark of a formal company is standard design, which means good interconnectedness. Simply put, the magic circle is durable. Can we really destroy it in 10 minutes?\"\n\"We should at least try. I'm not entirely sure we can succeed.\"\n\"What? You're saying that now? We launched this operation because you said you had an idea.\"\n\"Sorry. But I'm somewhat confident. And if we do succeed...\"\n\"If we do?\"\nShirone looked up, pondering for a moment before sharing his estimate.\n\"Perhaps we could destroy it in under a minute.\"\n\"A minute?\"\nAmy's eyes widened in disbelief. They were dealing with a mid-level magic circle, which professional demolition teams would struggle to neutralize in a minute.\nA magic circle inscribed by a formal company is known for its durability. Even if they employed powerful physical magic to pulverize the ground to gravel size, the concept might not disappear.\nAmy knew that the ground had to be ground down to the size of a bean for the concept to vanish, but she was unaware of any magic in Shirone's repertoire capable of such power.\n\"How do you plan to do it? Are you sure? Half-heartedly breaking it might not be effective. In fact, it could complicate things if the magic circle disintegrates further.\"\n\"Let's see. I'll give it a try.\"\nAmy's anxiety grew as she listened. It was clear Shirone hadn't thought it through completely.\nCould he really do it? Failure here would mean a waste of precious time.\nShirone positioned himself at the center of the magic circle. Expecting an aerial attack from above, Amy was surprised by his different approach.\n\"What are you planning to do from there? Can you create an impact from your position?\"\n\"Yes, but this is my first attempt, so it might be dangerous. Stay back.\"\nFollowing Shirone's instruction, the three retreated further.\nAlthough they were anxious, their anticipation was just as strong. Success could instantly turn the tide in their unfavorable situation.\nAs the magic circle was destroyed, the enemies' range of movement would gradually decrease.\nWith two mages on their side, they would have a significant advantage in firepower, allowing for a swift end to the battle.\nShirone closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Spreading his legs and slowly bending at the waist, he aimed a fist at the ground.\nNo immediate change was evident. The atmosphere was so serene, one might wonder if such tranquility was appropriate on a fierce battlefield.\nBut Amy's reaction was different.\nInitially skeptical of Shirone's actions, her eyes soon widened in shock, and her shoulders trembled.\n\"Shirone, you...\"\nTess, puzzled by Amy's reaction, looked at her. Although he saw nothing, Amy's face was as pale as if she had seen a monster.\n\"Amy, what's wrong? What's Shirone doing?\"\n\"Using that... I hadn't considered it, but now that I think about it, it makes sense.\"\n\"What exactly? Explain it to me.\"\n\"We should probably move further away. This could be really dangerous.\"\nAs Amy stepped back, Rian and Tess followed, moving to a new location.\nEven as they did so, the swordsmen felt a sense of perplexity. The distance Amy had retreated was more than twice what they had initially moved away.\n\"Now tell me. What exactly are you sensing?\"\n\"It's not about seeing; it's about feeling. I'm sensing the changes happening in Shirone.\"\n\"Feeling? What exactly do you feel?\"\n\"His Spirit Zone. Shirone's Spirit Zone is moving at an incredible pace right now.\"\nAmy was incredulous even as she spoke. How immense must one's mental fortitude be to allow the Spirit Zone to expand and contract so rapidly?\n'It must be the mental heartbeat. But it's too fast. At this rate, he's on par with Teacher Ethella.'\nShirone's current mental heartbeat exceeded 10 beats per second.\nBut for Shirone, that wasn't enough.\nIn the mental heartbeat test of Class Five, he scored 410, achieving 13.6 beats per second over 30 seconds.\nHe figured he needed to double that given the different circumstances. The previous test had a maximum expansion radius of 20 meters, but now, 5 meters, the diameter of the magic circle, should suffice. The shorter round-trip distance meant the heartbeat should be faster.\nThe question was whether his mental strength could withstand it.\n'I have no choice. I need to control it more precisely.'\nAs Shirone slightly furrowed his brow, Amy immediately noticed the change and said with a shaky voice,\n\"My goodness. It's getting faster.\"\nAs the radius narrowed, the mental heartbeat began to exceed 15 beats per second.\nCounting from 1 to 15 in one second was unimaginable, giving a sense of the speed.\nA typical mage's mind would have collapsed long before reaching this point.\nHowever, Shirone's resilience, bolstered by the Vajra Body, was unparalleled at the moment.\nFinally, the maximum expansion radius of the Spirit Zone matched the edge of the magic circle. What remained was to maintain the current rhythm while casting the spell.\nConcentrating intensely, Shirone clenched his teeth and attempted the decisive spell he had only conceptualized in his mind.\n'Explode!'\nFilling the pulsating Spirit Zone with mass-laden photons caused an astonishing phenomenon.\nAs the Spirit Zone took on the hues of light, even Rian and Tess could see Shirone's mind in action.\nThe light sphere expanded and contracted, creating fissures in the ground. Eventually, a massive rock split with a crack and shattered into thousands of pieces.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Forced Breakthrough (4)\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nChapter 150: Forced Breakthrough (4)\nShirone's explosive magic didn't stop there. Photons laden with physical force continued to pound the thousands of rock fragments until they were reduced to the size of grains of rice.\nShirone, following the collapsing ground, was gradually being buried deeper into the earth.\nThe diameter of the zone being four times shorter than during the test increased the speed exponentially, putting even Shirone on edge.\nAfter 20 seconds, the casting of the explosion ceased. When Shirone searched with his Spirit Zone, he could no longer feel the magic circle's energy.\n\"Phew, Amy, is this satisfactory?\"\nNo one answered. Everyone watching Shirone was in a state of shock, their faces mirroring the same dumbfounded expression.\nAmy let out an incredulous laugh.\n\"Ha, seriously Shirone, can we stick to conventional magic?\"\n\"What? I put a lot of thought into this. Anyway, the magic circle is destroyed, right?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah, probably.\"\nAmy entered her Spirit Zone to check, though it was unnecessary. Even without Synesthesia, the surroundings where the magic circle had been were utterly devastated.\nApproaching Shirone's location, Amy observed the concave terrain and realized the unique nature of Shirone's new magic.\n'Amplification of photons using mental pulsation. He must have thought of this during practice, but this destruction is absurd, isn't it?'\nDespite its limited range, the force capable of pulverizing the ground into dust made any disadvantage insignificant.\nThe combination of Vajra Body's resilience, Immortal Function's use of God's Particles, and the brilliance of Photon magic created a perfectly synergized magic.\n\"But what on earth made you think of this?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, I didn't plan to use it like this. Defense Form is my specialty, so I was thinking I needed to learn a defensive magic. Then I thought of mental pulsation and tried combining it with God's Particles.\"\n\"Ah, I see. So, this is a defensive magic?\"\n\"Yeah, a defensive magic.\"\nAmy almost slapped Shirone but restrained herself. Among the defensive magics she knew, this was arguably the most destructive.\nIn essence, it's a magic that creates a barrier of light packed with mass, which is rapidly repelled, creating a counterforce.\nWhile a single blast might be weaker than a Photon Cannon, at twenty pulses per second, nothing would remain intact around it.\nEither way, strictly speaking, it was indeed a defensive magic.\nThough multi-attack magic is classified as a shotgun, Wildfire surpasses that, acting more like a barrier, and would likely be registered as a defensive magic by the association.\n\"Shirone, are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?\"\nTess rushed over, concerned. Wildfire was the most ruthless and brutish magic she had ever seen, and Shirone being at the center of it seemed miraculous.\n\"I'm fine. The magic wasn't as dangerous as I thought.\"\n\"Not dangerous? I thought even you would be shattered.\"\n\"Ha! Really, I'm okay. It wouldn't be called a defensive magic if it injured the mage, right?\"\nIndeed, Wildfire was designed to protect the mage, making its destructive power a secondary feature.\nUnlike typical defensive magics, which rely on the thickness of a barrier for durability, Wildfire uniquely uses the momentum of the maximum and minimum radii to create a repelling force.\nTherefore, as long as the minimum radius is set just outside the mage, the mage will never be swept up in Wildfire, akin to being in the eye of a storm.\n\"Let's get serious now. Now that I've got the rhythm, I can cast it faster. It won't be a problem to destroy a magic circle in 30 seconds.\"\nComing to her senses, Amy immediately revised their strategy.\n\"Right, with this magic, we can keep destroying the magic circles. Let's avoid combat as much as possible and focus on demolishing the magic circles first. We'll provoke the enemies. And when they can't stand it anymore, we'll counterattack all at once. How about that?\"\nThere was no disagreement.\nShirone and his team formed pairs and teleported. Two streaks of light darted through the forest, seeking their next prey.\n* * *\n\"Wildfire.\"\nAn explosion of light centered around Shirone. As the barrier of photons battered the ground, the magic circle was obliterated without a trace.\nShirone's team was now on their seventh magic circle demolition. During the battles, they had also reduced the enemy numbers by seven, but the veterans didn't easily fall for Shirone's team's tactics.\nDespite gritting their teeth as each costly magic circle was destroyed, they maintained their stance, enduring the situation.\nHowever, as the number of destroyed magic circles surpassed fifteen, the enemies began to show signs of change. They feared leaving the magic circles unattended any longer would result in their total destruction.\n\"Damn it! How long are those bastards going to keep this up?\"\n\"We're in real danger now. We can only use magic circles at specific points, and three is the limit. At this rate, our operational range will shrink drastically.\"\n\"Captain! What should we do? It seems like they're hell-bent on ruining us.\"\nThe ten-man squad captain shared the frustration.\nTo fortify the northern forest, the Freemans had invested half of their five-year earnings.\nLeaving things as they were meant that even if they won, it would be as good as a loss.\n\"Gather everyone. We'll trap them and take them down.\"\nA messenger relayed the captain's orders to other squad leaders through the magic circles. The other leaders, sharing the same thoughts, quickly responded.\nShirone's team immediately sensed the shift in the battle atmosphere. Not only the enemies' movements but even their gazes had changed.\nThe most significant change was their shift from guerrilla tactics to surrounding them with dozens at once.\nBut the vast encirclement aimed not for Shirone's team's annihilation but to lure them somewhere.\nDespite their numerical advantage, they weren't foolish enough to engage in a head-on battle against a party that included two mages.\nTess marveled at the enemies' tactical adaptation. They were clearly experienced in such situations.\n\"This poses a new problem. They're trying to corral us somewhere. There must be a trap waiting to eliminate the mages.\"\nShirone wasn't concerned. If the enemies were coming at them with all they had, it was now a race against time. They had to reach their destination and rescue Yuna as soon as possible.\n\"It's fine. We'll break through there. It's better to conserve our strength for now.\"\n\"But what if it's a trap?\"\n\"I'll break through. Leave it to me.\"\nShirone sped up, taking the lead. He believed in his Schema's ability to turn the situation around, but Tess couldn't muster the courage to overtake him.\n\"Whew, Shirone is really something.\"\nTo Tess, the current Shirone was unrecognizable. He had always been kind and gentle, so it was natural to be surprised.\nShirone was her biggest concern during this battle. She had asked Rian if he could kill, but Shirone was implicitly included in her concern.\nYet, once they engaged in real combat, Shirone transformed completely.\nHe showed no fear, and his approach to enemies was flawless.\nThis was a uniqueness only Shirone possessed.\nWhile brutality and cruelty can be virtues in a struggle, the way Shirone fought was like watching a machine, calculating efficiency over and over.\nSensing Tess's emotions, Rian quietly smiled, reminded of when he first met Shirone.\nTheir swordfight in the training ground was still chilling to recall.\nShirone's insight could even comprehend the fear of death. Rian had sweated bullets watching Shirone charge with nothing but his sword in mind.\n\"Remember this, Tess. That's Shirone. Once he gets going, no one can stop him.\"\nWhile Rian was nostalgic, Amy looked worriedly at Shirone.\nShe knew how impressive Shirone's insight was, but it seemed powerful variables like Yuna and Marsha were influencing him now.\n\"Isn't this too reckless? He's just charging straight ahead without analyzing the strategy.\"\n\"We're running out of time. If Shirone says he'll do it, I won't stop him.\"\nRian threw his support behind Shirone, accelerating his pace, but Tess agreed with Amy. Even as they ran, she analyzed their surroundings and spoke seriously.\n\"Amy, the terrain is strange. The men are fired up, so let's balance things out.\"\n\"Okay, that sounds good. But what do you mean by 'strange terrain'?\"\n\"If it's not artificially altered, we'll soon enter a valley. It's an ideal spot for setting a trap. It could be dangerous.\"\nNature follows its laws. While humans alter shapes to suit their needs, nature never goes against its principles.\nConsidering the mountain ranges they had passed, the terrain was steadily descending.\nThe increased moisture and prevalence of ferns over shrubs indicated they were heading towards a valley.\n'That means they've dammed the valley.'\nBlocking the front and attacking from both sides is a textbook strategy in warfare.\nTess was conflicted. The urgency was real, but playing into the enemy's hands could lead to their demise.\n\"Amy, we have to stop Shirone.\"\nAmy nodded without complaint. The path was narrowing, and the cliffs were becoming insurmountable.\nThe biggest problem was the dwindling number of enemies previously forming the encirclement.\n\"I'll tell him. Shirone! Wait!\"\nAmy's call went unheard. Before she could speak, Shirone had teleported away with Rian, unwilling to slow down.\n\"Why is he doing this?\"\nDespite everything, Amy had to pursue. She grabbed Tess's waist and teleported.\nBut catching up to Shirone was futile.\nIf teleportation magic was the sole criterion, Amy's skills were comparable to Shirone's but not enough to surpass him.\nShirone knew Amy was following and didn't stop his magic. He seemed determined to continue regardless.\nRushing forward, Shirone and Rian quickly reached the valley entrance.\nThere, Shirone halted his teleportation and ran along a shallow stream.\nRian, puzzled, asked, \"Shirone, why the rush? Even I can tell this is a trap.\"\n\"That's why I'm hurrying. I have to destroy the trap somehow. Depending on the trap, I can concentrate the enemy's attacks using Wildfire.\"\n\"What if you fail?\"\n\"Then we're trapped. If we don't succeed here, the mission's difficulty will skyrocket.\"\n\"It's not just about difficulty. We could die. Let me do it.\"\n\"No, I have to do it because I can. If you keep this up, I'll have to leave you behind.\"\nRian realized why Shirone had sped ahead. If Shirone had mentioned facing the enemy's assault alone, neither Tess nor Amy would have agreed.\nShirone was willing to take risks for a higher chance of success. He sensed the urgency to rescue Yuna.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Hey, Shirone!\"\nBefore Rian could stop him, Shirone had already cast teleportation, speeding away at an incredible pace.\nAnd shortly after, Amy and Tess caught up with Rian.\n\"Rian! Where did Shirone go?\"\n\"He went ahead just a little while ago.\"\n\"What was he thinking? What did he say when he left?\"\n\"He must be planning to prematurely exhaust the traps with his Wildfire. He said he had to go alone because you might not allow it.\"\n\"Of course! Who would allow such a reckless method! Moreover, Wildfire is a mobility shield, so it could be dangerous if the timing is off!\"\n\"Right. That's exactly why he went alone, to avoid hearing those words.\"\nAmy was irritated. Not because Shirone acted unilaterally, but because the strategy he chose was indeed the most effective in terms of results.\nBut it was too risky. In a normal situation, they might take the chance despite the low probability, but in this case, even with a high probability, they had to consider the possibility of failure.\n\"If he fails, he dies! This idiot!\"\nAmy, screaming at Shirone who was not present, put her hands on the waists of Rian and Tess and said,\n\"We can't stop him. Let's just support him. Everyone, be on alert. We'll follow at top speed.\"\nAmy bent forward and cast teleportation. A bright flash cut through the stream, shooting out refreshingly.\n***\nThe only way to the hideout in the upper part of the valley was completely blocked by a 20-meter-high wall.\nCurrently, about ten subordinates were positioned, and Falcoa's subordinates who were building the encirclement began to arrive one after another.\n\"The enemies are coming! Get ready to activate the traps!\"\n\"They're much faster than expected. We don't have enough time to activate them all.\"\nThe leader clicked his tongue. Whoever came up with this was quite clever. If there was no way to bypass the traps, they planned to rush in the shortest distance possible and take action.\n\"It doesn't matter. The traps were designed to annihilate hundreds from the start. Even if only half are activated, it's enough to bury four people.\"\nThe leader remained calm to the end and instructed his subordinates.\nHowever, when he saw a boy running alone from 200 meters away, he couldn't help feeling perplexed this time.\n\"What? Why is he alone?\"\n\"He must have rushed ahead in a hurry.\"\nThe leader didn't think so. It wasn't entirely impossible, but the moment he realized the enemy was alone, he felt an unusual sensation in his heart.\nHe began to feel it was a waste to trigger the traps.\n\"He's good at psychological warfare. It's a waste to use the wide-range traps just to catch one person.\"\n\"What should we do? Should we go out and fight?\"\n\"What do you mean what should we do? Hurry up and activate the traps. Are you not thinking? That's what the kid is thinking. I acknowledge that he's risking his life in this gamble, but he's underestimated us too much. It's not the time to hold back. Catching even one of the two mages could turn the tide. There's no time to spare.\"\n\"Understood. Hey, we're starting now! Everyone, get ready!\"\nShirone glared at the wall standing across the valley. About ten enemies had drawn their bows and were aiming into the sky.\n'Arrow attack?'\nShirone was puzzled. It was nearly impossible for merely ten archers to hit a target 100 meters away.\nBut the enemies released their arrows without hesitation, and Shirone stopped running and looked up at the sky.\nThe arrows looked no different from ordinary ones, only that their tips varied in color.\n'They're magic bullets!'\nShirone, who had cast teleportation, instinctively retreated. If he hadn't seen the magic bullets at the Kergos Ruins firsthand, he would have been caught without a chance to react.\n\"Shirone!\"\nAt that moment, Amy's voice came from behind, and Shirone stopped retreating.\nHe could tell how anxious Amy was by the fact that she arrived much sooner than expected.\nBut Shirone didn't change his mind. In a situation where neither advancing nor retreating was possible, the magic bullets fell to the ground.\nA powerful explosion occurred. The roar shook the valley, and smoke thickly enveloped Shirone.\nShirone realized their strategy. They planned to end it with traps after blocking the view.\n\"Amy! Don't come!\"\nEven without Shirone's words, Amy couldn't enter, because from where the smoke hadn't spread, she could see the massive vibration operating above the valley.\nAs expected, terrifying mechanical devices similar to catapults lined up along the cliff appeared. They were equipped with wheels, but still, several people had to push to move them.\n\"Now! Pour everything on them!\"\nFollowing the leader's command, Falcoa's subordinates activated the devices. Massive boulders were hurled down the valley with the help of levers.\nThe boulders were enormous enough to fill and even exceed the V-shaped cross-section of the valley.\nGiven their power, they weren't meant to stop a few individuals. They were the ultimate weapons to annihilate the enemies in the final battle.\n\"Shirone!\"\nAmy screamed in despair, but it was already too late. The giant boulders were plunging into the smoke, one after another.\nAmy heard the imagined sound of a crunch as if being crushed. But the next moment, a powerful shockwave blew away the illusion.\nThe smoke that had been lingering in the valley dispersed in all directions, revealing Shirone surrounded by a sphere of light.\n'Wildfire!'\nThe sphere of light centered around Shirone flashed brightly. The Spirit Zone, with a maximum diameter of 20 meters, was larger than the boulders.\nAs the enormous light raced wildly, onlookers feared they might go blind.\nThe light, laden with mass, tried its best to create a counterforce, but the boulders, too, were formidable in weight.\nThe boulders, shaking violently as they penetrated the Wildfire, seemed about to crush Shirone at any moment.\nHowever, the moment they reached halfway, the boulders shattered into dozens of pieces. And from there, Shirone's Wildfire began to overpower the boulders.\nThe number of medium-sized boulders increased exponentially, causing a chain of explosions.\nSmaller and smaller.\nShirone unleashed a rapid-fire of photons until the rocks turned to dust.\nBy the time the remnants of the boulders reached near Shirone, they were nothing but small particles. Even those were swept away by the cycle of light.\nThe boulders took only 2 seconds to fall to the ground, and the same amount of time to disintegrate into dust.\nThe thousands of events that occurred in that time compressed in human cognition, creating an illusion akin to a massive explosion.\nDust spread in all directions, rustling as it settled on the ground.\nAn eerie wind swirled through the valley.\nFalcoa's subordinates couldn't comprehend what had just happened. A flash of light followed by the boulders bursting into dust was all they saw with their own eyes.\nShirone, covered in dust, stepped out of the stream and glared at the wall. The subordinates who had operated the traps were beginning to retreat.\nThe leader realized something had gone terribly wrong. He had survived over a decade on the battlefield, but had never heard of such magic.\n\"Damn it! What the hell is that kid!\"\n\"Leader! What do we do?\"\n\"Prepare the magic bullets! Shoot them down!\"\nAs the subordinates quickly detached the arrowheads and attached the magic bullets, Shirone, who had been glaring fiercely, focused his mental strength in front of him.\nA sphere of photons was born with a bang, absorbing the surrounding light and vibrating powerfully.\n\"Leader! Look over there! That's dangerous!\"\nSomeone who had previously experienced Shirone's technique at the Royal Pub shouted to the leader.\nIndeed, even to the leader, the sight of a light larger than a human face compressing seemed ominous.\n\"Damn it! Hurry up! Fire the magic bullets!\"\nThe subordinates' hands moved faster, but the magic was quicker.\nA line of light suddenly appeared between Shirone and the wall, as if a flash of lightning had been born.\nThe Photon Cannon hit the steel gate squarely, causing a piercing metallic sound that tormented the ears.\nThe subordinates, assembling the magic bullets, winced and bent over. The impact was so strong that vibrations could be felt even atop the wall. Even after the magic disappeared, the steel gate was still making a humming sound.\n\"What, what? Is it broken? Check it!\"\nA subordinate went down the stairs connected to the ground and examined the gate. The thick steel plate was bent overall, but it wasn't destroyed.\nFeeling triumphant even with such an outcome, the subordinate shouted cheerfully.\n\"The gate is safe!\"\n\"Good! Now it's our turn to attack.\"\nWith the Photon Cannon's attack turning out to be futile, Tess turned to her friends and said,\n\"We can't break the gate with magic. Rian, let's climb up the wall.\"\nTo win a siege, one of two things must be achieved.\nThe first is to destroy the gate with siege weapons or magic and then push the troops through.\nBut if the gate cannot be destroyed, the alternative is to climb the walls and eliminate the enemies. This was a task for swordsmen like Tess and Rian.\n\"Okay. It's better if we go up.\"\nRian inserted his straight sword behind his back to run more comfortably. But as the two of them bent forward to start, Amy stopped them.\n\"Wait, hold on.\"\n\"We don't have time to delay. We need to strike before the enemies regroup. Now is the chance.\"\nTess was right. Amy, being of the flame affinity, was weak in shock impact, and Shirone's Photon Cannon was useless against the thick steel gate.\nBut Amy knew that Shirone had another weapon at his disposal.\nIt was a magic that could show the highest efficiency in this situation.\n\"It's okay. Shirone will handle it.\"\nTess, not understanding the situation, looked perplexedly at Shirone, then suddenly widened her eyes.\nShirone's body was emanating a red light.\n\"What, what's that? Isn't that dangerous?\"\nHumans feel uneasy when they see red because it reminds them of bleeding.\nEven Tess was scared to see such a chilling red light, let alone the enemies.\n\"Leader, what on earth is that?\"\nShirone fired a flash of red light forward. A laser beam, fast enough to be called instantaneous, reached the gate and heated its surface.\n\"Argh! What's that?\"\nHaving already experienced the power of the Photon Cannon, the subordinates were terrified and stepped back.\nBut there was no expected shockwave or loud noise.\nLooking down from the wall at the gate, the leader regained his confidence. The current magic was merely illuminating the gate without any visible effect.\n\"Good! Now! Prepare the magic bullets!\"\nWith the returning subordinates from the traps included, there were over 40 personnel. With this number, they could devastate Shirone's surroundings with a barrage of magic bullets.\nAs all the subordinates finished aiming, the leader lowered his hand and shouted.\n\"Fire the...... Huh?\"\nThe wall began to vibrate violently.\nBoth the leader and the subordinates, about to release their bowstrings, looked at each other in shock.\nA subordinate, bending over to inspect the gate from outside the wall, spoke with a trembling voice.\n\"Le-Leader! That...\"\nThe gate shook insanely. Eventually, the vibration starting from the gate spread throughout the wall, shaking the very foundation of the structure.\nFalcoa's subordinates were appalled by the unprecedented sight.\nThe iron at the point where the laser touched boiled, bulging out like bubbles.\nThen, the wall shook as if it were about to be uprooted, and finally, with a loud boom, the gate burst open.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

A steel gate that would normally withstand any siege weapon had been breached.\n\"Damn it! Fire directly!\"\nHis command was almost a makeshift measure. Now that the gate had been breached, if they couldn't stop the invaders here, the tide of battle would swiftly turn in their favor.\nKnowing this, the subordinates directly targeted Shirone and drew their bowstrings.\n\"Fire!\"\nWith all their might, forty magic bullets were launched towards Shirone.\nDespite seeing the rapidly approaching arrows, Shirone didn't move. The radius of teleportation was insufficient to escape the range of the explosions.\nBut spatial warp was a different story.\nThe moment the forty arrows were about to land, Shirone's body turned into a flash of light and soared into the sky.\nThe whirring noise of spatial warp spread instantly, and a powerful bombardment devastated the spot where Shirone had been standing.\nTess watched the bombardment in shock. The echoing thunder throughout the valley made her feel as if she were in the heart of a battlefield.\n\"Shi-Shirone...\"\nThe magnitude of the explosion and the deafening sound were enough to shake anyone's spirit. Thus, no one realized that Shirone had cast spatial warp.\nAmy was the exception. It's said that archers hear the sound of their arrows most clearly, and swordsmen the clash of their blades.\nThus, Amy, being a mage, could distinctly hear the unique sound of spatial warp amidst the explosive roar.\n\"Shirone is safe. Let's go in.\"\nCutting through the smoke, Amy moved forward. As expected, beyond the point of bombardment, Shirone stood in front of the gate.\nSpatial warp involves the bending of light. Hence, the illusion of a flash soaring into the sky is just a misperception.\nIn reality, it wasn't Shirone soaring into the sky but the bending of space itself.\nMoreover, such an illusion can only be observed from a distance; up close, it would merely seem like a sudden disappearance.\nThis is why mages determine the use of spatial warp by sound.\n\"Buahaha! It's over! Completely over!\"\n\"Not even a trace left! There's nothing to fear now. Everyone, prepare for the assault!\"\nFalcoa's subordinates put down their bows and grabbed their weapons. With the most threatening mage presumed dead, there was nothing more to fear.\nWatching this, Tess tilted her head in confusion. Shirone was clearly standing before the gate like a reaper, yet the enemies were cheering.\n\"What's with them? Why are they like that?\"\n\"They didn't hear the sound of spatial warp like you did. They must think Shirone is dead.\"\nIt didn't take long for Falcoa's subordinates to correct their misunderstanding.\nAs Shirone slowly stepped back and emerged from behind the wall's angle, they were all startled as if seeing a ghost.\n\"Le-Leader! Over there...\"\nThe leader's face flushed red with anger. Shirone, who should have been torn apart by the bombardment, was glaring at the wall defiantly.\n\"You, you bastard!\"\nBefore the full-scale siege began, Shirone decided to give the enemies one last chance.\n\"Release Zis's sister. Then we'll leave it at this.\"\nThe leader stared blankly at Shirone. After all this chaos, he wants to leave? Where to? Does he think this is some kind of amusement park charging admission?\n\"Do you think we'll let her go alive? The real face of a siege begins once the gate is breached. Do you have any idea how much the magic circle you destroyed costs? Your life couldn't even begin to cover it. We'll make you beg for death.\"\n\"I don't want to engage in more meaningless battles. It was your mistake from the start. So I'd appreciate it if we could end this here.\"\n\"Buahaha! What? End it? Do you know who we are? We're the Parrot Mercenaries, living and dying on the battlefield! Guys, let's go! Slaughter them thoroughly!\"\n\"Uwaaaaaa!\"\nThe soldiers bravely brandished their swords and shouted.\nSeeing that words were futile, Shirone sighed and walked towards a blind spot in the wall.\nHes conveniently coming right into the trap! Guys, go down and... Huh?\"\nThe leader halted mid-sentence. A scene flashed through his mind.\nIt was the peculiar magic that had pulverized falling rocks into powder above the valley. Could he confidently claim that the walls here were stronger than those rocks?\n\"Uh, wait a moment...!\"\nThe leader rushed down the stairs to check the gate. As expected, Shirone was moving through the hole in the gate, his fist raised downward.\n\"Hey, hey, buddy, this is a joke, right? Surely you're not...\"\nFear trembled in the leader's voice. His mind went blank.\n\"Hey! Don't do it! Do you know how much effort went into building this wall? Hey!\"\nShirone, having finished charging his magic, glanced back at the leader standing on the stairway.\nFacing Shirone's intense gaze, the leader finally realized the decision had been made.\n\"Run! Everyone jump down!\"\nAs the leader ran up the stairs shouting, Shirone muttered softly.\nWildfire.\nBoom boom boom boom boom boom!\nThe Wildfire pulsed at a rate of fifteen times per second with a diameter of 20 meters. The wall shook as if an earthquake had struck, causing Falcoa's subordinates to lose their balance and fall.\nThe massive structure indeed had considerable durability. However, Shirone didn't stop the Wildfire. After all, there's a limit to the durability of materials. Keep hammering, and eventually, it will break that's a law of physics.\nThe gate clanged as if hammered, and lightning-like cracks sprinted across the wall.\nThe cracks branched out, infiltrating the entire wall, and finally, the ground shook, signaling the start of a collapse.\nThe leader was at a loss.\nHe was a veteran and had experienced several sieges, but he had never encountered such a brute-force tactic of bringing down the wall itself.\n\"Uwaaaa! Okay, we give up! Stop it!\"\nThe leader screamed, but the photons loaded with mass drumming on the wall prevented his voice from spreading even a meter.\n\"Damn! This can't be happening!\"\nThis was truly dangerous.\nIf the wall collapsed like this, the fate of the 40 lives would be left to the gods.\n\"Ugh!\"\nShirone grimaced, focusing on the Wildfire. The uniform rhythm, without acceleration or deceleration, was ejecting everything around it outward.\nFrom a vantage point where the wall was in full view, Tess blankly watched the spectacle.\nInitially, the central part of the wall was partially destroyed, followed by hysterical cracks spreading along the wall. The left side sagged slightly, and then the right side balanced out by sinking.\nAnd finally...\nRumble!\nThe entire wall came crashing down.\n\"This is... He's like a human weapon.\"\nRian agreed with Tess's sentiment. Up until now, Shirone had tended to use magic to protect others.\nSeeing him decide to truly destroy something, they were newly aware of how different the outcome could be, even with the same magic.\n\"Indeed, it's amazing. It seems I too didn't fully understand Shirone,\" Tess admitted with a nod.\nAmy smiled in agreement, recognizing that combat wasn't everything to a mage, but it certainly was a matter of pride.\n\"Shirone doesn't usually escalate situations. But when he sets his mind to it, his combat capabilities are exceptional. With this level of power, he could easily be among the top ranks in the advanced class.\"\nTess burst into laughter at Amy's words, understanding her implication.\n'It seems she's been paying attention after all. Theres always more to her than meets the eye.'\nAmy was genuinely pleased with Shirone's growth. At this rate, graduating together with Shirone might not just be a dream.\n'You've come this far, Shirone.'\nWhen the Wildfire ended, the wall had completely collapsed. The wall built along the valley side maintained some of its shape, but the center looked as if a giant boulder had rolled through, utterly flattened.\n\"Ugh...\"\nSoldiers buried under the rubble groaned and writhed.\nNot a single person was unscathed. The leader, who had tried to stop Shirone, couldn't escape the collapse and ended up with a broken arm.\nBut he was so dazed he couldn't even feel the pain.\nMemories of the past five years spent fortifying the northern hideout flashed before his eyes.\n\"This can't be. Defeated by just one person? The Parrot Mercenaries?\"\nAs the leader heard Shirone's approaching footsteps, he flinched and turned around. Confronted with Shirone's intense gaze, an uncontrollable fear surged through him.\n\"Bring Zis's sister here now! Or I won't let this slide!\"\n\"Eek!\"\nThe leader instinctively covered his face, causing his broken arm to swing like a pendulum before his eyes.\n\"Ugh!\"\nDiscovering his arm grotesquely twisted, the leader's eyes rolled back, and he fainted.\nShirone and his companions had passed the first checkpoint.\n* * *\n\"Wow, Shirone is amazing.\"\nMarsha watched Shirone's battle from 200 meters away from the wall.\nSitting on a handkerchief spread on the ground, her demeanor was as relaxed as a girl on a picnic.\nThe loss of her men was a tragedy, but such sorrow was part and parcel of a mercenary's life. She herself had been deceived by politicians' tricks, losing hundreds of her men.\n\"So strong and yet so deceivingly innocent. Or was it his strength that afforded him such leisure?\"\nShe knew Shirone had a talent for magic, but she hadn't anticipated such a performance.\nEspecially remarkable was that all of Shirone's magic was derived from his unique understanding and application.\n'An Unlocker...'\nMarsha felt pleased.\nShe liked that Shirone was strong and that he was a hypocritically compassionate human being.\nAbove all, the exciting part was that soon, such a pure and beautiful boy would be at her mercy.\n\"You're years away from catching me, little songbird.\"\nStretching, Marsha stood up. Her bracelet shone brightly, whisking her body away to a cliff in the north.\n***\nShirone and his companions continued northward. Most of Falcoa's men had been injured at the first checkpoint, so no battles ensued.\n\"This way.\"\nAmy took the lead in navigating through the forest.\nWithout a sense of direction, one could easily lose their way in nature's maze.\nBut such common sense didn't apply to Amy. Tess, following her, realized that Amy had a talent for reconnaissance.\n'Indeed. The Red Eyes can be used this way.'\nAmy's eidetic memory could perfectly reconstruct the state of specific moments. Therefore, as long as she remained conscious, she could accurately determine directions, no matter where she was moved.\n\"Amy, there's a mountain path over there.\"\nUpon hearing Shirone's direction, Amy turned and exited the forest.\nA winding mountain path led to the summit of the terrain.\nTess checked the ground. Though it seemed to be some time since it was last used, tracks from a wagon were still visible.\n\"From here on, we're entering their living area. In terms of a siege, we've penetrated the inner castle, I suppose?\"\nThis was a welcome piece of news for the group, weary from running through the forest.\nBut they couldn't relax just yet. While most of the enemy forces were neutralized, the officers, referred to as the higher-ups, were nowhere to be seen.\n\"If we follow this path, we'll reach their hideout. Let's muster a bit more strength.\"\nAmy's declaration sounded decisive, but in truth, she couldn't be sure. It was more a statement of responsibility as the leader, meant to bolster her friends' morale.\nBased on the movements recorded in her eidetic memory and the distance traveled in curves, they had moved approximately 12 kilometers from where the battle began. Converted to a straight line, this amounted to advancing over 7 kilometers on the map.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Just about a kilometer more to go...\"\nJust as Amy was about to explain, a ferocious noise erupted from the forest, and a ball of fire shot out.\n\"Ambush!

A man emerged from the forest, about the same height as Rian but with a noticeably lean and agile build.\nDespite having no eyebrows, his slicked-back hair exuded confidence, and his pale complexion resembled that of a serpent.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"The Vice-Captain of the Parrot Mercenary Corps. Agado Freeman.\"\nThe word Vice-Captain' brought tension to the faces of Shirone's party. However, it also implied that their destination was not far off.\n\"Shirone, I'll take care of this. When I give the signal, take Rian and Tess to the cliffs.\"\n\"That's too dangerous.\"\n\"And what about you? Jumping into traps alone, have you forgotten? Are you going to keep underestimating me like this?\"\n\"It's not about underestimating you. He's not alone. There are about 20 of them hiding in the forest.\"\nAmy had already confirmed this through her Spirit Zone, but that was exactly why she wanted to send Shirone ahead.\nBeing held up here would only give the first checkpoint's reinforcements time to arrive.\nAs Amy tried to convince Shirone, she pointed at Freeman.\n\"Shirone, look at that man's weapon. It's a gun.\"\nShirone too turned to look closely. The man held a weapon identical to those described in books.\nWhile a bow needed arrows to be replaced, a gun was specially designed to use only Mana Bullets.\nIt fired a small amount of Mana Bullets forward, and its design suggested that it was a revolver capable of rapid firing through the rotation of the cylinder.\n\"See? You know what a gun is, right? It can reload faster than arrows and is a direct fire weapon. Unlike arrows that explode after impact, it fires in an already activated state, making it specialized for medium to long-range combat. Probably all those hiding in the forest are using this weapon too.\"\nShirone understood Amy's point.\n\"Alright. I'll leave this to you.\"\nRian and Tess looked puzzled. Hearing about the gun only made them think the situation was even more dangerous. Why then was Shirone so willing to leave Amy behind?\n\"I'll use a Fire Wall to buy us some time and prevent their pursuit. Break through in that moment.\"\n\"Got it. Rian, Tess, be ready.\"\nRian followed Shirone's lead without question. Although it felt wrong to leave a comrade behind, this was not the time for debate, and Tess also braced herself, ready to spring into action.\n\"Now! Go!\"\nAmy shouted with wide eyes, and as Shirone took the lead, Rian and Tess followed on either side.\nAs expected, flames shot from all directions in the forest, courtesy of the guns.\nAmy cast a Fire Wall in a massive circle around her.\nThe ground bubbled like boiling mud, and flames erupted from beneath her feet, charging fiercely into the forest.\nThen, amplifying her mental power, the wall of fire roared, obstructing the enemies' view.\nAt the same time, Shirone, grabbing Rian and Tess, initiated a spatial transfer. Although its range was shorter compared to that of a high wizard, it was enough to disappear from the enemies' sight in a blink.\nHearing the noise of the spatial warp, Amy finally ceased casting the Fire Wall and gasped for breath.\nThe Fire Wall, known as a mana-eating parasite, required continuous mental effort to maintain its barrier.\nDespite its powerful effect, it wasn't considered overpowered due to the high cost of casting it.\nHowever, Freeman was purely impressed. The girl standing before him was barely in her teens.\nTo his knowledge, it was extremely rare for a mage of her age to cast a Fire Wall of such magnitude.\n\"Commendable. To sacrifice for your comrades.\"\n\"Hmph! Sacrifice, my foot. I sent them away because I can handle it myself.\"\n\"Is that so? You seem quite exhausted, though. Sorry, but we're in a hurry and can't afford to wait.\"\nAs Freeman finished speaking, his subordinates appeared.\nThe fact that none tried to extinguish the burning forest indicated the absence of mages among them. However, they were all Schema users, like Freeman, and held guns.\nThe combination of Schema and magic in combat. Such individuals were known as Gunners on the battlefield.\nHaving never witnessed a Gunner's battle, Amy could only imagine. She too could wield long-range magic and Schema simultaneously.\nFreeman's men opened the cylinders of their guns and loaded Mana Bullets. It seemed each cylinder could hold at least six Mana Bullets.\nWith twelve rounds in total and twenty enemies, the cycle of their firepower was two hundred forty Mana Bullets.\n\"Sorry, but your reckless adventure ends here.\"\nAs Freeman spoke, his subordinates raised their guns.\nCertainly, the subordinates reflected the character of their leader, unlike those under Falcoa's command.\nThey showed no complacency or bravado, focusing solely on eliminating their targets.\nAmy couldn't help but smirk. While Shirone had been the main contributor to their battles so far, she hadn't expected such a low estimation of her abilities.\n\"Only twenty of you for a shootout with me?\"\nAmy concentrated, drawing her legs together as if channeling strength to her lower abdomen, and began to cast a spell.\nA whirlwind swirled around her, lifting fist-sized stones into the air around her, which then ignited with a whooshing sound.\n\"You've picked the wrong opponent this time.\"\nAmy's eyes blazed red.\n* * *\nEven as she ran, Tess kept looking back. Though she trusted and followed Shirone's lead, the plan seemed reckless.\nGunners might be weaker in firepower compared to mages, but they matched swordsmen in physical prowess.\nThe thought of Amy fighting among them made Tess's stomach clench.\n\"Shirone, shouldn't we go back now? I'm worried about Amy.\"\n\"It'll be fine. Delaying only puts us at a disadvantage. We might be pursued by the forces that survived the first checkpoint. Our priority is to reach the hideout as quickly as possible.\"\n\"But what about Amy? Wouldn't it have been better if you took out the enemies and came back?\"\nUnderstanding Tess's concern, Shirone gave a wry smile.\n\"It's not like that. A mages strength isn't simply measured by their power. It varies with the situation and the type of magic. Against Gunners, Amy is far stronger than I am.\"\nTess seemed unconvinced.\nShe knew Amy was a senior student, but the feats Shirone had performed since arriving were nothing short of incredible.\nCould there really be a situation where Amy could outshine Shirone, who had already proven himself to be exceptionally powerful?\n\"Is that possible? No matter how skilled, there's something to be said for numerical superiority.\"\nTess, thinking like a true swordsman, placed emphasis on physical strength.\nIndeed, in battle, the total physical force represented by numbers is a critical factor.\nHowever, when it comes to magic, the scenario shifts slightly.\nFor mages, who manipulate countless phenomena through the combination of knowledge and omnipotence, the number of opponents isn't as critical.\nWhat matters more to them is the ability to manipulate situations to maximize the efficiency of their finely honed skills.\n\"The properties of photons differ from those of flames. Moreover, the strategies of the Four Symbols are distinct. Amy specializes in long-range magic, maximizing the advantages of her Red Eyes. No matter how strong the enemies in the forest might be, if Amy confronts them in her element...\"\nShirone stated confidently.\n\"No matter their numbers, they stand no chance against Amy.\"\nTess swallowed hard. Normally, she felt like she was looking after a stubborn younger sibling when dealing with Shirone and Amy, but in the heat of battle, they turned as cold and calculating as ice.\n\"You guys are truly amazing. How can you be so resolute?\"\n\"That's a misunderstanding on your part. If anyone's amazing, it's you, Tess.\"\n\"Tch, what have I done? You were the one who breached the fortress, and I didn't even lend a hand.\"\nShirone didn't see it that way. The paths of swordsmen and mages are inherently different from the start.\nWhile the mental arts can see individuals surpass age-related expectations, physical growth supports the swordsman's path, typically leading to their prominence emerging somewhat later.\nTess and Rian would grow stronger over time, each carrying their convictions upon their swords, forging their unique paths.\n\"Shirone, we've arrived.\"\nEmerging from the forest, they were greeted by the sight of the vast blue sea churning below a magnificent cliff.\nTo the east of the cliff, a brick house was visible, likely their hideout. Yet, reaching it required passing one final obstacle.\nSquad Leader Falcoa awaited Shirone's party.\nTess furrowed her brows in confusion. Given her assessment of his character, Falcoa should have long since charged into battle.\n\"What's going on? He's still here?\"\n\"Kek, smashing you right from the start would have been fun. But, I have my orders.\"\nFalcoa's compliance was driven by Marsha's directives. Although it went against his temperament, he followed them, for it was she who transformed him from a societal pariah into a hero of the battlefield.\n\"Well, you've made it this far. The leader was right. The woman you're looking for is inside that building. Try going in and taking her out.\"\nFalcoa mockingly stepped aside, but Shirone's group remained stationary. The lethal aura that had been absent in the royal palace now barred their way, dense and overwhelming.\nTess empathized with Amy's position. Facing a master of such caliber necessitated a level of risk-taking from their side as well.\n\"We're being baited. I'll handle this with Rian. Shirone, go inside and bring Yuna back.\"\nShirone nodded without hesitation, understanding the plan. Tess realized why Amy had smiled; rather than feeling slighted, she felt a warmth of trust.\n'So this cold world has its warmth, too. Is this what being trusted feels like?'\nWith Shirone's skills, escaping alone was hardly a challenge. After a brief pause, he executed a spatial warp, vanishing in a flash of light.\nYet, Falcoa didn't even glance in his direction.\nTess realized then that Falcoa had intended to let Shirone pass from the beginning.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Well, I have my orders from the leader, and frankly, I prefer the company of the ladies.\"\nDrawing his sword, Falcoa pointed it at Tess. His murky aura was unmistakable, yet the drunken instability was gone.\nWithout taking her eyes off Falcoa, Tess relayed the strategy to Rian.\n\"He's a Schema user. I'll hold him off; you attack.\"\nJudging by his stance alone, Falcoa's prowess was evident. As a fellow Schema user, Tess taking on the defensive role seemed the best chance for survival.\n\"That won't do. I'll defend; you attack.\"\n\"Are you crazy? How could you possibly hold him off? I hate to say it, but you can't handle him alone.\"\n\"If it's impossible, then so be it.\"\n\"What?\"\nTess was incredulously wide-eyed, but Rian was serious, not showing any sign of giving up the fight, merely standing his ground.\n\"We're here to defeat him, not just to survive. Fighting just to save our own skins isn't the point.\"\nTess couldn't argue.\n\"You might buy us time, but you know it's not enough to win. We'd both end up dead. So, I'll hold him off. You focus on the attack.\"\nRian's logic was sound. Sharpening the blade, not fortifying the shield, was the essence of victory, even at the cost of life.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

His Schema isn't just at a student's level.\"\n\"Even so, what choice do we have? We just have to give it a try.\"\nRian let his greatsword, a symbol of Ogent, hang low as he advanced slowly. Tess, on the other hand, moved sideways, slipping out of Falcoa's line of sight.\nTheir positioning was textbook for a two-person team, but Falcoa seemed unfazed.\nWhat would the spirits of those slain by his blade think if he were to be swayed by mere fledglings?\nRian boldly extended his greatsword and declared, \"Come at me. I'll take you on.\"\nBut before he could finish, Falcoa had already closed the distance with an astonishing burst of speed, laughing maniacally.\nRian, who managed to block the vertically descending longsword, felt a sting in his nose. It wasn't the clash of swords, but rather the impact of a hammer.\n\"Already giving up?\"\nFalcoa furiously grated against the greatsword, and with each impact, Rian's knees buckled until he was finally brought to his knees.\n\"Kugh!\"\nThe muscles in the arm holding the straight sword spasmed, and in that moment, Falcoa's kick struck Rian's solar plexus.\nRian's body rolled away like a ball.\n\"Rian!\"\nTess cried out in despair. The situation seemed to have concluded, but defying Falcoa's expectations, Rian managed to rise again.\nNot only his extraordinary strength but also his resilience was one of Rian's specialties.\n\"Phew, I get it. So that's your level?\"\nFalcoa's eyebrows twitched, but Rian didn't stop there. He aimed his greatsword straight and provoked his opponent again.\n\"Alright. The real fight starts now. Come at me all you want.\"\n\"Kekkek, I'll kill you.\"\nA grin spread across Falcoa's face, reminiscent of his days as the battlefield fiend.\n***\nShirone entered the building, revealing a tidy living room, uncharacteristic of a place used by mercenaries, with rows of potted plants under the sunlit windows.\n\"Where is Zis's sister?\"\nShirone wandered from room to room until, upon opening the third door, he froze with his hand on the knob.\nThe room smelled pleasant, with a red carpet and furniture arranged in an orderly fashion.\nShirone looked at the woman sitting on the bed. He had been vaguely aware of her when Tess spoke, but seeing her in person was a shock.\n\"Oh, you're here, Shirone. How have you been?\"\n\"Marsha\nMarsha was indeed the leader of the organization that kidnapped Yuna. Yet, her kind face and smile made it hard to hold such thoughts.\n\"Did you get home okay that day? Did you make up with your friend?\"\nShirone swallowed the response that had risen to his throat. It seemed Marsha knew he was coming but still didn't hand over Yuna.\n\"You already know, don't you? You must have heard everything.\"\n\"Oh my, why so serious, Shirone? Are you angry with your sis? I'm sorry for deceiving you that day.\"\nAs Marsha coquettishly approached, Shirone kept the same distance between them, stepping back.\n\"Phew, you really are angry. How can I make it up to you? Should I kneel and beg right here? If that's what you want, I'll do it.\"\n\"Please return Zis's sister. That's all I ask.\"\n\"Ah! Was that it? You should have said so sooner. I thought you came to fight me. Well, it's not like kind-hearted Shirone would do such a thing. I'm relieved.\"\nShirone was confused. Who was this person, really? Her behavior, as if from another world, was incomprehensible.\n\"Where is Yuna?\"\n\"She's upstairs. You can take her if you want.\"\nShirone turned away, not wanting to think about Marsha anymore. He just wanted to leave this place as soon as possible.\n\"Ah, right. But shouldn't you take something to cover her with?\"\nShirone stopped in his tracks. When he turned back, Marsha was smiling playfully.\n\"It would be awkward to see a stranger's naked body, right? That's why I'm telling you in advance. Don't be too shocked. She might be out of her mind, you know. My men can be quite rough.\"\nAs Shirone's gaze turned icy, Marsha spoke even faster.\n\"I was there, you know. The screaming was no joke. Thinking about it now, it might have been too much. But Shirone, do you know? I ordered all of it. But you'll understand, right? Because you're the kind Shirone. Right?\"\nShirone remained silent, which seemed to bring immense joy to Marsha.\n\"How does it feel, Shirone?\"\n\"What feeling? What exactly do you want to hear?\"\nShirone no longer saw any value in respecting Marsha, but to her, this was an exhilarating moment.\n\"Hohoho! Are you really angry? Why are you mad at me? You used to say my thievery would eventually be okay, but have you changed your mind? Maybe you should have scolded me harshly back then. Then, perhaps I wouldn't have kidnapped Yuna. Honestly, you were so annoying.\"\nShirone fully faced her. Yuna was no longer the issue. Marsha had crossed a line that should never have been crossed.\n\"Huh? Answer me. How does it feel? Are you going crazy? Does it feel miserable that your once-beloved sister has turned out this way? Do you feel like there's nothing left to believe in this world?\"\n\"To play with someone's emotions like that... Do you need to hear it out loud to be satisfied?\"\nMarsha's laughter stopped as Shirone posed his question.\n\"If you really wanted that, you could have just done it. But why care about my feelings? Afraid I might be disappointed?\"\n\"Stop talking nonsense! I'm mocking you!\"\n\"Really? Then shall I tell you what I think of you right now?\"\nMarsha's face stiffened, waiting for Shirone's response as if deprived of the power to choose her words.\n\"I don't hate you. In my memory, you're still a good person.\"\nMarsha's expression changed in real-time. From perplexity to disappointment, and then to anger.\n\"Don't spout nonsense. If that's true, can you forgive me? Can you smile at me like before, even after I've trampled over Zis's sister?\"\n\"No. You've done something unforgivable. If you really did what you said, I could never forgive you.\"\n\"Ha! You think I'm lying? But what if I'm telling the truth? Go upstairs and see for yourself.\"\n\"Even if it's true, I won't hate you. It's just...\"\nShirone bit his lip as he looked at her.\n\"...sad that someone who should understand that pain better than anyone else would do such a thing.\"\nSparks flew from Marsha's eyes. Her expression twisted into a fierce scowl, and her teeth gnashed.\nIf she had really trampled Yuna, she might not have felt unjustified. But she couldn't stand it. The way Shirone spoke as if he knew everything about her was infuriating.\n\"You! You really piss me off!\"\nShirone hastily backed away. The sharpness of Marsha's aura, infiltrating his empathy, was palpable.\nA star-shaped Zone.\nIt was a unique sensation exclusive to those with offensive Schemas among the Four Symbols.\nAs Marsha prepared to attack, Shirone countered with a defensive stance. However, Yuna on the second floor was at stake.\nUrban environments posed quite a challenge for mages. It wasn't as simple as reducing the range of their Spirit Zone.\nTo a swordsman, it was akin to abandoning a longsword, their primary weapon, for a short dagger in combat.\n'What kind of mage could she be...'\nWhile Shirone observed Marsha, preparing for any incoming attack, he pre-emptively cast Photon Transformation, ready to evade instantly.\nBut Marsha's magic exceeded Shirone's expectations. As she narrowed her eyes and unleashed a piercing scream, an overwhelming roar assaulted his eardrums.\n\"Kugh!\"\nShirone staggered under the mental assault. It felt as if a needle had pierced through one ear and exited through the other, sending a jolt of pain.\n'Sonic Cannon. She's a sound mage. This is dangerous.'\nSound mages specialize in acoustics. They create various sound waves by vibrating the air, not necessarily through human voices. A prime example of their offensive magic was the Sonic Cannon Marsha had just cast.\nThe pressure from a Sonic Cannon exceeds 150 decibels. At close range, it could rupture eardrums and cause deafness.\nBeing a directional magic that amplifies sound waves, it doesn't spread widely like a laser but remains concentrated, making it one of the more challenging magics to counter due to its invisibility.\n'This is a disadvantageous position.'\nJust as the efficiency of Shirone and Amy could drastically vary depending on the situation and environment, so too was a confined space practically Marsha's home turf in dealing with sound.\nShirone racked his brain for a way out of the current predicament. He finally opted for ultra-fast short-range teleportation within the cramped space.\nMixing Spacial Warp and Rainbow Drop, he moved around the room, the complex patterns of light confusing Marsha.\nShirone then attempted to strike from behind with a Photon Cannon. However, Marsha easily dodged the magic coming from her blind spot with a mere twist of her body.\n'How?'\nUnless she had eyes on the back of her head, there was no way to detect an attack from a blind spot.\nAnd even if she did, evading a Photon Cannon at this distance would be impossible.\n\"Huhu, surprised? You didn't think that was all I had, did you?\"\n\"Could it be... Sonar?\"\n\"Wow, befitting a magic school graduate. Studying hard, aren't we?\"\nSonar is the ability to perceive sound. Though primarily maximized underwater, mages can fully mediate their Zones to manifest it anywhere.\nA master of Sonar can outperform a Seer in terms of detection capabilities, making it only natural for Marsha to react to the Photon Cannon instantly.\n\"Amplification magic is so tedious. It lacks finesse.\"\nShirone tilted his head. It was odd to hear a mage belittle their own learned magic. After all, no mage would degrade their own spellcraft.\n\"But this, I like this.\nIf she had mastered Sonar, there was no need to amplify sound at all. As Marsha spread her arms, Sonic Cannons fired from both sides.\nShirone urgently teleported, but the sound was faster than his reflexes.\nThe high-decibel sound waves scrambled his mind, disrupting his magic. Such sound-based magic was perilously effective against mages, who rely on mental focus.\nMarsha then employed Sidelooping to encompass the entire building.\nIt was a magic similar to how dolphins emit sound waves and interpret the echoes, allowing the detection of existence, direction, and distance, regardless of obstructions.\nShirone was cornered. The Sonic Cannon was indefensible, and Sidelooping's instant detection made even Photon Cannon easily avoidable.\n'It's so strange. Sound magic is highly specialized. How could Marsha, a mercenary, wield such spells?'\nSound mages dedicate their lives solely to the study and collection of sounds. Even encountering a unique opportunity wouldn't suffice without academic knowledge, making sound magic an intricately complex field.\n\"Enjoying the look on your face. It's as if you're wondering, 'How could someone like you...?'\"\nShirone faced a crucial moment, caught in a battle where his usual strengths were nullified, against an opponent whose abilities seemed beyond the realm of ordinary mercenaries.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

At this moment, no magic was more effective than blocking his ears.\n\"Argh!\"\nHowever, Shirone's expectation was completely off the mark.\nA sonic cannon of a different dimension from before pierced through the back of his hand. If he hadn't blocked his ears, his eardrums would have burst.\n\"Huff, you're underestimating me too much. I might not have gone to school, but I can at least do arithmetic sequences.\"\nMarsha, classified as a non-magic school graduate by the Magic Society, was also a veteran who had killed numerous mages. It wasn't an exaggeration to say that she had acquired the important theories in practice through experience.\n\"Banshee's Scream.\"\nAs Marsha vibrated the Spirit Zone, a bizarre sound that seemed to stretch out filled the room.\nShirone, terrified by the sudden phenomenon, jumped to his feet. He couldn't see. The world was pitch black, as if his retinas had been blackened.\n'What is this? What kind of magic is this?'\nSound mages travel the world collecting various sounds. Among them, banshees are winged humanoid monsters that live in high-altitude areas, characterized by their female upper bodies.\nMarsha used sound magic to perfectly imitate the banshee's unique high-frequency sound, which blinds its prey's eyes and then consumes them.\nShirone became anxious. He couldn't determine Marsha's location through the Spirit Zone.\nThe narrow space was dizzying with the echoes of the sound waves, and Marsha, as the origin of the sound waves, could only be sensed through sound.\nWhile Shirone's senses were paralyzed, Marsha had already approached him and extended her palm towards his ear. At this distance, a direct hit from the sonic cannon would halt brain function.\n'Farewell, Shirone.'\nAt that moment, Shirone's Zone vibrated violently. Marsha, sensing the crisis with the sensitivity of a sonar, immediately retreated. At the same time, a fury burst out, pushing the equipment in the room away.\nShirone, with his eyes tightly shut, surrounded himself with lasers in all directions.\nRapidly swirling lasers couldn't cause much impact, but Marsha, who had confirmed their power at the first gateway, crouched under the desk.\nHidden behind cover, Marsha couldn't see the front with her eyes. However, using the sonar's search ability, she could clearly feel what Shirone was doing.\n'Huh?'\nMarsha's heart dropped. Shirone was precisely focusing the Photon Cannon right in front of him towards her direction.\nHow could he? Banshee's scream echoing in the small room usually doesn't fade easily.\nMarsha remembered the lasers that had swirled around the room.\n'Could it be? Cutting the sound?'\nIt wasn't easy to disrupt sound waves with ordinary magic. However, a high-efficiency energy amplification like a laser could possibly cut through sound waves.\nMarsha didn't know the principle of lasers, but Shirone understood the principle of sound. This difference in responsiveness. That's why magic schools teach a wide range of disciplines beyond their majors.\n\"This can't be...!\"\nShirone, with his eyes sharp, launched the Photon Cannon towards Marsha. At the same time, Marsha, like a squirrel, leaped out to the side and rolled.\nBoom!\nA heavy sphere of light penetrated the wall of the building and stretched out.\n* * *\nThe battle in the forest was reminiscent of a war.\nFreeman's subordinates clearly didn't understand the value of magic bullets. Firing recklessly, they completely destroyed the surrounding landscape.\nBut the ones cornered were them. The number had reduced from twenty to seven, and they still hadn't located Amy.\n\"Damn it! Where the hell is she?\"\n\"There! She just passed by there!\"\nFrom deep within the forest, a burning stone flew in, hitting a gunner directly in the back of the head, even though he was in an open Schema, knocking him unconscious.\n\"Damn! She's deliberately using fire-type magic.\"\n\"There's no ghost like her. She moves so fast and still with incredible accuracy.\"\nFor a gunner, mobility and accuracy are crucial. Amy was overwhelmingly dominating in both aspects.\nBeing able to use Fly magic stably and targeting almost perfectly accurate was because she was a Red-Eye.\n\"Phew, only six left now. No, including Freeman, seven.\"\nAmy levitated the stones around her again. The stones heated up and burst into flames like lava.\nIf the photon series had the Photonization Theory, the flame series had the Ignition Theory. Known as Ignite, it was the foundation of the flame series magic.\nThe properties of the flame created by Ignite could be divided into five categories.\nHeat, which generates heat; Flare, which kindles fire; Burn, which sets objects on fire; Blaze, which burns a wide area; and Buster, which causes explosions.\nHeating a stone with Burn-type flame was called Fire Call, a magic that burns rocks like lava and throws them.\nFor a fire mage, the Burn series is important as it compensates for the lightness, a drawback of the flame. Hence, it was perfect for dealing with gunners using Schemas.\n\"Shall we go again?\"\nAmy, soaring into the sky, mercilessly dropped Fire Call.\nCompared to the child's play of Meteor bombardment, it was terrifying for those on the receiving end.\n\"From above! Fire everything!\"\nThe gunners aimed their guns at the sky and shot magic bullets. However, Amy, adjusting for errors with eidetic memory, was playing with her opponents in terms of evasion and accuracy.\nFly magic could be learned by anyone, but maintaining balance in the air, where the atmosphere constantly changes, wasn't easy.\nYet, Amy seemed to hover in the sky, rapidly backing up her eidetic memory, her pupils glowing red at an incredible speed.\nWith each exchange of bullets, the number of enemies decreased by one.\nWhen only two of Freeman's subordinates remained, Amy poured out all the remaining Fire Call.\nPrecision targeting was no longer necessary. The burning stones thudded into the heads and backs of the fleeing enemies.\nOnly then did Amy deactivate her Fly magic and landed in the clearing.\nTwenty gunners were annihilated in an instant. Only Freeman remained.\n\"Your men have been taken down, and you haven't changed your expression. Isn't that too cold? Or are you a coward?\"\n\"If disliking fighting makes me a coward, then maybe.\"\nAmy frowned at Freeman's words. If it was a psychological warfare, it was quite a high-level technique.\nBut Freeman didn't care what she thought.\n-Freeman is coming. The coward Freeman is coming.\n-If you make Freeman cry, Marsha will come. The loser who relies on a woman for help.\nRecalling past memories, Freeman made an unexpected proposal.\n\"Let's stop this.\"\n\"What? What did you just say?\"\nAmy was dumbfounded. She was on the verge of victory, and suddenly he suggested stopping. Besides, such a proposal was not respectful to the subordinates who had fought with their lives on the line.\n\"I'm worried about the leader. I think I need to go. I don't want her to fall.\"\n\"Hmph, no one wants to lose. That's why you should have lived kindly from the start.\"\n\"That's not what I mean. She must not lose. Even if it means dying.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nFreeman didn't answer Amy's question. He just muttered to himself, telling his own story.\n\"The leader is strong. Friends could die.\"\n\"Hmph, Shirone is stronger. He'll never lose to such a woman.\"\n\"Loyal to the end. It's good to trust your man, but you'll regret it.\"\nAmy, apparently displeased at being misunderstood as being blindly loyal, raised her fist and shouted.\n\"You're joking. And I'm stronger than Shirone, you bastard. So I can't let you go, you'll have to fall right here.\"\n\"Is that so.\"\nRealizing that negotiations had broken down, Freeman gripped two guns in his hands and activated his Schema.\nAs he looked at Amy, his figure blurred like an afterimage and then disappeared.\nAmy couldn't even react, but as she sensed someone behind her through her Zone, she hurriedly twisted her body.\nFreeman's kick grazed her chin and passed by. Amy bit her molars in frustration.\n'Damn... I made a mistake!'\nShe had expected a long-range attack from a gunner, but he had approached for close combat instead. His thought process was clearly different from that of his subordinates who had relied solely on magic bullets.\n\"Hmph! I'll take you on seriously too!\"\nAs Amy regained her composure, Freeman, who had jumped into the air, fired a barrage of magic bullets. Explosive fireballs fell towards Amy like a dotted line.\nHowever, Amy also continuously fired Flame Strikes, neutralizing all of them.\nAligning a point with a line in an infinitely vast coordinate system is an extremely difficult task. The precision of both was neck and neck.\nThe two collided again on the ground and engaged in a close-range firepower duel. But, as expected, the gunner had the advantage at close range.\n\"In that case...!\"\nAmy deployed the defensive magic Fire Mist. A gust of hot wind blew, and smoky reddish mist enveloped the surroundings like a gas cloud.\nWhen Freeman retreated out of range, Amy fired a barrage of Flame Strikes to end it there. Dozens of fiery spears rushed forward, burning the air.\nBut that wasn't the end. Amy teleported repeatedly around Freeman, endlessly casting magic.\nDozens of Flame Strikes converged on one point, and Freeman widened his eyes and opened his Schema.\nOne of the eye techniques, Compound Eye.\nThe scene Freeman saw was fragmented as if viewed through an insect's eyes.\nAs individual pieces of analyzed information arrived, Freeman's waist twisted like a willow branch.\nThe successive Flame Strikes didn't even brush his clothes as they crossed paths in chronological order.\nAmy sensed that it wasn't an ordinary technique. Although it couldn't compare to the Red-Eye, it was clearly an eye technique specialized for gunners.\nShe changed her strategy and hid in the forest. Facing a high-level gunner, she had no chance in close combat.\nHowever, Amy had another specialty: sniping. From a distance of 300 meters, she watched Freeman calmly open the cylinder and replace the magic bullets.\n'Hmph, let's see how long you can stay relaxed.'\nAmy transformed her Target-type Spirit Zone into Sniper Mode. The Zone extended in a cone shape, aiming directly at Freeman's face.\nAs the distance increases, the power of Flame Strike amplifies due to the creation of an Air Tunnel, a characteristic of wind magic.\nUsing air pressure, an object can accelerate the more it flies. A Flame Strike fired from 300 meters would have nearly four times the power at close range.\nAs Amy cast the spell, the fiery spear was sucked into the air tunnel, rushing towards Freeman.\nAt 200 meters, Amy thought it was over. With the current acceleration, the speed for the remaining 100 meters would exceed four times that of the first 200 meters.\nFreeman had no chance of reacting.\nAs expected, Freeman didn't move, but Amy was shocked. The Flame Strike hit far from Freeman.\n'Did I make a mistake?'\nAt that moment, Amy realized. A strange sensation had infiltrated her mind.\n\"Anti-magic...\"\nFreeman's gun was undoubtedly endowed with anti-magic magic.\nShe felt it was about 3 percent, but at a distance of 300 meters, the error could be enormous.\nAnti-magic was dangerous for her. It directly affected the Zone, making it a magic that even Red Eyes couldn't counter.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 156: The Second Encounter (4)\nWE TRIED TRANSLATIONS\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nDiscord:\nhttps://dsc.gg/wetried\nINFINITE MAGE\nAmy realized that Freeman was more tactical than she had expected.\nWith the mastery of Schema and Compound Eye, even a 3 percent Anti-Magic was enough to neutralize her sniping.\nShe could fight at all distancesclose, mid, and long.\n\"Have you been hiding there?\"\nHolding a gun loaded with Magic Bullets, Freeman soared into the air. The process of stepping on trees to dominate the distance was so rapid it seemed disjointed.\nThe ensuing battle turned into a chase.\nDespite her continuous attempts to snipe him, hitting Freeman proved elusive. No matter how much she backed up her Red Eye, a 3 percent margin of error always crept in.\nGetting up to mid-range seemed feasible, but it essentially meant entering Freemans turf.\n\"There's no other way.\"\nAmy stubbornly continued to snipe, but Freeman, who didnt even need to dodge, was almost yawning.\nWhatever method she thought up, it didnt matter. Her snipes would miss, and if she approached, he could just evade with his Compound Eye.\n\"I heard that a mages mental strength has its limits...\"\nIn the early stages of combat, a mage who didnt need to reload had an advantage, but over time, the momentum was bound to shift towards the gunner.\nAs the speed of her Flame Strikes slowed, Freeman began to actively hunt his prey.\nAmy was out of mental strength to cast any more spells. It felt as if her mind was bleaching out. The Omniscience and Omnipotence were not sticking.\nHa. Ha.\nYet, Amy squeezed out every last bit of mental strength she had. And finally, she cast one last Flame Strike.\nFreeman watched the approaching magic calmly. True to his expertise in ballistics, he had already noticed the strike was minutely off target.\nHe raised his two guns and hooked his index fingers on the triggers, confident she couldn't even maintain her Fly magic anymore. It seemed safe to think of her as an ordinary girl now.\nBang!\nIn that moment, a powerful shock struck Freeman's temple. For the first time, emotion showed on his face.\nConfusion and awe.\nSurely, the Flame Strike had deviated by 10 meters from the intended target. How then could it have impacted him?\nHis thoughts went no further. Struck in a vital spot, Freeman crashed to the ground with a thud, sprawling out as flames began to rise from his face.\nMarsha\nClinging painfully to a tree as she descended to the ground, Amy couldnt help but collapse onto her buttocks.\nThe fatigue was immense, far surpassing the weariness of an ordinary person staying up for four nights straight.\nYet, the feeling wasnt all that bad since her risky gamble had paid off.\nHuff! Huff! Done. I won.\nThe range of Amy's last attack in Sniper Mode was actually no more than 100 meters.\nIf Freeman hadnt approached, the Flame Strike would have vanished before even reaching its target.\nBut he had charged in, and that was his critical mistake. The 200 meters Amy had relinquished in distance were countered with a Deviate Formation of the Four Way Formation.\nSuch a maneuver ensured the Flame Strike, held in its own zone, could change its trajectory and strike Freeman.\nWith this method, even 3 percent Anti-Magic couldnt evade the attack.\nIf before they were throwing stones, this time it was as if she had grabbed one and struck directly.\nAnyway, Im glad I won. It would have been embarrassing to die and not even make it to heaven.\nAs her friends were likely still embroiled in their own battles, Amy had no leisure to recover her strength. She trudged towards the cliff with a stooped posture.\n***\nFreemans face was burning, yet he made no sound.\nFrom the moment he regained consciousness from the pain of his burns, only one thought occupied his mind.\nI need to get to Marsha.\nDespite the flames continuously scorching his skin, Freemans body was regenerating at a matching pace.\nCaught between the dual extremes of pain and relief, Freeman recalled his younger days spent with Marsha.\nEh? Its Freeman. The cowardly Freeman.\nUnibrow Freeman! Why arent you crying yet? Cry, I tell you!\nFreeman was always the butt of jokes because he was a coward.\nOf course, no one is born a coward. He believed his severely sloped unibrow was the cause of all his troubles.\nStop it. It hurts, he protested.\nThen cry about it. If you cry, Marsha will come. Pretty Marsha, that is.\nDont bully Marsha!\nStupid, Marshas the boss around here, whod bully her? Plus, shes fun! Anyway, just start crying already. Eh, eh.\nAaaaah! Marsha!\nUnable to hold back his tears, Freeman fled.\nThe children were desperate to make him cry. They would poke his face with branches as a matter of course, and sometimes even throw stones when they were particularly harsh.\nHey! Tell Marsha to come here! Were going to play war.\nThe children cried Freeman to bring Marsha out to play. Yet, despite this, Freeman always ran to Marshas house.\nIt was the only place the bullied boy had to go.\nEach time, he felt the loneliness of her home. Her father, a mercenary, didnt even bother to furnish the house. When he went on jobs, he would stay out all night and upon returning, he would invariably beat Marsha.\nOpening the door to Marshas room revealed a starkly empty space. A leftover piece of bread and a glass of milk occupied the only corner in a room devoid of a bed or desk.\nMarsha, hic, the kids hit me.\nMarsha, always with her hair cut short but beautiful nonetheless, greeted Freeman with a warm smile.\nYou never get tired of being bullied, huh? Why do you even hang out with those kids?\nIts not by choice. They find me and bully me.\nAlright. Ill go talk to them. Where are they?\nFreeman, wiping his nose, pleaded,\nCant you just not go? If you leave, uncle will come in and beat you up.\nIts the same whether Im beaten by him or the kids. Ill tell them not to bully you anymore.\nNo! You dont like playing with those jerks either. Youre just forcing yourself because of me. I hate seeing Marsha smile at those jerks.\nOh my, thank you for that. Then try to be a bit tougher. Dont talk big if you need help.\nMarsha playfully poked Freemans forehead as he became annoyed and ran towards the door, spreading his arms and yelling.\nI still dont like it! Dont go!\nWhy are you like this today? Try talking big to the other kids too. Oh, are you jealous because I play with them? Is that why?\nFreemans face flushed red. He was so nervous, his heart pounded audibly, and he felt like he might vomit.\nAmused by his reaction, Marsha waved her hand dismissively.\nHey, Im just kidding, just kidding. You're such a small fry\nYes! I like you! What are you going to do about it, huh?\nMarsha looked at Freeman blankly.\nSo what if I like you? Did I ever ask you to reciprocate? Liking someone is my own business, why do you get to dictate that? Am I not allowed to like someone because Im a coward?\nFreeman, usually poor at expressing his feelings, yelled as his emotions got the better of him, escalating the situation until Marsha stepped forward with her hands out to calm him down.\nOkay, okay, I get it. Im sorry. Liking someone is certainly your prerogative.\nDamn it! Even you treat me like a fool!\nAs Marsha spoke to him as if he were a child, Freemans anger grew. She then chuckled and grabbed his wrist, pulling him over to sit in her usual spot.\nI wasnt treating you like a fool. So calm down a bit.\nMarsha wrapped herself in a tattered cloak and prepared to leave.\nFeeling embarrassed by his outburst, Freeman fell silent for a moment before sheepishly looking up.\nAre you really going to play with them?\nNo, Ill just scold them a bit and come back. Lets play together later.\nFreemans expression brightened immediately.\nReally? You have to come back soon!\nYes. If youre hungry, eat the bread and milk. Ive already finished mine.\nAs Marsha left the house, silence fell again. Freeman, too, seemed to merge with the impoverished surroundings, his expression turning glum.\nAh, I was going to say this when I gave it to her.\nFreeman took a small hand mirror out of his pocket. It was something he had bought with the little money he had earned from running errands for three months.\nMarsha owned hardly anything else, as her stepfather took everything else.\nShes a girl, after all; she should have a mirror. That uncle is really strange. Why does he treat such a beautiful daughter like that?\nThinking that Marsha would like the gift, Freeman smiled. However, the reflection in the mirror was not a smiling face.\nIt was his severely drooping unibrow.\nBecause of this brow, he had been nicknamed a crybaby since he was young, and having lived like that for ten years, he had indeed become a crybaby.\nIs it really that strange? I think its okay.\nAs time passed, Marsha and Freeman had both turned 17.\nFreeman was still known as a coward around the neighborhood, but he worked diligently, earning him a reasonable reputation.\nHowever, the only person he genuinely connected with was Marsha.\nHe saved the money left over from his living expenses to buy her gifts.\nDespite the fact that her father took everything he gave her, Marsha was genuinely happy to receive the gifts.\nFreeman would spend any amount to see her smile.\nAt some point, she seemed to have lost her smile. He had a vague idea why. Recently, her stepfather had been abusing her more severely.\nMost of the kids grew up in similar family environments.\nFreeman also lived with a drunken father who insulted him daily.\nThen one day, Freeman finally understood. The type of touching Marsha endured from her stepfather was completely different from typical parental discipline.\nMarsha, Marsha?\nIt may have been fate that led him to Marsha's house that night. He had been concerned since seeing her unusually gloomy face earlier that day.\nAs Marsha did not respond to his knocking, his anxiety grew.\nWith no choice, Freeman climbed through the window. Since there was nothing to steal, the window was usually left open in the summer.\nHey, Marsha? You were in your room? But why didnt you answer\nFreeman froze as the moonlight revealed the scene inside the room. Marsha was seen kneeling, appearing soulless.\nShe was holding a knife, and blood dripping from the blade flowed along the floor to a corpse.\nMar-Marsha\nFreeman suddenly snapped to his senses and rushed over. He didnt know where this , but he knew he had to do something if Marsha was unresponsive.\nGet up. What exactly happened?\nHe shook her shoulders several times until Marsha regained her senses.\nShe looked up at Freeman with a dazed expression and then a shocking confession came from her lips.\nDad he tried to assault me.\nFreeman lost his words.\nHe had always thought the man was creepy due to his reticence and shady eyes, but a parent is still a parent, right?\nAs the unimaginable truth unfolded, revulsion flooded through him.\nLet's run away. Uncle is a mercenary. If his colleagues find out, they'll come for revenge.\nFreeman was right. Marsha, ever so astute, snapped to her senses as soon as she heard his words. They needed to leave the house immediately.\nA burst of ironic laughter escaped Marsha as she realized she had nothing to take with her; she owned nothing after all.\nFreeman grabbed Marsha's wrist and pulled her out of the house. The two ran non-stop until they reached the entrance of the village.\n\"Huff! Huff! That should do it. We should be safe for now.\"\n\"Yes. They probably won't chase us this far outside the village.\"\nPanting, Marsha managed to calm her racing heart. Although she was fearful of her stepfather's colleagues, she was confident she could run to the ends of the earth if necessary.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Let's get out of this dreadful place quickly. I can take care of you anywhere.\"\nCaught off guard by his words, Marsha was flustered. Then, realizing the time had come, she spoke in a sad voice.\n\"Freeman, I'm sorry. I'm leaving alone. I won't take you with me.\"\n\"What? Why? How can a woman alone do anything? The outside world is dangerous.\"\n\"It's okay. I think I can handle whatever comes now.\"\n\"No! I don't like it! I'm coming too! I won't let you go alone.\"\nMarsha thought it over one last time, but no matter how much she pondered, she couldn't bring herself to take him with her.\nFreeman had a family.\nAlthough he was practically no different from her own adoptive father, he was still her true father by blood.\n\"Freeman, I don't love you.\"\nFreeman's face flushed with Marsha's blunt words.\n\"What are you talking about all of a sudden?\"\n\"You are a really good friend. But I will never accept you as a man. It would be unhappy for you to follow me. I might marry another man.\"\nFreeman felt as if his heart was being torn apart. It was cruel. So cruel, Marsha.\nHow could she say such a thing in this situation? Maybe this was their last moment together.\nFreeman clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.\nIf that's how Marsha feels, then so be it. Hanging around her would only end up hurting him.\n\"I don't care. I'm still going with you. I hate living with a drunken father who calls me an idiot. It's my choice.\"\nMarsha was furious. Freeman's suffocating personality was driving her insane.\n\"You idiot! Why can't you understand? I don't like you!\"\n\"So what? If you don't want to like me, then don't! I'll just keep liking you! You have no right to say anything about that!\"\nMarsha yelled back, her anger spilling over.\n\"Ah, is that so? Good for you. Just keep looking at me until you die old and alone. Shall I tell you the truth? Having you with me is a burden. How long should I take care of a coward who can't even kill a single ant? It only makes things harder for me!\"\n\"I'm not a coward! I will protect you!\"\n\"And how exactly are you going to protect me? What can you even do?\"\n\"Arrrrgh!\"\nFreeman screamed towards the ground. He then picked up a sharp stone and began scraping off his eyebrows.\nMarsha was startled and tried to stop Freeman.\n\"What are you doing, you fool!\"\n\"Let go! Just let me be!\"\nFreeman was relentless.\nThe sound of his skin tearing made Marsha's skin crawl. She watched in disbelief as he continued to rub the stone against his eyebrows until they were completely gone. Throwing the stone to the ground, his face, now covered in blood, looked demonic.\n\"How about that? Now I look scary, don't I? Being a coward was all because of my eyebrows. Now no one can mess with me. So, I won't be a burden to you.\"\n\"You... are you insane?\"\nMarsha was speechless, but Freeman was serious.\nHis eyebrow-less face indeed looked frightening, but in reality, it bore the saddest expression.\n\"I will become stronger. I will do whatever it takes. Just let me stay by your side, please? I promise I won't ask you to like me if you just let me come with you.\"\n\"You... oh, you fool.\"\nMarsha sighed deeply. She felt it was wrong, but even that thought seemed to be drowned out by her sigh.\n***\n\"Marsha.\"\nFreeman's eyes sparkled. His face, which had been distorted by burns, was now perfectly regenerated.\nHow much time had passed? It might already be too late. But he had to go. He had promised. Until Marsha was dead, his life wasn't his own.\n\"I'm going now. Wait for me.\"\nThe energy he poured into choosing life over death at the brink was tremendous. His body was heavy, and his legs barely carried him.\nBut Freeman walked without rest.\nTo where Marsha was.\n***\nAmy gritted her teeth as she raced up the mountain trail. Her mental strength had recovered enough to think clearly, but casting magic was still too much to handle.\nShe couldn't afford to slow down. The battle was not yet over. Freeman had been dealt with, but another formidable enemy, Falcoa, still remained.\n\"Just a little more!\"\nAs the destination came into view, Amy increased her speed. And just as she crested the hill, she was met with an unexpected sight.\nRian, battered and bruised, was holding Falcoa from behind.\nBut what shocked Amy was something else.\nTess, running at full speed, was stabbing Falcoa with her sabre.\nTess's eyes were wilder than ever. If things continued this way, even Rian could be impaled by her sword. However, the two seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement, as they hesitated not at all.\nFinally, Tess's sabre pierced through Falcoa. Rian's pupils dilated, and his shoulders convulsed.\nMoments later, blood spurted from Rian's mouth.\n***\n20 minutes before Amy's arrival.\nFalcoa's attack was the epitome of flashy brutality. But it was not finesse that shone through, but a beast-like savagery.\nRian couldn't afford to think about techniques. Just enduring the shock had already drained him to his limits.\nFalcoa found an opening and sliced through Rian's thigh.\n\"Rian!\" Tess's voice echoed.\nAlthough Rian had held up better than expected, having his lower body injured meant he had lost half his strength.\nAngered by her friend's injury, Tess launched an attack, but Falcoa was worthy of being called a demon of the battlefield.\nAs long as he didn't die, it seemed he didn't care how injured he got, focusing most of his movements on attack.\nThis actually caused Tess's attack frequency to drop. It was a moment that proved the adage: the best defense is a good offense.\nAs the battle continued, the scratches on Rian and Tess's bodies multiplied. They avoided fatal wounds, but after ten minuTess, their bodies were nearly ragged like cloth.\n\"Hahaha! Is this the end? It's been fun.\"\nIgnoring Falcoa's taunts, Tess looked back at Rian, who was gasping for breath.\n\"Rian, are you okay?\"\n\"Yeah, I can manage. What about you?\"\nTears welled up in Tess's eyes, unable to continue her words. What did he mean he could manage? His body was clearly marked by the path of Falcoa's sword.\nIt was the first time she had felt so heartbroken. What was this trash of a person to hurt Rian like this?\nTess gripped the handle of her sabre tightly. Even if it meant risking her life, she was determined to cut off Falcoa's breath.\n\"Yaaaaa!\"\nTess pulled the sabre towards her body and charged. It was a charge unique to the Elzain family.\nHowever, the gap in their power was too great to bridge with just willpower.\nAlthough Tess's charge was fast, Falcoa retreated even faster.\nAs he created distance, his intention became clear. With a wicked grin, Falcoa suddenly kicked off the ground and advanced. With a smooth move, he deflected Tess's sabre.\n\"Huh!\"\nFalcoa spun around to Tess's side and slammed his knee into her ribs. Her lungs were compressed, cutting off her breath momentarily.\n\"Kek, not bad, but you still smell green.\"\nFalcoa's long sword descended towards Tess.\nTo Tess, time seemed to slow. She could clearly see the trajectory of the sword coming down to slice her neck.\nBut she was paralyzed. As time slowed, so did her body.\n'I'm sorry... Rian. I wanted to at least strike back once.'\nAt that moment, Rian charged like a bull at Falcoa.\n\"Aaaargh!\"\nFalcoa's legs were lifted off the ground. But Rian's tackle was unsuccessful. Even in mid-air, Falcoa maintained a terrifying balance, landed smoothly, and pulled Rian's neck forward while raising his knee.\n\"Kuh!\"\nThe impact seemed to go through the solar plexus, through the stomach, and out the back.\nWas this the combat ability of a demon who thrived in war? It seemed impossible to shake Falcoa by any means.\n\"Don't fret too much. I'll take good care of your woman.\"\nRian's fading consciousness snapped back. Despite their usual bickering, Tess was a good friend, someone he respected and acknowledged as a fellow swordsman.\n\"Not to someone like you...\"\nGripping Falcoa's collar, Rian summoned all his strength as if burning his whole body.\n\"I won't hand over my friend, you bastard!\"\n\"Kugh!\"\nAs Rian was dragged along, Falcoa was puzzled. He knew Rian was strong, but this level of power didn't match his previous schema.\nWhere had such strength suddenly come from?\nRian slipped behind Falcoa and applied a wrestling hold. Once Rian wedged his arm through Falcoa's armpit, raising his arms, Falcoa could no longer swing his sword.\n\"This bastard!\"\nFalcoa flexed his trapezius muscles and pushed his arms down. Rian's nose bridge twisted as if ropes were tied around his shoulders and pulled by horses, his body screaming in agony.\n\"Grrrr!\"\nBut Falcoa couldn't break free.\nIt was indeed strange. None of the opponents he had faced in combat had shown such strength. How could Rian possibly exhibit such power?\n\"Damn it! Let go, you bastard!\"\n\"Try and get out. This is what they call an imaginary schema, you brat.\"\nMages train their minds, swordsmen their bodies. Yet, there is one organ intimately connected to both— the brain.\nPerhaps thoughts also affect the body?\nAlthough very few do it, some schema users spend their lives trying to reconstruct the neural schematic.\nUnknown to Rian, the term \"imaginary schema\" was also coined by them.\nDoes the mere thought of not letting go influence the body? If so, would the intensity of the thought change its effect?\nIf this was possible, given that thoughts have no limits, how much could the effects amplify if one intensely focused their thoughts?\nRian decided not to move. He had issued a command to his body and locked it in that state.\nThis kind of mental lock wasn't traditionally considered a schema, but Rian's extraordinary strength could be explained no other way.\n\"Argh! Let go! Let go, you bastard!\"\nFalcoa thrashed wildly, but it felt as if he wasn't grappling with a living being. Rian's body was as unyielding as if it had turned to stone.\n\"Tess! Stab him!\"\n\"But…”\nTess realized what Rian was suggesting. It was a logical decision. If not now, there would never be another chance to defeat Falcoa.\nBut Tess couldn't bring herself to do it. To kill Rian, even if it meant dying together. She couldn't bear the thought of stabbing him with her own hands.\n\"Rian...\"\n\"Aaaargh! Quickly! I can't hold on much longer!\"\nDanger signals were blaring from all over Rian's body. His mind's orders were being executed by his body at 100%, but the limits were clear. If Falcoa broke free, Rian's body would likely be shattered into pieces.\n\"Tess! Do it now!\"\n\"Yaaaah!\"\nTears streaming down her face, Tess charged. Rian was risking his life to fulfill his duty. Letting emotions interfere and missing the timing would make him the world's biggest fool.\nThat was the moment Amy arrived.\n\"Tess!

Following this, Rian's eyes widened as blood spurted from his mouth.\nThere was no mistake in Tess's swordsmanship. The sabre had accurately penetrated Falcoa's heart, and soon it would cease to function.\nFalcoa sensed his impending death. He wasn't particularly frightened. Perhaps, he mused, death was the closest thing to pleasure in this world.\n\"Marsha.\"\nSurprisingly, the last word from Falcoa's lips as he faced death was the name of his commander. As if experiencing his life flashing before his eyes, the corners of his mouth faintly lifted.\n'Take me to the battlefield.'As Tess withdrew her sabre, Falcoa's body fell backward with a thud, collapsing, and then Rian, unable to endure the physical pain any longer, fell to his knees.\n\"Rian! Are you okay?\"\nAmy hurried over. Rian forced a smile as he looked back at her.\n\"Hey, Amy. Did you take care of everything?\"\n\"Tell me. Where and how are you hurt? Tess! How could you stab him too?\"\nAmy shouted at Tess, sounding hurt, but Tess was merely shaking the blood off her sabre. Then, she suddenly smiled and winked.\n\"Hehe, what are you talking about? What do you take me for? I am confident in my control of distance. I only stabbed Falcoa's torso. Rian is unharmed.\"\nAmy looked at Tess with an incredulous expression.\n\"But... there's blood coming from Rian's chest?\"\n\"What!\"\nTess's eyes widened as she inspected Rian, and indeed, thin streams of blood were oozing out, just as Amy had said.\n\"Rian! Rian! Are you okay? Snap out of it!\"\nAs Tess's face paled, Rian, who had momentarily lost consciousness, waved his hand dismissively and struggled to his feet.\n\"Don't make a fuss. It just went in a bit deep.\"\n\"I'm sorry, Rian. It's my lack of skill...\"\n\"Don't say that. If it had been any shallower, Falcoa wouldn't have fallen. We both would have been in danger then. Your judgment was right.\"\n\"Hmm, but...\"\nRian truly believed that. No matter how worried one might be for a friend, deeper was better than insufficient. That's why Tess could maintain her utmost concentration.\n\"Ugh! This wound is nothing. Let's go quickly. I'm worried about Shirone.\"\nEven amid their fight, strange noises and explosions had been heard from inside the building. It was clear that the commander was engaged in combat. The situation inside had to be more perilous than the battle with Falcoa.\nAt that moment, the wall of the building burst open, and Shirone emerged.\n\"Shirone!\"\nShirone teleported just before hitting the ground, retreating ten meters. As his photonization state dissolved, he managed a landing posture and was pushed back along the ground.\n\"Shirone, are you okay?\"\n\"Don't come closer!\"\nShirone shouted urgently. The fact that the usually calm Shirone was so agitated alarmed his friends, who stood frozen in their tracks.\n\"It's not over yet. The Sound Magic is dangerous if you get closer.\"\nMarsha's Sonar could freely control targeted and area attacks. It was clear that the already exhausted trio would be ensnared by powerful Sound Magic if they approached.\n\"Pretty impressive. To withstand me for so long.\"\nBending over as she exited the building, Marsha approached with a smile. However, her smile faded as she passed Falcoa's corpse.\nFalcoa was dead.\nThough he was a mentally unstable man, he had indeed lived an amusing and unrestrained life among life's misfits. The name Parrot, which had made a mark on the continent, was imbued with his blood.\n'No regrets then, Falcoa.'\nMarsha knew without looking. A man who might have thought dying by the sword was a far more glorious end than a heart attack induced by addiction.\nBut that was where her sentiment ended.\nIt was surprising that a mere student had taken him down, but considering Falcoa's body had been ravaged by years of drug abuse, it wasn't unusual.\nMarsha refocused on confronting Shirone. She had suspected as much when she breached the first barrier, but facing him directly confirmed that his magical combinations were exceptionally well-balanced.\nHis Teleportation was of a high standard, and she was pleased with the potency of his core offensive tool, the Photon Cannon.\nThe laser was ideal as a siege weapon, and although the defensive magic Wildfire required precise timing, it could be converted into an offensive spell if necessary.\nThe balance set by a mage after long contemplation and evolution.\nAbove all, what pleased her the most was the uniqueness of Shirone's magic, which couldn't be learned from any other mage— it was exclusively his.\n\"Unlocker's magic, huh? Interesting. I'm starting to want it.\"\nAs Marsha mused, Shirone was also analyzing the variables of the situation, having emerged onto the open ground.\nDespite numerous penalties inside the building, there were no disadvantages now. Most importantly, there was no risk of hostages being harmed, so he could unleash his full power.\n\"Things will be different now. I will never forgive you.\"\n\"Hehe, Shirone, you will forgive me.\"\n\"On what basis? Your actions have crossed the bounds of humanity.\"\n\"That's the thing, actually...\"\nMarsha stuck out her tongue mischievously and shouted.\n\"It was all a joke!\"\nShirone and his group were baffled by her words. Then Marsha shouted towards the building.\n\"Yuna! It's okay to come out now!\"\nHer voice boomed, amplified, echoing towards the sea.\nMoments later, the door of the building opened, and a pretty young girl walked out.\n\"Could it be, that girl is Yuna?\"\n\"Yes, that's Yuna. As you can see, she's been here comfortably without any problems. So, Shirone, are you not angry anymore?\"\nShirone was speechless. Even with his exceptional insight, he couldn't guess what Marsha was thinking.\n\"Oh, you still don't get it? Was I just playing a prank on my little sister, and you got all worked up over that? Everything I told was a lie. So forgive me, okay?\"\nYuna bowed to Shirone and his group.\n\"My sister did nothing wrong. In fact, Marsha saved me.\"\nRian, frustrated, spoke up.\n\"What the heck is going on? Can someone please explain this to me instead of staying silent?\"\nBut neither Amy nor Tess responded.\nIt was a clear mockery. The issue was the motive. What exactly was Marsha's intention behind all this?\nThat's what Shirone was pondering.\nIt wasn't just a trivial prank. The Parrot Mercenary Band had been wiped out. Falcoa was dead. Yet all this was claimed to be a mere falsehood.\n\"If that's really the case... send Yuna over here.\"\nRescuing Zis's little sister was the priority. However, Marsha, still sporting a playful smile, shook her head.\n\"Yuna, go back inside. I'll send you to your brother later.\"\nYuna nodded and returned to the building.\nShirone was infuriated. What exactly did Marsha want with this situation?\nHe couldn't discern her purpose or meaning. It seemed she just wanted to stir up trouble like a child.\n\"What are you trying to do? What do you want?\"\n\"Hehe, why? Yuna is safe, isn't she? Isn't that enough? Oh, did you want to be the hero who rescues her?\"\n\"That's not it, but...\"\n\"Now you understand, right? I did nothing wrong. The bad one is you, Shirone. You made me sick to my stomach. That's why I'll never hand over Yuna to you.\"\nShirone entered his Spirit Zone. Marsha's blade-like Attack Form was already targeting his brow.\n\"Hmph! I won't be taken down this time.\"\nThough Shirone spoke boldly, he was internally conflicted. Marsha had removed the motive for their fight. Yet she still emitted a belligerent intent to kill.\n\"Calm down. She's hostile toward me. That's reason enough to fight.\"\nIf it was a tactic of deception, he couldn't just stand by. Plus, with the hostage safe, he wouldn't be at a disadvantage as he was inside the building.\nHowever, breaking Shirone's expectations, Marsha deactivated her Spirit Zone and, spreading her arms as if disarming herself, said to him,\n\"You can kill me if you want.\"\nShirone's heart sank. He understood the significance of the words she had just uttered.\nIt was the spell she had memorized each time she was beaten by her foster father.\nMarsha was serious. She genuinely wanted him to end her life.\n\"What are you, Marsha? Who exactly are you?\"\n***\nMagic Association Interrogation Room.\nSakiri, a certified Grade 5 mage and investigator, wiped the sweat from his brow. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, and more than half of his shirt buttons were undone.\nClearly, he was the picture of exhaustion. However, the muscles of his arms, clutching a metal club, still bulged with apparent strength.\n\"Whew, had a rest, shall we start again?\"\n\"Ughhh...\"\nLucas, who had fallen to the floor, groaned.\nHe was the vice-captain of the Parrot Mercenary Band, which had raided the Magic Association following Arcane. However, at that time, he had been incapacitated by Siena’s Absolute Zero magic, resulting in both legs being severed.\nHe had been beaten for hours.\nHad he not protected his body with a Schema, he would have been dead long ago from the beating.\n\"Here it goes. Clench your teeth.\"\nSakiri swung the club again. The barrage of blows made Lucas crawl on the floor with his arms until, exhausted, he rolled over.\n\"Aaaaah! Please stop! Ask something before hitting me! I've told you I'll tell you everything!\"\n\"Wait. We've got a thousand to reach.\"\n\"You crazy son of a bitch!\"\nSakiri counted internally. Five hits left. Now four. Three.\nFinally, with the last blow aimed at the ribs, he tossed the club aside with a sense of relief.\nThe club clattered noisily as it rolled across the floor.\n\"Whew, that's refreshing. Got my workout for today.\"\n\"Why... why are you doing this...\"\nLucas clutched his aching stomach and wept.\nThough recruited into the downgraded Parrot Mercenary Band and quickly rising to vice-captain due to his outstanding abilities, he had been a formidable villain even in the face of Arcane.\nBut in front of Sakiri, he was no better than gum stuck to the floor.\nSakiri grabbed Lucas's hair and hurled him towards a chair.\nLucas crashed heavily and clung to the chair, while Sakiri sat down across the desk and said,\n\"Sit down, before I cut off the other arm too.\"\nLucas, using his arms, barely managed to seat himself. Then, Sakiri silently scrutinized the files the investigators had compiled for a long while.\n\"Investigator, just send me back to prison. I'll tell you where Marsha is.\"\n\"No need. What kind of woman do you think she is, to still be there?\"\n\"Dammit! Then why the hell did you beat me?\"\nAs Sakiri flipped to the last page of the file, he slammed his fist on the desk in irritation.\n\"Do you know what kind of criminal I hate the most? Murderers? Home wreckers? No, escapees. Does the state look that easy to you? Even if you're swollen with pride, a B-grade criminal like you escaping? Your life is over. You'll never see the sun again.\"\nLucas gulped. Sakiri's words were not a threat but a statement of fact.\nHis readiness to deliver a thousand blows was evident from his disposition.\n\"Anyway, let's start. You'd better listen well. My daughter is four years old, the age when she's supposed to be showing off in front of daddy. But I haven't been home in days! Let's try to keep living. Got it?\"\n\"What do you want to hear?\"\n\"Forget everything else, tell me about Marsha. Spill everything you know about her.\"\nThat was all Sakiri wanted to know.\nClay Marsha. Though a political criminal classified as an A-grade criminal, she hadn't caused much uproar, making her hard to capture.\nThe biggest problem was the scattered intelligence on her. Sometimes she was reported as a fire mage, at other times as using ice magic.\nConsidering that, she was highly strategic and meticulous. Even using all available investigators to track her had not clarified her routes of movement.\nThus, Sakiri had summoned Lucas. From the start, the operation had been misguided.\nWhat really needed to be known was not where Marsha was but Marsha herself.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

If you spill everything you know, I'll send you back to prison nicely.\"\nLucas remained silent, his mind racing rapidly.\nHaving joined when the Parrot Mercenary Band was actually the Parrot Thieves' Gang, Lucas had no particular loyalty to Marsha. Thus, spilling the facts he knew should have been easy.\nBut confessing here meant he might never leave a deep, dark cell until his death.\n\"How about a deal?\"\n\"A deal? What kind of deal?\"\"I'll tell you everything about Marsha. In return, reduce my sentence. Just make it possible for me to get out before I die, and I'll give you the information you want.\"\n\"Huh...\"\nSakiri looked at Lucas with a dumbfounded expression, then suddenly burst into laughter, stamping his feet.\n\"Hahaha!\"\nThe desk toppled over with a crash. Sakiri sprang up and advanced, screaming in rage.\n\"You insane bastard! Do you even know where you are?\"\nHe kicked, and Lucas, along with the chair, toppled over. Yet, even that didn't seem to satisfy Sakiri's rage as he stomped repeatedly on the fallen Lucas.\nBut this time, Lucas was desperate too.\nWhether he died this way or that, it was all the same. If he couldn't achieve some result here, his life was effectively over.\n\"Go ahead! Beat me! I will never talk! Let's make a deal!\"\nSakiri's kicking paused.\nWhy are all the bad guys shamelessly brazen? If they hated prison so much, they shouldn't have committed crimes in the first place.\n\"Ah, this is driving me insane.\"\nSakiri calmed his breathing and turned away.\nEven in his frightened state, Lucas observed him closely. The fact that Sakiri had stopped kicking meant he was conflicted. If Lucas could just hold on a little longer, a channel for negotiation might open.\nHowever, contrary to expectations, Sakiri opened the door of the interrogation room and issued a terrifying order.\n\"Hey, deactivate the magic restriction device here.\"\nMagic restriction devices differ from anti-magic. These are specifically designed to completely block the initiation of magic.\nThough it was also a form of magic, very few thieves could break through the magical circles designed by the top-ranking archmages.\nLucas swallowed hard. He shouldn't show fear. It was clear that Sakiri was also making a last-ditch effort. If he could just get through this ordeal, he might see the outside world again someday.\nSakiri waited calmly. After a moment, there was a heavy sound as the air seemed to settle.\nLucas couldn't tell what had changed, but Sakiri approached, appearing somewhat lighter, and twisted his neck.\n\"Tell me everything you know about Marsha. If you remain silent or lie, unbearable horror will come upon you.\"\n“I-I won't tell. I won't say a word.\"\nSakiri, unbothered, extended his hand towards Lucas and, closing his eyes, chanted something like an incantation.\n\"I command as a judge, speech answers to speech. The scales of truth are yours alone.\"\nLucas's complexion turned deathly pale.\nHe had mistaken Sakiri for an ordinary investigator. Sakiri was indeed one of those numerous figures who must never be crossed.\n\"Damn it!\"\nTen minutes passed.\n\"Aaaaaaah!\"\nA ripping scream echoed through the interrogation room.\nLucas was nearly out of his mind. Even the surgery to amputate his legs hadn't been this painful.\n\"Okay! I'll talk! I'll tell everything, just stop this!\"\nThe moment he shouted, the pain disappeared as if it were a lie.\nLucas, crumpled in a corner of the room, cowered and looked up at Sakiri.\n\"It's your choice. If you want to be at ease, spill everything.\"\nLucas resigned himself. Neither silence nor lies were tolerated.\nIn front of Sakiri's magic, the \"Scales of Truth,\" no criminal could withhold the truth.\n\"Marsha is clever. And she makes no mistakes. Initially, she lets her opponents expose all their weaknesses while pretending to be losing. But she never allows herself to be hated, laying traps to ensure it.\"\n\"Typical con artist's tactics.\"\n\"Heh, con artist? No, she's not a con artist. Do you know what makes her terrifying? She doesn't lie to deceive someone. Her entire life is a lie. Ordinary methods won't catch her.\"\n\"Hmm, I see her type now. But mere intelligence shouldn't have the intelligence reports so jumbled.\"\nSakiri leaned on his chin and pondered. Then, a possibility struck him.\nNo one else might understand, but he could be certain of why the intelligence was inconsistent.\n\"Could it be? Is she perhaps...\"\n\"Yes. She's one of your kind.\"\nRelieved that he would no longer suffer, Lucas spoke with force in his voice.\n\"Marsha is... an unregulated eater.\"\n***\nShirone analyzed her by any means necessary. Yet, he could understand nothing. She was completely different from any person he had met in his life.\n\"Even if you kill me...\"\n\"Heh, yes. You hate me, right? So feel free to kill me.\"\nShirone thought no longer. If there was no answer to be found, he would stick to his convictions.\n\"If Yuna is safe, then I have no reason to fight you.\"\nA crack-like faint smile etched across Marsha's lips.\nAs her Attack Form of the Spirit Zone lunged in, Shirone immediately teleported.\n'Eh?'\nShirone was puzzled. The Spirit Zone suddenly vanished, and his teleportation unraveled.\nIn that moment, the roar of the Sonic Cannon passed by, scalding his ears as if they were on fire.\nUnable to withstand the shock, Shirone rolled on the ground, prompting Rian to exclaim in surprise.\n\"What? Why did Shirone suddenly do that?\"\nThe Sonic Cannon compresses sound waves, so it doesn't disperse sound indiscriminately. Therefore, his friends, who were at a distance, only heard a high-pitched scream.\n\"That's the Sonic Cannon. A type of Sound Magic. But that's not the problem.\"\nAmy spoke up, and Tess chimed in.\n\"Right. Shirone got hit.\"\nA dark shadow crossed Amy's face. It seemed that Shirone had tried to escape using teleportation, but the photonization had been disrupted just before the magic activated.\n\"That's not just being hit. It was stolen.\"\n\"Stolen? What was stolen?\"\nAmy, through synesthesia, could confirm it. She had seen the moment Marsha siphoned off Shirone's Spirit Zone like dew.\n\"Perhaps... his mental power.\"\n\"That's impossible. How can someone steal another's mental power?\"\nAmy hurried towards Shirone.\nClay Marsha.\nIf she was right, then this woman was extremely dangerous.\n\"Shirone! Be careful! That woman is an unregulated eater!\"\nShirone's head snapped up. Though his ears felt like they were bleeding from the Sonic Cannon's power, his indomitable spirit was still intact.\n\"This... is unregulated consumption?\"\n\"Oh, you know about unregulated consumption too? You guys are really something. You must have long straps on your bags.\"\nMages develop numerous spells every day, and the association registers these as regulated magic.\nHowever, there exists magic that can never be registered—unregulated consumption.\nThe omniscience of unregulated consumption is unique.\nIt's not based on universally known facts but solely on the blind ideology of the individual.\nIn other words, these magicians create their own rules and can impose them on others.\nShirone recalled a lesson about unregulated consumption he had attended with Siena.\n\"Omnipotence is belief. The reason the speed of photons can be categorized into four types, the temperature of flames can change, and plasma can be produced even at moderate temperatures is because the omnipotence of mages supports the omniscience.\"\nSiena wrote the word 'unregulated consumption' on the blackboard.\nThe emergence of the unfamiliar term caused a stir among the students, but she continued undeterred.\n\"However, there are those in the world who use omnipotence for personal gain. That is, they don't just support omniscience; they twist it entirely. The magic used by such individuals is called unregulated consumption.\"\n\"Teacher, I don't quite understand?\"\n\"Let me explain now. What's my job?\"\n\"Of course, you're a teacher.\"\n\"Right. I'm a teacher. Shall we start? Is there anyone here who doesn't think I'm a teacher? Raise your hand.\"\nNaturally, no one raised their hand. It was an impossible notion. Knowing that she was a teacher and then denying it would be a contradiction.\n\"This is exactly the nature of the mind. Unlike the body, the mind does not push out a concept that enters it. Instead, it absorbs it and forms a new mass.\"\nSiena emphasized her point by raising a finger.\n\"In other words, other people's thoughts can be applied to others, and in fact, all the thoughts that make us up are obtained from others. Now, let me demonstrate unregulated consumption.\"\nSiena stepped down from the podium and looked squarely at the students.\n\"Those who think I'm a teacher will die.\"\nThe students murmured. Siena's statement was serious, and although some tried to deny it, it was ultimately impossible.\nThe mind does not get denied. It just changes.\n\"Teacher, is this for real?\"\n\"Don't be alarmed. I was explaining the mechanism. I'm not an unregulated eater.\"\nA wave of deflation washed through the students' voices.\nSiena adjusted her glasses and returned to the podium.\n\"Of course, it's not that simple in reality. No unregulated eater could inject a fundamental concept to kill someone. Unregulated consumption is also magic. The principle of equivalent exchange always applies.\"\nA male student raised his hand.\n\"But there could really be such a person, right? Someone who believes that the rule you mentioned earlier is fair.\"\n\"Sure, it's possible. But magic is a product of rational thought. Someone that deranged couldn't handle magic in the first place, and even if they existed, it wouldn't work on you.\"\n\"Because it can't even penetrate the mind.\"\n\"Exactly. Therefore, unregulated consumption has significant constraints and costs. For example, here's a rule that could be made: Those who think I'm a teacher must use honorifics with me.\"\n\"Hey, that's obvious.\"\n\"Right. And this is the scary part of unregulated consumption. Just as you accept this as obvious, unregulated eaters can implant their own rules into others as obvious. What about this? Those who think I'm a teacher must love me.\"\n\"Haha! That's also obvious, right?\"\nThe children laughed heartily. Siena continued without concern.\n\"Those who love me must obey me.\"\nThe laughter in the room gradually subsided.\n\"Those who obey me must die before me.\"\nSilence fell in the classroom.\n\"This is one of the techniques of unregulated consumption called constraint. It imposes several constraints to extend the rules. Where logic leaps, omnipotence connects. Because they really believe it, such events occur. Therefore, once caught, there's no escaping.\"\nA gulp sounded. Could such magic really exist in the world? If it did, they would never want to encounter such a magician.\n\"However, the real reason unregulated consumption is tricky isn't the constraints but the cost. Earlier, I said you couldn't kill someone with a fundamental concept, but if a cost is involved, it's a bit different. Let's try it now. Those who don't think I'm a teacher will die.\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 160: The Gate of Gephin (Part 3)\nIt was the entrance to heaven, reborn 250 years ago by the Unlocker, MacLaine Gephin. A red orb was embedded in the center, with vertical cracks radiating from it.\nBefore coming here, Shirone had already concluded a contract with Kadum. His request was simple: go to the Angel's Library, Ingris, and deliver the will of Chief Kergo of Kadum's tribe.\nThe Angel's Library? Kadum had said it wasn't a journey to reach God, so it shouldn't be too difficult. But Shirone couldn't help but feel that it was an impossible task, involving gods and angels.\nShirone exchanged glances with his friends. They might return. Maybe. Since they had decided to go, there was no choice but to think positively.\nWhen Amy nodded, Shirone placed his hand on the orb at the center of the gate.\nTaking a deep breath, he activated the Immortal Function. In that moment, a white flash erupted from the orb.\n\"Oh, ohhhhh!\"\nA voice filled with awe echoed. Even Mahatu, a half-angel, knelt and chanted \"Anke Ra.\"\nShirone focused his energy even more.\nContrary to his initial thoughts, the gate wasn't just a simple stone wall. The scratches on the gate, which he had thought were marks of time, began to glow red, revealing indecipherable magical runes.\nAs the magic took effect, the stone wall began to break apart into dice-sized cubes.\nThe fragments, defying gravity, crumbled into dust and were eventually absorbed by the light.\nA white radiance burst from the gate and engulfed Shirone.\n\"The Gate of Gephin has opened! Praise the angels!\"\nThe priests prostrated themselves and chanted \"Anke Ra.\"\nShirone couldn't hear their voices. All he could hear was the sound of his own heartbeat as he was enveloped in the light.\nFor the first time, he felt fear. It was just one step, but it felt like an eternity. He didn't want to move.\nA strong, warm hand gripped his shoulder. It was Rian.\nYes, he wasn't alone. Rian would never give up, no matter the situation.\nTess's precision, Amy's cleverness, Canis's defense, and Arin's mental strength. Even Harvest was now a reliable ally.\nWasn't this a great party? His tension eased slightly.\nShirone stepped through the gate.\nAs Shirone's party left the altar, the white radiance coalesced into gray particles, and the stone wall began to restore itself.\nThe floating cubes reassembled themselves, and the magical runes lost their glow.\nWhere the stone wall had closed, no one remained.\nThe cavern was silent.\nShirone clenched his teeth. A kaleidoscope of light raced around him.\nWhat awaited them at the end of this? Or was there even an end? The blinding light didn't disappear even when he closed his eyes.\nIt felt as if his vision had expanded like a cannonball fired from a cannon.\nThe party's feelings were the same. They could only hope that this wasn't a world of burning sulfur.\nThe first impression wasn't bad. The air was clear and cool. But the moment they realized where they were, screams erupted.\nHow foolish it was to think that the Gate of Gephin, which had been on the ground, would lead them back to the ground.\nThey were floating in the sky, higher than the clouds. The altitude was so great that they could see the ends of the ocean.\nThe mages tried to teleport, but it was futile. Still under the influence of the Gate of Gephin, they fell toward the ground faster than freefall.\nThe ocean receded, and a lush forest came into view.\nShirone spotted a city standing at the center of the forest in the distance. It was identical to what he had seen in the Maze of Space-Time.\nThe city was surrounded by two concentric circles, with the inner circle divided into six sectors like a pie.\nIn the sky, mechanical devices resembling ladybugs flew around. For a moment, Shirone thought they looked like human brains.\nAs their altitude decreased, the city disappeared from view, and they eventually crashed into the forest. Breaking through the water, they saw the ground. If they hit it head-on, they would die instantly.\nThey tried to use magic, but it was impossible. Only when the gravel on the ground was within reach did the Gate of Gephin release them.",

If the condition for lifting the magic-stealing spell was merely contact, maintaining distance made sense.\nBut the problem was that Marsha was in a far too advantageous position. She had stolen numerous spells involving the Particle of God, while Shirone himself could only rely on Windcutter.\nWasn't this a fight worth engaging in? Yet she had moved dozens of meters away, as if terrified.\"A mindless Unregulated Eater...\"\nShirone's eyes widened. Everything now became clear in his mind.\n\"I've got it! A mental gap. Marsha isn't perfect.\"\nIt was a simple matter when he thought about it. If magic could be stolen just through contact, who would be able to defeat her? There had to be a price involved.\nShirone didn't know what it was, but it had to relate to the trauma behind the Unregulated Eater.\n\"An Unregulated Eater is a being with mental distortion. To harness such overwhelming power, their trauma must have been there from the start.\"\nThus, he couldn't come closer. Shirone had figured out how to break the Pillage spell, greatly increasing the chances of triggering that price.\nMarsha feared not losing the stolen magic, but the terrifying consequence that would follow immediately after breaking the spell.\n\"But she's stolen countless spells up to now. How did she survive back then?\"\nThe answer came quickly. As soon as Shirone found it, he charged at Marsha.\nThere was no time to waste. Marsha was only stalling for time until reinforcements arrived.\nMagic deprivation achieved at the cost of her greatest suffering.\nIf Shirone risked triggering that price, Marsha wouldn't dare fight.\nConversely, if he wasn't that afraid, the magic-stealing spell wouldn't exist in the first place.\nShirone was no longer afraid. There was still enough time. He had to capture Marsha before the reinforcements arrived.\n\"Hik!\"\nMarsha let out a groan and moved further away. Her face grew pale even if Shirone just closed in a little. Her playful speech and charming expressions had vanished.\n\"I can do this! I can get my magic back!\"\nHaving found hope, Shirone relentlessly pursued Marsha. Though tracking down a mage with Teleportation was nearly impossible on foot, he couldn't stop with the life-stealing thief right in front of him.\n\"Shirone! Watch out!\"\nAt Tess's shout, Shirone looked up. Ten streaks of light thundered down from the sky.\nMarsha's face brightened for the first time, while Shirone was so disheartened he could hardly keep running.\nHe had thought there was enough time, but he was wrong. The surviving subordinates had quickly arrived using a magic circle.\n\"Hohoho! They're finally here. Now it's all over!\"\nTwenty Schema users crowded around Marsha, forming a protective barrier. Getting through that to capture her was impossible.\n\"S-Shirone...\"\nAmy bit her lip, swallowing her tears.\nWas it really going to end like this? Shirone might have to abandon his dream of being a mage.\n\"This can't be happening. I loved magic so much. I worked so hard...\"\nShirone gazed at Marsha as if giving up on everything. His expression was one of utter emptiness.\n\"Oh my, Shirone? Why are you looking at me like that? Ah, because of your magic? Don't worry. You're still young, so you can learn it all over again. Of course, you'll never be able to use the magic I stole, even if it takes you your entire life.\"\n\"The Sound magic was also stolen from someone else, right?\"\n\"Fufu, right. You know I have a thing for stealing. Why are you suddenly so petty when you claimed to understand me before? You easily paid 50 silver for that vase, but now you can't give up your magic? What, too precious to share?\"\nAmy screamed in anger.\n\"Shut up! How can you say that? What did Shirone ever do to you?\"\nHow could someone be like that? Not content with just stealing Shirone's magic, Marsha seemed intent on crushing his entire life.\n\"Hohoho! That's hypocrisy. There's no one good in this world. They pretend to care, but they're always hiding selfish thoughts behind their kindness.\"\nThough Marsha was cursing the world, all Shirone heard was her cursing one person.\nHer father.\nHe had taken in the orphaned Marsha and raised her until she was seventeen, but realizing that those years were shaped by a twisted desire must have left her devastated.\nThat's what made Unregulated Eaters so terrifying: their power was rooted in human trauma.\nFor ordinary mages, omnipotence complemented their omniscience. For Unregulated Eaters, however, omnipotence twisted omniscience.\n\"It's so painful that even their thoughts get distorted. That's the Unregulated Eater.\"\nThat twisted humanity manifested through magic, and now Shirone understood why the Magic Association didn't recognize it as magic.\n\"You have my sympathy.\"\nMarsha's eyes sharpened. Who was he to pity her?\nShirone, who had lost all his magic, was the one deserving pity, falling victim to his own hypocrisy.\n\"Hmph! Now you're trying to win me over? After trying to kill me? Do you think I'll let you off?\"\n\"Actually, I'm not sure myself. I don't know how much you've suffered.\"\n\"Hoho! Finally admitting it, huh? No one cares about the pain of others! That's human nature! Everyone's just awful.\"\n\"So... I'm coming to you now.\"\nMarsha's heart skipped a beat. There's no way he could get here with 20 subordinates standing guard.\n\"You might be right. Maybe it's hypocrisy. But I still believe we can share our pain. If you truly show your wounds, I can see the real pain within you. So show me. I need to see the real suffering.\"\n\"Don't spout nonsense. Why would I accept pity from you?\"\n\"I'm going to break the shell trapping you and see for myself how deep your wounds go.\"\n\"Don't come any closer! I'll die if you do! If I die, you'll never get your magic back!\"\nWith a terrified look, Marsha screamed. The wound was so deep that even a feather landing on it would be excruciating. And Shirone wanted to open it up? And dig through it?\n\"I promise never to abandon you. Whatever the pain, I'll bear it.\"\nWhen Shirone finished speaking, Marsha's subordinates drew their swords and blocked his path.\n\"Don't let him through! Cut his head off!\"\nShirone looked at them quietly before turning to Rian.\n\"Rian, protect my side.\"\nRian was the most injured among them, barely able to move, but he stood up without a word and slung his sword over his shoulder.\nTess spoke up, following behind.\n\"Wait, I'll do it. I'm not as hurt as Rian.\"\n\"It's okay, Tess. This is what my lord asked of me.\"\n\"But in your condition...\"\nShirone shook his head.\n\"Tess, Rian has to guard me. I can't let anyone else shed blood.\"\n\"Blood? What blood?\"\nAs Shirone slowly advanced, he spoke to Rian.\n\"Rian, cut down anyone who tries to attack me.\"\nRian couldn't understand his request. He had no magic, and even walking was a challenge. Charging into enemy territory meant certain death.\n\"Alright, I'll handle it.\"\nBut Rian obediently followed Shirone. A sword doesn't judge; it just follows its master's orders, even at the cost of its life.\nMarsha trembled with rage.\n\"Check my wounds? Share my pain? Nonsense, bullshit.\"\nShirone was just trying to get his magic back by lying through his teeth.\nThat's humanity. Even when they pretend to be kind, they only seek to satisfy their own greed.\n\"Kill him! Kill that brat now!\"\nAt Marsha's cry, her 20 subordinates lunged forward. Enhanced by Schema training, they closed the gap swiftly, raising their blades high.\nRian grasped the hilt of his sword tightly. How long he could hold out was uncertain, but even if he was decapitated, he planned to press forward.\nA swordsman in the lead jumped up, slashing down toward Shirone's head. Gritting his teeth, Rian prepared to strike back.\nBut at that moment, the swordsman's body turned to light and soared into the sky.\nA sharp noise from a Teleportation spell tore through the air.\nMarsha watched in a daze, and Amy and Tess stared from the other side, also perplexed.\n\"What are you all doing? Attack! We'll win this no matter what!\"\nAt the command, three swordsmen launched their assault. But they, too, were whisked away into the air before they could strike Shirone.\nMarsha's lips quivered.\nShirone was approaching, and with each step, subordinates disappeared with a loud noise.\n\"What is this? What's going on?\"\nAmy was the only one who understood the situation, but even her voice trembled.\n\"Amazing. I knew he had an exceptional magic sense, but I never imagined this.\"\nWhen had Shirone anticipated this moment?\nWhen Marsha's subordinates arrived? Or when he figured out the limits of the Pillage spell? No, it was probably when Rian told him about Windcutter.\n\"What is it, Amy? What is Shirone doing now?\"\n\"It's magic. Slow Time, a spell that reduces the speed of time.\"\nConnecting theoretical omniscience directly with omnipotence was only possible for Shirone. Even Amy hadn't expected he could do this.\nMarsha must have been equally unprepared. Shirone, once entangled in lies and conspiracies that drained his power, now brought his insight to the surface, disrupting Marsha's calculations.\n\"Slow Time? Is that really Slow Time?\"\nTess scanned the battlefield again. From the outside, everything appeared normal. The only observable change was that any enemy who approached Shirone flew away.\nBut Rian, inside Shirone's Spirit Zone, saw something completely different.\nOnce someone stepped into Shirone's Spirit Zone, their body would flash with light and then move agonizingly slowly.\nThose who reached the level of sublight speeds could warp the zone's time. Shirone couldn't stretch time as dramatically as Alpheas, but he could easily double its relative distortion.\n\"So I just need to cut them down?\"\nRian prepared to slash at the approaching enemies. Their eyes were filled with terror, knowing they were doomed. They quickly activated their teleportation bracelets and vanished.\nWith the enemies retreating even before the fight, Rian snorted dismissively and continued following Shirone.\nScreeching noises from teleportation filled the air. Now, only three subordinates stood between Marsha and Shirone, but even they fled as Shirone advanced.\nOnce again alone, Marsha trembled with a ghostly pale face. She was trapped in a cycle of terrifying thoughts.\n\"Don't come near! If you do, I'll die! If I die, you'll never get your magic back!\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Why is everything a lie? What do you gain from deceiving people?\"\n\"Why should I tell you? You're just trying to use me! If you really care, then just leave! I'll trust you if you do! Please, just go!\"\n\"I'm asking, what's real?!\"\nMarsha flinched at Shirone's shout.\n\"Don't just say it hurts! Tell me where and how it hurts! Only then can I decide whether to leave or not! You paint the world with all these lies.\"\nShirone shouted, raising his fist as he approached Marsha.\"I can't see how much pain you're really in!\"\nA strong voice rang out from behind them.\n\"Marsha! Noooo!\"\nAmy and Tess turned around. Freeman, eyes wild, was charging at Shirone with incredible speed.\n\"Unbelievable! He took a direct hit to the face!\"\nAmy was stunned as if she'd seen a ghost. It was impossible to survive a face burnt by Flame Strike.\n\"As if we'd just let you pass!\"\nFreeman leapt as Tess tried to block his path. He drew his weapon and lunged at Shirone, soaring past Tess's height with a massive leap.\nTurning around, Rian swung his sword at Freeman. Though his muscles burned with pain, he couldn't let Freeman get past them and undo all their efforts.\n\"Aaaargh!\"\nFreeman was caught by Shirone's Slow Magic like anyone else. He was bound to be split by Rian's sword.\nBut Freeman did not retreat. He had to protect Marsha, to somehow pull her away from Shirone.\nAt that moment, Rian and Freeman both froze in shock. Rian couldn't strike, and Freeman couldn't reach Shirone.\nShirone sensed the situation behind him and suddenly released his Slow spell.\nTime magic had the unique advantage of working equally well in both offensive and defensive modes.\nEven so, Shirone's fist swung through the air in a broad arc.\nAll Marsha could do was watch as the cruel boy's fist approached to shatter her.\nShirone's punch landed squarely on Marsha's face. Her head turned, and she crumpled to the ground as if struck by a tremendous impact.\n\"Ma-Marsha.\"\nFreeman's face went pale. Marsha couldn't accept what was happening, staring blankly at the ground with a lifeless expression.\nShirone realized that his magic had returned, while Marsha's mind had been emptied of all magic.\n\"Marsha.\"\nFreeman approached, his face contorted with grief. His subordinates returned from the teleportation magic circle, appearing behind the building. But none dared come closer.\nMarsha lay collapsed. They all knew what that meant.\n\"Are you alright?\"\nFreeman's voice was subdued as he asked Marsha. His jaw clenched visibly.\n\"Yes, I'm alright.\"\nMarsha forced a smile. Faced with the unchangeable truth, perhaps humans become indifferent.\nShe smiled, but her emotions had all but evaporated. It was as if only a shell remained.\nAmy didn't pity her. Marsha was the very one who'd tried to ruin Shirone's life.\n\"Serves you right! This can't be all. Your magic-stealing ability must come at a price, right?\"\nMarsha didn't get angry. That was the nature of equivalent exchange. If she hadn't been prepared for this outcome, her magic wouldn't have worked in the first place.\n\"Yes, to release the Plunder spell, you have to touch my body. Then the magic returns. And the price is that I say this to that person.\"\nMarsha turned to face Shirone. With a terrified expression, she opened her mouth.\n\"You're welcome to hug me.\"\nTess frowned in disbelief.\n\"W-What?\"\nUsing something like this as collateral. What kind of woman is this?\nBut Shirone knew that Plunder was a power one could only gain by risking one's life.\nThe spell she used to kill her foster father that night was a memory she would rather forget.\nRealizing the situation, Rian spoke bitterly.\n\"What's the point of this as a price? Shirone would never do such a thing. What happens if he refuses?\"\nFreeman answered.\n\"Then Marsha dies. She'll lose her life the moment Shirone rejects her according to her rules.\"\nThe word \"die\" made Tess flail her arms and stammer.\n\"S-Still, isn't there something we can do? How could this be allowed? Amy, say something. This isn't right, right?\"\n\"Don't ask me. It's Shirone's decision.\"\nAmy was also conflicted. Shirone wasn't the kind of person to hurt a woman like this. Yet it was hard to know how he felt in a situation where he held her life in his hands.\n\"Fine. Living is better than dying. I'll take care of it myself.\"\nHaving made up his mind, Shirone walked toward Marsha. This time, Amy couldn't help but feel her heart racing.\nFreeman suddenly blocked Shirone's path, moving without realizing it. It was a love he couldn't help.\nBut ultimately, he had no choice but to step aside.\n\"Please. Save Marsha.\"\nMarsha waited with her eyes closed. She was trembling like someone facing their first surgery, but she felt that this was for the best.\nHer dreadful trauma. If someone could cauterize her with a hot iron, maybe it would bring some relief.\n\"Freeman, I'm sorry.\"\nMarsha apologized for the first time. Knowing what those words meant, Freeman bowed his head and stepped back.\nShirone approached Marsha.\nThe trauma was dangerous because it held both the present and future hostage to a past event. Perhaps she had never lived in the future since that day.\n\"Can we go somewhere alone? Please.\"\n\"There's no need. Here is fine.\"\nMarsha opened her eyes and studied Shirone's expression. He remained calm.\nWhat was he thinking? Would he kill her after tormenting her with false hope?\n'Well after everything I've done.'\nShe had stolen magic and tormented him relentlessly. Shirone must have felt like he'd hit rock bottom. She understood the desire to vent his anger.\nSupporting Marsha's back, Shirone pulled her toward him. She obeyed. Refusing would only result in an even greater price.\nWith Marsha's face buried against his chest, Shirone whispered in her ear.\n\"I've hugged you.\"\nMarsha blinked, then frowned, realizing what Shirone meant.\nWhat kind of childish game was this?\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"I hugged you. Didn't you ask for it?\"\n\"Don't mess with me. You think this is over just like that? Mocking me?\"\n\"I told you I'd never give up.\"\n\"Let me go! I don't want your cheap sympathy! You think this makes you great? Just hug me for real! You're angry at me! Take your revenge!\"\nMarsha couldn't harm Shirone due to the rules of the price. But even if she struggled, he had no intention of letting her go.\n\"You jerk! Hypocrite! Piece of garbage!\"\n\"You're a good person.\"\nShirone said, stroking her head.\n\"You're not like Arcane. Look at how many people follow you. Even if it's all a lie, it's enough. No one knows what's in another's heart. Not even me. We just live believing. Even if no one else trusts you, you can believe in yourself. If you truly love someone, there's someone in this world who will truly love you in return.\"\n\"No! Impossible! What do you know? How can you say that?!\"\nMarsha yelled, denying Shirone's words. But she stopped when she realized tears were rolling down her cheeks.\nHer heart wasn't sad at all. So why were these tears falling?\n\"Huh? What's happening? Why am I crying all of a sudden?\"\nHad she been so tightly closed off that her tears flowed before her emotions could surface?\nBut not anymore. As she recalled the memories she'd sealed away, Marsha finally confronted her trauma.\nIt was a day when she was 17.\nLying on the floor staring at the ceiling, she smelled her foster father's alcohol breath as he approached.\nSame situation, same violence.\nMarsha felt the dagger hidden behind her back. Its cold touch chilled her to the bone.\n\"You can hug me.\"\nHer foster father's eyes widened in shock.\nEven now, she remembered clearly the monstrous emotions reflected in his pupils.\nMarsha gripped the dagger. He was approaching. She had no choice but to stab.\nBut the father she imagined wasn't the same as the one in her memory.\nLifting Marsha upright, her father buried her face in his chest and gently patted her back.\n\"I'm sorry, Marsha. You're my daughter.\"\nThe words she longed to hear most.\nThe moment she recalled those words, the walls around her heart collapsed. Ten years' worth of pent-up emotions exploded, and she couldn't stop crying.\n\"Sob! Sniff!\"\nCrying in Shirone's embrace, Marsha wept bitterly.\n\"Daddy! Daddy!\"\nShirone remained silent, simply patting her back.\n\"Daddy! Why did you do that! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Daddy!\"\nThis was what she had always wanted, to be embraced. No matter how violent he'd been, she had wanted him to remain her father till the end.\n\"It's okay now, sis. It's all okay.\"\nMarsha's past shattered, being reconstructed into a stronger memory and transforming into a hope she could use to live in the future.\n\"Sob! Daddy! Daddy!\"\nFreeman checked the time.\nThe conditions she'd set should have already taken effect. But Marsha was still alive.\n\"What happened? What's going on?\"\nOnly Shirone and Marsha knew the nature of the emotions exchanged between them. Everyone else remained wary.\nFreeman explained.\n\"The Plunder spell has been lifted. Shirone dispelled her magic.\"\n\"No way. All you had to do was hug her? What kind of price is that?\"\nFreeman hesitated. Amy's skepticism was understandable given her lack of knowledge.\nBut it wasn't just about language.\nShirone had broken through the walls around Marsha's heart. He shattered the shell created by her status as an Unregulated Eater and showed her a new path.\n\"Shirone didn't just lift the Plunder spell. He canceled its conditions and severed her power. Marsha's Pillage doesn't exist anymore.\"\nFreeman smiled bitterly. Maybe Shirone hadn't cared about Marsha's real pain. From the start, he had intended to embrace it all.\n'I couldn't do that This is our utter defeat.'\n\"Sob! Sob!\"\nMarsha's tears showed no sign of drying up. She knew it too. If she didn't open the door now, she might never again.\nA decade of past memories sank into the depths.\n***\nTwenty minutes passed after the battle ended.\nThe subordinates of the Parrot Mercenary Band rested, and Rian treated his injuries with Tess's first aid.\nEven as this happened, Marsha remained in Shirone's arms.\nThere were no more tears. But she trembled intermittently, savoring the lingering feelings.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Would you mind moving aside? How absurdly bold can you be? If people saw this, they'd think we're the bullies and you're the victim.\"\nMarsha glanced at Amy and burrowed deeper into Shirone's embrace, pouting her lips in defiance. Amy could practically hear her patience snapping.\n\"I've had enough of you, seriously!\"\nFreeman stepped in to shield Marsha and pleaded.\n\"Let her be. She's exhausted from crying.\"\nAmy glared at Freeman and pointed her finger.\n\"Are you delusional or something? Do you know how much trouble you've caused us? It's a good thing we won, but Shirone's life almost ended today!\"\nWhat really angered Amy was the idea that a positive outcome was all that mattered. If Shirone hadn't overcome today's crisis, the aftermath would have been terrifying. Not only would Shirone's heart have been crushed after losing his magic, but Amy, who had to witness it, felt like she'd returned from hell.\n\"I'm sorry. All the crimes committed while operating with the Parrot Thieves were under my orders. Marsha only fought the guild's trackers. But if that's a crime as well….\"\nAmy folded her arms and interrupted.\n\"And if it is?\"\n\"Then I'll take responsibility for her life.\"\nMarsha shot up from Shirone's embrace, approached Freeman with a huff, and kicked his backside.\n\"Don't make me laugh! Who said I needed you to block my way to marriage?!\"\nFreeman staggered but stood firm, like an old tree unmoved by Marsha's tantrums.\n\"Marsha.\"\nHer shoulders trembled at Shirone's voice, but she couldn't bring herself to turn around. She had taken her frustration out on Freeman out of fear of this very moment. In the end, she spoke without turning.\n\"Um… I'm sorry about what happened. I know I can't be forgiven.\"\n\"That's right. You can't.\"\nMarsha turned around, shocked. Shirone's eyes were cold, the kindness he'd shown earlier gone without a trace.\n\"No matter the reason, you kidnapped and used an innocent girl. That's something you should never do.\"\nMarsha couldn't argue and bowed her head. She had never bullied the weak before, but she didn't want to make excuses. She had kidnapped Yuna, and the person most hurt by that was Shirone.\n\"You're right. I was truly a villain.\"\n\"That's right. You were.\"\nShirone spoke without hesitation. He had always been that way, treating people sincerely and without deception. He never confused or misled others.\n\"I'll be going. I hope you can endure. And I hope I never see you again.\"\nShirone turned and walked away without hesitation. Pitying and understanding Marsha was all he could do.\n\"I'm sorry!\"\nMarsha suddenly mustered the courage to shout. Shirone had refrained from making any judgments about what had happened.\nJust like when she had stolen pottery at the market, she had to approach him first.\n\"How can you just leave like this? I'm only getting started. At least give me a promise that we'll meet again!\"\nShirone stood still for a long time before turning back around. His gaze was still sharp, and Marsha felt nervous like a prisoner awaiting her sentence.\n\"If you're really sorry, apologize to Yuna. Tell her brother Zis you're sorry, too. Compensate them fully for what they've suffered.\"\n\"Of course! I hate this kind of thing, too. I won't make excuses, but I'll apologize to both of them.\"\n\"Even so, it doesn't erase what you've done. I can't forgive you for what you did.\"\nMarsha's shoulders drooped, and tears welled up in her eyes.\n\"But if you've truly decided to live a new life, I can forget the past.\"\nMarsha quickly looked up, then hugged Shirone like a child, sobbing.\n\"Waaaah! I was wrong!\"\nShirone couldn't comfort Marsha as she cried in his arms. He had never made a decision like this before.\nSome people live tougher lives than others, and not everyone can fight for their beliefs.\nThat's why Shirone decided to forgive her.\nIf he was the starting point of her transformation, he felt he had to see it through.\n\"Clay Marsha…\"\nPerhaps that's why Shirone suddenly realized that the strong and intimidating Marsha was actually a small woman who could fit comfortably in his arms.\nMarsha led Shirone and the others into the building. With two mages having fought there, nothing was left intact.\nTheir friends could imagine how fiercely Shirone had fought.\n\"Let's head upstairs. I'm starving after that fight. I'll make us some food, though my cooking isn't great.\"\nThe second floor was the only usable space, with just a few broken flowerpots on the floor.\nThey waited for the food to be served, with Yuna also sitting at the table. She seemed much better now that the tension had eased.\nHaving set out at dawn without eating a single meal all day, they were starving. Since waiting for food was unbearable, Marsha served soup and bread right away.\nAs soon as the food was ready, they dug in, filling their stomachs eagerly. Despite his injuries, Rian ate the most.\n\"Can you no longer use Pillage?\"\nThe most notable part of the battle for Shirone was definitely Pillage. Although it wasn't as rare as an Unlocker's magic, it was a unique ability in the magical society.\n\"Not really. Pillage won't work anymore, but scars engraved in the heart don't heal so easily. They tend to leave their mark.\"\n\"I see. Hmm.\"\nAs Shirone trailed off, the perceptive Marsha smiled brightly.\n\"Don't worry. I won't make any more evil magic. The rules can be changed a little.\"\nShirone nodded in surprise. This was practical knowledge he couldn't learn at school.\n\"So do you have any rules in mind?\"\n\"Not really. Let me think… How about I go to the magic academy and create magic to seduce a handsome blonde?\"\nShirone gave her a nervous smile. After all he'd been through with Unregulated Eaters, he couldn't just take it as a joke.\nMarsha caught Amy's sharp glare and tried to reassure her.\n\"Haha, don't worry. It's not Shirone.\"\n\"Oh, really? Then who is it?\"\n\"Someone who attends the academy, is blonde, and handsome.\"\nAmy remained silent. Arguing with an Unregulated Eater who saw the world in her own way was pointless.\nFreeman put down his spoon and said seriously.\n\"How about magic to seduce a man with no eyebrows?\"\n\"Pfft!\"\nMarsha spat the soup back into her bowl. She hadn't expected such brazen words in this situation.\n\"What nonsense is that? Have you gone mad?\"\n\"Why? I didn't say it was me.\"\n\"What other person with no eyebrows exists besides you and a monkey?\"\n\"But monkeys aren't people.\"\n\"No! I'm saying you're a monkey! By the way, you lost, didn't you? What a pathetic coward. How many times did I tell you not to use that Reverse Technique Tree, huh? Huh?\"\nMarsha jabbed a fork into Freeman's temple.\nWatching them bicker, Amy suddenly realized something. It was certainly strange that Freeman was fine after being struck directly by her Flame Strike.\n\"Reverse Technique Tree?\"\nThose who trained in Schema often layered multiple schemas for building up techniques. The base schema formed the foundation, and others were layered on top as options.\nReversing them suddenly was the Reverse Build.\nSchema users called this \"Reversal,\" a defensive build used only in life-threatening situations.\nGunners prioritized agility and precision and based their schema on sensory or neural enhancements. Defensive builds for regeneration or cell activation had to be added as options.\nFreeman, a gunner himself, wouldn't have been any different.\nAccording to Marsha, Freeman fought using the defensive Reverse Build from the start.\nThis explained why his face remained unscathed despite being burned by Flame Strike.\n\"That last speed he showed when saving Marsha was incredible.\"\nThat must have been the gunner's normal speed without a reversal. The realization left Amy boiling with rage.\nFreeman, perhaps sensing her mood, spoke up.\n\"If not for the Reversal, the opponent would have used a different strategy. It's not about being strong or weak. You just adapt to the situation, and courage is a skill too. You were stronger than me, Amy. That's all.\"\nMarsha rested her chin in her hand, chuckling softly. Her cowardly eyebrowless Freeman could now speak quite manly.\nReceiving praise from her opponent, Amy felt slightly awkward.\n\"Well… you were pretty impressive yourself, old man.\"\n\"Thanks. But I'm not an old man. I'm the same age as Marsha.\"\n\"So what? You might be her age, but you're still an old man to me.\"\nFreeman sulked and returned to his bread. He wanted to ask why Shirone called Marsha \"sister,\" but his timid nature held him back.\nOnce the playful banter died down, Marsha's expression turned serious again.\n\"Anyway, Shirone, if you're aiming to become a mage, you should be wary of Unregulated Eaters. I know it sounds strange coming from me.\"\n\"No, I want to know. Please, tell me more.\"\n\"Well, the Pillage spell I used wasn't all that efficient. The concept of stealing another's magic is overpowered, but it's just a possibility rather than an effective battle strategy.\"\nShirone agreed. If he had to risk his life for an ability, he wouldn't choose Pillage. There were too many limitations on stealing others' powers.\n\"I'm a special case. Most Unregulated Eaters are unique, but their magic isn't created for combat. Others use much more effective and versatile abilities.\"\n\"I see. In hindsight, it was terrifying fighting you. I never thought there was a way to seal Immortal Function.\"\n\"Haha, sorry about that. But you're right. Nothing's impossible in magic, and nothing is absolute either. You beat me because you found my weakness, right?\"\n\"Yes. If Unregulated Eaters base their magic on trauma, I thought attacking that trauma persistently might create an opening.\"\n\"Exactly. It's a battle between conditions and prices. When fighting an Unregulated Eater, figuring out how their magic works is more important than their combat power. But I think you'll manage just fine.\"\n\"I learned a lot this time.\"\nShirone answered sincerely. This battle had shown him how vast the world was and how many outstanding people there were.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Maybe now, I can live a different life?”\nThe wounds hadn't fully healed, but at least she had broken through her shell. What remained was to carve out a new life while vividly recalling the pain of the past.\n“What will you do now? I heard someone’s after you.”\nFreeman asked.\n“We're leaving. We started as mercenaries, and we must live as mercenaries. Our subordinates want that too. Of course, in this country, we've unfairly been labeled as a bandit group.”\nSadness clouded Marsha’s eyes. Mercenaries fought for a living, and she had accepted that she could die at any time. Burying her comrades' deaths deep within, she could still smile.\nShe had never fought for a greater cause or for some shallow sense of justice, but she had always been proud and never avoided a challenge.\nMarsha at least wanted to grant them the title of brave warriors. She felt that their reputation as bandits shouldn't stain their graves.\nUnderstanding Marsha’s feelings, Tess tried to console her.\n“Honestly, there's a fine line between bandits and mercenaries. And in some ways, the same can be said for knights and mercenaries. They’re all buried fighting for their beliefs. Politically outcast groups might be branded as evil, but the tides can always turn.”\nRian shared a similar sentiment. Shirone or Amy, who delved into academics, might not relate, but it was a common burden for those aspiring to be knights.\n“There was a time our family was threatened too for trying to remain neutral. And Tess, your father must be having a hard time too.”\n“True. He’s a hero here, but in the colonies, he’s seen as an invader. It’s politics.”\nMarsha smiled, realizing that Rian and Tess were sharing their experiences just to cheer her up.\nDespite her lingering distrust in the world, she had come to believe in the existence of genuine people.\n‘Such kind children. Shirone’s friends are just like him.’\nMarsha leaned her chin on the dining table like a lazy cat, and in a rare moment of peace, she pointed a thumb at Shirone.\n“What about you all? Planning on some sightseeing?”\n“Ah, we're going to the Kergos Ruins.”\n“Kergos? What are you going to do there, you young couple?”\n“Well, actually…”\nShirone explained why they were on the island. Listening with interest, Marsha nodded in surprise.\n“Wow, I didn't know that secret was there. I wasn’t on the island, so I had no idea. Freeman, did you know?”\n“To some extent. I heard stories from the locals.”\n“So, you want to enter the Kergos self-governing district?”\n“Yes. But the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice is so difficult that we're unsure if we can pass.”\n“So if you can't, that’s it?”\n“Probably. I do have a backup plan, but it's not certain.”\nFreeman chimed in.\n“If it's that, we can help.”\n“Huh? The Room of Achievement and Sacrifice?”\n“No, even if you can’t pass through that room, you can still enter the district. Falcoa seemed to have made deals with that side and Lupe. If you show Freeman Organization’s pass, they’ll let you in. After all, Falcoa was skilled at that kind of thing.”\nShirone’s group was stunned. It was the first time they heard that one could enter the district without taking the test.\nAmy tilted her head and asked, “Doesn't that lead to a different path? If two routes exist from the start, there’s no need to have the trial.”\n“I don’t know about that. What’s clear is that both paths lead to the same place. This was confirmed by those who passed through the trial.”\nUpon hearing this, Shirone was also puzzled. She had expected that passing the trial would lead to a different zone.\n“One place requires passing the trial, but the other doesn’t. Why would they do that?”\nTess added, “We don’t know. Maybe it's tradition. Old cultures often keep those customs. Or maybe it’s to avoid suspicion.”\n“What’s the point?”\n“To give the impression that the self-governing district isn’t that special. Hearing about the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice has already lowered our expectations.”\n“Anyway, it’s best to confirm directly. If necessary, we can get you a pass. It can be done right now.”\nFreeman concluded.\n“Yes, please.”\nShirone decided to accept it. They hadn’t decided which route to take yet, but having multiple ways to access the self-governing district was better.\nFreeman called in his subordinate to prepare the pass and then spoke to Shirone’s group.\n“Entering won't be a problem, but you'll need someone who knows the native language. We don’t have anyone who does.”\n“Huh? Then how did Falcoa handle it?”\n“After arriving on the island, he built his own network. Strictly speaking, the existing mercenary group didn't fit him. Although his private network disbanded after he died, he used to hang out with the smugglers. One of them must have acted as an interpreter.”\n“Hmm, so we need to find an interpreter.”\nYuna slowly raised her hand.\n“Um, I don’t know if I should say this…”\n“It's fine, say anything.”\n“My brother knows some Kergos.”\nAmy’s interest was piqued.\n“Really? How did he learn it?”\n“He took on various jobs to look after me when we were young. Before becoming a harbor recruiter, he did some tour guide work. I think he learned it then.”\nFreeman added, “That’s great. Let's ask him. We’d like to help you more, but now that Marsha’s back, staying on the island is risky. The Magic Association is still after us.”\nShirone nodded understandingly. She didn’t want to burden Marsha, who was already being pursued at a national level.\nWith their conversation settled, Shirone’s group left before nightfall.\nMarsha placed teleportation bracelets on them.\nThe instructions were simple. The bracelet had its own Spirit Zone, so they only needed to visualize the coordinates like casting magic.\nShirone examined the bracelet Marsha had given him\nPeople used these without a second thought, but the idea of linking magic tools to magic circles was truly unprecedented.\nConnecting two separate Spirit Zones was an impossible feat.\nThis could have been how Marsha’s teleportation looked from the outside.\nA person inside the spot would only see the hole in space, but from the outside, both the entrance and exit would be visible.\n‘The Labyrinth of Space-Time. Maybe the world is already within a huge secret.’\nInitially, she thought his case was unique, but she realized he was Alpheas’s disciple.\nFurther investigation revealed a connection to the Kergos Ruins.\nMoreover, spatial magic was now incorporated into magical tools and spread worldwide.\nShirone suddenly felt fear. Maybe he was seeking something that he shouldn’t, just as the headmaster had warned.\nWhile he was lost in thought, Marsha approached and gave her final advice.\n“There’s a carriage waiting at the base of the mountain. I might see you again before you leave, but be careful. And once you're back, find a healing mage to treat your wounds.”\n“Got it. Thank you for your concern.”\n“Hoho! Don’t mention it. Not between us.”\nMarsha covered her mouth and lightly slapped Shirone’s arm. Although she no longer needed to hide herself, she wasn’t much different from when they first met. Perhaps she had used falsehood as a shield, revealing herself through deception.\n“We’re off. If I don’t see you on the island, contact the magic school.”\n“Don’t worry. Clay Marsha can find you anytime, anywhere.”\nMarsha spoke vigorously with her sleeves rolled up, clearly someone who knew how to lift people’s spirits.\nFreeman stood by her side, ever the loyal support. Though their dynamic seemed unequal, it felt well-matched.\nWhen Shirone entered the forest, Marsha, who had stayed for a long time, asked, “The Kergos Ruins. Will they be alright?”\n“Probably not,” Freeman replied calmly.\nMarsha frowned at Freeman but he maintained his usual composure.\n“They'll make it. They’re strong.”\nWith a bittersweet smile, Marsha looked up at the sky. The sound of spatial movement tore through the forest air.\n***\nBy the time Shirone’s group returned to the villa in the carriage, evening had already fallen.\nZis, who had been pacing the living room despite his injuries, turned around as soon as the door opened.\n“Aah…”\nTears filled Zis’s eyes. His only sister, Yuna, had returned unharmed.\n“Brother!”\n“Yuna!”\nZis cried as he hugged Yuna, and the siblings clung to each other, sobbing.\nThe ordeal had been challenging for them. Even Shirone, known for her mental fortitude, had nearly given up multiple times.\nKnowing they had been attacked by such vicious people made Zis and Yuna’s helplessness all the more palpable.\n“Are you okay? Are you hurt?”\n“Yes. I’m fine. My brother and sisters saved me. But what about you? What happened that you’re all bandaged up?”\n“I’m fine. As long as you’re back, nothing hurts.”\nIn truth, Zis could barely walk, but he didn’t want to show his pain to Yuna. Her fears were far greater than his suffering.\nZis looked at Shirone’s group with gratitude and bowed deeply.\n“Thank you! Thank you so much! I won’t forget this kindness.”\nTess patted Zis’s shoulder reassuringly. Having heard Freeman’s story, he knew this was something to discuss later.\n“Hoho! Forget it. Just remember what I said when we set out. If you’re really grateful, show it with your actions from now on.”\n“Huh? What do you mean?”\nZis blinked, confused by Tess’s words, while Shirone’s group and even Yuna smiled at him.\n***\nAfter putting the exhausted Yuna to bed, Zis returned to the table. Sipping on herbal tea, he resumed the paused conversation.\n“So, you want to enter the self-governing district through the Kergos Ruins, and that’s why you need an interpreter?”\n“Yes. Yuna says you can help, but we want to know how proficient you are.”\n“For casual conversation, I can guide you. But entering the self-governing district is…”\nZis stroked his chin with a concerned expression.\n“What’s wrong? Is there something that bothers you?”\n“No, it's fine. I’ll guide you. I don’t know why you’re going, but it’s a special place. Not because it’s secretive but because the Galian government strictly controls access. Are you sure about this?”\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

The government controls access? But the Galiant government and the native self-governing district have separate administrations. If we decide to go in, what can they do?\"\n\"It's true that it's mostly just nominal control, but I think there must be a reason they're so adamant about it. Sorry if it sounded unnecessary.\"\n\"No, it's fine. We didn't know that, either. But our decision to go hasn't changed. Of course, that's if you guide us, Zis.\"\n\"Of course! Who else but Zis to be the guide?\"\nConfidently thumping his chest, Zis gasped in pain. It took a while for the pain to subside before he could continue speaking.\n\"But, with the state I'm in, I'm not sure I can walk around properly.\"\n\"Don't worry about that. Tomorrow, we'll go to the healing mage Mr. Freeman recommended. Most external injuries can be treated there.\"\n\"A healing mage? Isn’t that going to be incredibly expensive?\"\nZis's eyes widened in surprise, and Amy looked at him sleepily, saying,\n\"It’ll probably be cheaper than the guide fee you suggested.\"\nZis scratched his head. That comment made him realize just how much he had tried to overcharge them.\n\"Haha, why bring that up now? That’s all in the past.\"\nShirone sank into a plush sofa.\n\"Anyway, we should rest today. Mental fatigue can be recovered with sleep, but Rian and Tess will be uncomfortable until they receive healing magic.\"\n\"Huh? No, I'm fine. My injuries are already healed.\"\nEveryone turned to look at Tess. Indeed, the cuts on her cheeks and arms had healed cleanly.\n\"Wow, how did you do that? Is it something similar to what Mr. Freeman did?\"\n\"Yep. I set my second schema to focus on mitochondria.\"\n\"Mitochondria?\"\n\"It’s a cell organelle that produces energy. Using a mitochondria schema dramatically boosts basic physical abilities like reflexes, regeneration, and stamina. That’s why less talented swordsmen often choose it as their base build. Probably, soldiers and mercenaries in the kingdom use mitochondria builds a lot.\"\n\"I see, but what's this about a second build and base build?\"\nHaving been lynched by swordsmen during a previous encounter with the Parrot Mercenary Band, Shirone wanted to learn more about schemas.\nThe aspects of magic combat were indeed different. With the potential dangers in the ruins unknown, it was best to gather as much information on combat as possible.\n\"A build refers to a technique tree. People usually say to imagine a virtual body when explaining a schema, but the sensation is different when you actually train it. As the cells in your body awaken, they expand in clarity. So here’s the question. How do swordsmen overlay multiple builds?\"\nAmy and Rian knew the answer but remained silent. Tess had the highest understanding of schemas here, so they left the explanation to her.\n\"Maybe. If it's about virtual schematics, maybe it's about developing parts like arms and legs?\"\n\"People usually think that. It’s not impossible, but that approach doesn’t allow for balancing the body. For example, if you keep developing only the nervous system, your muscles might burst. Conversely, if you only develop muscular strength, your fists could shatter when you swing them.\"\n\"I see. I've always wondered how they balance enhancing the body.\"\n\"It’s similar to magic. You probably have a systematic method to handle your spirit, too. Something like a special pattern.\"\n\"Yep. It's called the Four Way Formation. There’s also something like a Sequence Method.\"\n\"Swordsmen are the same. That’s what a build is. Imagine creating several layers of virtual schematics and stacking them. For example, you might lay a mitochondria schema at the very bottom, then a muscle strengthening schema on top of that, and then a technique for the eyes on top of that. By completing the base like this and climbing the technique tree, the risk of the body collapsing due to imbalance is significantly reduced.\"\n\"Ah! I see.\"\n\"The most efficient is the base schema. If the efficiency of the schema at the bottom is 100, the second layer is 50, and the third is 25. You can switch the order, but unless you're a master of the technique tree, it’s hard to apply it directly in combat. However, there are a few exceptions, notably a technique called Reversal.\"\n\"That’s the technique used by Mr. Freeman that Amy mentioned, right? Does it create a specific pattern like the Four Way Formation?\"\n\"No, a schema doesn’t work like that. To put it simply, Reversal is possible because it allows changing the perceptual timing of the schema.\"\nTess reached out over the table and mimicked the movement of shuffling papers.\n\"For example, let's say you stacked three sheets of transparent paper. When you look down, your gaze penetrates the papers in order. If we label these 1, 2, 3, then Reversal means flipping the view from bottom to top, like 3, 2, 1. Besides this, there are many techniques related to the technique tree, like Deviation, Penetration, Folding, Crossing, etc. All these considerations are what we call building a schema.\"\nShirone was impressed. He had thought swordsmanship was just about physical enhancement, but it was as technical as magic.\n\"So Tess, you’ve placed the mitochondria schema as your second technique tree. Its efficiency is half that of the first.\"\n\"Right. Although the mitochondria build is popular, it’s somewhat wasteful to concentrate physical activity in the schema with 100% efficiency unless it’s a physical confrontation. So, those who perform the sword properly choose the schema that best fits their technique. In my case, I chose a nervous system build because precision is critical in handling a rapier.\"\nShirone now understood. If two swordsmen with the same rapier skills and schema abilities fought, the nervous system build would overwhelmingly overpower the mitochondria build.\n\"The mercenaries we met in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice were quite something, choosing builds other than mitochondria. It seems warriors chose muscle strengthening builds and archers sensory builds.\"\n\"Huh? Are the nervous system and sensory builds different?\"\n\"They are similar, but they enhance different parts. Think of it as the difference between internal and external senses. My nervous system build focuses on internal senses, which allows for extremely precise control of my body’s movements. Conversely, a sensory build focuses on external senses, like the primary senses of eyes, nose, ears, and the close senses of taste and touch. Archers naturally train their primary senses, so their vision, smell, and hearing are much more sensitive than others. Of course, my third build also adopts a sensory system.\"\n\"Ah, so that’s why it’s tough to tail an archer.\"\n\"Right. The important thing is to find a build that suits you. Of course, diligently refining each schema is essential. Even if you choose a mitochondria build, if your practice is lacking, your physical abilities will be inferior to a swordsman who chose mitochondria for their third technique tree.\"\n\"Now I understand what a schema is and why it’s called a body diagram.\"\n\"Think of it as another self-image. For example, phantom limb pain. People who have had an arm amputated might still feel pain where the arm used to be if there's an object in that space. That’s the actuality of a schema.\"\nAs the conversation continued, like Shirone, Amy also felt she was learning a lot. She had assigned Tess to explain because she thought it would be simpler from a swordsman's perspective, but as they delved deeper, even she found herself discovering new information.\n\"So Tess, how many schemas has my dad overlapped? I remember he had lots of techniques as a child. If the efficiency decreases with each layer, isn't building beyond the fourth layer almost pointless?\"\n\"That's usually the case. But there’s a way to make the efficiency of the second technique tree 100.\"\nIntrigued and already deeply interested in schemas, Shirone asked eagerly,\n\"Oh, really? How’s that?\"\n\"Swordsmen call it mastery. Like I mentioned, to explain a schema, imagine the shadow of your own body. Opening a schema means clearing away the black parts of that shadow. But honestly, how many people can perfectly understand their own body? I mean, someone who has peeled away every black part of a single schema.\"\n\"That sounds tough.\"\n\"It requires immense training and genius talent, but there are people who have achieved it. They become so transparent that they ultimately merge with their own body. So, someone who has mastered a specific schema eventually acts as if that layer isn't there at all. If someone has mastered five schemas, the efficiency of their sixth schema is 100. But this is a matter of time and effort. Talent can shorten it.\"\n\"Wow.\"\nShirone let out a breath he had been holding. Although he had always dreamed of becoming a mage, he had realized the infinite potential of the sword during his real combat with Rian.\nMage and swordsman. Spirit Zone and Schema. Indeed, there was a reason these powers divided the world.\n\"That's amazing, Tess.\"\nTouched by Shirone's sincere compliment, Tess blushed.\n\"Ah, it's nothing. I've been learning this since I was a child. I did explain a bit extensively hoping it would also be helpful to you, a magical poet.\"\n\"Yes, it's been incredibly helpful. Now, in situations like today, I can respond better than before. So, Tess is already healed, and tomorrow it'll just be Zis and Rian who need healing magic.\"\nShirone spoke casually, but Tess suddenly stiffened, realizing something.\nCome to think of it, despite the discussion about swordsmanship and schemas, Rian hadn't interjected at all.\nTess discreetly glanced at Rian. He was listening impassively, but his gaze lingered on his own body.\nHis body was in complete disarray.\nAlthough he had ultimately overwhelmed Falcoa with an imagined schema, his failure to master the schema was a significant flaw.\nHe wasn’t just failing to heal; it felt as if his injuries were getting worse.\n\"Damn it! Why can't I...\"\nTess looked at Rian with pity, but her heart also raced with tension. She felt guilty as if she had inadvertently hurt him.\n\"His pride must be hurt. He must be the most upset about this.\"\nRealizing his friends were watching him, Rian quickly adjusted his expression. As if nothing had happened, he flashed a bright smile and thumped his chest.\n\"Haha! I'm fine. I don't need healing magic. I'm tough.\"\nIndeed, Rian was thumping his chest with tremendous force, yet his expression didn’t change, nor did he show any sign of pain.\nBut everyone knew. He was enduring through sheer superhuman willpower.\nWhile his mental strength was indeed astounding, his combat effectiveness would significantly decline if his injuries weren’t treated.\nStill, no one urged Rian to receive healing magic again. They understood the misery of having to show weakness.\nBut Shirone was different. During this trip, Rian had seriously carried out his duties as a guardian knight. If Rian was serious, Shirone thought he should treat him with the same commitment.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

I don't have any fatal injuries. Of course, the spot where Tess stabbed me is strangely a bit painful, haha!\"\n\"Rian, the moment you fall is the moment I die.\"\nRian's laughter stopped abruptly. The living room was enveloped in silence. Everyone looked anxiously between Shirone and Rian.\n\"Shirone, I...\"\n\"I know. You would protect me until your last breath. However, a moment's decision can determine the success or failure of a mission. I'd prefer you take more hits for me if you're going to be stubborn like this. Otherwise, I might have to reconsider entrusting my back to you.\"\nThis might sound selfish and cold. Indeed, asking a friend to take a blade for him was undeniably harsh.\nBut Shirone knew Rian better than anyone.\nRian was fire. The way to fuel that fire was not through shallow praise but by impressing upon him the harsh realities.\nRian slightly curled the corners of his lips. A hot fire surged within him, burning away any trivial emotions.\n\"Don't worry, Shirone! I'll do whatever it takes to return this body to perfect condition! As long as I'm here, no one will be able to reach you.\"\nRian seemed ready to receive healing magic right then. Freed from her own hell, Tess secretly looked up at the ceiling and sighed.\n\"Phew. Thank you, Shirone. Really, thank you.\"\nTess had no doubt that Rian would someday become the greatest swordsman. But even if he became a burning sword, only Shirone could wield him.\n***\nEarly in the morning, Shirone's group left the villa.\nThere was a mages' guild in the residential area, small in influence due to the Freeman Organization’s control over the island but sustained by possessing a healing mage.\nBeing a resort area, it was common for people to sustain injuries while relaxing and having fun.\nCommoners might seek home remedies or visit a doctor, but nobles would get treated by a healing mage even for a minor finger injury.\nThe cost of healing varied depending on the type and severity of the injury, ranging from 1 to 10 gold, but due to Freeman's influence, the treatments were reasonably priced.\nHealing magic stimulated cellular activity to naturally heal wounds, unlike physicians who diagnosed and treated based on the cause of the illness.\nAlthough some schema users practiced emergency surgery as surgeons, mages preferred to follow the natural order, eschewing artificial methods.\nHigh-level magic involved complex theories, but even simple cellular activation was highly effective because the human body knew how to heal itself.\nThe healing mage seemed not very skilled, as it took two hours to fully treat Zis and Rian’s injuries.\nShirone was newly impressed by the power of magic upon seeing Rian's injuries cleanly healed.\nTwo hours would be impractical in real-time combat on the battlefield, but over the long term, the combat effectiveness of a group with a healing mage was tremendously higher.\nUpon returning to the villa, the group repacked their belongings and headed out.\nWhile healing magic only regenerated wounds and didn't boost overall condition, Rian seemed to overflow with vitality, strong as he was.\nZis also seemed confident in his endurance, cheerfully shouldering his backpack without showing signs of fatigue.\nRian was puzzled by Zis's luggage. Since Zis, the guide, was expected to part ways once they entered the self-governing district, he wouldn't need much gear.\n\"Huh? What's with the luggage?\"\n\"Ah, this is a packed lunch. Yuna made it while we were getting treated. She's got a knack for cooking since she works in a restaurant.\"\n\"Oh, she's a professional? That’s great. Let's eat now.\"\nAs Rian approached drooling, Tess pinched his side and scolded.\n\"We just ate, why another meal? Let's head to the ruins first. It’d be troublesome if it gets dark.\"\nEveryone knew it was better to leave early since they had visited the location before. This time, the women didn't complain and finished packing earlier than usual.\nWhen they arrived a kilometer from the ruins, the coachman stopped the carriage as usual. Accustomed to this, the group disembarked and walked towards the ruins.\nNothing had changed since their last visit.\nThe bustling crowd, the natives watching warily, and the pub where they had encountered mercenaries were all the same.\nHeading towards the outskirts of the ruins, they decided to have lunch in the park. Yuna had packed rice balls made from leftover ingredients soaked in rice, a dish unfamiliar to them but popular on the island.\nShirone tasted it and found it uniquely delicious, with a salty, nutty flavor from the various ingredients.\nThough it seemed a light meal, it sat heavily in the stomach, more so than bread.\nZis reviewed a manual that Freeman had passed along. Although brief, his years in the organization allowed him to quickly grasp how deals were conducted.\nHe led them to the opposite side of the entrance to the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, also guarded by a native in civilized clothing.\n\"Hello.\"\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"I'm from the Freeman Organization. When can we depart?\"\nAfter scanning Zis up and down, the native spoke more freely once shown a pass.\nZis and the native exchanged a few words in the native language before he turned to Shirone.\n\"We have to wait about an hour for our ride?\"\n\"Ride? What kind of ride?\"\n\"We’ll probably take a tram. That's what was written. Anyway, they told us to come back when the tram arrives.\"\nTess looked around the group.\n\"What should we do? Wait here for an hour, or look around a bit more?\"\nShirone pondered. Was it really okay to enter the self-governing district like this? If so, why did the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice exist?\nTess thought it might be tradition, but Shirone doubted it was that simple, especially since the labyrinth's breath touched this place.\n\"I want to try the trial gate again.\"\nHis sudden suggestion surprised his friends, who wondered why he would choose the hard way when a simpler route was available.\nBut Amy shared Shirone's thoughts. There must be something beneath the ruins that people shouldn’t know about. So, if there were two routes leading to the same place, there must be a special reason for each.\nHowever, the problem was passing the trial. Pursuing an impossible task might just waste their time.\n\"Can we really pass it? Are you thinking of trying with lasers?\"\n\"If possible, I'd like to try.\"\n\"And if that doesn’t work? The tram might not wait for us. And entering the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice will take a significant amount of time.\"\n\"I guess it wouldn't matter much if we failed.\"\nShirone spoke nonchalantly, prompting a puzzled response from Amy.\n\"It doesn’t matter if we fail?\"\n\"I have something on my mind. Of course, I can't be sure of anything yet. How about this? I'll enter the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice alone, and the rest of you wait here and take the tram if it comes. That way, we can synchronize our timings and experience both routes.\"\nAmy thought Shirone's plan was logical. Since he had scored the highest in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice before, there was no need for others to follow. Besides, if he went alone, it wouldn’t take much time.\n\"Alright. Let’s head to the trial route then.\"\nWith Amy's agreement, the group headed toward the altar to the east. Different natives guarded it this time.\n\"Shirone, you remember the password?\"\n\"Yeah. Stay back. Last time, they mistook us for a group because you were too close. I'll go in and come back alone this time.\"\n\"Okay. It should be fine, but... be careful, anyway.\"\nShirone walked toward the altar but stopped in his tracks after just three steps.\nSomeone inside was banging on the door.\nAs Shirone approached, the native guarding it turned around and operated a mechanism, opening the stone wall.\n'It seems someone else attempted the trial. Are there more challengers than I thought?'\nCurious about who was emerging from the trial, Shirone watched eagerly. But the moment he saw their faces, he was startled.\n\"Uh, what?\"\nAmy, standing behind him, also jumped in surprise.\n\"What! How are they here?\"\n\"What’s wrong, Amy? Do you know them? Friends, maybe?\"\n\"Hmph! Friends? They’re enemies!\"\nFrom Amy’s reaction, they clearly weren’t on good terms. Rian and Tess, more curious now, closely observed the man and woman who had emerged from the altar.\nFrom a distance, they looked like siblings due to their similar features—black hair, dark eyes, pale faces, and a uniquely dark aura.\nShirone stared blankly at them. They were Canis and Arin, disciples of Archmage Arcane.\n'Why are they here?'\nOf course, they were free to travel wherever they wanted, but it was ominous that they had emerged from a place touched by the labyrinth’s breath.\nCanis and Arin were also surprised to see Shirone’s group but quickly regained their composure.\n\"So you were here too.\"\nCanis approached with a sneering face, while Arin shyly looked down, unaccustomed to social interactions due to her life confined in Radum.\nAlthough they had clashed before, they would be classmates next semester, so she felt obliged to at least greet them.\n\"Ah, hello, Shirone?\"\nSummoning all her courage, Arin raised her hand to wave at Shirone, but Canis glared at her fiercely. Realizing her mistake, Arin quickly lowered her hand, though Shirone greeted her warmly.\n\"Hi, doing well?\"\n\"Uh? Yeah. Just...\"\nArin, glancing at Canis, responded with a shrinking voice. But seeing Shirone genuinely welcome her, she wondered if there was really a need to be so hostile.\nAs she slowly raised her head, surprised by Shirone’s intense gaze, she gasped.\n'He was impressive before, but now he’s even more distinct. Truly a fascinating person.'\nMeanwhile, Shirone also had a lot on his mind with the arrival of Canis and Arin. Their return from the altar meant they had likely been rejected by the Angel's Eye.\n'It’s not easy, the Labyrinth of Time.'\nAs disciples of the Archmage, Canis and Arin were formidable, especially in real combat experience, where they were considered superior to anyone at the magic school.\nAlthough Shirone had subdued him before, he had struggled even while receiving elemental blessings.\nBut even they had been unable to advance further in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, giving a clue about the high standards of the labyrinth’s cut-off.",

Did you guys get eliminated? That figures.”\nThough Shirone might not hold any grudge since he had won the battle, Amy had her own scores to settle with the pair.\nHer philosophy was simple: payback was due, and this was her chance to strike a blow.\nHowever, Canis did not rise to her provocation.“Humph, look who's talking. As if you're any better. Now I see, the seniors aren’t so special after all.”\n“Laughable! How would you know if I've failed?”\n“Knowing that I failed implies you took the test too. If you had succeeded, you wouldn’t be wandering around here. Are you an idiot?”\n“You little brat! How dare you talk back to your senior!”\n“At least you should be thankful. If I hadn't stopped Lucas, you would have been dead.”\nFire flashed in Amy’s eyes. The memory of being chosen by Lucas and nearly cursed during their exposure to the Abyss Nova filled her with rage.\n“You little…”\nBefore Shirone could intervene, Amy raised her fist towards Canis.\nJust as she was about to strike him with the power of her Schema, a dark shadow loomed behind Canis and a black clawed hand swept over his shoulder.\nAmy instinctively stepped back. Harvest, protecting Canis as if embracing him, split his mouth in a grin.\n“Kekeke! Long time no see, sister. You haven’t changed a bit.”\n“Aaagh! What is that!”\nTourists screamed and fled at the sight of Harvest. Shirone could understand their reaction; the effects of magic were familiar to nobles, but a shadow rising in human form was another level of bizarre.\nEven Tess lost her composure at the sight of Harvest.\n“My word. The shadow talks? Rian, have you ever seen anything like this?”\nA small face with broad shoulders, and a waif-like waist; though humanoid, its arms were twice as thin and long as a human's. Its palms were as large as shields, and its nails as sharp as swords.\n“No, this is a first for me too, but seems like Shirone knows him?”\nHarvest spread his palm wide, covering most of Canis’s torso, optimized for absorbing impacts. In front of a Harvest specialized in shock absorption, even Amy had to be cautious.\n“Keke, let’s be careful about approaching each other. I don’t want to see blood in such a place.”\n“Eww…”\nJust as Amy was about to rush again, Shirone raised his finger. A red photon condensed at his fingertip, ready to be shot any moment.\nThis time, Harvest remained silent. It was the same laser technique that had nearly annihilated him before.\n“Apologize to Amy. It’s not right to dredge up someone’s painful memories.”\n“Painful? That much and it’s called pain? Besides, I saved that girl. Really, these nobles and their ways of thinking.”\n“That’s for the person who was hurt to decide. If you've stirred up painful memories, the least you can do is apologize. How long will you keep looking at the world so negatively?”\n“Hmph! I don’t need to hear that from a greenhouse flower.”\nCanis’s taunt was followed by Harvest inflating his upper body, threatening everyone. Meanwhile, Shirone’s laser glowed even brighter.\nArin, slowly extending her Spirit Zone towards Shirone in the form of tentacles, thought to disrupt his mental focus and disperse the laser.\nBut before her Zone could reach him, Amy blocked the way. Arin frowned, aware that most mental magic was futile against those with red eyes.\nMagical creatures, lasers, mental magic, schema memories.\nDifferent types of magic clashed and intertwined like ribbons, no one daring to make a sudden move, each watching the others.\nThe tension was so palpable that Tess grabbed Rian’s arm and feigned crying.\n“What’s with them? So scary.”\nRian thought differently. People said mages were bizarre, and the more they deviated from the norm, the more distinctly they defined their identity as mages.\nRian was pleased that Shirone had become such an extraordinary and abnormal person.\n“You’re doing well, Shirone.”\n“What, what?”\nTess looked at him incredulously, as if he were a pervert.\nBut Rian simply walked towards the mages, drawing his straight sword from behind his back.\n“Hey, whoever you are…”\nBefore he could finish, Tess, who had run up behind him, climbed onto his back and covered his mouth with her palm.\n“Please have some sense. What will we do if you start acting up too?”\n“Mmph! Let go! Shirone! Mmph!”\nShirone, Amy, Canis, and Tess watched the struggle between Rian and Tess with dumbfounded expressions.\nTheir fight eased the tension of the impending battle, and even Harvest deflated his inflated torso.\nAs the light of the laser faded, Arin's Spirit Zone dispersed, and Amy's red eyes returned to normal.\nReally, there was no need for such fierce hostilities. If Amy had scratched Canis’s pride, he had simply countered with a bit more force.\n“Let’s stop this pointless skirmish. We didn’t come here to fight you guys.”\nCanis absorbed Harvest back into his shadow as he spoke.\nWith the opponent offering a truce, Amy also cooled her fighting spirit and regained her rationality.\nWith tensions diffused, Canis finally asked the question he had been curious about since seeing Shirone.\n“So, how is it? Sticking around even after failing suggests you’ve found a way to enter the Kergos self-governing district, right?”\nShirone was about to speak when Amy cut in.\n“Why should we tell you?”\nThis wasn’t just provocation. The information they had risked their lives for was not something to be carelessly shared with untrustworthy individuals.\n“There’s no need to be so wary. We know how to enter the self-governing district too. You’re probably thinking of using the smuggling route, right?”\nAmy was taken aback by Canis’s knowledge. It seemed he knew about Freeman Organization’s dealings with the loop. But then, why had they entered the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice and taken the test?\nAs Amy pondered, Canis, watching her closely, quirked an eyebrow.\n“Can you hear your brain ticking over here? Want me to explain?”\n“Pfft! Who’s curious? We know enough already!”\n“Ah, really? What about you, Arin?”\nCanis turned to ask her. Arin, who had been distracted, hurriedly collected herself to respond.\n“Huh? Oh, it’s a lie. She’s very curious. Her heart is pounding.”\n“Eek!”\nAmy clenched her teeth in frustration. Whether ‘pounding’ was literal or not, hiding emotions was impossible around Arin with her abilities.\nAt that moment, a rumbling noise came from Arin’s stomach.\nAll eyes turned to Arin. She blushed deeply, embarrassed.\n“Arin, are you okay?”\n“I’m fine. It’s nothing. I’ve been through worse.”\nCanis clenched his teeth. They had been traveling for a long time and had run out of money, going without food for three days.\nWhile he could endure hunger, Arin shouldn’t have to. His instinct to protect her, honed over a decade in Radum, still prevailed.\nSwallowing his pride, Canis turned to Shirone.\n“Do you guys have something to eat? Arin hasn’t eaten. I’m okay, so don’t worry about me.”\nShirone took a good look at Canis’s appearance for the first time. The wear on his clothes and the dirt seemed to indicate they had been sleeping outdoors.\n‘Arcane said they’d been stripped of everything he left them…’\nSince the pulse test, Canis had not returned to school. It made sense that basic survival was their biggest issue.\nSkilled but without formal accreditation, mages found it hard to get work. Clients were wary, except for those involving criminal activities.\nBut Canis no longer wanted to live in the shadows. He had realized that fighting against society would never allow them to rise to the top.\nAmy sighed.\n“We need to eat something first. Let’s go to that pub we visited before. The noodles are good there.”\n“No, I’m really fine!”\nArin waved her hands. She was starving, but she couldn’t bear to follow because of Canis’s pride.\nAmy grabbed Arin’s wrist and dragged her along.\n“What do you mean, fine? There’s thunder in your stomach. You need strength whether you’re fighting or not. Canis, you come too.”\n“No, I’m good. Just take Arin.”\n“Enough, follow me. It’s only natural for a senior to treat their juniors to a meal.”\nShirone pushed Canis’s back.\n“Come on, Canis. Let’s go inside. We have things to talk about anyway.”\nReluctantly, Canis followed, and Amy led them to the pub where they had met the mercenaries.\nOnce the six of them settled down, Shirone introduced Canis and Arin to Rian. Amy’s explanation that they were disciples of the Archmage and Shirone had beaten him reassured Rian.\nFilling their stomachs was the immediate priority. Canis and Arin were so hungry they quickly devoured two bowls of noodles each.\nWatching them eat, even those in Shirone’s group who had just eaten Yuna’s packed lunch felt full.\nAfter gulping down the soup, Shirone smiled spontaneously. Regardless of their origins or personalities, they were all human after all.\nOnce the pair seemed revived after their meal, Shirone tentatively broached a topic.\n“We’re all dealing with complicated thoughts, but let’s open up a bit. Why are you guys here?”\n“Canis has always been interested in ruins. So, we’re here exploring.”\n“Ah, was being an archaeologist Canis’s dream?”\n“Tch, unnecessary chatter.”\nNot fond of sharing his story, Canis grumbled. However, he didn’t stop Arin from continuing.\nAlthough not very sociable, Arin wasn’t someone who would simply answer anything asked. Her response was carefully calibrated to reveal enough without giving away crucial information.\nIn reality, their visit to the island wasn’t just for exploration; they had a specific reason that necessitated Shirone’s involvement.\n“So, why are you here?”\nCanis pointed at Amy. Although Shirone was likely the leader, he didn’t want to show too keen an interest.\nBut Amy was adept at psychological warfare, adept enough to navigate around Arin’s abilities.\n“Hehe, obviously to get into the Kergos self-governing district. Just like you guys.”\n“Hmm, and what do you think is there?”\n“Hmm, you speak as if you know something?”\n“It could be, or maybe not.”\nAmy flashed a feigned smile, but inside she was desperate.\n‘They know. They definitely know, the bastards.’\nCanis had chosen the test route, not the smuggling route. This meant he must have a clear reason for needing to take that path.\n‘This is tricky. How do I get information out of these two?’\nCanis and Arin were different from the mercenaries they had met before. With Arin’s abilities, they were unbeatable in a battle of wits.\nShirone, having listened quietly, decided to ask directly.\n“Canis, can you share what you know? We really don’t know much.”\nAmy might think differently, but it was clearly a disadvantageous situation. It was better to be open and see how they responded.\nUnexpectedly, Canis took it well. Shirone’s group couldn’t know, but Canis and Arin urgently needed Shirone’s help.\n“Alright. But first, I need to verify something.”\n“Ask anything. If I know, I’ll tell you.”\n“Are you trying to get into the self-governing district because you want to learn about the Labyrinth of Time?”\nShirone’s eyes widened. The Labyrinth of Time was supposed to be a secret known only to his close friends and the headmaster.\n“How did you know? What do you know about the Labyrinth? Or about the Kergos Ruins?”\nAs Shirone pressed him, Canis leaned back casually.\n“Well, I suppose I know a bit more than you.”\nShirone pondered deeply. Where could they have gotten such information, and in such a short time?\nThen it hit him. The shadow under Canis’s feet, and the magical creature dwelling there, told him everything.\n“It’s Arcane’s knowledge, isn’t it?”\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

How could she have missed it? Harvest was a magical creature that inherited all of Arcane's memories.\nThe Archmage Victor Arcane, who once ruled the world.\nIf anyone knew the hidden secrets of the Kergos Ruins, it might be him.\nShirone and Amy looked at Canis with newfound certainty in their eyes. But Canis remained noncommittal.\n“Hmm, half of what you're thinking is correct and half is wrong.”“Half and half? What do you mean?”\nCanis hesitated. It wasn’t time to reveal everything. The secrets of the Kergos Ruins were much more serious than Shirone imagined.\nAmy leaned in closer and said,\n“Are you going to keep being vague? If you're going to tell us anyway, just do it now.”\n“I don’t understand. Why should I? You’re not seriously going to argue over the cost of a meal, are you?”\n“That’s part of it, but you’ll have to reveal more for another reason. You need us. If not, you wouldn’t bother negotiating.”\nCanis closed his mouth and took a deep breath. He had expected this outcome, but timing was crucial.\n“Fine. To be honest, I need something from you as well. In that sense, we both have what the other needs.”\n“What do you want from us? Are you talking about the pass?”\n“That can be easily solved. With mental magic, we can just hand over a piece of paper. Arin's mental resonance ability can control the realm of language.”\n“Oh, I see.”\nShirone understood why they could enter the altar without an interpreter.\n“Even so, we didn’t choose that route because one person must pass the trial gate. But as you know, we failed, and that's why we need your help. In that sense, I want to negotiate.”\nAmy analyzed Canis’s words. Then a random question struck her.\n“By the way, what score did you get?”\nCanis blinked at the unexpected question, then averted his gaze.\n“I don’t want to say.”\n“Oh, why not? How much did you get? Hm?”\n“Why should I tell you? If you want to know so badly, you tell me first.”\n“No, you first. Then I'll tell you.”\n“I refuse. You go first.”\nShirone, frustrated, interjected to prevent a never-ending loop.\n“Enough. Let's get back to the point.”\nBoth Amy and Canis promptly closed their mouths.\nWith the situation resolved, Canis, now more haggard, spoke again.\n“Anyway, what I propose is this: if you pass the trial gate, the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, then we can discuss further.”\nAmy frowned.\n“That’s a bit strange, isn't it?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“You failed the trial too. If Shirone passes, there’s no need to take you with us. You need to offer something to make the deal worth it.”\n“That may be true for now, but trust me, this deal won’t harm you.”\n“Then prove it. Even without revealing everything, you can show us. Otherwise, the deal is off. We can’t risk being used.”\nCanis glanced at Arin, unable to decide alone.\nAfter Arin gave her approval, he reluctantly spoke.\n“Fine. Here’s the deal. You’re trying to enter the self-governing district to learn about the Labyrinth, right? Is it imperative for you to get there?”\n“Yes. We want to understand the Labyrinth better.”\n“Then... my information might save your lives.”\nShirone’s heart pounded. Save their lives? What was in the self-governing district to warrant such a statement?\n“I’m telling you, without my information, approaching the Labyrinth of Time means you will almost certainly die, but if you team up with me, you might survive. Essentially, I’m trading your lives for this deal.”\n“What...!”\nAmy jumped to her feet, shouting.\n“Do you think threats will work? This isn’t proof. It’s just fearmongering. The Freeman Organization frequented that place. No matter how dangerous, it’s not a matter of life and death.”\n“I told you, the self-governing district itself isn’t dangerous. The problem is entering through the trial gate. And Shirone.”\nCanis turned to Shirone.\n“I know what you’re planning to do in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. You’re thinking of unlocking the Immortal Function in the Labyrinth of Time, right?”\nAll eyes were on Shirone. After a long silence, he finally spoke.\n“Yes. The structure of the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice was unique. I thought it was unnecessary to rotate the Labyrinth of Time in eight directions just to test a warrior’s prowess. The atmosphere was too serious for mere decoration. So, I suspected something else. I thought the Angel’s Eyes might be watching for something other than brute force.”\nCanis nodded approvingly.\n“For now, we can only hope that method works.”\n“What? You don’t know for sure?”\n“I said half and half. But I suspect it's related to the Immortal Function. It might be wrong, though.”\n“So, what do you want, Canis?”\n“Let’s discuss that after passing the trial gate. I’ve shared this much because you’re an Unlocker. I gave you substantial information, hoping you would succeed.”\n“Hmm, what should we do?”\nAmy nodded at Shirone. They had planned to attempt the trial gate before meeting Canis, so agreeing didn’t put them at a disadvantage.\nAmy gave directions to wrap up the situation.\n“Alright. Shirone, you go into the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. We’ll use the pass to enter the self-governing district. No problem, right?”\nAmy confirmed once more, emphasizing the importance of Canis’s offer.\n“No problem. The smuggling route is just a convenient way. Only one person needs to pass the Labyrinth of Time’s trial.”\nAmy’s head throbbed. She had a vague understanding but lacked clear information.\n“Sigh, I don’t understand any of this. If Shirone passes, we’ll figure it out. Let’s go now. If we leave now, we’ll be on time.”\nThe group left the pub and split into two. Amy's group merged with Canis’s, while Shirone headed alone to the altar.\n“Shirone, do your best, but don’t overdo it.”\nAmy was worried. Shirone had once opened the Immortal Function and nearly vanished forever.\n“Don’t worry. If it doesn’t work, I’ll give up. You be careful too. Unexpected things might happen.”\nTalk of life and death was unavoidable. Amy glanced at her party. Rian’s strength, Tess’s agility, Canis’s defense, and Arin’s mental skills—despite past animosities, she felt assured they would handle any crisis.\n“We should be fine.”\n“Haha! True. Our strength is reinforced.”\nAmy couldn’t laugh it off. Shirone sensed the task might be more dangerous than anticipated.\nAs Shirone left for the altar, Amy led her friends westward.\n“Arin, let’s go.”\nAs Amy’s group moved away, Canis looked back at Arin, who was staring at Shirone.\n“Arin? What’s wrong?”\n“Hey, Canis... Is Shirone blonde?”\nArin perceived things differently. She couldn’t merge the form and name of an object, making it difficult to distinguish real forms.\nSo identifying Shirone as blonde was unusual.\n“Shirone? Yes, he’s blonde. Why? How does he look to you?”\nArin blinked and then turned away.\n“No, it’s nothing. Let’s go.”\nCanis shrugged and followed Amy. Arin also walked quietly, lost in thought. Suddenly, she seemed to realize something and looked back.\n‘Ah, so that’s it. That child...’\nArin couldn’t take her eyes off Shirone for a long time.\n***\nShirone arrived at the western altar and approached the glaring native, reciting the password.\n“Kertia, Ro Hoima. Acrasia, Widmia Benjen.”\nThe native nodded and activated the mechanism to open the door. Entering the dark entrance, Shirone found a spiral staircase lit by torches.\nHe descended slowly. Though he had been here before, the atmosphere felt different alone.\nAt the bottom, familiar passageways appeared. Natives spoke to Shirone, guiding him.\nHe couldn’t understand them but guessed the context. It seemed to be ritualistic formalities requiring no further communication.\nPast the iron door at the end of the passage, the familiar sight appeared. The eight orbs floating in an octagonal pattern on the broad altar. The Labyrinth of Time, known as the Angel’s Eyes, awaited Shirone.\nThough the gatekeeper had changed, the man with the white face tattoo was the same as before. Or maybe not. Shirone couldn’t distinguish the faces of Kergosnians yet.\n“May I take the test?”\n“This is the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. The Angel’s Eight Eyes will judge you. To enter Kergos, you must pass the Labyrinth of Time.”\nAfter the man finished explaining, Shirone climbed the altar. Before testing the Immortal Function, he decided to strike the Labyrinth of Time with his laser.\nResolute, Shirone focused his laser ahead. The crimson light startled the stoic, tattooed man.\nWith all his might, Shirone fired the laser. The Labyrinth took longer than usual to display numbers, likely due to continuous impact.\nFinally, numbers appeared. The initial number Shirone saw was a mere 200. Then it began to change by the second, increasing steadily.\nFrom 400 to 782. From 1,311 to 2,643. It\neven soared past 4,874 to 6,822.\nHopeful, Shirone clenched his fist. But just then, the numbers reset, starting again at 72.\nThe Labyrinth seemed to have a time limit on energy accumulation. After two cycles, the final maximum score was 6,822.\nThe Labyrinth emitted a red glow, signaling Shirone’s failure.\n“Phew.”\nShirone exhaled dejectedly. The laser had an effect, but the Labyrinth anticipated energy accumulation and imposed restrictions.\nThe most frustrating part was that despite recording his highest score, he didn’t pass.\nShirone recalled Canis’s warning about potential death. What had the headmaster foreseen when permitting this exploration?\nAs he pondered, the tattooed man spoke sternly.\n“Will you leave or stay? If you want to prove your skill, pass the Labyrinth of Time.”\nShirone shook his head to dispel his fear. He couldn’t give up now. His friends were already in the self-governing district.\n“I’ll try once more.”\nThe man crossed his arms and waited. Assuming he had permission, Shirone positioned himself in the center of the altar.\nImmortal Function.\nIf this didn’t work, it was over. He didn’t know what Canis knew, but he was ready to give up if this failed.\n“Phew.”\nCalming himself, Shirone entered his Spirit Zone. His defensive zone expanded, enveloping the Labyrinth of Time in eight directions.\nAfter checking the boundaries of his Spirit Zone, Shirone opened the Immortal Function.\n“Gasp!”\nAn incredible event occurred.\nUncontrollably, his mental power surged, pouring into the Labyrinth of Time.\n‘Th-this...!’\nThe rate of absorption was astounding. Normally, his zone would have collapsed instantly. But as much power as was absorbed, equal force flowed from the infinite realm, barely maintaining balance.\nShirone feared losing control. It felt like his value was vanishing, turning him into a mere gate between two forces.\n‘No! Stay focused!’\nIf this continued, his consciousness would disintegrate. There would be no luck of reconstruction by the Labyrinth this time.\n“Ughhhh!”\nShirone maximized his defensive frame, pulling the zone taut. Despite the tension, the form remained due to the immense mental release.\nDesperately, he entered the Indomitable Diamond state, clinging on.\nHe couldn’t think. He only prayed for it to end quickly, for him not to disintegrate.\nAt that moment, the eight orbs of the Labyrinth shone brilliantly. Eight beams of light converged on Shirone, forming a white sphere around him, engulfing the altar.\n“Gasp!”\nShirone shuddered with intense deprivation. It felt like the first time he opened the Immortal Function.\n“O-Ohhhh!”\nThe natives, seeing Shirone enveloped in light, shouted in amazement.\nShirone’s body floated to the ceiling.\nIt was as if a vision unfolded. His eyes were unblinking, pupils trembling with shock, seeing something unknown.\nThe Labyrinth of Time, absorbing near-infinite mental power, conveyed information back to Shirone.\nIt was undoubtedly something the orbs could only reveal after absorbing their maximum capacity.\nThe natives screamed at the top of their lungs.\n“La! Anke! La!”\nA blinding light filled the room, forcing the natives to turn away and shut their eyes.\nWhen the light faded, Shirone stood on the altar, panting heavily.\n“Gasp! Gasp!”\nShirone struggled to regain his senses. He couldn’t even tell where he was.\nWhat had he seen? Was it real? Why had the Labyrinth created such a device and waited for an Unlocker?\n‘Was it an illusion? Or real? I have no idea. What does this have to do with the Immortal Function?’\nBreaking from his thoughts, Shirone looked around. Every native had knelt on one knee, heads bowed.\n“W-Why are you doing this?”\nShirone asked in a bewildered voice. The natives remained silent, holding their submissive posture.\nThe tattooed man looked up at Shirone and spoke.\n“Convey the will of Ra, messenger of the gods.”\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

This is Zis, the new liaison.\"\n\"Zis? Doesn't look like someone for this job.\"\nThe Kergonian quickly assessed his demeanor. Smuggling the loop was a serious crime, sometimes punishable by death.

As in deceased?\"\nThe native mimicked slitting his throat, and Zis nodded.\nThe native looked doubtful. Falcoa was strong and shared the Kergonian temperament. It was hard to believe that this gentle-looking Zis was his replacement.\n\"You have the pass, right?\"\n\"Of course. Here, take a look.\"\nThe native's smile vanished as he snatched the pass.\nAmy's group tensed up. They had thought the pass would be the end of it, but the native's suspicion was deeper than expected.\nMoreover, they weren’t there to buy the loop.\nFalcoa was dead, and there would be no more loop transactions. If the native found out, there could be serious consequences.\nThe pass was genuine.\nThe native's doubts couldn’t stand against the visible proof.\nHe led them to the mine cart.\nThe cart was large enough to accommodate all six of them. A seesaw lever system was set up to propel the cart.\nThe native grabbed the seesaw and started moving the cart.\nIt was usually a two-person job, and Rian tried to help, but the native's glare made him step back awkwardly.\nThe native's strength in moving the cart was impressive. However, it was over 20 kilometers to Toa Mountain. Using such force all the way would lead to exhaustion.\nThe tracks sloped downward, increasing the speed. They felt the air in their bellies drop.\nThe slope leveled out, but the speed didn’t decrease. The tracks were designed to maintain momentum with slight inclines.\nIt was clear they would reach the autonomous region faster than by carriage.\n\"Wow! This is insanely fast.\"\n\"Yeah, better hold on tight.\"\nThe cart wobbled severely. If it overturned at this speed, survival wasn’t guaranteed.\nAmy's group crouched down. The native muttered something under his breath, his lips twitching.\nThe noise made it hard to hear, but it was definitely not a compliment.\nAs the cart turned, one wheel seemed to lift off the track. Though the curve wasn’t sharp, the speed made it feel more dangerous.\nArin gripped the edge of the cart with one hand and pulled Canis’s collar with the other. As they entered a straight path, she asked Zis,\n\"When will we arrive?\"\n\"I don't know. Maybe another 20 minutes. It’s my first time here too.\"\n\"But you’ve heard about it, right?\"\n\"Not at all. As I said, this is a secret route even high-ranking members don’t know much about. Only Falcoa used it.\"\nArin estimated roughly 20 minutes. They needed time to explain her abilities to the group before reaching Toa Mountain.\nTelepathy magic was on the borderline of eavesdropping and confession.\nBy dominating someone with mental waves, she could penetrate their inner thoughts, but it risked revealing her abilities.\nIf her mental magic was discovered, its effectiveness diminished since the target would be more cautious.\nTherefore, she usually sent subtle mental waves to eavesdrop on surface thoughts unnoticed.\nShe extended her Spirit Zone into the native's shadow and connected five additional tendrils to everyone except Zis.\nPrepared, Arin asked the native,\n\"How much longer?\"\nHearing Kergonian, the native turned to her. If they were face-to-face, he might have noticed the discrepancy between her lip movements and speech, but Arin avoided such mistakes. The cart's noise and speed also distracted him.\n\"About 10 minutes, but we’ll need to go further after that. The slope is too steep for the cart.\"\nAmy's group was surprised to hear the translation, but their expressions didn’t change. They were skilled enough to hide their emotions.\nZis’s translation showed his skills weren’t that great. Arin’s telepathy was likely superior.\n-Arin, did you do this?\nAmy guessed because her red eyes had activated. The feeling of her Spirit Zone’s intrusion was barely perceptible, like a gentle breeze.\n-Yes, I linked the mental channel.\n-Can you read my thoughts?\nThe idea that Arin might read her deepest thoughts was horrifying.\nThankfully, Arin shook her head.\nAn archmage specializing in mental magic could easily dominate seniors, but even they couldn’t penetrate a mental construct.\nArin found Amy challenging because of her Red Eyes.\n-Don’t worry. This is like a tunnel. The mental field has 12 layers. This is the 11th layer, the surface psychology. Only filtered thoughts pass through, so I can’t read your inner mind.\n-What’s the 12th layer?\n-It's the layer above the surface, the realm of reason—forced smiles, pretense. If you resist strongly, the channel will break. But I’ll disconnect if you want.\n-No, it’s fine. Reading surface thoughts is convenient. Let’s keep this going.\n-Thank you. I didn’t include Zis. He’s an outsider, and revealing my abilities might expose us to enemies. Even if he’s trustworthy, reacting to my abilities could endanger us.\nWhen Arin opened the channel, Rian and Tess’s thoughts flowed in.\n-I want to say something! Why can’t I speak... Oh, I can now.\n-Me too. Tess, can you hear me?\n-Yes, I can hear you. This is amazing.\nAmy realized how useful Arin’s ability was. They could talk while looking in different directions, sharing numerous thoughts.\nThe unfamiliar magic was fascinating.\nDark magic was a minor field. Despite its versatility, it had critical weaknesses.\nDark attributes were weak to light.\nMoreover, mental magic struggled against those with higher mental strength.\nBut at Arcane’s level, it was different. Canis and Arin, as Arcane’s direct disciples in dark magic, were formidable.\n-Amazing. This will be really helpful. Oh!\nAmy checked Arin’s reaction. Her excitement had surfaced, revealing her thoughts.\nArin smiled in response. Despite Amy’s calculated thoughts, Arin was simply pleased.\nHuman minds are more self-centered and desire-driven than they show.\nHaving read such emotions all her life, Arin found Amy’s hidden goodwill nothing.\nTelepathy magic would be excellent in emergencies or battles. Canis and Arin’s joining was reassuring.\n-Haha, this is fun! Amy, isn’t that native annoying? He kept glancing at my chest.\n-Did he? I thought he was just ignoring us.\n-I’m getting hungry. I hope we can eat when we arrive.\nThe mental channel filled with chatter and complaints.\nUnfamiliar with magic, Rian and Tess pushed unnecessary thoughts through, trying to use the channel.\nSuch thoughts barely counted as thinking. It proved the saying that the environment controls the mind.\n-It’s so noisy. Arin, turn the volume down. Or just cut it off.\nAt Canis’s command, the channel’s volume dropped. It felt like whispers in the ear.\nIf they didn’t focus, they couldn’t hear, so conversation slowed.\nEnjoying the chat, Tess protested.\n-Why lower the volume? I can’t hear well. Turn it up.\n-Don’t use the channel for non-strategic talk. This isn’t a gossip corner. It’s Arin’s ability. You can’t just demand she adjust it.\nTess clicked her tongue but didn’t change her expression, staying alert.\nAs the chatter died, Arin explained why she showed her ability.\n-As you know, this is telepathy magic. I excluded Zis. Revealing my abilities to outsiders is risky, and even if he’s trustworthy, reacting to my abilities could expose us.\nZis could understand the native’s words, so they could pass quietly if they didn’t draw attention.\n-This ability is really convenient.\n-Heh, consider it one benefit of our alliance. Whether Shirone passes the trial or not, using Arin’s ability is crucial if we form a party.\nThough Canis’s pride in his partner was annoying, the ability was undeniably impressive.\n-And one more thing. I used telepathy because there’s something we haven’t told you.\n-Something you haven’t told us? What do you mean?\nAmy’s gaze sharpened. Even with the condition of Shirone’s success, unexpected changes in their temporary alliance weren’t welcome.\n-It’s nothing major. We didn’t hide it on purpose. We just didn’t think it was necessary. Anyway, Arin and I had another reason for attempting the trial. Contrary to your expectations, the Kergonian natives aren’t friendly to outsiders. They’re quite hostile.\nThis wasn’t entirely surprising. They hadn’t expected a warm welcome.\nBut they didn’t see a reason for hostility either.\nThe autonomous government and the Kergonian tribe coexisted, and many natives had adapted to civilization.\n-Their hostility stems from a mistake by the Gallian government. When they first came to the island 100 years ago, they promised significant rewards. The natives, recognizing the inevitable changes, agreed to negotiate. That started the tourism industry. Did you know the autonomous region was initially open to the public? But now, all exchange is cut off.\n-I see. My father faced strong resistance when he first went to the colonies. It’s understandable.\n-That’s part of it. But the Gallian government went too far. They were too excessive.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

So they devised a new venture: human tourism.\nSilence filled the mental channel.\nEveryone grasped the implications of \"human tourism.\"\nEspecially Tess, who had studied politics, understood the gravity of the situation between the Gallian government and the Kergonians.-They made the worst choice imaginable.\n-Right. The Gallian government went beyond exploiting the Kergonian ruins and culture; they turned the Kergonians into tourist attractions. This became publicly known much later. Initially, they had the natives stand by the roadsides for tourists to observe. Then, their possessiveness took over, leading to human hunting. Mercenaries captured Kergonian boys and girls and sold them to nobles at high prices.\n-It's a wonder a war didn’t break out.\n-It's the fate of those left behind by civilization. The Kergonians' military might wasn’t weak. In fact, they were not inferior to the Gallian government, but they couldn't match them in political maneuvering. Children were being kidnapped, the culprit clearly the Gallian government, but there was no evidence. They must have spent a lot of money to erase that evidence, yet human hunting was so profitable that it still paid off. They were powerless. Without concrete proof, they couldn’t confront them without risking the livelihoods of the natives who relied on tourism revenue. So, they had no choice but to agree. They opened the ruins to tourism but closed off access to the autonomous district. That's how they closed their doors and arrived at the present.\nAmy could deeply empathize with the plight of the Kergonians, who had no choice but to open their ruins while knowing their children were being sold to nobles.\nBut regardless of their circumstances, the situation had become dangerous. That was the crucial point.\nCanis had a similar reason for bringing it up.\n-But that’s not the main point. There are bad guys among the natives, which is why lupe is being smuggled. Regardless, the natives in the autonomous district won’t see us kindly. There may not be physical confrontations, but we must stay vigilant.\n-Isn’t Shirone in danger too?\n-No, she won’t be. The first reason Kergonia opened the ruins was for money, but that’s not all. The Room of Achievement and Sacrifice holds special meaning for them. They've been waiting for someone for a long time.\n-Who are they waiting for?\n-Perhaps... an angel?\n-An angel?\nAmy asked, but Canis did not answer.\nArin announced over the mental channel.\n-Sorry, but I need to conserve my mental strength, so I'll close the channel. Don’t be alarmed if we reconnect later.\nTelepathy consumed mental energy, especially when exchanging real-time information, like a firewall constantly eating away at the mind.\nAs the mental channel closed, Amy refocused on her surroundings. The sound of the tracks filled her ears as the mine cart disappeared into the darkness of the cave.\n***\nThey arrived at an underground city.\nWhile lacking sophisticated aesthetics, the network of tunnels and expanded chambers at intersections, resembling an ant colony, was an impressive achievement of coexistence with nature.\nAmy looked around with the curiosity of a tourist, but her excitement quickly turned to dismay.\nThe Kergonians lived in stark contrast to the scenic surroundings. Everyone was starved and emaciated. Their hostility towards outsiders, which Canis had mentioned, was more than justified.\nElderly refugees shuffled along the tunnels, and those unable to walk leaned against the earthen walls, cradling their grandchildren and closing their eyes.\nThe desolate scene felt like a silent scream. This was an ant colony, and they were the ants.\nElders carrying heavy loads staggered forward, while old women with bent backs wove baskets from tree bark in the corners.\n“Is this really the Kergonian autonomous district?”\nNo one answered Amy’s question. The expectation of a tribe owning valuable real estate like the ruins was utterly shattered.\nCanis felt a surge of unnamed anger as he held Arin’s trembling shoulders. She remembered their lives in the hellish city of Radum.\nThey both knew that starvation was the most excruciating suffering in the world. Thus, these people were the most tormented souls on earth.\n“Hey, come this way.”\nThe native who had driven the cart beckoned them. He clearly didn’t want outsiders seeing the current state of the Kergonians.\nThey followed a winding path and arrived at a blocked tunnel. Only a single torch on the wall illuminated the area.\nAmy glanced back. They had taken a long detour, so any commotion here wouldn’t be noticed outside.\nThe native led them to a man.\nWith his arms crossed and mouth set in a hard line, he looked every bit the true Kergonian warrior, fitting the description perfectly.\nHis upper body muscles were more developed than Rian’s, and his face was marked with dark tattoos. He wore earrings made from predator fangs on both ears.\nWhen Zis spoke to him, he introduced himself as Mahatu.\nAmy recalled hearing about Mahatu as a warrior’s name.\nThe name Mahatu, the warrior, matched his appearance and demeanor.\n“So, his name is Mahatu. He raises the lupe and delivers it to the temple.”\nAmy guessed that the black tattoos signified those who managed the lupe. If white was for those who performed rituals, then black must be for those who prepared them.\nSince Arin hadn’t attempted telepathy, Amy's group had to rely on Zis for translation.\nTess thought it was a wise choice. Judging by Mahatu’s temperament, he was no ordinary strongman. If he had a sensory schema, he might detect telepathy.\nAs they pondered this, Mahatu’s words suddenly made sense.\nWhen Amy looked back, Arin smiled.\n-So, you tried after all? That guy seems pretty strong. You’re bolder than you look.\n-No. I didn’t use telepathy on Mahatu.\n-What? Then how are we understanding him?\nArin subtly pointed at Zis.\nAmy realized that Arin had used telepathy on Zis.\nIf she only needed to eavesdrop on the surface thoughts, there was no need to contact the speaker directly. Another strength of Arin’s ability.\n“Falcoa is dead?”\n“Yes. The Freeman organization won’t buy the lupe anymore. They plan to leave the island soon.”\nZis spoke honestly. Meeting the chief, there was no way to hide the truth.\nAs expected, Mahatu's expression darkened. He glared at Amy's group before speaking.\n“Then who are they?”\n“Oh, they’re not here to buy the lupe. They have business in the district.”\n“Business? Besides lupe transactions, outsiders can’t enter here, don’t you know that?”\n“Yes, but we had to inform you about the transaction cancellation. And we have a pass...! Whoa!”\nMahatu shoved Zis aside and approached. His clenched jaw twitched, and his eyes blazed with anger.\nHe examined the group, focusing on Amy. Not because she seemed like the leader, but because she alone met his gaze defiantly.\n“Sent by the Freeman organization? So, are you a member?”\nZis rushed to translate. His sense of duty was commendable even in this tense situation.\nOf course, Amy understood through Arin’s telepathy. But she couldn’t reveal this, so she answered a beat late.\n“No. But we’re well acquainted with Freeman.”\n“How well? Enough to risk your life?”\n“Of course. We’ve actually done so.”\nLies came easily. They had indeed risked their lives fighting Freeman, so it wasn’t entirely false.\n“Then you can settle the outstanding payment.”\n“Outstanding payment? For what?”\n“Falcoa took 8 kilograms of the lupe recently, only paying a deposit. He couldn’t settle the balance.”\nAmy scoffed, picturing Falcoa’s boastful demeanor, only to find he was penny-pinching on credit.\nStill, if there was money owed, she had to ask.\n“We might not be close enough to lend money, but how much is the outstanding balance?”\n“10,000 gold.”\n“What? 10,000?”\nAmy's eyes widened. Zis also looked confused, unsure if he had heard correctly.\nBut Amy knew through Arin’s telepathy that it was indeed 10,000 gold.\nShe had thought the 8 kilograms of lupe were worth a lot. But 10,000 gold? And that was just the remaining balance, meaning the total was even higher.\nA question popped into her mind.\nFalcoa must have spent a fortune on the lupe over the past five years. How could the Kergonians' living conditions be explained then?\nSelling just 8 kilograms of lupe could feed the people in the plaza for a year. It made no sense.\nZis tried to negotiate with Mahatu.\n“I’ll report the outstanding balance to the organization. They’ll decide whether to return the lupe or settle the payment.”\nUnsure, Zis looked to his friends for approval.\nTess nodded. With Marsh and Freeman’s reputation, they would surely settle the balance.\nEmboldened by Tess’s support, Zis spoke confidently.\n“Alright then. We’ll pay the balance later, so let us stay here for now.”\n“I don’t understand. What’s your purpose here?”\nAmy answered.\n“We’re waiting for a friend. He entered the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. He should be here soon.”\nHer tone was harsher than before. Seeing Mahatu and Falcoa neglect their starving people infuriated her.\n“The Room of Achievement and Sacrifice?”\nMahatu scrutinized them closely. Assessing not their appearance but their demeanor, he sneered.\n“Such grand dreams. Give up and go back. Your friend is likely waiting for you outside.”\n“Hmph! How can you be so sure?”\n“Isn’t it obvious? That altar isn’t for brats like you. Many pretenders come seeking the Kergos ruins, hoping to buy the lupe or find gold. If your friend is at the altar, go back and check.”\n“You think you're so great? Do you know how many people have suffered from the lupe sold outside?”\n“The lupe is sacred. It’s you who abuse it as a drug. And I don’t care about foolish outsiders’ issues. You always judge and take what’s ours. But it won’t be so easy here.”\n“We’re not leaving until we confirm our friend’s success.”\n“With your skills, it’s impossible to pass. Reveal your true purpose.”\nThe cart driver spoke.\n“They might be thieves, looking to steal gold.”\nThere was no longer a false smile on the native's face. If it wasn’t about the lupe, then Amy’s group were the most hated outsiders, nobles.\n“That’s possible. All the more reason not to let them in.”\n“Should we search their bodies? If they brought weapons, they could harm our people.”\nMahatu didn’t want to touch a woman’s body, considering it dishonorable as a warrior.\nBut he didn’t speak because he knew what his companion meant.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Many women lost their purity under the guise of security inspections. No matter how twisted his comrade's hatred became, it was impossible to side with the outsiders.\n\"I will begin the inspection now. You, come here and raise your arms.\"\nAmy stood her ground, refusing and wary at the same time.\nIf the man had not been a master, she would have struck him the moment she was insulted. But his killing intent was unusual. If a fight broke out, it would cause chaos, and this was not a suitable place for such an act.\n\"This is too much to watch.\"\nRian stepped in front of Amy. Although Amy might be better at assessing the situation, if the opponent intended to humiliate a woman, it was right for him to step in.\"Even though Falcoa is dead, Freeman's organization remains strong. If you treat us like this, you won’t escape unscathed either.\"\nRian's strategy of leveraging Freeman's influence was clever. Amy also thought it was a good method.\nHowever, the Kergonians were more belligerent than expected.\nMahatu's face turned red, as if his reverse scale had been touched.\n\"Is this a challenge? Come at me as much as you want. Kergonians do not run away.\"\n-Everyone, step back. Mahatu is focusing his mind.\nArin informed them through the mental channel.\nBy the time she finished speaking, everyone could feel it. Even the usually insensitive Rian sensed the powerful aura.\nAmy aimed her Spirit Zone at Mahatu. Depending on how high Mahatu's killing intent soared, her combat strategy would be decided.\nBwooouuuu!\nAt that moment, a horn sound echoed from the other side of the cave.\nIt was loud enough to reach deep into the winding tunnel, giving a sense of its volume.\nAs the horn's sound spread throughout the cave, Mahatu looked at the entrance with surprised eyes.\nHis comrades' reactions were even more severe. They trembled as if they couldn't believe it.\n\"Mahatu, that's the horn of Jin-Gok. What in the world...?\"\nBefore his comrade could finish speaking, Mahatu leaped forward.\n\"Damn it! Why is the horn of Jin-Gok sounding? Has a war broken out?\"\nThe horn of Jin-Gok was the highest level of alert set by the Kergos tribe. Upon hearing this sound, all tribesmen must gather at the source of the sound immediately. There were no exceptions, and noncompliance would be punished.\nOnce the natives disappeared, Amy's group fell into confusion as well.\n\"What is this? Something must be happening outside.\"\n\"We should go check it out. It's dangerous to stay in a dead-end.\"\nAmy's group left the cave and headed towards the source of the sound.\nThey arrived at a massive plaza where seven tunnels converged.\nNatives were gathering, but there were so many that it was hard to see what was happening.\nThe noise of the crowd made it difficult to communicate. They hoped for a mental channel, but Arin was just staring at the platform.\n\"Kneel and worship! The messenger of the god who will save us has come!\"\nAn old man on the platform shouted. At his command, over a thousand people knelt and shouted in unison.\n\"We welcome the messenger of the god.\"\nThe crowd seemed to collapse, revealing the old man and Shirone standing in front of him.\nShirone's eyes met Amy's as he looked around. Although they had only been apart for two hours, he had experienced so many absurd situations that he could hardly contain his emotions.\n\"Amy.\"\nThe people who had been shouting for the god's messenger fell silent. The silence spread out in concentric circles, and some people looked at Amy.\nAmong them was Mahatu. Amy felt she would never forget the look of confusion on his face.\n\"Shirone.\"\nThe natives' gazes returned to Shirone, intent on not missing a single word from his mouth.\nShirone's face turned into a frown.\n\"Amy, what's with these people? I can't understand a word they're saying.\"\nSeeing Shirone almost on the verge of tears, Amy scratched her eyebrow.\nAnd she thought to herself.\nHow should I know?\n***\nAs Shirone moved forward, the crowd parted like bamboo being split. The fact that they moved in perfect unison even while bowing was a sign of their tension.\nShirone's face was haggard. Being exposed to an unknown language for two hours was exhausting.\nUsually, people give up on conversation if they can't understand the language, but the temple's executors never left Shirone alone for a moment.\n\"I was about to die from frustration. Every time I said something, they bowed, so I ended up not saying a single word. Why are these people acting like this towards me?\"\n\"I don't know. We just got here ourselves. Did you pass the test?\"\n\"Yeah, I think so, but there's a bit of a problem.\"\n\"A problem? What problem?\"\nExplaining the scene from the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice would take too long, and this wasn't a good time.\nThe old man who had blown the horn approached Shirone.\nFollowing behind the old man was Mahatu. His mind was in turmoil. If Shirone was indeed the god's messenger, it meant he had opened all eight dimensions of the Mirror of Time, but seeing a fluffy-haired boy was shocking.\n-Absolute obedience to the god's messenger.\nThis was something he had heard countless times since childhood.\nUnlike the religious beliefs of outsiders, for Kergonians, the god was a real power to be obeyed like subjects to a king.\nMahatu quickened his pace and approached Shirone. If he was indeed the god's messenger, Mahatu had to atone for the rudeness shown to Amy's group before facing the old man.\n\"Revered god's messenger, forgive my presumption, but are these people your comrades?\"\nAs Zis approached to translate, Mahatu raised his hand to stop him.\n\"No, if there's someone using mental magic, let them enable me to communicate with the god's messenger directly.\"\nMahatu realized this when Amy's voice had grown louder.\nUsually, when talking through an interpreter, speech becomes simple and short, but some parts seemed to be understood quite accurately in Kergosian.\nArin's Spirit Zone permeated Mahatu's shadow.\nShirone was startled by the voice echoing in his head but quickly understood what was happening and nodded.\nMahatu, understanding that they were ready, repeated his question.\n\"God's messenger, are these people your comrades?\"\n\"Yes. They are my friends.\"\nMahatu nodded heavily. He wasn't afraid of dying, but offending the god's messenger's friends was a mistake that could endanger the entire tribe's fate.\nThe downfall of Kergos wasn't due to the lupe uprising or the volcanic eruption. Officially, that's what was said, but the hidden truth was that no one knew.\nKergonians had angered an angel.\nAnd the boy standing before him was the descendant of that angel.\nThe 500-year-old tale passed down through generations was deeply rooted in the subconscious fear of the current Kergonians.\nMahatu's expression changed from defeat to fear, and then, as if he had made up his mind, he resumed his original expression, knelt deeply, and shouted.\n\"Forgive me! Please kill me! I have greatly offended your comrades!\"\n\"Offended? How did you offend them? You didn't use violence, did you?\"\nShirone's vigilance triggered by their almost fanatical behavior, made him snap. He wouldn't forgive them if they had harmed his friends.\n\"Oh, it's nothing much. Just a little skirmish. You know, the kind we usually have.\"\nAmy's words were almost like slang. There had indeed been a conflict, but the situation was complicated, and she hoped they could move past it.\nMahatu looked up at Amy gratefully. Relieved that he hadn't jeopardized his race, he stepped back and made way for the old man.\nIntroducing himself as Hashid, an elder of the Kergos tribe, the old man posed a meaningful question to Shirone.\n\"Did you come with the message from Lord Miro?\"\nShirone recalled the scene from the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. Although it had passed quickly, each fragment of information was vivid.\nWhen Shirone nodded, the elder turned and leaned on his staff.\nThe gathered natives awaited his answer.\n\"At last, the god's messenger has come to Kergos!\"\nShirone's group covered their ears. As soon as Hashid finished speaking, the natives roared like warriors.\nThe cave echoed with sound, threatening to burst the ceiling.\nAmidst the cries of joy, the sound of weeping occasionally mixed in. Barefooted people approached and knelt before Shirone.\n\"God's messenger, my child is sick. Please heal them.\"\nWith Arin's channel connected to Mahatu, she could understand the woman's plea. But Shirone didn't have the ability to heal the sick.\nA nearby old man, crawling on his knees, held out his hands, begging.\n\"Please give us food! My family is starving.\"\nThis started a chain reaction as more people arrived.\n\"Grant me eternal life!\"\n\"Please spare my daughter Atore! She has a fiancé!\"\n\"Make me a woman!\"\nArin, unable to bear the cacophony, covered her eyes as well. The sight conveyed through her telepathy was so saturated with red it was like watching boiling lava. If she absorbed any more of the people's desperation, her mind would collapse.\n\"Canis! The voices are too loud!\"\n\"Close the channel. You might get hurt.\"\nShirone, trapped by the crowd, couldn't move. Though Arin canceled her telepathy, making translation impossible, the emotional waves continued to press against her heart. It felt like collective hypnosis. The key emotion was madness.\nShirone looked to Hashid and Mahatu for help, but they could only look at their kin with sorrowful eyes.\n\"Everyone, be silent!\"\nA man's shout cut through the noise, bringing instant silence.\nA young man accompanied by burly warriors walked from the northern tunnel. Though not tall, his bulging muscles overwhelmed even his guards. His long hair was tied back, and his face bore golden tattoos.\nArin finally opened her eyes.\nThe emotions she perceived through her telepathy were of reverence.\nBut that wasn't all.\nThere was also fear. The emotion was typical of someone facing an iron-fisted ruler. The man was undoubtedly the leader of Kergos.\nIntroducing himself, the man approached Shirone.\n\"I am Kadum, chieftain of Kergos. I will take care of you from now on.\"\nShirone consulted his friends.\nNo one opposed. To achieve anything in the self-governing district, they had to meet this person at least once.\nAnd this marked the end of Zis's task.\nShirone, showing his regret, spoke.\n\"We'll handle it from here. It might be dangerous.\"\nZis nodded without showing any discomfort. It was his lack of unnecessary pride that made Shirone's group trust him.\nAs they shook hands, Zis spoke with concern.\n\"Be careful. The self-governing district seems very different from the Kergos I know.\"\n\"Yeah. There won't be any trouble. Thanks for translating.\"\n\"I'm glad I could help. Once this is over, come to my house. Yuna and I will have plenty of good food ready.\"\nShirone requested Kadum to escort Zis to the ruins. Several people eagerly volunteered to guide Shirone, wanting to follow his orders. Arin picked someone trustworthy.\nZis left the self-governing district with a large warrior.\nKadum led Shirone's group into the cave.\nEven after walking for 20 minutes, they hadn't reached their destination. If this path were a dead-end, any traveler would have collapsed by now.\nA maze doesn't just involve complex design. The scale of the self-governing district's labyrinth was overwhelming.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

As the taste of the air changed, they emerged onto a mid-tier level of the stepped altar.\nThe jungle of Toa Mountain sprawled beneath their feet.\nThe forest, seen from 20 meters above sea level, was vast, with occasional glimpses of Kergos villages.\nTurning to the opposite side of the altar, a golden palace came into view. It was the residence of Kergos’s chief. Upon entering the palace, a long hall with two rows of tables was laid out.\nShirone sat at the head table, with Amy, Rian, Tess, Canis, and Arin seated to his right in that order.On the left sat Chief Kadum and the elders. Hashid, who had blown the horn, was not present. At the end of the table, Mahatu’s presence indicated his high rank.\nMusic played, and traditional Kergos food was served. Before they could taste it, warriors entered in pairs, carrying large chests.\nThe warriors opened the chests, revealing an immense pile of gold coins and jewels.\n“What is this?” Shirone asked.\n“It’s a humble gift from Kergos. Please accept it.”\nThe value exceeded countable amounts and had to be measured by weight. The combined weight of the five chests was at least a ton.\nAmy put down her food with a displeased expression.\nThis was not income from the ruins. It was money earned from smuggling lupe. That amount of money could feed the entire tribe and more.\n“Shirone, you’re not thinking of accepting this, are you?”\n“We can’t accept such a large sum without knowing the reason. They wouldn’t just give it for nothing.”\nAs Shirone demanded an explanation, Kadum’s expression changed.\nEven a saint would be affected by seeing over a ton of gold coins. However, Shirone reacted as if the gold was just rocks.\nShirone was not indifferent to wealth, but he wasn’t foolish enough to covet something that wasn’t his.\nKadum did not appear flustered. Instead of explaining, he clapped, and a second tribute was brought in.\nHe was confident that no one could refuse this.\nMen with white tattoos on their faces, like the one in the room of achievement and sacrifice, entered. Shirone assumed they were priests.\nWhen they stepped aside, a dozen young and beautiful Kergos women entered.\nThe boys, including Shirone, stared in shock. It was a sight they rarely encountered at their age.\nThe nearly naked women approached, dancing sensually.\nFrom a distance, the dance appeared elegant, but up close, it was intensely provocative. The women's eyes were glazed, indicating they were in a trance.\n“How do you like it? These are the most beautiful priestesses of Kergos. They are the second tribute for the messenger of the gods. I hope you are pleased.”\nShirone felt the heat from his side. Without turning, he knew what expression Amy had.\nKadum’s goodwill backfired.\nThough the priestesses' dance was enchanting, to Shirone, they seemed like women writhing under the influence of lupe.\nUnprovoked kindness often felt like a threat, and Shirone's mind grew cold as he analyzed Kadum's intentions.\nKadum began to worry as Shirone’s reaction remained firm.\nAn Unlocker’s spirit was superior to an ordinary person’s, but they were not saints. Immortal Function was a process towards enlightenment, not a state of nirvana.\nSomeone truly free from the five desires and seven emotions wouldn’t have ventured into the room of achievement and sacrifice. Kadum couldn’t discern what Shirone wanted.\n“I must have been mistaken. I thought you would be pleased. This is my first time welcoming a messenger of the gods, so I simply followed tradition.”\nShirone found his words even more distasteful. What kind of debauchery had Unlockers engaged in for such a tradition to exist?\n“Did they enjoy such things?”\n“According to records, they did not dislike them. But don’t misunderstand. There is no ulterior motive; it’s merely tradition. Kergos is a tribal society, but the priests hold great power. Priests are divided into sages and warriors, and among the sages, the women become priestesses. According to Kergos’s rules, priestesses must be beautiful and remain chaste throughout their lives. However, to conceive a child of an angel, they can sleep with someone once. These priestesses are prepared to give everything for Shirone, the descendant of an angel.”\n“If I accept these women, what must I do?”\nA chief wouldn’t make such a sacrifice without expecting something in return. Traditions arose from necessity.\nThe amount of gold could feed the entire tribe. Additionally, the women dancing for Shirone’s favor were potential future mothers who could increase Kergos’s population. Essentially, they were offering Shirone the tribe’s wealth and future.\n“Kergosians are the children of the great Ra. The descendants of angels are the only ones who can connect the Kergos tribe with the gods. Please convey our faith to the gods.”\n“By gods, do you mean Aker?”\n“Aker, Ra. It means the eternal Ra. He has existed since the beginning and created us. With his great power, he still watches over us.”\nStripping away the religious context, it was a proposal of trade.\nThey would receive gold and women in exchange for delivering the tribe’s wishes to the gods. The method was unclear, but it was evidently linked to Immortal Function.\nThe mental channel buzzed with discussions about accepting the offer.\nTess was against it. Beyond the money, she couldn’t imagine Shirone sleeping with another woman while being with Amy.\nSurprisingly, Amy supported accepting the offer, and Shirone agreed.\n“Shirone! How could you? I trusted you, even though they say all men are beasts.”\n“Calm down. Shirone must have a reason. Amy agreed too.”\n“Ridiculous! Rian, are you siding with Shirone because you’re a man? I’ll never agree. Amy, say something. Aren’t you annoyed?”\n“Of course, I’m annoyed. It’s upsetting that the tribe starves while they throw feasts. But Shirone can control that. What’s important is gathering more information, so we should agree.”\nWhile Shirone’s group exchanged thoughts, an elderly man with white hair entered. It was Elder Hashid, who had blown the horn. His eyes, filled with veins, glared at the elders engrossed in the feast.\nMahatu stood up respectfully as Hashid approached.\n“You’re here, Elder.”\n“Such foolishness. What is this madness?”\nAs the music stopped, the dancing girls collapsed in exhaustion.\nHashid, leaning on his cane, approached Shirone.\nKadum spoke in a high-handed tone, blocking his path.\n“What are you doing, Father? Ruining a sacred banquet?”\n“Sacred banquet? Our people are starving to death while you waste money on this nonsense. The tribe will perish if this continues!”\n“It’s astonishing to hear such heresy from a former chief and honorable elder. Can I quote your words at the council?”\n“You mustn’t. The tribe is hopeful because of the arrival of the messenger, but that’s all. They seek happiness, not the messenger.”\n“I’ve heard your opinion, Elder. Regardless, I am the chief. Kergos will be revived by the grace of the gods. We will restore the glory of our ancient civilization, not hide in the mountains fearing outsiders!”\nHashid clicked his tongue and turned away, twitching his beard.\nKadum was the chief, and escalating the conflict in front of the elders could lead to another civil war like the one 500 years ago.\nAs the atmosphere settled, the elders quietly left, and the banquet ended.\nKadum led Shirone and his group to the top of the altar. The rooftop was spacious, with a 7-meter-high statue on the north side. The moonlit giant was imposing.\nKadum stood by the statue, gazing at the night sky.\nCountless stars twinkled.\nBut he focused on one.\n“Do you see that cluster of stars in the northern sky? Connect them into an 8, then find the brightest star at the intersection of the two circles.”\nThey followed him, reluctantly spending time identifying the star Kadum pointed out.\nThen Kadum made a shocking statement.\n“That star is Kergos’s homeland.”\n“What? Homeland?”\nTo Shirone, homeland meant the place of birth. It was not some distant point in the night sky.\n“Kergonians know that the god who created us lives there. We are born and die here, but our souls fly to that star. We call it heaven.”\nShirone felt puzzled.\nHeaven was an abstract place, not a tourist spot to be pointed out to a traveler.\n“I don’t understand. Why is that star heaven?”\n“You don’t believe in gods, do you, Shirone?”\nShirone neither believed nor disbelieved in gods.\nA mage’s thinking did not draw clear conclusions about the unprovable.\nTo Shirone, gods were beings whose existence could neither be confirmed nor denied.\n“Kergos’s creation myth includes this story. It’s a prehistorical myth. In the beginning, there was a giant, and humans were born from the giant’s flesh and blood. The first human was Garok, who lived for 782 years. His child Deris lived for 982 years, and his son Tessus lived for 1,320 years.”\nRa’s creation myth wasn’t much different from other religious myths.\nSome scholars suggested that the lifespans in prehistorical stories represented the duration of a family's rule.\nFor instance, if a family flourished for 13 generations, the myth would speak of a single figure living for a thousand years.\nIt was a plausible theory.\nEven in the Kingdom of Thormia, the king's name was passed down through generations. The current king was Adolph XII.\nKadum recited the lifespans of unfamiliar names as if showcasing his memorization skills.\nAfter the mythical era, he moved on to historical times.\n“Two thousand years ago, the sage Hannes established civilization here. From then on, we were embraced by Ra. You might wonder why we haven’t restored the Kergos ruins buried in volcanic ash.”\nShirone recalled the thick barrier in the middle layer of the ruins that even Amy’s sniper mode couldn’t penetrate.\n“There are many ancient ruins worldwide, and this place is one of them. But there’s a hidden fact unknown to the public. Long ago, our ancestors seemed to travel freely between earth and heaven. The underground facilities of the ruins prove this.”\n“What exactly is underground?”\nBy now, Shirone couldn’t bear not knowing.\nKadum stared into Shirone’s curious eyes and said,\n“Underground, there is a gate that leads to heaven.”\nIt felt like being struck by a hammer. Heaven? Did he mean the star in the northern sky?\nThat place was in space.\nIt was an unreachable distance for humans.\n“Are you saying there’s a way to reach where the gods are?”\n“Yes, exactly.”\nA thought struck Shirone. Was Kadum a madman, or was he telling the truth?\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

The only ones who showed no change in emotion were Canis and Arin.\n\"The reason we can't open the Kergos Autonomous Zone. The only one who can open the door underground is someone who has inherited the power of an angel. That’s why we’ve been waiting for you.\"\nThe door to heaven. It wasn’t a nonsensical claim. Shirone had experienced going to the space-time of the labyrinth through the Immortal Function.\nHowever, this time, the scale was different. The world created by a mage was different from heaven. Kadum was talking about the place where God resided.\n\"Long ago, angels served as intermediaries connecting gods and humans. They transcended time and space to convey the will of the gods. We know that an Unlocker is someone who has inherited the power of an angel. Please, restore the glory of Kergo. The tribe is prepared to make any sacrifice for it.\"\nShirone couldn’t answer. They were asking him to meet God. What could he possibly do by going to a star in the sky?\"Kergos has faced countless crises. The disaster of a volcanic eruption and even a civil war. We’ve also suffered humiliation from outsiders. The tribe is on the brink of destruction. Our people are starving. But we believe that the descendant of an angel will revive Kergos”\nAmy pointed a finger and asked.\n\"Why don't you just buy food? Depending on faith in a situation where you can be self-sufficient is like gambling with your life. We know that the profits from Loop smuggling are astronomical.\"\n\"Kergos’s situation is worse than you know. The income from the relics we share with the Galiant government can’t feed twenty thousand people. Even if we sustain ourselves by selling Lupe, we will be overrun by outsiders as we were a hundred years ago. As the chieftain, I’ve saved a great fortune while praying for God’s blessing.\"\n\"No matter what, using money and women to persuade a divine messenger—did you really think that would work?\"\n\"I don't know about that. I was merely searching for a method through the records. According to Kergos’s history, a divine messenger once demanded a hundred million gold as a condition for going to heaven.\"\nShirone was astonished to hear that someone had already been to heaven. Moreover, demanding a hundred million gold—it was something only someone who valued money more than life would do.\nOr perhaps, it was someone so skilled that they were unafraid of going to heaven. But was that even possible?\n\"What happened to that person? Did they return safely?\"\n\"Of course. Two hundred years ago, the divine messenger left for heaven with their companions and came back, having received the will of the great Ra.\"\n\"How did they return? Did they come out through the entrance?\"\n\"That’s impossible. As you might guess, the door to heaven operates with the Immortal Function. The door makes the Immortal Function possible. But since there is no medium in heaven to activate the Immortal Function, another method must be used to return.\"\n\"What method?\"\n\"I don’t know. The records only state that they said it wasn’t a profitable venture when they returned.\"\nSilence fell.\nIf the powerful beings who traversed the unknown space where God existed said it wasn’t profitable, it meant returning by their own power was impossible.\nShirone finally understood Canis's words. Not being able to return was a more serious problem than death in some ways.\nThis wasn’t about setting sail for a distant land. It was about passing through space-time to reach a star somewhere.\n\"I’m speaking honestly. I know it’s dangerous. But the fate of the tribe is at stake. If you help Kergos, we will do everything we can. If you want gold, we’ll give it to you. If you want women of Kergos….”\n\"No, I don’t want anything. I don’t think I can accept any reward.\"\nWhile they had agreed to listen at the banquet, the situation had changed.\nFrankly, no amount of money would change his mind. But... the intense curiosity that rivaled the fear of death stirred within him.\nShirone, having thought of the best answer, spoke without needing to ask his friends' opinions.\n\"I’ll think about it.\"\n***\nLeft alone at the altar, Kadum stared at the stars.\nThe servile look he had shown to Shirone's party was gone. Standing with his chin raised, befitting the ruler of Toa Mountain, he sensed someone approaching and turned his gaze.\nAn old man coughed as he walked up from the entrance of the altar. It was Elder Hashid.\n\"Are you really going to send them?\"\nKadum's expression twisted as Hashid addressed him with respect.\n\"Father, it's not appropriate to speak to your son that way.\"\n\"Son? You know my son is no longer in this world, Father.\"\nIt was a strange situation where they both called each other \"Father.\" Of course, it was even more bizarre for the elderly Hashid to call the robust Kadum \"Father.\"\nKadum revealed his true nature. The gleam in his eyes hinted at the wisdom of someone who had lived for over two hundred years.\n\"Hmph, do you still misunderstand? Kadum’s death was an accident. I didn’t kill him.\"\n\"Of course, you would say that. But if my son hadn’t died, the man named Kang wouldn’t have borrowed Kadum’s name to become the chieftain again.\"\nKadum turned to face Hashid.\n\"What are you trying to say?\"\n\"Father, they won’t succeed. Even if that boy is a divine messenger, he won’t bring back what our tribe desires.\"\n\"It doesn’t matter. The wealth will remain here anyway. If they bring back what we want, it’s worth any amount. If they fail, we’ll just dispose of them. Everything is for Kergo.\"\n\"Is that so? Two hundred years ago, you gained three hundred years of life through a divine messenger. That has nothing to do with Kergos, does it?\"\nHashid glared at Kadum with contempt.\nWhile the son was old and frail, struggling to even walk, the father enjoyed youth with a muscular and sleek body.\nSince gaining three hundred years of life, the chieftain had gone wild. He searched for Unlockers across the land and spent a vast fortune. When the tribe’s wealth dwindled, he even sold Lupe to outsiders.\nIn a way, it was understandable.\nImmortality. Eternal youth. What wouldn’t someone give for that?\n\"Isn’t it enough already? Since that day, many Unlockers have left but not one has returned. Obsessing over immortality makes you lose your humanity. Lady Miro realized this early and issued a warning.\"\n\"Silence! No one can lead the tribe as strongly as I can. Have you forgotten how miserable Kergos was when you were the chieftain? You’re just a failed leader. Kergos needs me. I am Kergos itself!\"\nHashid could say nothing as he watched Kadum howl at the sky.\nFather was strong. He was a two-hundred-year-old serpent with formidable strength. As he boasted, he might indeed revive the tribe.\nBut perhaps... he would be the last, and Kergos would vanish from the world.\n***\nShirone's party headed to their lodging.\nThe cave stretching northwest from the square was complex, but to Shirone, who frequented Estas like his own home, it was just a bothersome maze with many forks.\nThe lodging was a large room with a bed they hadn’t expected. There was even a cabinet next to the bed.\nIt was a room for outsiders. How many people had stayed here until now? Had they left for heaven? Or had they disappeared from the world?\nThe chieftain’s words were so shocking that everyone was silent even after they reached their lodging.\nAfter unpacking and organizing in the cabinet, they turned to Canis. Divine messenger, heaven, the situation in Kergos. Now it was his turn to explain what he knew.\n\"I kept my promise. Now, explain.\"\n\"It’s just as you heard.\"\nAmy sat next to Shirone, facing Canis.\n\"Heaven? Does such a place really exist? When did you find out?\"\n\"Honestly, I’m not sure either. Besides, it seems faster to ask Shirone about that. Hashid asked you. What did you see in the space-time of the labyrinth?\"\nAmy turned to Shirone and asked.\n\"Right, Shirone, tell us. What did you see?\"\n\"It’s not what, but where.\"\nCanis’s guess was accurate. Shirone nodded and continued.\n\"Yes. It was a place.\"\nThere was a sea and a forest. At the center of a city surrounded by circular walls, there was a spire.\nShirone had been drawn into the light at the top of the spire and, before he knew it, he was back at the altar.\n\"That’s everything I saw. If that place is heaven, then Kadum’s story isn’t absurd. So, before deciding, I want to hear Canis's side. What do you know?\"\nHarvest, who was standing guard at the door, turned to Canis. Usually foul-mouthed, he was now silent.\n\"My master, Arcane... I think he had been to a place called heaven.\"\nShirone got up from the bed.\nArcane had been to heaven. Considering he had secluded himself in a dungeon for fifty years after being betrayed by Alpheas, it must have been long ago.\n\"Arcane also came to the Kergos ruins?\"\n\"No, it must have been somewhere else. According to Kadum, relics around the world are somehow connected to heaven. Though they are controlled by their respective nations now, they weren’t even known to exist eighty years ago. In that sense, the Kergos ruins are unique.\"\nEighty years ago, Arcane would have been only sixty. Although not a young age by human standards, considering how powerful the 149-year-old Arcane was, he would have been in his prime.\n\"What’s in heaven? What kind of place is it?\"\n\"I don’t know.\"\nShirone narrowed his eyes.\nSaying he didn’t know didn’t make sense. If Arcane experienced heaven, Canis should know about it. Harvest inherited Arcane’s knowledge, after all.\nHarvest added.\n\"Canis is telling the truth. Arcane erased his memories of heaven. The only fact we know is that he had been there.\"\n\"He erased his own memories?\"\n\"Yes. Completely erased. So we don’t know what he did there. It seems he didn’t want the world to know about heaven.\"\nKnowing Arcane’s character, Shirone couldn’t believe it. What secret was so significant that an archmage, acknowledged worldwide, had to erase his memory to hide it?\n\"Canis, what is heaven? Is it really a place where God lives?\"\n\"Nothing is certain. That’s why we have to go. I need to see it with my own eyes. So, take me there.\"\n\"No, I’ve changed my mind. You were right. It’s too dangerous. It’s not a place to go out of curiosity.\"\n\"No, your thoughts don’t matter. The deal I proposed was to take me and Arin there. No matter what, we will enter heaven.\"\n\"Honestly, I don’t want to send you either. Once you enter, you can’t return through the original door. Besides, if I don’t go, they won’t allow you to use the door to heaven. The chieftain seemed desperate.\"\nShirone was right. Judging by the difficulty of the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, what the Kergosians wanted wasn't something trivial.\nOnly those who could prove their strength in the space-time of the labyrinth or open all eight doors simultaneously could enter the self-governing district, let alone the door to heaven.\n\"Canis, it's time to bring it out. If Shirone doesn't go, we can’t get to heaven either.\"\n\"But it's surprising. I didn't expect him to be this scared.\"\n\"You could see it as insight. His intuition seems to move based on the information he's heard. Anyway, let's get started.\"\nAccepting Harvest's opinion, Canis looked at everyone. He subtly extended his hand and began to speak.\n\"What if I told you... there’s a way to come back from there?\"\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

This was a new phase.\nThe reason Shirone recognized heaven as dangerous was due to the low probability of returning. But if there was an escape route, the story changed.\n\"Tell me in detail. What’s this way to return?\"\n\"As you know, the wealth our master left us was confiscated by the Magic Association. We were left on the streets. We didn’t want to seek help from Alpheas either. While we were figuring out what to do, Harvest recalled an old memory. While you were at school, Arin and I traveled. We discovered a secret place that Archmage Viltor Arcane never wanted to reveal. Since he erased his memory, even the Magic Association couldn't find it.\"\n\"So, this secret place has a way to return from there?\"\n\"No. It’s more than that. I’ll show you.\"Arin took out a cubic box from her pocket.\nIt was engraved with patterns in relief and intaglio. It was almost black, but it reflected a rainbow-like light depending on the direction of the incoming light. It had seams like a cube, suggesting it could be turned by hand.\nTess had never seen the object Arin was holding. However, she had heard countless times about the iridescent hues and inimitable patterns.\n\"That's an ancient artifact. Made of a metal that doesn’t exist in this world, its surface is engraved with magical patterns. I’ve heard it can’t be used without unlocking a powerful seal. Am I right?\"\n\"Yes. And the seal is already broken. It can be used right now.\"\nTess's eyes sparkled.\nThe Elzain family collected information on ancient weapons because of their immense power that could destabilize nations.\nTo her knowledge, unsealing an ancient artifact was internationally forbidden. If any country were to unlock such an artifact, it would be tantamount to declaring war on the world.\n\"Can I take a look?\"\nWhen Shirone asked, Arin handed him the artifact. The friends gathered around Shirone's bed.\nShirone rubbed the surface and examined the seams. As he turned it, something triggered, and the cube split along the centerline, revealing a glass tube inside.\nSurprised, Shirone pressed on the cube, but it seemed fixed and wouldn’t close.\nIndecipherable characters floated inside the glass tube. There was no way to know what it was used for, and the possibility of an explosion couldn't be ruled out.\n\"Wow, it's beautiful.\"\nOn the other hand, Tess's eyes sparkled. Growing up hearing stories about artifacts instead of fairy tales, her heart raced with excitement.\nReceiving the cube from Shirone, she asked Canis.\n\"But what is this used for? I can’t figure out how to use it.\"\n\"I don't know the details either. Arin found it. Here, toss it over.\"\nTess carefully passed the cube, while Canis casually threw it to Arin, who handled it without any tension, suggesting she had already experimented with it.\nWatching Arin manipulate the cube, Shirone realized that she hadn’t just stumbled upon its use by luck.\nMost people, upon seeing an ancient artifact for the first time, would base their assumptions on familiar objects. Shirone thought of cubes and bombs. However, free from such constraints, she was able to identify its unique features.\nRealizing the artifact's extraordinary power, Shirone listened intently to Arin's explanation.\n\"I don't know why, but pressing certain parts activates it. Like this... and then pressing here should do it.\"\nRed light shot out from the glass tube, staining the room as if with blood. Amy covered her face with a pillow and screamed.\n\"What is it? Is it going to explode?\"\nShe peeked over the pillow, ready for anything.\nThe beeping sound accelerated, then turned into a hum as the red light faded.\nArin picked up the ancient artifact and pointed to the spot where the cube had been.\n\"This is the spatial input. It remembers where the cube was placed. Now, let’s try again.\"\nWhen Arin manipulated the cube, the glass tube emitted a blue light this time.\nShe looked around for an appropriate spot and placed the artifact near Shirone.\nThe tube turned white, and a large black sphere materialized in the air. A similar sphere appeared at the spot Arin had pointed to earlier.\n\"Oh, this is?\"\nShirone was astonished.\nIt was the black hole he had seen in the space-time of the labyrinth. The ability to compress space and pierce through it. The purpose of this ability was clear.\n\"Now I get it. It’s a portal. A portal that pierces through space-time.\"\n\"Exactly. It’s a device called the Metagate. This will be our secret weapon. Let’s demonstrate with Harvest first.\"\nCanis knew no one would volunteer to jump into the black sphere. Harvest, being lifeless, was perfect for the experiment.\nWhen Harvest put his hand into the black hole, it emerged from the other black hole.\nAmy and Tess leaped onto the bed.\nThe distance between the portals was three meters. Harvest was stretched across three meters, with parts of his body in each portal. If they had used a person, it would have been an even more bizarre sight.\n\"Heh, heh, heh, this is fun every time.\"\n\"Harvest, it’s dangerous. Come out now.\"\nArin spoke worriedly. According to their experiments, the portal lasted one minute.\nWhen Harvest withdrew and the portal disappeared, Canis picked up the cube again and spoke proudly.\n\"What do you think? It’s a warp device that connects space-time by remembering a specific point. If we remember this location and use it in heaven, we can return anytime.\"\nAs the impossible became possible, a wave of emotion swept through Shirone's party.\nTess, with a trembling voice of awe, said.\n\"This is... incredible.\"\nOnly an Archmage like Arcane, who risked his life to visit heaven, could possess such an ancient artifact. That alone was a top national secret.\nThe most astounding fact was that the seal was broken.\nIf the existence of this artifact were revealed, it would undoubtedly cause diplomatic friction.\nIt wasn’t like the magic circle used by the Parrot Mercenary Band.\nWhat if a spy infiltrated the royal palace and activated the Metagate? An army would pour in, threatening to overthrow the kingdom. Such was the power of an ancient artifact.\nAmy reached the same conclusion. Its use aside, its monetary value was unimaginable.\nNo matter how much Arcane’s legacy had been left to Canis, this one item would be worth several times more.\n\"Could we... sell this?\"\nShe knew it was a ridiculous thought but was curious nonetheless.\nFrankly, she was dying to know. A hundred billion? A trillion? If they could sell it, her twelfth-generation granddaughter would bow before Amy's portrait every night. She began to understand why Canis had kept it a secret.\nTess considered it seriously. As if appraising an item, she examined the Metagate and shook her head.\n\"Honestly, no one can buy this. At the very least, it would have to be a national entity. The impact would be tremendous. Aside from nations, the most ideal buyer would be the Ivory Tower.\"\nNo mage residing in the Kingdom of Thormia could be free from the Magic Association. Other countries also had Magic Associations.\nHowever, the Ivory Tower wasn’t bound by such concepts. They pursued magic regardless of world affairs. They were a transnational organization, capable of contending with the world.\n\"The Ivory Tower is known as the pinnacle of the world. I doubt they would move even for an ancient artifact.\"\n\"You might think that as a mage. But it’s possible. Look at the Ex Machina incident seventy years ago.\"\n\"Ex Machina?\"\n\"It’s the name of an ancient weapon possessed by the country of Koteria. I heard from my father that Koteria strengthened Ex Machina’s security by relocating it thirty meters from its original position to a newly constructed bunker. The international community went into an uproar. It felt like a world war could break out at any moment. Do you understand what this means? The mere act of moving an ancient weapon thirty meters caused such a stir.\"\n\"That's terrifying. What kind of weapon is it?\"\n\"The Elzain family also participated in the intelligence war but discovered nothing. Its form, size, and even the principle of activation are unknown. However, judging by the reactions of neighboring countries at the time, it’s likely a map weapon.\"\n\"A map weapon?\"\n\"It means it’s not a weapon used on the field. It’s named for the fact that the highest leaders make decisions with a map. Although the seal hasn’t been broken, you never know. It’s been seventy years.\"\nMap weapons are devoid of humanity. Maps don’t show who lives there, what culture they enjoy, or what must be protected. It’s a world calculated with a ruler, compass, and pencil.\nCanis listened silently as they appraised the artifact.\nHe had no intention of selling his master’s artifact. The reason he kept it secret was to engrave his sacrifice. His desire to go to heaven was so strong that he was willing to reveal an ancient artifact.\n\"Hmm, Ex Machina... and this is Metagate.\"\nShirone murmured, then turned to Canis.\n\"Wait, how do you know its name? Didn’t Arcane erase his memory?\"\n\"It was written on a note. Just a series of words. He must have wanted to prevent anyone from inferring its meaning, even if they found the secret place. It’s a meticulousness fitting of my master.\"\n\"What else was written?\"\n\"Nothing significant. There was no mention of heaven. He must have been reluctant to reveal it. But we can explore it. Because we have the Metagate. What do you think? Is this enough for a deal regarding the Immortal Function?\"\nThere was room to consider. The terrifying idea of heaven had turned into a small excitement. With Canis, the probability of survival would increase significantly. But... what was he aiming to gain?\n\"Why do you want to go to heaven? Just because Arcane went isn’t a convincing reason. There’s no detailed information. I need to know your motivation to judge.\"\nCanis felt more trust in Shirone's thorough scrutiny. If they were to venture into danger, it would be far more efficient to have Shirone as a companion than a less competent mage.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 175: The Gate of Goffin (2)\nWE TRIED TRANSLATIONS\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nDiscord:\nhttps://dsc.gg/wetried\nINFINITE MAGE\n“It's estimated that Master went to heaven around 80 years ago. Do you know what that means?”\n“No, I don’t.”\n“The rank assigned to Master by the Magic Association was different before he went to heaven and after he returned. In other words, he became an Archmage after realizing something in heaven. Every mage dreams of becoming an Archmage. Knowing this, it doesn't make sense not to go to heaven.”\nShirone had to agree. If Arcane had become a third-class mage after returning from heaven, it meant there was something in heaven that had awakened him.\nSeeing Shirone waver, Canis revealed the last piece of information he had.\n“Most of the notes left by Master were just words, but at the end, there was a single sentence.”“What did it say?”\n“It was something like this: ‘That place is the origin of everything. The source of Schema and...’”\nRian's eyes lit up.\n“Schema?”\nIgnoring him, Canis continued.\n“Forgotten ancient magic…”\nAmy asked again.\n“Ancient magic?”\n“The ancient weapons lying dormant…”\nTess shouted.\n“Ancient weapons!”\nCanis frowned.\n“...Are you doing this on purpose?”\n“Hohoho! Sorry, please continue.”\nAnnoyed by Tess's jest, Canis eventually recited the entire sentence.\n“It was written like this: ‘I leave this at Metagate.’”\nIt was a note left to prevent those unaware of heaven's existence from accessing the information.\nEven Harvest, who inherited Arcane’s memories, had wandered the continent to find the secret location. The fact that he had gone to such lengths to obscure it showed how much he didn't want this information to be known.\nNevertheless, he left a record... perhaps it was an inescapable mischievous streak.\nThough it was just a single sentence, the note contained crucial information. First, heaven had Schema and magic. Therefore, it was likely inhabited by humans. Additionally, ancient relics would likely be piled high there.\nArcane was saying through the note: ‘Examiners and mages of the world, beyond the Metagate lie mountains of ancient relics.’\nSo, what were these ancient relics? No history book mentioned them.\nShirone grasped what kind of place heaven was.\n“Ancient magic. Ancient relics. The origin of everything.”\n“Yes. Master knew. When did humans first start learning Schema and magic? If it were a biological principle, animals should exhibit Schema too. But no matter how far back you go in history, there's no mention of the birth of Schema and Spirit Zone. Do you know what this means?”\n“Humans understood it from the beginning. It's a paradox, but that's what you're trying to say, right?”\n“Exactly. More specifically, Schema and magic existed even before humans. Kadum called heaven his hometown. It's just a myth, but we must use myths as our compass from now on.”\nA prehistorical world awaited them. The origin of humanity, which no scholar had unveiled, might be hidden somewhere in the immeasurable sky.\n“I've told you everything I know. The conclusion is, we will go there. To honor Master’s will and to further our magic. Arin and I have agreed on this. Whatever happens, there will be no resentment.”\n“I-I want to go too!”\nAmy declared her intention to join.\nOpportunities to elevate one's magic level didn't come often for a mage. Also, the idea of being rivals with Canis and Arin from the same school influenced her decision. No matter how dangerous it was, didn't they have the Metagate? It would be foolish not to even try when there was a way back.\n“If Amy's going, then so am I! Shirone, let’s go!”\nTess supported Amy’s decision. There was no reason not to go when ancient weapons awaited them.\nThe Metagate alone was immensely valuable. Ancient weapons were items made from metals not found in this world. Picking up even a single stone lying around would be worthwhile.\n“No. I'm not taking anyone. I'm not going either. It's too dangerous. I don't think going to heaven is the right choice for us.”\nEveryone was dumbfounded by Shirone’s words.\nIt was too precious to give up just like that. This was an opportunity that no mage in the world would ever have. Didn't Arcane also reach the rank of Archmage after gaining enlightenment in heaven?\n“I know it's dangerous. But doesn’t Canis have a way back?”\n“That’s not the point. Whether there’s an exit or not doesn't matter. Just because I can open the gate to heaven doesn’t mean I should put you all in danger.”\nCanis gritted his teeth.\nHe had known Shirone's philanthropic spirit was like a cliff you couldn't cross. That's why he had crafted a meticulous plan to bring them to this point. But even this couldn't break through her adamant resolve.\n“If you’re that scared, then don’t go. But we had a deal. You have to let Arin and me through heaven’s gate.”\n“No. I won't let you go either.”\n“You bastard! Are you betraying us now?”\n“Think whatever you want. But now you’re a fellow student at our school. I can’t open the gate and send you to your death.”\n“Who asked you to worry about my life? I’ll handle my own affairs! And we can always come back!”\nAmy, who usually respected Shirone’s decisions, sided with Canis this time.\n“Yeah, Shirone. It’s a great opportunity. And didn't we agree to take on this level of risk from the start? You came this far to learn about Miro.”\nShirone raised his voice.\n“Put yourself in my shoes. If you were me, could you ask us to go through heaven’s gate? Could you ask us to go to the star we just saw?”\n‘No, not even if I died.’\nThat was the issue. It was a matter separate from the risk.\nIf Shirone had come alone and if the situation were as it was now, he would have entered heaven immediately.\nBut as an Unlocker, taking his friends' lives into her hands and leading them was an immature act. Shirone had the responsibility to make the most mature judgment among them.\nLost in thought, Amy flicked Shirone on the forehead. Shirone, holding his stinging forehead, looked at her in disbelief as Amy spoke.\n“Of course, I’d say let's go to heaven. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”\nAmy was lying.\nWorrying about a friend's safety also hinders clear judgment. She thought it best to lessen Shirone's burden first.\nBut Shirone saw right through her.\n“Don’t lie. This is really dangerous. Even with the Metagate, do you know where it leads? We’re not going to come right back. The more determined we are to go, the greater the risk. Why don't you understand that?”\n“Then why did you bring me here?”\n“What? That’s…”\n“You said you’d feel reassured with me. Isn’t that why you came to my house? Or what, were you planning to go sightseeing with a girl?”\nAmy aggressively pressed. Shirone was speechless. He had a responsibility for bringing a senior student here, wasting valuable time.\nTess pounded her chest and supported Amy’s opinion.\n“I feel the same. Even if you open the gate, it’s my choice to follow or not. You don’t need to worry about that. Besides, if we’re going, Rian and I would be a great help.”\nIn any party, a swordsman was crucial. They had the bravery and animal instincts that mages lacked. A second they created could be a life-or-death moment for a mage.\nAs Shirone hesitated, someone knocked on the door.\nCanis hid the Metagate. The knocker waited for permission before entering.\nWhen Shirone allowed entry, Mahatu walked in. An unwelcome guest.\nAs Shirone's group watched, Mahatu hesitated before speaking.\n“I apologize for earlier. I came to formally apologize.”\n“It’s fine, I’ve forgotten about it.”\nOf course, Amy hadn’t. But she let it slide, suspecting Mahatu had another reason for his visit.\nAs expected, Mahatu got to the point.\n“Are you going to heaven?”\nShirone didn’t answer. Despite his friends’ strong persuasion, he still had doubts.\n“Please don’t go.”\nHis friends frowned.\nAccording to the chief, Shirone was the key to the Kergos tribe's fate. It was surprising that Mahatu, who knew this better than anyone, was dissuading them.\nCanis, who thought Shirone had almost been convinced, spoke irritably when Mahatu interrupted.\n“What are you talking about? Don’t go?”\n“Please excuse me.”\nMahatu crossed his arms. As he inhaled, his muscles swelled, and a powerful aura emanated from his eyes.\nIt was an overwhelming presence.\nShirone’s group felt as if they were being pushed back. Maybe they were. If he had added killing intent, they wouldn't have been able to breathe.\nNot intending to offend, Mahatu quickly withdrew his presence. But the air was still heavy.\n“I apologize for overstepping.”\nNo one thought Mahatu’s apology was sincere.\nThough there was no absolute measure of strength, there was a clear line between a master and a novice. Mahatu’s level indicated he knew his strength.\n“I cannot go to heaven. I failed to prove my strength in the Room of Accomplishment and Sacrifice.”\nShirone understood Mahatu’s intent. He was indicating the difficulty of heaven based on his own strength.\nWhile warriors and mages couldn't be compared directly, his argument was persuasive enough.\n“Do Kergosians also take the test?”\n“Of course. Proving one's strength in the Room of Accomplishment and Sacrifice grants a Kergosian warrior the right to go to heaven.”\n“But to go there…”\n“Yes. An Unlocker is necessary. When the gate to heaven buried in volcanic ash was restored, many went to heaven. But few returned. Therefore, Miro established the Room of Accomplishment and Sacrifice to verify strength. Though Unlockers are an exception, it's best not to go unless you can pass the test.”\nThe fact that few had returned was surprising, but it was even more shocking that Mahatu mentioned Miro's name.\n“How do you know Miro? Did you meet her?”\n“No, but most leaders know of her.”\n“Can you tell us more? We came here to learn about Miro.”\n“Indeed, I see.”\nMahatu understood why Shirone hadn’t been swayed by gold or women. Someone connected to Miro was certainly different from the usual indulgent Unlockers.\n“500 years ago, the Kergos civil war broke out. It was a conflict between those who followed the angels and those who opposed them. The anti-angel faction won. But a sudden volcanic eruption nearly wiped out the tribe. The angel followers saw the eruption as a disaster sent by the angels.”\nScholars were wrong to think Lupe started the civil war. The involvement of angels made it a top-secret known only to Kergo’s high-ranking officials.\n“250 years later, an outsider named McClain Goffin visited. He was an Unlocker like you, Shirone. He restored the Kergo ruins buried in volcanic ash and opened the gate to heaven. We call that gate Goffin’s Gate. But it caused another turmoil. The conflicts from 250 years ago reemerged. This time, the angel followers won, changing the regime. That’s the current Kergos.”\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

The elders who welcomed Unlocker must have been Angel Faction, while those who looked at him with disdain belonged to the Anti-Angel Faction.\nWhen classified that way, Chief Kadum's father, Hashid, was Anti-Angel Faction. So was Mahatu.\n“Chief Kadum is leading Kergos to ruin. It's ironic for someone like me, who engages in Lupe smuggling, to say this, but I believe that entrusting the tribe’s fate to the messenger of God is wrong. In truth, I am of the Anti-Angel Faction lineage, and I was destined to be a slave. You've heard about the human trafficking perpetrated by the Galiant autonomous government. Most of the victims were from the Anti-Angel Faction. My mother was also kidnapped by foreigners.”\nAmy decided to erase the last bit of resentment she had towards Mahatu. If his parents had suffered such a fate, it was understandable that he harbored animosity towards outsiders.\n“A hundred years ago, the Kergos tribe was shaken by the infiltration of civilization. The anger of the Anti-Angel Faction intensified as the Galiant autonomous government began hunting humans. It seemed like a third civil war was imminent, and destruction seemed unavoidable. But there was someone who turned it all around. The person who ended the civil war by designing the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice to prevent reckless ascensions to Heaven. That person was Miro.”Shirone thought of Miro. There had been times when he felt a chill from Miro’s eyes that seemed to show rapid emotional changes. But before entering Miro's space-time, he was a human being.\n“There is still conflict, but it’s much better than back then, thanks to Miro. Without her, I would have been just another slave.”\n“Where is Miro now?”\nShirone knew that she resided in a middle dimension of Estas. But he also thought she might exist everywhere.\n“After designing the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, Miro entered the Gate of Goffin. Though I wasn’t there, I heard she said she was going to meet Goffin.”\nAmy asked with a puzzled look.\n“Wait a minute. Isn't Goffin from 250 years ago? How can she meet him?”\n“I don't know either. But the records clearly state that.”\nShirone believed it was entirely possible.\nTo have installed the Gate of Goffin meant she was an Unlocker who wielded Scale Magic. If Miro was strong in spatial aspects, then Goffin must have been strong in temporal aspects.\nHe thought of Armin, the Eternal Cintana. He had also spent over a hundred years contemplating with Stop Magic, so it wouldn’t be strange for Goffin to be alive somehow. Even the Archmage Arcane survived 150 years solely with his biological abilities.\nCanis wasn't interested in Miro. However, the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice she designed was crucial in determining ascension to heaven.\n“So, where are those who passed through Miro’s space-time waiting? Shouldn’t they go with Shirone?”\nNow that it was mentioned, Shirone was curious too.\nThose who proved their strength in Miro’s space-time. If they were still here, more clues might be obtained.\n“Whether they accompany us or not is up to the messenger of God to decide, but currently, no one is here. The last team left for Heaven two years ago and never returned.”\nThe fact that it was only two years ago was shocking. People were ascending to heaven more frequently than expected.\nKadum hid this fact because he was part of the Angel Faction. He wanted more people to ascend to Heaven.\nAmy asked another question.\n“All Kergosians believe in Ra, right? How can a faction that opposes angels exist?”\n“I’m part of the Anti-Angel Faction, but I don’t know how the first civil war started. Most records were lost in the volcanic eruption 500 years ago. We call it the Lost Record. Honestly, we can’t even be sure if the volcanic eruption was the work of an angel. It’s just a story passed down.”\nMahatu's story influenced their judgment. Even if there was a way to return, caution was necessary. They couldn’t grasp what Heaven was like.\n“Even so, if you decide to go... I won’t stop you. No, I have no means to stop you. But please understand this. Everyone who passed through Miro’s space-time was stronger than me.”\nMahatu implied that they were stronger than Shirone’s group. Yet even those strong individuals couldn’t return from Heaven.\nIn the heavy atmosphere, Shirone’s group fell into deep thought. Realizing that his sincerity had been conveyed, Mahatu bowed his head.\n“I respect your determination, Shirone, unmoved by tribute. You must have come with a purpose beyond common worldly desires. That’s why I felt compelled to tell you the truth. While I won’t interfere with your decision, please consider it carefully.”\n“Yes, we heard important information. Thank you.”\nAs Mahatu left the room, silence fell.\nHeaven was still alluring, but no one tried to persuade Shirone.\nShirone's insight was correct. Only Shirone could decide, and the rest had no choice but to follow.\n“Headmaster… how much did he know?”\nThe person who came to mind at the end of the thought was Alpheas. Knowing Shirone was an Unlocker, why had he told him about the Kergos ruins?\n“Maybe he knew as much as we do? He said Miro was his student. He must have heard about her actions.”\n“Even so, why did he allow it? What if the situation we’re in was beyond the Principal's expectations? What should I do then?”\n“That’s also a possibility. We don’t know how far he predicted, but he might have thought you wouldn’t go to heaven. I would think the same. In the end, the problem is...”\nCanis threw a Metagate and spoke.\n“I was the variable.”\nAlpheas hadn’t anticipated Canis’ presence. Even if he had, he wouldn’t have dreamed that he could find a way to return.\nNow, the only thing left was to choose.\nThe fact that there was an exit was positive. As long as it wasn’t a world filled with toxic gas, they wouldn’t die immediately upon arrival.\nThinking this way, not attempting seemed foolish. But given the unpredictability of human psychology, missing the chance to return couldn’t be ignored.\nShirone couldn’t sleep until dawn.\n***\nThe next morning, Shirone’s group descended to the temple’s underground. Led by Chief Kadum, followed by Hashid and Mahatu.\nAmy thought this place must be the secret space of the ruins that couldn’t be explored with the Spirit Zone.\nUpon reaching the lowest level, they found a straight passage with traces of a volcanic eruption. Gems embedded in the walls guided their way.\nOpening the iron door revealed a cavern. Priests lined the walls, and a solitary stone gate stood in the center. Its disconnection from anywhere else undeniably suggested the existence of Heaven.\nShirone approached the gate.\nThe Gate of Goffin. Recreated by the Unlocker McClain Goffin 250 years ago, it was the entrance to heaven. A red orb was embedded, with vertical lines etched around it.\nBefore coming here, Kadum had completed a contract with Shirone. His request was simple. Just convey Chief Kadum’s will to the Angel’s Library, Inglis.\nAn Angel’s Library. Kadum said it wasn’t a difficult journey as it wasn’t about reaching God, but Shirone thought it was an impossible task involving gods and angels.\nShirone met eyes with his friends. They could come back. Maybe. Once they decided to go, they had to think positively.\nWhen Amy nodded, Shirone placed his hand on the orb at the center of the door.\nTaking a deep breath, he activated the Immortal Function, causing the orb to emit a white flash.\n“Oh, ohhh!”\nVoices of awe were heard. Even Mahatu, an Anti-Angel Faction member, knelt and chanted Aker Ra.\nShirone focused more power.\nContrary to initial thoughts, it wasn’t just a simple stone wall. What seemed like the scratches of time revealed themselves as indecipherable magical runes emitting red light.\nAs the magic activated, the stone wall began to fragment into dice-sized cubes.\nThe fragments, defying gravity, shattered into finer particles and were eventually absorbed by the light.\nThe door emitted a white light, engulfing Shirone.\n“The Gate of Goffin has opened! Praise the angels!”\nThe priests bowed and chanted.\nShirone couldn’t hear their voices. Enveloped in light, he could only hear the sound of his own heartbeat.\nFor the first time, he felt fear. Though it was just a step, it felt like an eternal distance. He didn’t want to move.\nA strong and warm hand rested on his shoulder. It was Rian.\nYes, he wasn’t alone. Rian wouldn’t give up in any situation.\nTess’s delicacy, Amy’s brilliance, Canis’s defense, and Arin’s mental strength. Harvest was also a reliable ally now.\nThis was a splendid party. He felt a bit relieved.\nShirone stepped through the door.\nAs they left the altar, the white light condensed into gray particles and began to reconstruct the stone wall.\nThe floating cubes found their places, reassembled, and the magical runes lost their glow.\nThere was no one standing at the closed stone wall.\nThe cavern was silent.\n***\nShirone gritted his teeth. Multicolored lights whizzed around him.\nWhat awaited at the end? Or was there even an end? The dazzling light patterns didn’t disappear even when he closed his eyes.\nIt was as if he had become a cannonball fired from a cannon, with his vision opening wide.\nThe group shared the same feeling. They only hoped it wasn’t a world of burning sulfur.\nThe first impression wasn’t bad. The air was clear and cool. But realizing where they were, they screamed.\nThey had assumed the Gate of Goffin would lead them to the ground. How foolish.\nThey were floating high above the clouds, at a height where they could see the ends of the sea.\nThe mages attempted teleportation, but it was futile. Still affected by the Gate of Goffin, they plummeted towards the ground faster than freefall.\nThe sea receded, revealing dense forests.\nShirone spotted a city standing in the center of the distant forest. It was identical to what he had seen in Miro’s space-time.\nA castle surrounded by two concentric circles, with the inner circle divided into six sections like a pie.\nMechanical devices resembling ladybugs were flying in the sky. They reminded him of a human brain.\nAs they descended, the city disappeared, and they plummeted into the forest. Breaking through the forest, they saw the ground. They would be killed instantly upon impact.\nThey tried magic again, but it was impossible. Just as the pebbles on the ground touched their retinas, the Gate of Goffin released them.\n***\nHeaven’s outskirts. Purgatory.\nShirone had no time to look around and immediately checked his head. Falling face-first, his head should have been smashed.\nHe seemed to have lost consciousness for a moment, but when he came to, he was standing on his two feet, unharmed.\nTess examined his body and spoke.\n“Are we alive? Or did we die?”\n“We’re alive, I think. I’m hungry.”\nEven in this situation, Rian’s comment about hunger was meant to reassure Tess.\n“Maybe we didn’t fall from the sky.”\nShirone, using his expertise, explained.\n“Think of it as spatial movement. We simply arrived here through a tunnel, and the various landscapes we saw were due to the space folding.”\nIn the end, it was spatial movement. However, the extraordinary distance traveled caused such phenomena.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Trees with long leaves blocked the sky above.\nFrom above, it seemed there were no gaps, but light squeezed through the tiniest of spaces, illuminating the world. Moss and mushrooms grew in the shade, and the soil felt damp with moisture.\nYet, it didn’t feel like their original world.\nThe secret to the feeling that time had stopped lay in the size of the rocks.\nThe age of a space can be known by the weathering of its rocks. But here, the rocks varied in size. There were small pebbles, but there were also countless house-sized boulders. It was impossible unless someone had moved them.\n“The composition of this place might be different from where we lived. Maybe it has the durability to withstand time.”Canis had a point.\nAncient artifacts were made from minerals that didn’t exist in their world. And being an ancient artifact itself meant it was something from a time before history. If it belonged to Heaven, then these rocks, having endured for eons, were living proof.\n“So, this really is heaven?”\n“Let’s check the Spirit Zone first.”\nAt Amy’s suggestion, each of them tested their ability to cast magic. The Spirit Zone is a realm of omnipotence, but there was an unease that the zone could be disrupted in a physically distant world.\nFortunately, their magic worked normally.\n“So, this is heaven? Well, we’ve seen the sights; shall we go back now?”\nEveryone looked at Tess. Surprised by the attention, she waved her hand awkwardly with an embarrassed smile.\n“Haha, no, just joking.”\n“No. I was seriously considering it too.”\nIf even Rian was saying such things, it was clear how tense everyone else was.\nProving this fact, Shirone’s group hadn’t moved a step from the spot where they arrived.\nShirone took a small but significant step forward and spoke.\n“Let’s move. Whether we fell from the sky or space folded, we saw a city. We should walk towards it, right? At least it means there’s civilization.”\nWhere there’s civilization, there’s law. Though it was uncertain if the laws would be reasonable, it was a more practical decision than spending the night in a forest where anything could jump out.\n“But how do we find the city? We don’t know the direction.”\n“I can handle that.”\nAmy’s eyes turned red. Reading the information stored in her magnetic memory, she pointed in the direction where Rian was standing.\n“Based on the coordinates, the city should be that way.”\nAmy’s magnetic memory perfectly restored specific moments. Even in this situation where they flew astronomical distances.\nThis was based on the fact that her ability wasn’t mathematical. Just as a compass points north regardless of the space, she also possessed a sort of magnet that could maintain her orientation amid any variables.\nFollowing Amy, the group didn’t miss the sounds emanating from the landscape. They heard insects and birds, but oddly, nothing was visible.\nRealizing it was a phenomenon not to be overlooked, they stopped when they heard rustling in the forest.\nWith heightened senses, Tess drew her saber and turned. Rian, holding the handle of his greatsword, stood by her side.\n“What is it, Tess?”\n“I don’t know. Someone seems to be approaching us.”\nAmy asked with a tense expression.\n“Are you sure it’s someone? Not something?”\nTess couldn’t answer. The breathing sounded human, but she couldn’t be certain.\nThere was no guarantee anyone lived here.\nIn a situation where some monster might emerge, the group's tension peaked.\nSss! Sss!\nThe sound of foliage rustling grew closer and faster. Tess was sure they were being targeted.\nThe mages entered the Spirit Zone, and Rian drew his greatsword, lowering it to strike the moment anything emerged from the forest.\nTaking a deep breath, Rian waited for the approaching entity with a puzzled expression.\nGiven the frequency of the sounds, it should have arrived by now. Yet, there was only noise, and the entity hadn’t shown itself.\n“Rian, you should step back.”\nTess’s voice trembled.\nShe thought of one possible scenario. The sound was coming from much farther away than expected.\nMaintaining his stance to strike, Rian stepped back when suddenly, thud! Thud! The ground shook.\nFinally, pushing through the bushes, it appeared.\n“What, what is that?”\nShirone looked up. As much as he could lift his head.\nA giant.\nAn eight-meter-tall giant. Although it was scantily clad, it wore ragged pieces of cloth here and there.\nIts beard reached its chest, and its face was deeply wrinkled, but its body was as robust as a young man’s.\nTess, strategically trying to find a vital point, checked its groin. It was smooth. Though the face looked masculine, and there were no breasts, it lacked genitals.\n“Um… we have a bit of a problem here.”\nArin spoke. Tess, who had left the giant’s examination to Rian, turned around and asked.\n“What’s wrong? Worse than this?”\n“I don’t know which is worse, but this is a first for me.”\nShirone also turned to Arin. How would her insight view the giant now?\n“I can’t read its emotions. Whether it’s angry, smiling, or sad. Everything is mixed up.”\nThe most surprised was Canis. Even Harvest, who was materialized behind him, tilted his head while examining the giant.\n“Arin… can’t read its emotions?”\nImpossible. It was theoretically impossible.\nThe ability of Insight brings all characteristics of the world to an equal level.\nIf someone like Sakiri from the Magic Association could block emotions, it would at least show such Insight.\nThat Arin couldn’t read the giant’s emotions was certainly strange.\n“Those who come to Purgatory… Those who deny God…”\nThe giant’s words were unintelligible. It didn’t seem they could find an interpreter. The only person they could rely on was Arin.\nBut she shook her head again.\n“I don’t know. I can’t decipher it.”\nNeither Insight nor telepathy worked. Arin was practically blind. She couldn’t even read the expressions, so she borrowed Canis’s eyes.\n“Canis, does that giant seem hostile?”\n“It does seem that way.”\nCould it be that Arin, who specialized in mental resonance, couldn’t even sense hostility? The reason they ventured into this unknown world was because they trusted in Arin’s ability to nullify dangers.\nWithout Arin, it was impossible. Amy, possibly thinking the same, left the final decision to her.\n“Arin, what should we do now?”\n“Well, what else? We have to run!”\nAs Arin darted away, Amy stood stunned.\nCanis chased after her, and the others began to retreat as well.\nAmy, the slowest to react, looked back at the giant. It was uprooting a sapling nearly two meters tall and giving chase.\n“Gaaaah!”\nThe giant’s roar was as loud as a sonic cannon. In a daze, Amy threw herself aside.\nThe sapling’s roots brushed her collar.\n“Being big, it can’t follow us closely! We need to run!”\n“Why didn’t you say that earlier?”\nAmy, having caught up to Arin with Schema, shouted. Fortunately, she narrowly escaped the first strike, but had she reacted a bit slower, her back would have been split open.\n“Sorry! I didn’t expect this either.”\nArin didn’t evade responsibility.\nNow that they were in heaven, they were one team. As a non-combat mage, her role was to identify the enemy's nature and objectively analyze the situation to relay to the leader. With that function disabled, she could only apologize.\nSince they were a united group, no one blamed Arin. But they worried about the future.\nArin’s mental abilities were a huge asset. Although it was too early to conclude that her power didn’t work against just one giant, the fact that things had gone awry from the start was undeniable.\nHearing the ground shake, Shirone looked back. Thinking the giant would be slow because of its size was a miscalculation. It had caught up quickly.\nTess’s voice echoed in Shirone’s mind through the mental channel.\n-Shirone, give the command. Should we teleport and escape?\n-That’s risky. We still don’t know where we are. If we encounter a greater danger, we could be wiped out.\n-But we can’t keep running either. Honestly, I can’t even see what’s around us right now.\n-...That’s true. Then let’s fight here. Taking down the giant seems like the priority.\nAs Shirone chose the combat route, Rian and Tess turned and charged at the giant.\nWith Shirone at the center, Amy and Canis took their positions on either side, while Arin supported from the rear.\nRian, the vanguard knight, initiated the attack.\nFighting an eight-meter-tall enemy came with unpredictable variables. Attacks from above the head were hard to predict, and they could only target areas below the knees.\nRian aimed for the Achilles tendon.\nAs he swung his greatsword, the giant swung the tree trunk. Their weapons collided midair, and the trunk shattered like splintering wood.\nIt wasn’t that he had cut it. The giant’s strength was so immense it destroyed its own weapon.\nFrom the impact of the clash, Rian was thrown three meters away. He barely landed on his feet, but his legs dragged on the ground.\nFeeling a tremor in his right arm, he gripped his greatsword with his left hand and took a combat stance.\nThe giant’s strength was immense. But more surprising was its speed.\n“How can it be this fast? It defies physics.”\nFor a creature of eight meters to support its body, it would need hundreds of times the muscle strength of a human.\nJust standing was astonishing, yet its combat movements were comparable to a predator.\n“Executing heretics!”\nUttering incomprehensible words, the giant hurled the splintered sapling at Tess.\nAs the sapling embedded itself in the ground, Tess leaped into the air.\nThe giant, in a continuous motion, punched. It seemed impossible for Tess, suspended in midair, to dodge.\nAt that moment, her body flew forward, defying inertia, landing on the giant’s fist.\nIt was External Gravity.\nCharging up the giant’s forearm, she slashed at its left eye with her saber and jumped down. As the giant covered its eye and raised its torso, she shouted to her team.\n“Now!”\nShirone fired the Photon Canon. Considering the monster's size, conserving energy wasn’t an option.\nA beam of light, comparable to a cannonball, struck the giant’s abdomen.\nThe giant’s body bent around the Photon Canon, lifting its legs off the ground.\nWatching the giant get pushed back was hard to believe. Even Canis, who had previously been hit by the same technique, winced at the hallucination pain.\nShirone’s group thought it was over. But as the giant’s legs, now horizontal, came down, its feet crushed the ground, stopping its momentum.\nEveryone was speechless.\nThe giant had withstood the Photon Canon. Wasn’t this the same magic that had nearly reached 5,000 in destructive power in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice? The fact that a creature of flesh and blood endured it was unbelievable.\n“How on earth is it still standing after that?”\nThe giant’s expression twisted. Its wrinkled face became terrifyingly monstrous.\nAt that moment, a Fireball from Amy flew in, setting the giant’s face ablaze.\nAmy’s judgment was spot-on. Fire is the enemy of cells. No matter how strong, burning it was the solution.\nThe giant, its beard aflame, wobbled while clutching its face.\nSeeing the burning giant’s face, their skin crawled. Beneath the melting skin, new skin was regenerating.\nTess murmured in disbelief.\n“That’s Schema, isn’t it? How can a giant use Schema?”\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Now that the giant was wounded, it was the perfect opportunity to see if her ability would work.\nThe Might of Darkness that Arin used took the form of shadowy tendrils extending like branches of a plant. The tendrils climbed up the giant's shadow, wrapping around its ankles like vines.\nArin then cast Mental Shock, a spell designed to deliver a psychic jolt.\nIf telepathy was akin to theft, Mental Shock was like a full-on robbery. While it couldn’t induce trauma, it could certainly instill a phobia-level shock.\nThe true strength of Mental Shock lay in its ability to link into Mind Control.\nMind Control, one of Arcane’s specialties, was a spell that allowed the caster to manipulate the target’s body, though it was difficult to succeed. To achieve near 100% success, it required concentration twenty times greater than the target’s mental strength.Ultimately, this meant one couldn’t dominate a stronger opponent.\nHowever, with the right strategy and tactics, it was occasionally possible—especially if Mental Shock succeeded.\nIf they could control the giant with Mind Control, they would have nothing to fear in the forest. Knowing this, Canis watched the outcome without intervening.\nMental Shock failed.\nThe giant, with its face aflame, lunged at the group with even more ferocity.\nArin bit her lip. Telepathy, Mental Shock, and Mind Control, the so-called three great psychic skills, were ineffective against the giant.\nFor Arin, it was her first time experiencing such powerlessness. Her gentle temperament burned with frustration.\n‘Why? Why isn’t it working? It’s just a giant human, isn’t it?’\n“Arin! Move!”\nCanis stepped in front of Arin and cast Shadow Wall.\nAs the shadow rose, the giant’s fist crashed into it. The Shadow Wall disintegrated like dust. The impact exceeded the spell’s absorption capacity.\nBut the giant also seemed to lose some of its strength and couldn’t push further.\nHarvest climbed up the giant’s arm, using its claws to slice at a likely blood vessel.\nIf the giant had mastered Schema, it would have a physiology similar to a human’s.\nBlood spurted from a severed vessel in the crook of the giant’s elbow, but the wound quickly healed. Instead of slowing, the giant rampaged even more violently, spurred by the pain.\n‘It’s incredibly strong. That such a creature exists in the world…’\nShirone used teleportation to bait the giant while Rian slashed at its Achilles tendon from behind.\nCanis cast the Might of Darkness. Though the toothed shadows were specialized for attack, they couldn’t cut through the giant’s muscles even while wrapping around its ankles.\nAll Canis could do was shout, “It’s incredibly strong! Do something, quick!”\nAmy’s Flame Strike bombarded the giant’s face. Yet, adding more fire to an already burning giant made little difference. While the added wind enhanced the effect, it was physically weaker than the Photon Canon.\nShirone compressed photons. Contrary to everyone’s belief that he was preparing another Photon Canon, it took longer to activate than expected.\nNoticing the light mass wobbling, Canis yelled in frustration.\n“Damn it! What are you doing? Focus!”\n“No, it’s not that,” Arin said.\n“He’s altering the form of the photons.”\nUnable to bring it down with brute force, he was converting the photons into a cutting force. If neither heat nor impact worked, then sharpness might.\nIt was the right decision in the current situation.\nBut Canis doubted its feasibility. Altering the shape of light was beyond common sense.\nShirone felt it too. Suppressing the light he intended to release was tough. He believed it possible by varying the direction of the compression force on the photons, but the mental effort required was enormous.\nA groan escaped through his teeth. Tightening his fluctuating mind with an iron will, he increased his concentration until the photons flattened.\nThe Photon Canon, now in the form of a disc, surged towards the giant.\nThe giant, breaking free from the Might of Darkness, twisted its body. As the light blade sliced through its side, the wound opened a handspan wide, blood gushing like a waterfall.\nIt was a critical hit.\nRealizing this, the group—both swordsmen and mages—charged with newfound intensity.\nThey stabbed with sabers and pummeled with greatswords. They burned with flames and sawed with shadowy blades until the giant toppled over.\nThe assault continued, but it felt like trying to carve up a dragon with a pocket knife. Each muscle fiber was as tough as steel.\nPanting, Amy said, “Ha… ha. It’s dead, right? It must be dead, right? Isn’t it?”\n“I don’t know. Should we hit it one more time just to be sure?”\nTess shuddered.\n“No, I can’t do it anymore. There’s a limit to how cruel we can be.”\n“I tried to cut its neck with the Might of Darkness, but it wouldn’t cut. How about peeling off its skin?”\nCanis’s suggestion made everyone turn pale. Since the giant wasn’t moving, and Shirone’s wound hadn’t healed, it was best to leave it alone.\nTess gave Shirone a thumbs-up.\n“Nice job, Shirone. Another new spell, huh?”\n“I was lucky. If the giant had dodged, there wouldn’t have been a second chance. Just thinking about it is terrifying.”\nCanis wasn’t pleased. The Photon Canon was meant for impact. Altering its form for cutting? The idea was impressive, but as a dark mage, he couldn’t help but feel his territory was being encroached upon.\n“Hmph, it worked out, but it was a gamble. Since we operate as a team, individual mental strength converges with the party’s. Failure would have left us combat-ineffective. If a mage withdraws from the front line, even their body becomes a shield. It’s dangerous.”\n“I know. The efficiency surprised me too.”\nCanis snorted and turned away. Though he snapped at Shirone, he acknowledged that the insight to change strategies in that situation was a talent.\nArin seemed to share the sentiment. Watching Shirone rest through her Insight, she spoke.\n“As I’ve felt before, that kid really thinks freely.”\nIt was a gamble, but one with high odds.\nInsight to choose what to give up and what to keep to reach victory. If even one or two out of ten choices had been wrong, they wouldn’t have achieved this result.\n“Tch, he’s always had good instincts,” Canis added. They were a team now, and denying Shirone’s talent was just a sign of Canis’s own inferiority.\n“Grrrr…”\nThe giant’s groan made everyone’s heart skip a beat. Although it showed no signs of rising, its fingers were twitching.\nWithout needing to discuss, they sprinted into the forest.\nThey still didn’t know what kind of world heaven was, but they weren’t planning to fight another giant.\nWith Amy’s keen eyes, Tess’s senses, and Arin’s ability to distinguish natural from unnatural, they navigated without much trouble.\nThey arrived at a rocky area.\nThe abundance of shadows pleased Canis and Arin. While Shirone’s magic was unaffected by the environment, dark magic was maximized in darkness.\n“This place feels safe. In a pinch, we can use Dark Port to move.”\n“But Dark Port can’t transport multiple people, can it?”\nDark magic lacks the theoretical foundation for effect transference like Photonization magic. Thus, only dark mages can travel through shadows.\nCanis shrugged as if it didn’t matter.\n“At least it’ll be tactically useful. Here, I can lure enemies alone if necessary.”\nTess, taking the water bottle being passed around, said, “A giant using Schema. Isn’t this place too dangerous? And the fact that Arin’s mental magic doesn’t work is worrying.”\n“I’m sorry. I wasn’t any help.”\nAs Arin lowered her head, Tess waved her hands.\n“No, it’s fine. Even I couldn’t handle the giant. The important thing is that we won. We all worked together to win. Heaven isn’t so bad after all, haha!”\nThough Tess tried to lighten the mood, the mages’ faces darkened.\nUnlike warriors who were used to improvisation, mages disliked unexpected situations. They needed to control all variables to feel secure.\nThe magic of altering the shape of photons wasn’t part of their strategic plan for the party.\nKnowing that adding variables to variables led to disaster, they weren’t happy about a victory gained through improvisation.\n“In the last battle, we didn’t have complete control over the situation. It’s early to say this, but we might need to reconsider our return. What do others think?”\nAs Shirone opened the discussion, Amy responded.\n“For a first attempt, I think it was okay. We shouldn’t overlook the fact that we won. I mean, Shirone found a solution, and we can apply that solution in various situations going forward. We can avoid a repeat of the same situation.”\nAmy had a point.\nCanis, though not inclined to return, wasn’t foolish enough to lie out of greed.\n“It’s not that simple. Shirone probably won’t use the same strategy again, right?”\n“Right. It’s too risky. The time it takes to compress photons is long, and the efficiency is low. I wouldn’t try it unless it was absolutely necessary.”\n“The idea was clever. If photons can have mass, they become more like matter, making shape alteration possible. That’s what you thought, right?”\nCanis could read Shirone’s thoughts because the method he tried was typical of dark magic.\n“But it’s a miscalculation. Shaping mental energy isn’t your strength. It’s a trait of dark magic. Dark magic has less impact but achieves mechanical force through shape alteration. For me, it’s gears; for Arin, it’s vines.”\nArin demonstrated with the Might of Darkness. The shadows rising from the ground formed an intricate apple tree, adjusting the size to create a three-dimensional effect.\nAs Shirone marveled, Arin smiled and explained.\n“Mages use the Four-Way Formation, but dark magic, specialized in mental shaping, doesn’t need it. We call it modeling. While stable elements like ice or darkness are easy to shape, fire or light is too active to model easily.”\nAmy agreed.\n“Now that I think about it, I can’t control the shape of flames either. That’s why I incorporate air attributes into my magic.”\n“Exactly. But light is even harder than fire. In theory, modeling light is impossible. You can add light attributes to other elements, but not the other way around. Shirone did it with the Particle of God, but it was a special case. Though he succeeded to some extent, it’s impractical for combat.”\nShirone sighed.\n“Then how should we fight giants in the future? Laser might work, but considering the giant’s movements, it wouldn’t be easy.”\nA laser could destroy matter regardless of durability, but its energy buildup time made it less effective against fast-moving targets.\nIt was a new type of magic, and if Harvest had known about the laser’s properties beforehand, they wouldn’t have been caught off guard.\n“The problem is we only encountered one giant. How strong are giants in this world? If we knew that, it would help in our exploration.”\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

      "content": "Chapter 179: The Forest of Profane (3)\nWE TRIED TRANSLATIONS\nTranslator/Editor: Ryuu\nDiscord:\nhttps://dsc.gg/wetried\nINFINITE MAGE\nUpon Rian's remark, Shirone snapped his fingers.\n\"Right, let's think about it. If there are living creatures, they must consume something. Considering the food chain in an ecosystem is pyramid-shaped, if we extract the distribution of predators alone, it might look something like this.\"\nShirone drew a pyramid with complex curves, resembling a woman's body.\nIt depicted lower predators, middle predators, and top predators, with a few mutant predators mixed in.\nSince only carnivores were marked, the bottom and middle layers showed equal distribution.\n\"What about these mutant predators?\"\"Among predators, there are many that don't hunt for their food. Some might use traps, or some might feed based on their intellectual abilities, like monkeys in our world.\"\n\"I see. So where do the Giants fit in?\"\n\"Given that gravity and the presence of air are similar, their biological characteristics wouldn't deviate much. If we assume that, they would be somewhere around here, between middle and top predators.\"\n\"Whoa, are Giants mutant predators? They're that strong?\"\n\"Well, there's a possibility they are top predators. If so, there is hope for us, but their combat style is too primitive. Even cats hunt in a refined manner. But uprooting trees to swing around doesn't seem very helpful for hunting. That's why I classified them as mutant predators.\"\nTess tilted her head and asked, \"Could they be mutants between lower and middle predators? Wouldn't that be a problem? It would mean most predators in this forest are stronger than the Giants.\"\n\"I don't think so. Because it seemed like they used language. If they have any intelligence at all, they can't be below middle predators.\"\nCanis spoke up, \"I see. Then the Giant we first encountered is in the top 30 percent. Although it's not impossible for it to be in a different distribution.\"\n\"Statistically, yes. In any case, there wouldn't be many of them. Intuitively, I think the probability of encountering a stronger enemy than the Giants is less than 10 percent.\"\nAmy summarized the situation, \"Then it's not a problem, right? If the six of us fight together, we can handle it. No one is hurt.\"\nShirone analyzed the situation carefully.\nAmy's optimistic view was valid, but in life-and-death situations, probabilities were merely illusions.\nThe fact that they had barely arrived in heaven an hour ago made it impossible to turn back. Although it was an irrational illusion, everyone must have known it to some extent.\nUltimately, they didn't want to go back yet. Even if greater dangers lay ahead.\n\"Okay, let's at least get to the fortress. I don't want to give up here either.\"\nAs they prepared to set off with their backpacks, a loud noise came from the forest.\nTess's sharp ears picked up a woman's voice.\nA sense of unease crossed their minds, feeling that it might be a more dangerous situation than a Giant attack. However, if it truly was a woman, it meant an intelligent being. The information they could glean from her would be invaluable.\nSharing glances, Shirone's group dashed into the forest as if on cue.\n***\nKiing! Kick! Kick!\nA six-legged predatory creature, Dokgakgui, let out a rough cry.\nThe Dokgakgui, a crustacean, moved by driving its six sharp, triangular legs into the ground. Its pale purple body was covered in a carapace, with a single large eye embedded in the center of its face. A long horn on its forehead looked even sturdier and longer than a unicorn's horn.\n\"Rena! Drive it this way!\"\n\"Got it! Be careful, sister!\"\nKanya and Rena surrounded the Dokgakgui from front and back.\nThe woman with long black hair down to her waist was Kanya, and the girl with big, pretty eyes was her younger sister, Rena.\nThey were members of the Mecha tribe, denizens of heaven, known for their youthful appearances, characterized by slender jaws, small noses, and crescent-shaped thin lips.\nAlthough they were seventeen and fourteen years old, their faces made it hard to tell who was older.\nRena, who had taken the rear, targeted the creature's blind spot and swung her sword. The complex weapon, with countless intersecting lines on the blade, showed its remarkable effectiveness.\nAs the blade struck the Dokgakgui's back, a shockwave erupted with a bang, scattering carapace fragments.\nThe Dokgakgui, hit for the third time, shrieked and moved sideways. Rena leaped in response.\nAlthough the Dokgakgui's single eye could cover a 330-degree field of vision, Rena stuck to its only 30-degree blind spot and struck again at its carapace.\nAs the agitated Dokgakgui charged, Rena held out a small kite shield strapped to her wrist.\nThough it seemed like a toy, as the horn collided with it, a vision of a much larger shield emerged, repelling the Dokgakgui.\nThe flipped-over creature flailed its many legs like a beetle. It barely regained its balance but kept stumbling to the right, still reeling from the shock.\nKanya aimed her arc.\nIt resembled a bow but was made of metal and had no string. Instead, it had a handle that, when pulled, emitted a red light from end to end, targeting the Dokgakgui.\nA weapon capable of triangulating and locking onto a target.\nWith the sight calibrated, the projectile would not miss. Kanya aimed the red dot gathering at the Dokgakgui's face.\nSensing danger, the Dokgakgui moved side to side, but Kanya followed its movements.\nAs Rena vanished into its blind spot again, the frightened creature lunged at Kanya.\nKanya released the handle, sending a small bead shooting from the arc's center, piercing the creature's eye and exploding inside.\nThe Dokgakgui's body jerked and collapsed to the ground.\nIts innards must have liquefied, but it still let out a chilling scream.\nRena, holding her sword in reverse, stabbed into a gap in its carapace. With a pop, the Dokgakgui's body convulsed like salt sprinkled on it, then stopped moving.\nWith the battle over, Kanya lowered her arc and wiped her sweat.\n\"Whew, that was tough. This one was quite resilient, huh?\"\n\"Yeah. Are you okay, sister?\"\n\"As you can see, I'm fine. But it's strange. Why did a Dokgakgui appear here? We're far from its habitat.\"\n\"Could we be lost?\"\n\"No way. The drone is pointing in the right direction. Maybe the forest's laws have changed. Let's get out of here quickly.\"\n\"But we should collect the elixir, just in case.\"\nRena climbed onto the Dokgakgui's body. She pried open its carapace and plunged her hand inside, feeling the hot, mushy innards.\nDespite the disgusting texture, Rena boldly wiggled her fingers until she felt something.\nHer eyes lit up with satisfaction after a while.\n\"Hey, it's here! Sis, we got it!\"\nA red-glowing bead emerged from the Dokgakgui's body.\n\"Yay! A Red Elixir. Thank you, Dokgakgui.\"\nSeeing her sister hopping around, Kanya smiled warmly.\nMost creatures in Purgatory cultivated elixirs within their bodies. While divine protection rendered it unnecessary for Heaven's citizens, it was the most important substance in Purgatory.\n\"That was lucky. Now, let's hurry.\"\nAs Kanya turned into a stern elder sister and urged her sister on, she felt a chilling presence behind her.\nEyes embedded in the forest glinted with murderous intent.\nMoments later, creatures with sharp legs emerged, tapping against the rocky ground.\nMore Dokgakgui, and seven of them.\n\"Rena! Get over here!\"\nPulling her sister close, Kanya assumed a combat stance. Despite this, questions swirled in her mind.\nIt was impossible for Dokgakgui, especially in groups, to appear so far from their habitat.\n'Damn it. I should've kept checking the drone.'\nEven in the so-called Hell Outside Heaven, divine will reached this place. Though mindless monsters, the forest's laws acted like instincts. Thus, any event altering those instincts must have occurred nearby.\n\"Why now...!\"\nIt was rare for the forest's laws to change. And it was nearly unheard of for Heaven's citizens to venture into Purgatory.\nThe fact that these two unlikely events coincided added to her anxiety.\n\"Sis, what do we do? There are too many Dokgakgui...\"\nOne Mecha could handle one Dokgakgui. But with two, it required at least five Mechas.\nAccording to the laws, the Mechas' strength lay in their group combat techniques.\nWhile physically the weakest among the divine beings, their coordinated efforts made even the Kergos or Nor tribes cautious.\nKanya's fear stemmed from this. Even with her arc, defeating seven Dokgakgui was impossible.\nWhat on earth was happening in this forest?\nDespite spending a year scouting routes to avoid monsters, everything was now in vain.\nKiing! Kick! Kick!\nAs the Dokgakgui menaced with their horns, the sisters stood back-to-back, protecting each other's blind spots.\nOne Dokgakgui, seemingly testing the waters, lunged at Rena.\nHolding up her shield, Exed, Rena repelled the creature with powerful recoil.\nSwitching places with Rena, Kanya fired her arc. Unable to aim precisely, the projectile struck the carapace, causing an explosion.\nAs the Dokgakgui rolled from the impact, the remaining creatures attacked.\n\"Sis! Hide behind me!\"\nRena switched positions again, holding up Exed. Each time a horn collided with the shield, it sounded like thunder.\nDespite swinging her shockwave weapon, Sygna, hitting a Dokgakgui without exploiting its blind spot was challenging.\nThe time she could withstand with Exed was decreasing. As it exceeded its recoil limit, the shield became a mere toy.\nWith seven Dokgakgui attacking from all sides, Kanya and Rena hugged each other and closed their eyes.\nMore than the fear of death, it was the dread of the pain before dying that terrified them.\nDokgakgui impaled their victims and sucked out their innards. Kanya even considered using Rena's Sygna to end her life quickly.\nAs seven Dokgakgui aimed their horns at the sisters, a bright light flashed from above, and a burst of light descended.\nKanya and Rena saw the back of a boy. He had blond hair and wore strange clothes not seen in this world.\nShirone, upon landing, cast Wildfire.\nA curtain of light oscillated between a radius of 3 to 5 meters, repelling all the Dokgakgui.\nAs the ground formed a circular depression, the two women fell to their knees. Their eyes fixed on Shirone. They had never heard of people living in the Forest of the Profane.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nShirone smiled as he turned his head.\nMeeting someone in a world where returning home was impossible brought a joy incomparable to homesickness. No matter their origins, the disgusting monsters were enemies, and people were allies.\nKanya heightened her guard at the boy's appearance. On the other hand, the teenage girl Rena blushed.\n'He's handsome. Is he a Nor?'\nWhile the two women were lost in their thoughts, Shirone's group was fiercely battling the Dokgakgui.\nRian and Tess each took on one creature.\nHaving exchanged a blow, Rian felt somewhat reassured. While not an easy opponent, such strength was not uncommon among the monsters he frequently encountered in his original world.\nGrabbing the Dokgakgui's horn, Rian overpowered it, causing its precarious six legs to flip over.\nHe drove his short sword into the creature's abdomen, pinning it to the ground.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Twisting the blade, Tess brought the Dokgakgui to its knees.\nSeeing the fight dragging on, Amy erected a Fire Wall around them.\nSince the beasts lacked intelligence, fleeing would have been the best outcome. However, unexpectedly, one of them broke through the wall of fire.\nHarvest grabbed the Dokgakgui's body, which had swelled in size, and snapped its spine.Arin sighed in relief upon realizing that her initial spell was working. She cast Mind Control on four of the Dokgakgui, and two of them began to tremble.\nUnder the influence of Mind Control, the two Dokgakgui turned and started attacking their comrades.\nWith the monsters fighting each other, the group no longer needed to battle.\nRian and Tess, who had finished off their respective Dokgakgui, gathered their weapons and returned to Shirone.\nWhen Amy dispelled the Fire Wall, the group could see the bloodbath among the Dokgakgui. They used their horns, legs, and even jaws to stab, trample, and defeat one another.\nThe number of monsters was equal, so Arin's skill in controlling the Dokgakgui was crucial. Initially unfamiliar with the creatures, she quickly adapted and used their long horns for individual assault tactics.\nWitnessing the carnage, the group shuddered.\nFor Kanya and Rena, in particular, it was a shocking sight. A creature that followed the laws of the forest was now violating those same laws by killing its own kind. It was a day of many strange occurrences in the Forest of the Profane.\nHaving won the battle, Arin exhaled deeply.\nMind Control continually drained her mental strength, and making the creatures fight also transferred their battle intent to her, adding to her mental fatigue.\nThe Dokgakgui under Arin's control looked towards Shirone. Kanya and Rena quickly stepped back, but the creatures simply assumed a posture of submission.\nArin pondered what to do with the remaining Dokgakgui.\nThe high success rate of Mind Control through her initial spell was Arin's strength but also her weakness. High emotional synchronization meant she could vividly sense the emotions of the creatures she controlled.\nThis was a fate shared by all mind-type mages who dealt with the mental states of others.\nArin hesitated. No matter how monstrous, it was painful to mercilessly kill creatures that had fought for her.\nTess, known for her soft heart, voiced Arin's feelings.\n\"Can't we just keep them? Even having just two would make us feel a lot safer.\"\n\"No. We can't waste our mental energy on creatures like these. Now that we know Mind Control works, Arin should focus on that. She also needs to maintain her mental channel constantly.\"\n\"Hmm, what about letting them go?\"\n\"They'd come back to attack us. The worst case is they'd bring others.\"\n\"I see. So, unfortunately, we have to kill them. Can't we just make them fight each other to the death?\"\nTess's suggestion made Arin bite her lip.\nThis was different from controlling the Dokgakgui to kill other Dokgakgui. With the high emotional synchronization and the added feelings from fighting alongside them, her internal conflict grew stronger.\nRian, gripping the handle of his greatsword, spoke.\n\"Then I'll do it. Just hold them in place.\"\nCanis shook his head.\n\"No, this is something Arin must do. As a mind mage aiming for higher realms, she can't remain weak forever.\"\nRelying on her initial spell to stand out had its limits. To reach her goal, she needed to overcome situations like this.\nCanis wished for Arin to remain by his side for a long time.\n\"Arin, remember the promise we made when we were taken to the Magic Association. Our mentor is no longer here. We need to become stronger. This isn't a place where we can afford to show sympathy.\"\nArin closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Canis was right. She had to decide whether to rely on her initial spell or to dominate it. It was a difficult choice, but one she needed to face.\nArin walked the Dokgakgui to the edge of the forest. Then, she made them stab each other's eyes with their horns.\nThe two Dokgakgui fell, facing each other.\nThough still breathing, they could no longer move, leaving no other way to deliver a fatal blow.\nArin forced a smile.\nWatching her, Harvest recalled the time they had faced each other through a glass barrier.\nThe judgment that she was too weak for a mage still lingered, but compared to when she feared everything, she had become a completely different person.\n\"Arin's strength is also her weakness. She easily resonates with others' minds, but that's why she can't become ruthless. Arcane always regretted this aspect.\"\n\"But now she's changing. Arin will manage well.\"\nShirone, sharing in Arin's sadness, felt reassured hearing Harvest and Canis's conversation. Though he had chosen a tough profession, he had companions who would stay with him for life.\n\"Anyway...\"\nShirone began, turning around as his friends directed their gazes towards Kanya and Rena.\nThe two women flinched. The six pairs of eyes showed waves of emotion that didn't match the situation.\n\"They're humans.\"\n\"Yeah, they're humans. They even have swords and shields.\"\n\"Swords and shields. I was dying to see those. The thought of talking to giants uprooting trees made me dizzy.\"\nAs the incomprehensible words continued, Kanya blocked her sister and shouted.\n\"What are you saying? Who are you people?\"\nArin connected to the Spirit Zone and attempted telepathy. As Kanya's thoughts were transmitted, Arin used her initial spell to convey them to Shirone's group.\nShirone tried to speak as kindly as possible.\n\"Uh, so, we came from another place...\"\nKanya's fierce gaze stopped Shirone.\nUnderstanding the previously incomprehensible words, Kanya's tension rose. The lip movements and language didn't match.\n\"What did you do? Is this magic too? Are you Nor?\"\n\"Nor? What's that?\"\nInstead of answering, Kanya extended her right arm. A drone flew down from the sky. The beetle-like device landed on her wrist, then detached into sections, forming a gauntlet.\n\"Language decoding.\"\nA light appeared on the back of the gauntlet.\n\"Say that again.\"\n\"What?\"\nThat was enough. Kanya bent her arm to check the gauntlet.\nNo data. Decoding failed.\nAfter checking the drone's information, she drew her arc. Pulling the handle, she aimed a red dot at Shirone's forehead.\n“W-What are you doing? Suddenly?\"\nHaving observed the arc's power in the forest, Shirone knew how strong it was.\nBeing targeted without knowing the reason left him flustered. This wasn't the reaction one expected when meeting other humans in a monster-infested place.\n\"Rena! These aren't our subjects! We must fight!\"\n“B-But sister... they saved our lives.\"\n\"Now I understand. The Dokgakgui are here because of them. They disrupted the forest's law.\"\nHearing this, Rena couldn't stay still. Though her face showed reluctance, she took up her Sygna and Exed, ready to fight.\n\"You better speak honestly if you don't want your head blown off by the arc. What did you do in this forest? Who are you?\"\nEven if they asked who they were, there was no way to explain. Frustrated, Shirone could only shout.\n\"We're humans too!\"\n\"How can I believe that? You don't speak our language! And you're not heretics either!\"\n\"But we can communicate. Isn't that enough?\"\nKanya frowned. Strangely, Shirone's words were convincing.\n\"So let's talk it out. If we can understand each other, we can find a peaceful solution instead of pointing those weird weapons.\"\n\"Peace? In the Forest of the Profane? You really are suspicious.\"\n\"The Forest of the Profane?\"\n\"Is that the name of this forest?\"\nAfter Arin's explanation, silence followed.\nA tense standoff continued for a while.\nShirone could easily subdue her if he wanted, but he hated fighting.\nThey were human. They could communicate. If she could just let go of her hostility, they could learn more about this world.\nAt that moment, Rena looked up.\nThe drone, patrolling the area, projected a scene from 500 meters away onto her retina. Over twenty Dokgakgui were approaching.\n\"Sister, we're in trouble. It's the Dokgakgui.\"\nKanya finally came to her senses. Staying longer was suicide now that the forest's law was disrupted.\nThe mysterious strangers didn't seem willing to fight. Though she couldn't be sure, if they had defeated the Dokgakgui, they could certainly subdue her.\n\"Follow me. Let's talk after we get out of here.\"\nKanya reverted the gauntlet on her arm to its beetle form and sent it skyward. Confirming the Dokgakgui's position, she chose a direction and entered the forest.\nWithout a word, Shirone's group followed her. Amy mentioned they were moving away from the city.\n***\nKanya led them into a canyon where the jungle and rocky terrain mingled.\nSurrounded by cliffs, they could only see the sky above. Walking along the V-shaped valley's bottom, Shirone could guess how long this world had existed.\nAs they walked, Kanya's group introduced themselves.\nThough still suspicious, Kanya seemed to accept that they had no intention of fighting.\n\"This is the Valley of the Vortex Serpent. With different laws, there shouldn't be any danger.\"\n\"The biggest danger would be Shirone getting hit by that weird weapon.\"\nRian joked, making Kanya squint. Despite her annoyance over the forest incident, she was even more upset.\nGuessing Shirone was the leader, she pointed and asked.\n\"Who are you really? Coming from another world doesn't make sense.\"\n\"But it's true. Whether you believe it or not, that's the only way to explain it. Now, you explain. What kind of world is this? And what about the giant we defeated earlier?\"\n\"Giant? You said giant?\"\n\"Yeah, giant.\"\n\"So, you killed a giant!\"\n\"No, we didn't kill it. What happened was...\"\nBefore Shirone could finish, Kanya grabbed his collar and yelled.\n\"How could you kill a giant, you fool! Giants uphold the law! It was you all along. Killing the giant caused the Dokgakgui to run rampant!\"\nAmy knocked Kanya's hand away. She had held back her temper for information but couldn't tolerate mistreatment of her friend.\n\"I said we didn't kill it! And the giant attacked us first!\"\n\"Of course! You broke the law! The Forest of the Profane is forbidden to humans!\"\nShirone stepped between the two growling women.\n\"We don't understand. Get it? We really came from somewhere else.\"\nKanya was stunned. Nothing Shirone said convinced her, but it was true, so it had to be.\n\"Are you really... from another place?\"\n\"We've been saying that.\"\n\"No, I mean...\"\nKanya's expression turned serious.\nThough just a childhood tale, there was a story about humans from a land ruled by the heavens.\nThey were descendants of the divine, but unable to feel the presence of gods, they lived short, suffering lives as mortals.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

This place is called Purgatory, also known as the Prison of the Earth.”\n“Purgatory? Here?”\n“Yes, it's a prison on earth. It's where heretics who reject the laws live. Now it makes sense. You must have denied the existence of God in the land of the earth. That's why you ended up here.”\nShirone did not correct her misunderstanding. Explaining it wouldn't make her understand, and it wasn't entirely wrong. None of them believed in Aker anyway.\n“You must be descendants of the Nor, given that you can use magic. Unfortunately, there's nothing left for you here in Purgatory except death. Eventually, you'll all die.”\n“Yes, we will eventually die. But so will you.”Kanya lifted her chin, looking a bit proud.\n“Absolutely not. I am one of the chosen ones by God. I am guaranteed eternal life.”\nShirone recalled the myths of Kergos. If someone could grant eternal life, they would surely be considered a god.\nBut it didn't seem realistic.\nAll living things aged and eventually died. Not even magic could prevent death.\nNow that Kanya understood who they were, she seemed more at ease. She disliked heretics, but these people were pitiful souls who had never even had the chance to receive divine power.\n“It can't be helped. You're lucky. Follow me, I'll show you a place where you can stay.”\n“Why are you being so nice all of a sudden? If you're a divine subject and we're heretics, shouldn't you be treating us badly?”\nKanya turned around, knowing no one would follow her.\n“You're very suspicious, which proves you are descendants of the Nor. In Heaven, I would have driven you out, but here it's fine. In Purgatory, no law can protect divine subjects. We're in the same situation. Anyway, we need to hurry. It's dangerous after sunset.”\nAs they ventured deeper into the canyon, the cliffs grew taller. It was a desolate place with not even a single flying insect. There was some moisture and echoing sounds. In the vastness of nature, only their footsteps could be heard.\n“We won't encounter anything strange, will we?”\n“Don't worry. The Valley of the Vortex Serpent is governed by a powerful law, so dangerous monsters like the Dokgakgui don't live here.”\n“What kind of law?”\n“The Vortex Serpent. It's a monster said to have lived here for over ten thousand years. But it should be sleeping now. It doesn't come out during the day. That's why we need to hurry. We must reach the Nor's Haven before sunset.”\n“You said we are descendants of the Nor. Then, aren't the Nor divine subjects?”\n“Of course, they are.”\n“Then why is there a Nor's Haven in Purgatory?”\nKanya felt frustrated but remembered where they had come from and added an explanation.\n“There are three races in Heaven. The Nor are one of them. Divine subjects have a predetermined lifespan from birth, and when it ends, they gain eternal life. But it seems some Nor couldn't accept this. So, they escaped to Purgatory and created an independent society.”\nShirone didn't fully understand the concept of a predetermined lifespan, but he let it go for now. At least it was less strange than the idea of gaining eternal life.\nHe appreciated Kanya's consideration. She was guiding them to a society of the Nor because she believed they were descendants of the Nor.\n“Thank you, Kanya. You're very kind.”\n“What are you talking about? No divine subject is kind to heretics. We're going there because we need something too, so don't misunderstand. Once we reach the Nor's Haven, don't expect any acknowledgment from me.”\nDespite her harsh words, she couldn't meet Shirone's eyes.\nSeeing Kanya's shyness, Rena puffed out her cheeks and added a comment.\n“That's right. My sister is going because she needs something. But I'm going because I genuinely want to help.”\n“Haha! Thanks, Rena. You're very kind.”\nRena blushed at Shirone's compliment.\nKanya stopped walking. She understood that it was natural for her sister to be drawn to the stranger during this sensitive time, but as a divine subject under the law, such thoughts were unacceptable.\nShe grabbed Rena's wrist and pulled her towards the cliff. Shirone's group watched in confusion as she whispered urgently.\n“Rena, what's wrong with you? You know we can never be with heretics. Even having such thoughts is blasphemy.”\n“I know. But that guy is…”\n“No means no! You may be naïve, but it's not all about looks. Choosing a man like that can lead to disaster.”\n“How would you know? You don't have a boyfriend either.”\n“You'll understand when you grow up. Anyway, listen to me, okay? From now on, be cold to that guy.”\n“It's not because he's handsome, it's because he's kind.”\n“Kind? That guy?”\nKanya looked at Rena in disbelief. How should she take her sister's words?\nShirone was certainly a unique boy but she felt that his free-spiritedness was because he was a heretic. Such freedom led to corruption. Associating with Shirone was dangerous.\n“Tell me clearly. Do you like handsome guys or kind guys?”\nRena, at fourteen, was at the age to feel love. Kanya, who had to act as a mother soon, felt the need to correct her sister's thinking.\n“Of course, both. He has to be handsome and kind.”\n“Ugh, I really can't understand you.”\n“Don't worry, sister. I won't fall in love with someone I've only known for a day. And... we're not so different from them right now.”\nDivine subjects entering Purgatory without permission was a violation of the law. They could be punished, but it was something they couldn't give up.\nHowever, bringing her sister along was something she regretted.\nEven if Rena had a longer lifespan than she did, it was an irresponsible decision as her sister.\n“I'm sorry, Rena. I…”\n“I know, sister. Besides, I insisted on coming. You don't have to take on all the risks alone. I want to give our mother a gift too.”\nKanya patted Rena's head. The child who once cried for milk had grown up so much. She hoped Rena would receive the divine grace and enjoy eternal life.\nBecause she was a lovely child, Ra would surely grant it.\n“Alright, let's go quickly.”\nThe canyon was turning into a maze. Shallow streams flowed through narrow paths, making the air damp.\nAmy noticed, using her Red Eye, that Kanya's route was becoming erratic.\nIt was typical behavior for someone who was lost.\n“It’s quite far. Is the Nor's Haven still a long way off?”\n“We're not going there. We don't know where the Nor's Haven is.”\n“What? You said we were going to the Nor's Haven.”\n“That's our destination. There's no way we, divine subjects, would know where the place made by the escaped Nor is.”\nSensing Amy's frustration, Kanya added.\n“Don't worry. We still have a way.”\n“What way?”\n“We'll use the drone. The Nor's Haven is an open market where anyone can go. A guide from the market is waiting in the Valley of the Vortex Serpent. We just need to find that person. So, the drone is searching for a place where someone could stay.”\nShirone looked up at the two drones flying in the sky.\nThose flying machines would be considered ancient relics in his world. However, their technology was far more advanced.\nHe wondered what expression Nade would make if he saw them.\n“I understand that the machine is scouting, but how do we see what it finds?”\nKanya poked her temple and said.\n“It's connected to my head. It's called a frequency.”\n“Frequency?”\n“It's like an invisible signal. Think of it as similar to sound. It's called retinal vision. When the drone sends a signal to my frequency, an image appears on my retina. Look closely at my left eye.”\nAn electric field-like image appeared in Kanya's pupil, quickly displaying an aerial view of the canyon. Despite its small size, the resolution was high enough to see the unfolding scenery.\n“This is the canyon from the drone's perspective. You might not see it clearly, but it takes up half my field of vision. The image appears directly on my retina.”\n“Amazing technology.”\nTess couldn't hide her envy. She had always been fascinated by ancient relics, and drones could revolutionize espionage.\n“Where can I get one of these?”\n“You don't get it; they're issued. Only the Mecha tribe receives these. At twelve, you get a drone.”\n“So you can't sneak one out?”\n“No. They’re strictly controlled. If caught, you'd face severe punishment.”\n“I see. I wish I had one...”\n“Other divine subjects envy drones too. But even if you had one, it wouldn't work for anyone else. It has a personal encryption. If the owner changes, it deactivates immediately.”\nKnowing it was an item for one person only, Tess felt even more frustrated. She wanted one. But being a state-issued item, it wasn't something she could buy.\nJealous, Tess fell silent.\n“I found a place where the Nor might be staying. It's not far from here.”\nKanya started running, arriving at the cave entrance.\nThe drone landed on her hand, transforming into a gauntlet.\nThe final captured scene appeared on the surface. Comparing it to the view, Kanya confirmed it was the right place and approached the cave.\nAt that moment, Tess raised her hand to stop her.\n“Wait. I smell blood.”\n“Blood? I don't smell anything.”\n“Haha, of course not. I’ve been trained since childhood. Your machine can’t smell?”\n“What? The Mecha tribe's technology can distinguish 140,000 scents. The drone just doesn't have that function.”\nOnly then did the group realize Tess and the drone were having a subtle rivalry.\nIndeed, the drone's reconnaissance ability was impressive. But Rian found Tess's jealousy towards a metal object ridiculous.\n“Enough. Just get on with it. Don't feel inferior to a machine.”\nFeeling better at Rian's words, Tess used her Sensory Schema to trace the scent of blood.\nTaking a step into the cave, she scanned the interior and looked outside for a while.\nAfter her analysis, she spoke to the group.\n“There’s definitely a scent of blood inside. Someone is in there, but it seems they haven't left the cave.”\n“Why? Isn't there any blood outside?”\n“No. The scent is stronger inside, suggesting they didn't leave.”\n“But you checked outside for a long time?”\n“It's a kind of manual. If there was blood outside, the cave might be a trap.”\n“So, it's not a trap. Let's go in.”\nShirone cast the lighting spell Shining.\nAs the orb of light floated above his palm, Kanya and Rena were startled. The Nor could use magic, but they had never seen such a spell in Heaven.\n“Sister, did you see that? He made light with his body.”\n“Yeah. The people from the land use strange magic.”\n“Yes. But doesn’t that light... look like it?”\n“Rena! Such thoughts are blasphemy. Apologize in your heart right now.”\nRena's expression turned sullen. The fact that her sister understood her thoughts meant she was thinking the same thing.\nNevertheless, blasphemy was a sin, so she silently asked Ra for forgiveness.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

They were large and fast enough to crush a human.\nShirone's group instinctively backed away.\nFrom a safe distance, they saw dozens of pillars crisscrossing from the cave walls, creating a bizarre sight.\n“Is everyone okay? Anyone hurt?” Shirone called out.Amy's response came quickly.\n“Yeah, I think we're all fine. What about you, Shirone?”\n“I'm fine too. Could this have been a trap?”\n“No, there are no signs of artificial modifications in the cave. Besides, the activation was too quick for a trap,” Tess said.\nTess was right. If they truly wanted to kill them, the trap would have been set off at a point where escape was impossible. But these pillars seemed designed to block their advance rather than kill.\n“If it’s not a trap, then what is it?”\nA boy’s voice echoed from the end of the cave.\n“Identify yourselves! I won't miss this time!”\nShirone extended his Shining spell, illuminating the interior.\nA boy of similar age was crouched, with both hands on the ground. Behind him sat a bearded man with a strong presence, sitting with his legs stretched out and blood seeping through his fingers clutched over his stomach.\nIt was the guide from Nor’s Haven, Gardrock.\nGardrock, scrutinizing Shirone's group, spoke to his apprentice.\n“Clove, I told you not to use earth magic in the cave. If the ceiling collapses, we’ll all die.”\nClove slowly stood up, but his wary eyes remained fixed on them.\nShirone felt a strange familiarity from their conversation. Although he didn’t understand the Nor language, the pronunciation and intonation were similar to the common language of the continent.\nKanya approached them, speaking in Nor’s language.\n“You are Nor, right? We’ve been looking for you.”\n“Oh? It seems you're esteemed divine subjects. So, what brings you Mecha tribe, who hate exploration and adventure, here?”\n“Of course, we are here for Nor’s Haven…”\nKanya paused to examine Gardrock’s condition. Though he was smiling, his face was pale.\nBlood was flowing from his stomach.\nIt was strange. What could cause an injury in the Valley of the Vortex Serpent, where only one law exists?\n“You're hurt? Was it the Vortex Serpent?”\n“No, it wasn't the law. It was the Kergos.”\nThe term “Kergos” hit Shirone’s group hard. They initially thought they had misheard, but Kanya, translating Nor’s language, confirmed it.\n“Kergos? They came hunting all the way here?”\n“This place has no heretics, so it’s not really hunting. They deliberately targeted us. I avoided a fatal wound, but if the bleeding continues, who knows what will happen.”\nShirone interrupted their conversation.\n“Did you say Kergos? What did they do?”\n“Kergos are another race of divine subjects. The Valley of the Vortex Serpent is safe because no monsters live here, but it’s a common route for heretics trying to reach Nor’s Haven. And where there are heretics, there are other hunters.”\n“So, the Kergos hunt heretics.”\n“They'll probably catch up soon. They are excellent trackers. Plus, they use the Giants' techniques. Finding this place by scent, like Tess, wouldn't be a problem for them.”\nShirone guessed that the Giants' techniques referred to Schema. If so, there was no time for idle talk.\nArin tried telepathy directly with the Nor.\n“Can you take us to Nor’s Haven?”\nGardrock and Clove’s expressions turned to astonishment. Although the language was incomprehensible, the meaning was understood.\n“What are these kids? Do they have the power of fairies?”\n“No, they’re from the land of the earth. They use magic like you. It might be different, but they seem to be descendants of the Nor.”\nKanya framed Shirone's group in a way that would make the Nor more accepting. Survival in Purgatory depended on integrating into the Nor community.\n“So, are they mock beings?”\nClove’s gaze turned disdainful.\nThe Nor, known for their curiosity, were the most law-abiding race in Heaven. They knew more forbidden secrets than even the Mecha tribe.\nThe same was true for knowledge about the land of the earth.\nThe land of the earth was said to be a shadow imitation of the perfect world of Heaven. Hence, humans there were considered mere imitations of the divine beings in Heaven.\nTo Clove, Shirone's group was less than anything in Heaven. The gap between the Nor and mock beings was as vast as that between creator and creation.\n“Mock beings? What’s that?” Shirone asked.\nIgnoring Shirone, Clove pointed to the bags lined along the wall.\n“Hey, you lot. Come and carry these. One each.”\nThere was no need for telepathy. Clove’s tone was filled with contempt. His arrogant posture made Amy retort sharply.\n“Why should we carry your bags?”\n“Isn’t it obvious? We need to flee.”\n“Then why should we carry them?”\n“Because you’re mock beings. Without us, you wouldn’t exist. You should be grateful.”\nClove seemed to believe it was a given that Shirone’s group would obey his orders.\nMeanwhile, he sneered and touched Amy’s hair, his nostrils flaring.\n“For a mock being, you’re not bad. How about joining my household? Don’t you want to live safely in Purgatory?”\nAmy’s eyes grew sharp.\nThe issue of divine subjects and mock beings was one thing, but touching a woman without consent was simply bad manners, unrelated to Heaven’s customs.\n“Get your hand off. Or I’ll knock you out.”\n“Haha! You? Knock me out? I guess mock beings can use a bit of magic. But you can't beat me.”\n“Enough, Clove.”\nThe anger in Gardrock’s voice made Clove step back.\nOnly then did the group feel the tension in the air. Shirone's group glared at Clove with murderous intent in their eyes.\n“What? What will you do if you glare at me?”\n“Clove, we don’t have time. Do you want me to die here?”\nRealizing his master’s condition, Clove hurriedly supported Gardrock. Leaning on his apprentice’s shoulder, Gardrock apologized.\n“Sorry. Even I have never seen mock beings before, so our response was inadequate. Anyway, you’re human too. I am Gardrock. We need to leave here. Can you help? You seem to be heading to Nor’s Haven. We’ll guide you.”\nGardrock, unlike Clove, acted more like a mage. Apologizing in front of his apprentice wasn't easy, but he understood that cooperation was essential for survival, whether they were mock beings or not.\nShirone's group agreed, knowing it was dangerous to stay longer, and shouldered the backpacks.\nThey reached the area where Clove’s pillars were intertwined.\nSupporting Gardrock, Clove struggled to find a way through.\nAmy smirked. Seeing him suffer from his own magic was satisfying, but it also indicated his lack of foresight.\nShirone was less concerned with Clove and more intrigued by the magic he had used.\nThe magic that caused pillars to emerge from the walls was forceful and dynamic. But replicating it in a way he knew seemed highly inefficient.\nPerhaps ancient magic had different principles. With this thought, Shirone asked Gardrock.\n“What kind of magic is that?”\nClove, with a mocking laugh, answered instead.\n“Haha! What, you can’t do it? This is ridiculous. Earth magic is basic.”\nWinking at Amy, he added.\n“I could teach you, though.”\n“No thanks. I don’t want my friends to suffer.”\nMocking Clove’s earlier behavior, Amy’s comment made his face turn red.\nGardrock, too, was curious about Shirone’s magic. Despite being mock beings, they wielded unusual magic.\nHe knew that the light orb Shirone was holding was impossible to create in this place. The cave was a domain of darkness.\nUnless he had a contract with a light spirit, which didn’t seem to be the case given its inactivity.\n“Hmmm, it's hard to explain. Do you not use such magic?”\n“We use earth-based magic, but nothing like creating pillars in caves.”\n“The principles might differ. We borrow the power of nature to use magic. Fire magic where there is fire, water magic where there is water. Clove used earth magic for the same reason. He just didn’t consider the collapse risk.”\n“I really was desperate back then, master,” Clove defended.\nBut Shirone’s group wasn’t listening. They were engaged in a telepathic conversation through the mental channel, ignoring Clove’s rambling.\n-Using the power of nature is quite unique.\n-The destructive power was significant. The magic Clove used would be quite advanced in our world. Yet he did it easily despite being so dumb.\nAmy added to Canis’s remark.\n-The advantage of borrowing nature’s power isn’t just its strength. One person can handle multiple types of magic. It’s different from our specialized training.\nArin pointed out a drawback.\n-But it also limits flexibility. They’re bound by the environment. If the desired element isn’t present, they can’t cast the magic.\nSummarizing ancient magic: it was broad, powerful, and versatile but heavily constrained by the environment. Sometimes, the magic itself could be sealed depending on the conditions.\nHeaven’s magic versus Earth’s magic. Determining which was more efficient remained uncertain.\nOutside the cave, Kanya looked back at Gardrock and asked.\n“So, where is Nor’s Haven?”\n“I can’t tell the Mecha tribe that. Just know it’s not here. We have to use magic to get there, but it’s impossible here. Follow me.”\nAt that moment, Rena, receiving a signal from the drone, checked her retinal vision and shouted.\n“Sister! Big trouble!”\nKanya also closed one eye to receive the drone’s information. A group was approaching rapidly from a nearby canyon.\n“Damn, it’s the Kergos! We need to hurry!”\nGardrock’s eyes filled with resignation.\n“It’s too late. Their sense of smell is incredibly sharp. They’ve caught the scent of blood.”\nThere was still no sound of their approach. Yet, if they had detected the scent of blood, it meant at least one of them was a master of sensory skills.\n“What do we do? What do we do, master?” Clove asked, panicking.\nGardrock had no brilliant ideas.\nAccording to Rena, there were about twenty pursuers. Gardrock was injured, and Clove lacked combat experience. If they clashed now, it would be a massacre.\n“Perhaps, we can try this.”\nAll eyes turned to Shirone.\n***\nThe Kergos pursuit squad, riding black horses, galloped across the stream.\nTheir red armor reflected the sun, and their eyes gleamed like newly forged swords.\nArriving at the cave, the squad leader raised his hand to halt.\n“Stop! They’re inside the cave!”\nLeading the group, the twenty subordinates stopped. A woman with her hair tied in a ponytail rode up to the leader's side.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

They are at a disadvantage in confined spaces. They know this and are luring us in.”\nThe captain used his Schema ability to shout, making the cave echo.\n“If you don't come out immediately, you'll face severe consequences! I’ll count to three!”\nHis subordinates drew their bows and nocked arrows.\nAlthough not explosive like an Arc, arrows propelled by Schema's strength could pierce even rocks. If they fired into the cave, there would be no escape from the barrage.“One!”\nThe cave remained silent.\n“Two!”\nThe captain’s face twisted in frustration. Were they planning to die?\nThe only thing the Nor could do was use earth magic to block the cave. But that wouldn’t last long and would cut off their escape route.\n“Three!”\nA red dot appeared on the captain’s forehead.\nSomething shot out from the cave, and the captain instinctively drew his sword to block it.\nBut before he realized what it was, the projectile exploded.\n“Damn it…!”\nWith a loud explosion, a fireball engulfed the captain.\nThe blast also affected his subordinates, causing the startled horses to rear and buck wildly.\nAt that moment, Shirone’s group dashed out of the cave.\nThe captain, fallen from his horse, glared at them, his body smoking. He stood up, planting his sword in the ground, and shouted, looking at the chaotic scene.\n“They are with the Mecha tribe! Don’t let them escape!”\nThey had been chasing the Nor and hadn’t expected the Mecha tribe to be involved.\nShirone had used this blind spot to their advantage.\nTheir plan had worked. Kanya and Rena had waited for the pursuers, timing their Arc shots to create an escape opportunity.\n“There are too many enemies! Find us a narrow path!” Shirone called out.\nKanya checked the terrain with the drone and adjusted their direction.\nThe pursuers fired arrows.\nEven at a hundred meters, the arrows flew straight, barely missing Shirone’s group.\nClove turned around in frustration.\n“I’ll buy us some time!”\n“No! Just keep running!”\n“But we need to save face for the Nor!”\nClove dipped his hands into the shallow water and cast the ancient magic, Sheaving.\nThe stream began to freeze, turning white as it did.\nCrack!\nThe sound of freezing water echoed through the canyon, and pillars similar to those seen in the cave rose from the icy surface.\nEven while running, Shirone watched this spectacle.\nThe scale of the ancient magic, harnessing the power of nature, was far greater than he had anticipated. The stream froze, and numerous pillars obstructed the view, preventing the horsemen from advancing.\nA loud cracking sound followed as the ice shattered.\nThe group’s faces turned pale. The pursuers had abandoned their horses and were smashing through the ice pillars with swords and fists, closing in on them.\n“Are the Nor and Mecha colluding? How typical of heretics!”\nKanya aimed her Arc and shouted.\n“We are divine subjects! You have no right to interfere with fellow divine subjects!”\nThe moment she released the handle, the Arc’s projectile shot forward.\nA warrior wielding a longsword cleaved the projectile in half. Moments later, two fireballs exploded behind him.\n“Those who defy the law will be beheaded! We are the first chosen by the gods!”\nThe Kergos pursuit squad brandished their weapons and roared.\nTheir appearance was unlike the Kergos civilization Shirone had seen in his world. Their luxurious armor and extravagant accessories marked them as nobles among the divine subjects.\nShirone, running alongside Kanya, asked.\n“Why are they acting like this? Aren't we all divine subjects? Why are they fighting us?”\n“It’s heretic hunting. They are the most devout among the divine subjects. That makes them arrogant and hostile to other divine subjects. It's best not to get involved with them.”\nShirone fell silent. They were already deeply involved.\n“Annoying as they are, they’re strong because they use the Giants' techniques. In Purgatory, anything goes. If they catch us, we won't die easily.”\nThe distance between the pursuers and them was closing.\nEvery single one of the pursuers used Schema, and Shirone’s group had an injured Gardrock.\nGardrock shouted to Clove.\n“Clove! Cast Aeos!”\n“It’s too dangerous! You're injured!”\n“We’ll die like this anyway! Hey, we’ll go ahead!”\nGardrock cast the wind magic, Aeos. As he floated up, Clove followed with the same magic.\nShirone recalled the Fly spell when seeing Aeos. If it worked similarly, maintaining balance in the narrow canyon would be challenging.\nAs expected, the two of them wobbled the higher they went. They seemed about to crash into the cliffs at any moment.\nWithout them, there was no way to reach Nor’s Haven. Shirone knew they had to be saved and communicated with his friends.\n-Take one person each! Let’s use teleportation!\nCanis wanted to use Dark Port, but with four mages needing to move two Mecha tribe members and two swordsmen, they had to opt for the Photonic Transformation spell.\nAmy grabbed Tess, and Shirone took hold of Rian. Canis and Arin each gripped Kanya and Rena’s hands.\nMeanwhile, the pursuers closed in.\nThe leading Kergos soldier raised his sword from horseback. The silver longsword came crashing down towards Shirone’s head like a bolt of lightning.\nAt that moment, Shirone’s group transformed into beams of light and soared upwards.\nGardrock and Clove nearly lost their spells in shock.\nNot only had they created light, but they had become light, moving the Mecha tribe members with them, a feat unimaginable in Heaven.\nAt least, by human standards.\n“How can they use light magic without borrowing the power of nature?”\nAncient magic always required the power of nature. Among the elements, light was the most difficult.\nLight is a weak and dispersed force. Even ancient magic that borrowed nature's power had trouble focusing light.\nNor could only use light magic where there was a Shining Spot.\nClove felt troubled.\nIn a flash, Shirone’s group, using teleportation, caught up with the rising Gardrock and Clove, defying his expectation of the mock beings as worthless and incompetent.\nClove had thought Shirone’s Shining spell merely transferred light from a Shining Spot. But they produced light from their bodies.\nAs far as he knew, only one entity in Heaven, aside from Ra, could control light.\nArin, reading the Nor’s emotions, conveyed through the mental channel.\n-The Nor don’t know teleportation magic.\nAmy scoffed.\n-Of course not. The theory of photonic transformation is one of the greatest discoveries in magic history, even in our world. They underestimate the geniuses of the land of the earth.\nAmy felt proud of being born in the land of the earth.\nBut the Kergos of Heaven were formidable too. They were using external force to run vertically up the cliff.\nAmy lay horizontally and fired a Fire Strike.\nSeeing the incoming flames, the pursuers split left and right. They circled the cliff and closed the gap with Shirone’s group.\n-Damn! They’re persistent!\n-Let me try.\nArin extended her tentacles and attempted Mind Control.\nMost of the pursuers resisted, but one fell under her spell. The controlled warrior swung his sword at his comrades, disrupting their formation.\n“You fools!”\nThe captain, watching from below, wrinkled his nose. He took a deep breath and roared at the cliff.\nIt was a Schema technique, Howling.\n“Awooooooo!”\nThe reverberations of the Howling hit the mages, breaking the Nor’s Aeos.\nShirone concentrated, enduring the shock. The technique shook his mind.\nHe cast teleportation to save the falling Gardrock. As he grabbed Gardrock, Amy flew in and caught Clove by the ankle.\nShe cast the photonic transformation spell to reset their inertia. Shirone descended with Rian and Gardrock, followed by his friends, who landed one by one.\n“Damn it! Howling is always the problem. The Nor are a poor match against the Kergos.”\nGardrock made excuses, embarrassed. Apparently, the master and apprentice were not so different.\nThen he wondered why Shirone’s group was unaffected by the Howling.\n“Hey, why are you okay?”\nSometimes naive questions are more irritating. Canis replied gruffly.\n“Do we look okay? Our heads are splitting.”\n“Then how did you cast magic?”\n“We just endured it. If this shakes you, don’t call yourself a mage.”\nUnlike the Nor, who borrowed nature's power, the land of the earth’s magic combined omniscience and omnipotence. It was a more complex and demanding method.\nHowever, this inefficiently honed focus strengthened their mental resilience.\nMoreover, Shirone’s group had many with special abilities.\nMental defenses were Arin’s specialty, Amy was immune due to her Inner Eye, and Shirone had an indomitable mental fortitude comparable to the Inner Eye’s effects.\nClove landed face-first in the stream. Rising in anger, he glared at Amy.\n“You! How dare you slam me down?”\nHe could no longer tolerate her arrogance. Despite her vile temperament, it had a charm he tolerated. But now, this mock being had overstepped.\n“I’ll never forgive…!”\nClove stopped, feeling a chill.\nAmy’s eyes glowed red. Her expression as she glared at the pursuers was ghostly cold.\nWithout turning her gaze, Amy spoke.\n“Don’t touch me during battle. I’ll indulge you later.”\nClove slowly turned his head. The Kergos pursuit squad was approaching, eyes gleaming like predators.\nClove’s face turned grim.\n“It’s over. We’ll be caught and tortured to death…”\n“Stop whining and get inside if you’re not fighting.”\nShowing weakness when already at a disadvantage was counterproductive.\nWhen Amy grabbed Clove’s collar and pulled him, his legs gave out, and he fell on his butt.\nThis time, Gardrock didn’t care for his apprentice. He was too focused on Amy.\n“Do you have a plan?”\n“I can’t be sure, but it looks like we timed it right. Shirone, is everything ready?”\n“Yes, just barely.”\nGardrock tilted his head in confusion.\n“What are you talking about? Ready for what?”\nShirone looked up at the sky. His Spirit Zone, a warped four-dimensional target, reached into the sky. It took time to transform into its unique shape.\nWithout touching anyone, Shirone cast the photonic transformation spell on them all. This was a magic he had perfected at the cost of his life on the cliff of the impassable bridge, known as Mass Teleport.\n“Hurry! They’re about to escape again!”\nThe pursuit squad's captain urged his men forward. He took a deep breath and unleashed another Howling.\nThe roar swept over Shirone’s group. Gardrock and Clove winced, but Shirone’s Indomitable Mentality remained unshaken. Compared to Marsha’s Sonic Cannon, this was nothing.\nShirone calmly watched the captain, then cast Mass Teleport.\nA bright flash engulfed them, lifting the group to the cliff top, where the Spirit Zone connected.\n“Damn! Howling didn’t work!”\nThe pursuit squad captain gritted his teeth, fuming.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

He had never seen a spell that transformed into a giant flash of light and flew into the sky.\n“How did they do that? Who are they?”\nTwo pursuit specialists began tracking Shirone’s group. One sniffed like a dog, while the other tilted his head back, tongue out.\nThe man using his sense of smell admitted defeat.\n“Captain, the wind is blocked. We can’t track them.”\nThe man using his sense of taste held out a bit longer. He had his tongue out to his chin, but then he retracted it, his eyes rolling back to normal.“I can catch them with taste. This way.”\nThe captain mounted his horse as the rear guard arrived. Turning in the direction indicated by the tracker, he commanded.\n“They’ve just gone over one wall! They can't have gone far! Pursue them!”\n“Ki-ra-ra-ra-ra!”\nThe pursuit team let out a screeching cry and retraced their path.\nOne minute later, Shirone’s group descended to their original location on the flash of light.\nShirone had proposed using the Kergos' tracking ability against them.\nThe area was already saturated with scents, making it impossible to track. The pursuers would only return here after checking all other locations.\nGardrock was again supported by Clove. Pointing to a deep crevice in the canyon, he said.\n“Thanks to you, we’re safe. We shouldn’t run into them for a while. Let’s go this way. There should be a path.”\nAmy, skeptical, asked.\n“Where exactly is Nor’s Haven? How much farther?”\n“That’s what I want to ask you. How do you control light magic so freely? Do you extract it from the air?”\n“We don’t use such methods. Why do you ask?”\n“To reach Nor’s Haven, we need a place where light converges. It’s similar to the spell you used but can travel much farther. Just trust me and follow. There’s a Shining Spot not far from here.”\nGardrock’s mentioned magic seemed to be a form of spatial movement. Using the power of photons at a place where light converged to reach Nor’s Haven in one go.\nIt was a smart choice. Even if the pursuers killed the guide, Nor’s Haven would remain hidden.\nThe Nor's way of thinking was certainly that of a mage. A place where such people gathered—what kind of place would Nor’s Haven be?\nWith a small sense of excitement, Shirone followed the crevice to the other side of the canyon.\n***\n“Where could they be hiding?”\nThe pursuit captain was frustrated. They had been searching the area for 20 minutes without finding any trace.\nA group of scouts rode in, their eyes reflecting their failure.\n“Nothing, sir. No signs in the Maru Valley or the Fan Creek.”\n“Damn! We almost had them!”\n“But sir, isn't it strange? How did they escape? That place wasn’t a Shining Spot the Nor talk about.”\nThe captain had been pondering the same.\nAs far as he knew, no Nor mage could use such magic. They might be outsiders, but they resembled humans.\nHaving hunted heretics for 400 years, he recalled a hint from ancient history.\n“Could they be… humans from the land?”\nA sharp light flashed in the captain's eyes. If they were from the land, the pursuit was a different matter entirely.\nThe Mecha delved into what was known, the Nor into what was unknown, but the Kergos sought out the divine, knowing all truths as the only true divine subjects.\nHumans from the land weren’t just imitations. To the Kergos, they were a significant variable that could affect the law.\n“Stop the pursuit. We return to Shamain. Reporting comes first.”\nThe captain and his subordinates turned their horses.\nAt that moment, a tremor shook the ground.\nEveryone casually looking around opened their eyes wide as the tremors intensified.\n“Could it be…?”\nThe reason the Nor used the canyon as a base was that, apart from one law, it was a safe zone free from harm.\nSo, this tremor should never have happened. A Vortex Serpent appearing during daylight was an unprecedented event.\n“The law… is breaking.”\nA strong wind blew, shrouding the sight of the twenty in darkness.\nNothing could be seen, followed by screams and cries.\nAs time passed, their cries faded.\nWhen the darkness lifted, sunlight shone on the cold canyon. Thousands of pieces of flesh floated in the red stream.\n***\n“Shamain?”\nShirone looked puzzled, and Kanya realized she had been brief, adding more detail. Encountering people from outside Heaven often made her forget they were from the land of the earth.\n“Shamain is a district where divine subjects live. It’s also called the First Heaven.”\n“The First Heaven? Does that mean the first sky?”\nGardrock, less burdened as a heretic explaining Heaven, answered.\n“Heaven is divided into seven zones, from the First to the Seventh Heaven. The place where divine subjects live is called Shamain.”\nShirone recalled the view from the sky.\nWithin the giant circular walls, six sectors were pie-like, with another sector in the center.\nThe seven heavens Gardrock mentioned referred to this.\n“Do all races live together in Shamain?”\n“Yes. While their living areas differ, they all reside in the First Heaven. Even the Kergos behave in Heaven because divine subjects are fundamentally protected by the law. But Purgatory is outside divine jurisdiction. Surviving here isn’t easy.”\n“How many races live here?”\n“Including Purgatory, countless. There are many creatures whose origins are unknown, called outsiders. The Dokgakgui you encountered are outsiders too. But only three races uphold the divine law. Each has its strengths and works together to form the foundation of Heaven. The Nor love exploration, and the Mecha love research.”\n“Then what do the Kergos like?”\nGardrock's lips curled.\n“They love God.”\n“Gardrock! That’s blasphemous!”\nKanya rebuked him, but Gardrock didn’t care.\nSince deciding to become a heretic, no law governed him. He had exchanged divine protection for a painful life, but that too was his choice.\n“The Kergos love to fight. Their role is hunting. They are the only race allowed in Purgatory. Of course, they interpret this privilege differently.”\nThis time, even Kanya couldn’t disagree.\n“They're a detestable race. Using the Giants' abilities doesn’t make them Giants. It’s annoying to see them mimic the law-abiders.”\n“But what exactly is the law?”\nWhen Shirone first heard of the law, he interpreted it as he knew, but over time, it seemed to differ from his world’s concept.\nKanya looked incredulous.\n“You don’t know the law? Does the land of the earth have no laws?”\n“No, we do. I mean, do you have to follow it strictly?”\n“Of course. The law is the will of the great Ra. Those who oppose it cannot exist. That’s why it’s called the law.”\nShirone spread his hands, exasperated.\n“But we’re breaking the law now.”\nKanya grew frustrated.\n“That’s why we’re in this situation in Purgatory! Can’t you understand? Would you want to live here forever?”\nClove countered Kanya’s disdain for Purgatory.\n“What’s so bad about it? It’s much better than living in a cramped place forever.”\n“Oh, really? Then try living well, always hunted by the Kergos.”\nBefore Clove could retort, Gardrock spoke.\n“That’s possible. We defied the law and were banished to Purgatory, but so what? At least we gained freedom.”\n“How is that freedom? It’s just fear, not knowing when you’ll die.”\n“We don’t know when we’ll die. But at least the right to die is mine. Isn’t that enough?”\nKanya’s expression hardened.\nDivine subjects were said to gain eternal life, but death remained a sensitive issue. Heretics speaking of the right to die mocked Heaven.\nUnable to contain her anger, Kanya snapped.\n“Divine subjects should follow the law! Running away and talking about freedom and the right to die won’t make your lives better! That’s why I dislike the Nor.”\nRena intervened.\n“Stop, sister. Fighting a heretic won’t change the outcome.”\nKanya knew. Talking with those standing against the law was pointless.\nBut Gardrock, living in Purgatory for so long, had much pent up.\n“Do you really think that way? That you're right?”\n“Of course! We’re different! We’re here because Heaven doesn’t use elixirs. Once we get the items, we’ll return to Shamain and live happily under divine protection!”\n“No need to dress it up. You’re just a creature thirsty for eternal life.”\nKanya’s eyes filled with rage.\nShe had tolerated the blasphemy up to now because there was a line. But Gardrock had just crossed it.\n“No matter how heretical you are, I won’t forgive such words. I could kill you right here.”\n“Sister, don’t.”\nKanya shook off her sister’s hand and drew her Arc. Gardrock, however, looked at her calmly, almost sympathetically.\n“Then why did you seek me out? What are you looking for in Nor’s Haven?”\nKanya’s shoulder twitched as she aimed the Arc.\n“Isn’t it obvious? Soon, someone in your family will receive a life-saving elixir, right? So you came to buy Nor’s medicine.”\nThe Arc wavered. At this distance, releasing the handle would leave no time to block the projectile. But she couldn’t fire. Uncontrollable tears streamed down her face.\n“What’s wrong with caring for my parents? This has nothing to do with the law! I just… I just want my mom to…”\nMen from Heaven were also weak to women’s tears, so Gardrock’s anger softened. He had once been a divine subject. He understood Kanya’s feelings well.\nRena hugged her sister and spoke to Gardrock.\n“I’m sorry. My sister…”\n“I understand. No need to apologize to a heretic. The Mecha tribe values family bonds. She must be very worried. It’s all because of this injury.”\nGardrock sheepishly examined his wound. His muscles were cut, but his organs were intact. The bleeding wasn’t severe, but it hadn’t stopped.\nTurning away, Gardrock said.\n“Don’t worry. The Nor don’t attach emotions to items. You’ll get what you want but the elixir will cost a lot. The Nor are skilled traders.”\nKanya wiped her tears and spoke firmly.\n“Don’t worry. I saved enough over a year.”\nGardrock’s lips formed a sad smile as he walked away.\nWatching their exchange, Shirone felt melancholic. Many words were unfamiliar, and the emotions behind them were unclear, but this place wasn’t ruled by absolute values either.\nWhat is the life-saving elixir? Is Ra truly a god?

It was a narrow gap, just wide enough for one person to pass through, and a single beam of light was shining through it.\n“Look here.”\nGardrock pointed to the center of the beam of light. Only there was the light clustered together. It looked fluffy like snowflakes, but upon closer inspection, you could see particles of light swirling around.\nShirone peered at it and scratched his head. How could he explain this? Naturally, light particles clumping together like this was impossible.The Nor didn’t think differently either.\nGardrock, emphasizing the peculiarity of the phenomenon, cupped the light particles with both hands and said, “Do you see how the light gathers here?”\n“Yes, but how is this possible?”\n“This place is imbued with the essence of light.”\n“So, this essence is gathering the light?”\n“No, it’s the light that stayed for so long that the essence settled. Essence can inhabit anything—wind, water, even thoughts—as long as those thoughts remain unchanged for a very long time.”\nShirone thought it was similar to the concept of mana stones.\nWhen a certain quality accumulates over a long period, the essence of that quality materializes.\n“When essence accumulates for a long time, it becomes a spirit. A spirit is essentially an active form of essence. Moreover, humans can make contracts with spirits. If you contract with a light spirit, you can draw on the power of light anytime, anywhere. But finding one is like plucking a star from the sky.”\nShirone pointed at the essence and said, “So, this light will become a spirit eventually?”\n“Haha, yes, maybe in a thousand years, as long as it doesn’t dissipate in the meantime.”\nA thousand years was far longer than the time given to humans. The period for an essence to become a spirit would be similar. It made sense why finding spirits was so difficult.\n“Anyway, we can use this place to reach Nor’s Haven. Gather here, everyone.”\n“The space is tight. Shouldn’t some of us move to the other side?”\n“It’s fine. By the way, the magic of the land of the earth doesn’t have a wide range. With the essence of light, we can expand the scale as much as we want. Like this.”\nGardrock grasped the cluster of light. His fist glowed golden, and the light spread up his arm to his shoulder.\nSoon, it seemed the light would cover his entire body.\nNature’s power was limitless, so humans borrowing that power could expand their scale indefinitely.\nHowever, it took quite a bit of time.\nEven after a while, the light didn’t go past his shoulder, and a look of doubt crossed Gardrock’s eyes.\n“Strange. Why is it taking so long? It usually takes about five minutes.”\n“Master, could it be that the essence of light has weakened?”\n“Impossible. It worked fine three days ago. For the essence’s energy to change, it would take at least hundreds of years. Or something could be weakening the essence’s energy.”\n“But that can’t be. This place only has one law. That’s why we use it as an intermediate base.”\nFrom Clove’s words, Gardrock realized. It might be a delusion, but looking for other factors while ignoring the only correct answer was an even bigger delusion.\n“Could it be...? But why?”\nThe essence of light began to waver. The ground, and finally the entire canyon, shook as if an earthquake was happening.\n“What’s wrong? What’s the problem?”\n“Get out of here quickly! It’s the Vortex Serpent! The essence is destabilizing!”\nIf the cliff collapsed, they’d be crushed, so Shirone’s group hurried out of the canyon fissure.\nLooking from outside, the entire area was shaking. Something significant had to be nearby.\nBut they couldn’t see anything snake-like around.\n“Damn! Where is it? Where’s it coming from?”\nRian drew his greatsword and stood in front of Shirone.\nThe mages formed a formation and prepared for battle.\nTess focused her senses, searching the surroundings. The tremors on the left and right were different. The creature was rounding the corner on the right.\nThe ground shook so much that it was hard to stand. Tess realized something was wrong. Her senses and reality didn’t match. With such tremors, it should have already appeared before them.\n“There! Over there!”\nShirone pointed in surprise.\nA tiny, white creature, no larger than three meters, was crouched on a rock on all fours.\nBut could this really be called a creature?\nIt had no eyes, nose, or mouth. It resembled a salamander, but its surface was smooth like polished jade.\nHe had never seen such a white creature in his life.\n“What is that? Is that the Vortex Serpent?”\n“It’s not that one!”\nAt Gardrock’s shout, Shirone instinctively stepped back. As his view opened, he finally saw it.\nA shadow of the Vortex Serpent was cast over the canyon. Unbelievably, it was a shadow large enough to fill the entire cliff.\nShirone turned his gaze back to the rock. The salamander-like creature was glowing intensely.\nThe light from its body was casting the shadow.\nBy the time Shirone realized this, the shadow had already split its massive jaws and was lunging at them.\nA curtain of darkness blocked their view. The sheer size defied common sense, making it hard to believe they were under attack.\nAs Shirone’s group was engulfed in the darkness, Gardrock, watching from the canyon fissure, shouted.\n“Danger!”\nShirone’s Photon Cannon exploded.\nThe moment the light spread, they realized how close the sharp shadow claws had come. Just a bit later, and they would have been torn apart.\n“Kiiaaaah!”\nThe Vortex Serpent screamed as the Photon Cannon ripped through it.\nIt was likely similar to the mechanism of the Harvester. A creature without a mouth couldn’t possibly have a sound organ.\nWhen they regained their senses, they saw the shadow of the Vortex Serpent retreating like storm clouds.\nIt was fortunate they blocked the first attack.\nMost prey lost their lives to the Vortex Serpent’s first strike. Trapped in darkness, they couldn’t even see the attack coming.\nAmy wiped the cold sweat from her brow and asked.\n“What is that? Is it a creature or not? Is that salamander controlling it?”\nGardrock emerged from the canyon fissure and explained.\n“No, the true form of the Vortex Serpent is the shadow. There is no main body. The thing on the rock is just an 'avatar' created by the Vortex Serpent’s shadow.”\n“How can that be? There must be a body for there to be a shadow!”\n“I don’t know. We call this a ‘reversal of law.’ That’s an outsider. I don’t know where it came from, but it’s definitely not from any world we can imagine.”\nThe Vortex Serpent hesitated to approach. Among the humans it had killed, none had emitted light before, so it was naturally cautious.\nAs the avatar’s body glowed, the shadow grew larger. It was similar to a wild beast displaying itself before its enemy.\nShirone realized something. This might not be his grave after all.\n“It’s like a wild animal. It probably wasn’t a common predator in its original world. Maybe like a cat or a mouse. If it were the top predator, it wouldn’t react so defensively.”\n“A cat? A mouse? Are you joking?”\nKanya voiced what everyone else was thinking. However, one more person understood what Shirone meant.\nIt was Canis.\nHe watched the Vortex Serpent’s every move with wonder.\n“It really existed, a world where darkness rules over light.”\nReversal of law. What was written on Arcane’s note was true.\n“Shirone is right. If it’s a world where rules are reversed, all creatures would exist as shadows. The Vortex Serpent wouldn’t be particularly strong. Of course, things are different here.”\nGardrock examined the canyon fissure.\nAs expected, the Vortex Serpent’s law had weakened the essence of light.\nEscape was impossible in this state.\nBut it wasn’t time to give up. Shirone’s Photon Cannon had been strong enough to repel the Vortex Serpent.\n“Hey, we’ve passed the crisis, but stay alert. Its weakness is light. That’s why it doesn’t act during the day. I don’t know why the law is broken, but using light magic gives us a chance.”\nShirone recalled his battle with the Harvester. From that fight, he learned that shock wasn’t important to darkness. The key was the total amount of energy.\nShirone cast Photon Cannon, and eight photons appeared in irregular positions on the left and right.\nThe eight beams of light struck the Vortex Serpent. A terrible scream echoed.\nAmy unleashed Fireballs. Fire contained light, so it should be effective.\nThe Vortex Serpent’s shadow caught fire.\nBut it was like an ant biting an elephant’s skin. The shadow was so enormous it felt like cheating.\nCanis couldn’t even attempt his magic. Attacking with darkness only made the Serpent stronger.\nThe outcome between identical attributes was determined by power.\nIf you couldn’t control a darkness greater than the Vortex Serpent, you’d be devoured.\nShirone left his friends. If the creature’s shroud enveloped them again, it would be truly dangerous.\nThe Vortex Serpent moved in wide circles, true to its name. When Shirone hit its side with the Photon Cannon, it writhed in pain and pursued him.\nAs the Vortex Serpent abruptly changed direction, its massive tail swung towards Amy’s group.\nClove clutched his head and screamed.\n“Aaah! It’s coming!”\nAmy deployed Fire Mist. The fire’s smoke protected everyone, but it wasn’t enough to burn the tail.\nJust as the tail was about to sweep them away like a broom, Amy cast Fire Wall for extra protection.\nThe tail caught fire, but its trajectory didn’t change.\nAmy bit her lip and increased the power. She was determined to hold her ground, even if it cost her life.\nJust as the tail was about to hit Amy, it suddenly diverted, grazing her face. The Vortex Serpent couldn’t bear the fire’s pain and pulled back.\n“Shirone!”\nAmy shouted, not even pausing to catch her breath.\nThe Vortex Serpent snapped its jaws and engulfed Shirone. Simultaneously, the Photon Cannon exploded, blowing the Serpent’s head apart.\nThe Photon Cannon fired in rapid succession.\nAmy estimated it fired about 200 rounds per minute. For Shirone, who held the school’s speed record, this was possible.\nThe firing speed increased, and then it became a continuous beam that pushed the shadow to the opposite wall.\nShirone had excluded mass from the photons.\nWith zero impact force, the beam couldn’t tear the shadow, but it slowly ate into the Serpent’s body.\n“What kind of magic is that? It’s ridiculous! That can’t be possible!”\nWhile it was good for their side to be winning, Clove couldn’t believe what he was seeing.\nKanya and Rena were equally shocked.\nUnlike the Mecha, the Nor could exert great power alone. But they had never seen anything like this in Heaven.\nSeeing someone single-handedly fight the feared Vortex Serpent was awe-inspiring.\nMore so, they were winning. Seeing the Serpent thrashing against the wall sent chills down their spines.\nShirone’s beam turned red.\nFrom the Photon Cannon’s photon output, it further compressed the energy to a single-wavelength laser.\nThe Vortex Serpent tried to recover its shadow realm and push back the laser, but it only resulted in chain explosions.\n“Kiiaaaah!”\nThe fierce roar echoed.\nThe Vortex Serpent was terrified.\nIn its original world, it was a lower-tier predator. It had crossed into Heaven through a strange tunnel ten thousand years ago.\nUnable to evolve without predators, it had lived comfortably here.\nBut now, that comfort was breaking. By a mere human it used to tear apart for fun.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Subsequently, all the tendrils erupted simultaneously.\nThe chain of explosions surged towards the main body.\nThe Vortex Serpent extended new tendrils, but Shirone already knew that the time it took for the tendrils to reach him was shorter than the time it took for them to reach energy saturation.\nAs Shirone’s energy dispersed, so did the Vortex Serpent’s durability.\nThe ensuing battle was a clash of light and darkness.\nIt resembled two fleets at sea, maintaining their distance while exchanging massive bombardments. Every time the dozens of tendrils left afterimages, Shirone’s light followed, causing them to explode.\nThe tempo of attack and defense was so rapid that it was impossible to follow the shadow’s movements with the naked eye.\nShirone relied on his Spirit Zone’s omnidirectional sense for 70% of his perception, continuously firing lasers.\nThe firing points were numerous, and the hyper-spatial trajectories dominated the space.\nIt was now a matter of who would tire first.\nShirone felt defeat approaching. He felt like crying from the tension, but his battle-focused mind wouldn’t even allow a change in expression.\nAs Shirone’s mind began to blur, the Vortex Serpent howled. It too was fighting with all its might.\nRealizing this gave Shirone a sense of kinship.\nThe Vortex Serpent thrashed as if sensing its impending death, but there was no space left in its shadow to absorb energy.\nThe laser’s energy reverberated through the entirety of the Vortex Serpent.\nA powerful explosion blew its body apart, scattering fragments of shadow.\nThe gradually thinning laser disappeared in droplets before Shirone’s eyes.\nEveryone watched the situation unfold in silence.\nShirone, too, held his ground, glaring at the Vortex Serpent’s avatar.\nThe light faded from the salamander-like body, returning to its original jade-like state. Then, its color faded until it seemed to merge with the air and vanish.\n“Is it... dead?”\nTess asked, though no one could answer.\nThis creature, which had lived here for ten thousand years, had been analyzed by numerous subjects and heretics, but its death remained an unknown realm. No subject had ever defeated, let alone cornered, the Vortex Serpent.\nRian stirred the spot where the salamander had been with his sword.\nGardrock inspected the canyon fissure. The essence of light had regained its brilliance.\nGardrock spoke with certainty. “It’s dead. Or at least, it’s no longer here.”\nOnly then did Shirone collapse to the ground. The others stared at him in stunned silence.\nA human from the earth had erased a law.\nKanya, Rena, Gardrock, and Clove understood what this outcome meant.\nThis boy was dangerous.\nA law existed because it was indestructible. Only a god could change divine will. Shirone had infringed upon an inviolable domain, one that allowed no changes by any being.\n“What... are you? What kind of magic is that? How did you learn such magic?”\nThe group remained silent.\nEven they didn’t fully understand. The principles of magic were the same, but Shirone’s magic was impossible to replicate.\nUnique magic created from divine particles had its pros and cons.\nThe laser had the potential to subdue strong enemies but was ineffective against fast-moving targets. Photon Explosion required precise timing, and Photon Cannon consumed significant mental energy for a basic spell.\nBut Shirone compensated for these flaws with light scattering, the invincibility of his indestructible durability, and the infinite mental strength drawn from the Immortal Function.\nCurrently, Shirone couldn’t be classified as any specific type of mage.\nCanis realized why the term “Unique” was used to describe Unlocked mages in the magical society.\nUnlocking the Immortal Function wasn’t the end. It was about how harmoniously one could balance their unique abilities.\nIn this sense, Shirone was becoming Unique.\nClove looked at Shirone with mixed emotions.\nWhile he didn’t want to harbor ill feelings towards the one who saved their lives, the potential consequences of Shirone integrating into Nor society worried him.\nBeing dominated by an imitation was unacceptable.\nUnable to overpower Shirone, the only option was to undermine him from the start.\n“Don’t get too full of yourself. If Master hadn’t been injured, we could have escaped. Removing laws recklessly is dangerous, even for heretics. Now that the Vortex Serpent is gone, a new law will form, and we can’t serve as guides here anymore. This time was an exception, but be careful in the future.”\nShirone wasn’t listening. He was staring intently at something that had fallen from the sky.\nIt was a jewel, glowing transparently like a droplet of water.\n“Hey! Are you ignoring me?” Clove shouted.\nShirone finally turned his head and pointed at the three jewels before him.\n“What are these? They seem to have fallen when the Vortex Serpent exploded.”\n“What? These... these are...!”\nClove’s eyes widened in disbelief.\nWhite Elixirs.\nClove had first encountered White Elixirs at the ‘Nor Shop’ in the large community on the mainland.\nAt the time, a unique Nor group outside the community had purchased the highest-priced item at auction: a Spirit of the Droplet, for 23 White Elixirs.\nUnlike Water Spirits, Spirits of the Droplet were hard to come by. While seas and rivers often produced spirits, droplets weren’t consistently formed.\nDespite this, Spirits of the Droplet were magically weaker than Water Spirits.\nHowever, contracting with a Spirit of the Droplet made one’s skin smooth, prevented aging, and provided minor healing abilities, making them popular among women.\nClove knew the value of a Spirit of the Droplet was equivalent to about 4,600 Red Elixirs or 670 Green Elixirs.\nYou would have to hunt about 7,000 One-Horned Devils to obtain an item of such value, yet it was worth only 23 Elixirs.\n“White! White Elixir!”\nClove lunged like a flying squirrel, reaching for the Elixir.\nAs he was about to grab it, Shirone swiped it off the ground.\nFeeling a sinking sorrow, Clove turned with a scowl.\nNaturally, since Shirone had obtained it, it belonged to him. But it was hard to let go when someone else’s possession seemed bigger. Especially since Shirone didn’t even know the value of the White Elixir.\n“Ahem, why are you looking at me like that? I just wanted to take a look.”\n“What is this?”\n“It’s nothing special. An Elixir, used by heretics for trading. To assess its value, I need to examine it closely. Could you let me take a look?”\n“Sure, here you go.”\nShirone handed the Elixir over without hesitation. Clove quickly snatched it up, fearing Shirone might change his mind.\nRealizing the situation, Kanya approached with fiery eyes.\n“Hey! Why are you taking it? Even heretics must have rules. Isn’t it common sense that the hunter gets the Elixir?”\n“What did I do? Besides, we hunted it together.”\n“What did you even do? The only one here who deserves the Elixir is Shirone. Hand it over.”\n“Tch! Suddenly acting all friendly because of an Elixir? I guess it doesn’t matter if you’re a mimic or a subject when it comes to treasure. Trying to curry favor for scraps, huh?”\n“Ridiculous! Subjects don’t need Elixirs! And Shirone, if you’re going to live with the Nor, remember this! Elixirs are food, water, air, and life. Especially the White Elixir; it’s incredibly valuable! Don’t just hand it over carelessly.”\n“It’s fine. He just wanted to take a look.”\n“What if he runs off with it? What will you do then?”\nShirone leaned back and planted his hand on the ground.\n“Haha! How would he run off?”\n“What do you mean, how? Obviously...”\nKanya blinked, realizing the absurdity.\nWhat could Clove do with the White Elixir without any skills?\nShirone’s friends were also keeping a close watch on Gardrock’s every move. They weren’t tense either.\nShirone could subdue Clove in less than a second if he wanted to.\nClove seemed to reach the same conclusion, showing evident embarrassment. His judgment had been clouded by greed. It was fortunate he hadn’t fully revealed his intentions.\nGardrock, looking at Clove with disdain, spoke up.\n“Clove, return it. It’s not something you can handle.”\nFlushed with shame, Clove handed the Elixir back.\n“I just wanted to take a look. Here, take it back.”\nShirone caught the Elixir. He tossed it in his hand, watching the light reflect off it, and asked Gardrock, “What’s this for? You called it an Elixir, right?”\nGardrock checked the essence of light. Judging by its rapidly strengthening glow, they could leave in about five minutes.\n“To survive in the Abyss, human strength alone isn’t enough. The environment is harsh, and food is scarce. Some places have rampant diseases, and others have sulfur fires that burn the air, making it hard to breathe. Elixirs help humans survive these conditions. There are five colors, and all are essential. The White Elixir is the second rarest. Its properties of regeneration and purification make it a key ingredient in air production and healing medicines.”\n“I see. Can I use it to buy something?”\n“Of course. The Nor Shelter we’re heading to has merchants, so you can trade for what you need. For something as valuable as the White Elixir, you’d need to go to the Nor Shop on the mainland, the most active market.”\nShirone had another question.\nThe three Elixirs from the Vortex Serpent.\nThe fact that these items were traded so commonly meant someone was hunting creatures of similar caliber.\nGardrock nodded in agreement.\n“The Abyss is vast. Immensely so. The Nor have built an independent society, but many communities existed long before us. We’re heading to a place closest to Heaven. Beyond that, we don’t dare venture. White Elixirs come from beyond that boundary. From those who travel far beyond us.”\nHoping the Nor Shelter had many merchants, Shirone stored the Elixir.\nEven in his original world, if you couldn’t trade an item, it was just a mineral. No matter how valuable the White Elixir was, if he wasn’t setting up a home in the Abyss, it was best to trade for needed items.\nAs everyone gathered by the canyon fissure, Gardrock grasped the essence of light. His body glowed, and as the ancient magic Elizer activated, a white radiance spread through the fissure.\nThe scattered light's edges dulled, revealing the original landscape.\nWhere people had vanished, a desolate wind swept in.\n***\nThe field was littered with ruins. A shallow stream flowed, and wildflowers bloomed along its banks.\nThe ruins, aged with time, felt more comforting than desolate. Butterflies fluttered between tilted arches, and a few people were resting.\nArriving at Nor Shelter, Shirone surveyed the landing spot.\nLight beamed down like a spotlight. On closer inspection, the essence of light flitted up and down the beam.\nThe ancient magic Elizer seemed to be a spell for moving through light.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

It's a place strongly imbued with the essence of light. It can accommodate hundreds of Norins. I heard it was once the site of a shrine of light, and the remnants of its power linger.\"\n\"It’s more peaceful than I expected. Is it safe from invasions by extraterrestrial species or heretic hunters?\"\n\"It’s not far away, but it’s hidden by a veil of light. From outside Nor’s Haven, it looks like nothing more than a plain.\"\nThe principle was similar to invisibility magic.\nInvisibility cloaks bend light using electrical power to render one invisible. Here, the light’s reflectivity is set to 100%, making it blend with the scenery like a mirror.Anyone with sharp eyes might notice the repeating patterns, but no one would likely conduct such an operation over this vast land.\n\"Of course, the higher-ups of Heaven could find it if they were aware. But no one cares about life in Purgatory. Only Kergosians and starving extraterrestrials are interested.\"\nA makeshift tent village had formed near the forest. Vendors sat on mats, chatting idly without customers, as if they weren’t expecting to sell anything.\nGardrock explained they were traders heading to the main shops. This was merely a rest stop, and for proper goods, one had to visit the Nor shops.\nNonetheless, occasionally, citizens seeking Nor items came here, such as Kanya and Rena.\nKanya had been tense since arriving. While Purgatory was a neutral zone, this place was within the territory of heretics.\nHence, she didn’t make eye contact with Shirone’s group and asked Gardrock,\n\"Where can I find Nor medicines?\"\n\"Hmm, has the herbalist arrived? Look over there.\"\nAs Kanya walked away, Gardrock shouted after her,\n\"Just remember one thing. Never fight in Nor’s Haven. Got it?\"\nThere was no reply. Instead, Rena turned to Shirone with a smile. It was a pretty smile meant to cover for her sister’s rudeness but also held her own feelings.\n\"See you later.\"\n\"Sure. I hope you find what you're looking for.\"\nNor’s Haven wasn’t very large, but once outside the radius of Arin’s Spirit Zone, communication would be impossible, making it a farewell of sorts.\nShirone watched Kanya’s receding figure.\nShe seemed anxious.\nWhat had she left Heaven to seek?\nWhile Shirone was lost in thought, Gardrock examined his abdominal wound. The bleeding had stopped, but the wound was in bad shape. Without proper treatment, it could be dangerous.\n\"I need to rest for a bit. The bleeding has left me exhausted. Clove will explain how to buy things. You all need to know this to survive in Purgatory.\"\nSeeing his master’s pale face, Clove couldn’t refuse. He led Shirone’s group to the stalls, noticing there were more merchants than usual.\n\"Hey, about the White Elixir, are you going to use it now?\"\n\"Not sure. I’ll look around first and buy what I need. Why?\"\n\"If you’re willing to pay a brokerage fee, I can haggle for you. You’re new here, so you don’t know what’s good.\"\nThere weren’t many items worth a White Elixir in Nor’s Haven. It was like paying gold for an apple.\nHowever, since Shirone didn’t know the value of items here, there was a chance to get something worthwhile through good negotiation.\nShirone checked his friends’ locations. They were scattered, looking at goods. With the mental channel still connected, there was no need to gather them.\n-Clove wants a brokerage fee. What should we do?\n-We probably need a broker. Honestly, I can’t tell what’s good here besides clothes and food. Can we trust him?\nArin responded to Amy’s question.\n-I can find out.\nShirone made his decision.\nBy using Inner Eye, they could see if Clove was cheating. Hopefully, it wouldn’t come to that. Paying a fee was fine, but wasting time on pointless arguments was a loss for both sides.\n\"Alright, show us around and introduce us to the items.\"\nAs Clove led the way, the others gathered around Shirone.\nThe variety of goods indicated the presence of many mainland merchants.\nInitially, they saw daily necessities. Food, clothing, pillows, and blankets seemed common but were essential for heretics living in Purgatory.\nClove pointed to a white bread-like object that looked like a pebble.\n\"This is Kalaya, a travel essential for heretics. It’s made with Elixir and keeps you full for a whole day with just one piece.\"\nAmy squatted to inspect it.\nThere were various colors, but nothing else to indicate the taste.\nKalaya seemed useful for a day’s meal but wasn’t necessarily a top purchase priority.\n\"Hmm, it’s cute and round. Should I try one?\"\nAmy baited, and Clove bit.\n\"This is a fantastic item. Even if you’re stuck in the wilderness, you can survive a month with just this. Buy as many as you can while you have the chance.\"\nClove winked at the merchant.\nArin scratched her head, not needing Inner Eye to see through his blatant lie.\nAssuming her friends knew this, she skipped the details and got to the point.\n-Should we just do it ourselves? He doesn’t seem serious.\nEven Amy was exasperated by his audacity.\n-It seems so. But let’s keep him around. Who would’ve guessed this pebble was food? We still need someone to introduce the items. He’s not lying, right?\n-Right. He’s just eager to earn Elixir. He must really want it. Seeing him like this, I almost feel sorry for him.\nCanis sneered.\n-Probably. Forget magic; his situational awareness and quick response are pathetic. Could he even hunt properly? That must make him greedier.\nMagic power varies widely in effectiveness, but it’s not the sole measure of superiority. Efficiency and compatibility depend on the environment and situation.\nA Vortex Serpent’s magic power was overwhelming, but Shirone had defeated it.\nTo gauge a mage’s level, one must see how quickly and accurately they make magical judgments.\nThis takes time, more than learning magic. Mercenaries often hired mages based on visible skills, only to be wiped out due to the mage’s mistakes.\nCanis, who had traveled the continent searching for Arcane’s will, had more experience with this than anyone.\nReviewing the three battles since arriving in Heaven, Shirone and Amy’s decisions were crucial, showing Clove’s incompetence.\nNext, Clove led them to an apothecary stall.\nShirone had overheard Kanya arguing with the herbalist but couldn’t understand due to the broken mental channel.\nClove introduced various medicines.\nSmall flasks contained colored potions made with Elixir.\nRed potions healed wounds, blue ones cleared the mind. These were the most common.\nOther potions had unique effects.\nPink potions amplified love emotions, brown potions made specific memories permanent.\nShirone pointed to a white potion she had noticed during Kanya’s argument.\n\"What’s this potion?\"\nClove squinted in surprise and picked up the flask.\n\"Oh? This is a rare one. It’s hard to make.\"\n\"What’s it for?\"\n\"This is an awakening potion, Epinephrine. Drinking this keeps you awake for a week without sleep. It’s excellent for mages. If you’re hit by Howling and your mind wavers, this will help you endure.\"\nShirone tried to make sense of Clove’s explanation. The blue potion enhanced magical power, while the white potion seemed to boost endurance.\n\"This is perfect for you. It’s pricey, but I can get you a good deal. How about buying it?\"\nShirone wasn’t interested in Epinephrine. Its effects were impressive, but bringing consumables back to the original world felt wasteful.\nUnique items were hard to use judiciously. In Purgatory, they might drink it whenever needed, but in the other world, it could be more of a burden.\nShe briefly considered its usefulness before an exam but decided against risking expulsion for banned substances.\nAfter a frivolous analysis, her thoughts returned to Kanya.\nAn awakening potion.\nWhat did she plan to do with it?\nAs Shirone refocused, the group had moved to the next stall.\nSeedlings that grew into massive vines within ten minutes were essential for traveling through rocky areas, and powder that boiled water when sprinkled on it was fascinating.\nWatching Clove’s explanations, Shirone noticed Amy staring intently at something.\nCurious, Shirone approached.\nInside a basket like a birdcage, something was moving. A ball of fire.\nFire that moved on its own?\nWhen Clove joined them, Shirone pointed to the cage.\n\"What’s this?\"\nClove, peering inside, widened his eyes in surprise.\n\"Wow! A spirit? Sir, where did you find this? You hit the jackpot.\"\n\"Haha! It’s a long story. I had a good dream, so I went hunting outside the community, hoping to get some Green Elixir from sulfur worms. But all I got were Reds. Frustrated, I was about to head back when a ‘Flame Claw’ caught me. I ran for my life, thinking of my wife, and fell off a cliff. Turns out, it was a fire spot where sulfur gas had been burning for ages. As I tried to note it, a flame bounced towards me. I freaked out, used a spirit trap, and caught it. That’s the story, haha!\"\nClove wasn’t amused. Why didn’t he have such luck?\nSulfur worms were common in Muspel, the land of fire, and lava regions. They were one-meter-long worms that sprayed lava but were slow, making them easy for Clove to catch.\nBut Flame Claws were a different story. Surviving an encounter and catching a fire spirit was beyond fortunate, akin to being born under a lucky star.\nShirone looked at Amy. Her eyes pleaded silently.\nShe understood the desire. If it had been a light spirit, she wouldn’t have been able to resist either.\nShirone seriously inquired about the price.\n\"Sir, how much for this?\"\nUsing telepathy was unusual for a merchant, but he only blinked, responding calmly.\nShirone inferred a possibility from his reaction.\nThey might not be the only ones in this world who didn’t use the citizen’s language.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Spirits are incredibly rare in Purgatory. I’m just stopping by on my way to the mainland.”\nShirone felt a pang of fear at the outright rejection, though he expected it to be valuable.\nCould he buy it for three White Elixirs? If he overestimated and lacked enough Elixirs, Amy would be deeply disappointed.\nRealizing he needed a basis for his decision, Shirone paused the negotiations to ask a question.\n“I heard that spirits can be contracted. Is it possible with this one?”“Contract? Ah, a contract. Of course, it's possible. But what would you do with a contract with a fire spirit?”\n“With a fire spirit, I could use fire magic, right?”\n“Technically, yes... but valuable spirits aren’t usually wasted on contracts. If a spirit enters a village, it makes life much easier. So, typically, villages pool their Elixirs to acquire one. Those living on the outskirts of the community, who live in harsh conditions and have surplus Elixirs, might buy with the intent to contract, but they’re essentially risking their lives. I don’t see you living that kind of life.”\n“So, a contract is possible, right?”\nWhen Shirone pressed, the merchant nodded reluctantly.\nIt was a common reaction on the mainland. People who couldn’t afford it often tried to haggle or send in teams to devalue the item.\nIf people from the outskirts of the community joined in, the auction would end there, but such people rarely cared for special spirits. Most of the time, it was a nerve-wracking battle on a razor’s edge.\nAmy fidgeted with her fingers. She was a haggling expert but couldn't say anything now.\nIn a world where gold was common, she would have emptied her savings to buy it. But in Purgatory, only life-and-death items held value.\nIn this situation, she didn’t want to cause trouble for Shirone by showing her desire to possess it.\nShirone already knew. For a mage, enhancing magical power was everything, so he wanted to get it if possible.\nSensing the critical moment, Shirone asked again.\n“So, how many Elixirs would it take to buy the spirit?”\nThe merchant chuckled dismissively. But seeing Shirone waiting intently, he thought seriously.\n“Hmm, if you were to buy it here, at least...”\nShirone’s heart pounded. Any price within his Elixir stash would be good.\nIt was evidently a high price, as the merchant took his time before speaking.\n“One White Elixir...”\nDisappointment filled Shirone and Amy's eyes. The unit of measure being White Elixir meant the likelihood was slim.\nAfter contemplating, the merchant looked up and named his price.\n“At least one.”\n“What? One?”\nShirone doubted his ears, which had never betrayed him before.\nIf it was just one, he could afford it.\nRealizing the same, Amy trembled with anticipation, as if someone might snatch it away.\nShirone evaluated everything. Initially, he hoped only to afford it, but mages are quick to discard irrelevant thoughts.\nSeeing Amy bite her lower lip, he couldn’t help but smile. She whispered softly,\n“I want it.”\nAmy, the only daughter of the Karmis family, grew up never knowing material desire. But when it came to magic, she was just another mage.\nThe merchant misunderstood Amy’s desire as resignation. White Elixirs were rare even for mainland merchants, so it was natural for newcomers to Purgatory to despair.\nThinking of his daughter, he consoled Amy.\n“White Elixirs are hard to come by. I’ve already given you a big discount. It’s risky going to the mainland. It's only because I assumed I could sell it at Nor’s Haven and return home safely. I calculated it precisely because you seemed serious. Don’t be too disheartened. Someday, you might get lucky and find a fire spirit.”\n“I’ll buy it.”\n“Huh?”\n“I said, I’ll buy it.”\nAs Shirone searched his inner pocket, the merchant blinked in disbelief. He couldn’t decide if he should be angry or laugh at the joke.\nBut seeing the three Elixirs rolling in Shirone’s hand, he fell off his chair in shock.\nThe rainbow spectrum confirmed they were White Elixirs.\n“Here. Can I take it now?”\nThe merchant, speechless, nodded. Shirone handed him the White Elixirs.\nSimultaneously, Amy cradled the spirit trap to her chest.\nShe felt its warm presence.\nThe warmth of fire.\nThis was Amy’s essence.\n“Hey, is it okay? Isn’t it hot?”\nThe merchant, confirming the Elixirs’ authenticity, regained his senses and asked.\nA fire spirit was still fire until contracted, and touching a hot iron cage should cause burns.\n“Huh? No, it’s just warm.”\n“That’s strange. Can I check it again? I’m worried because it might be defective.”\n“No, it’s fine. This is definitely a fire spirit.”\nAmy lovingly watched the fire spirit bounce in the air. She then spoke to Shirone via the mental channel.\n-Shirone, it’s a Spirit Zone.\n-Spirit Zone?\n-Yes. It’s amazing. It’s real fire, but it’s also connected to the mind. I can feel it constantly.\nMages don’t get burned by the fire they create. Though it’s real fire, the creator is a mage.\nAccording to Amy, spirits also seemed to have a fixed Spirit Zone. They had become a form of mental transcendence.\n“So, how did you get the White Elixir?”\n“It came from the Vortex Serpent.”\n“The Vortex Serpent? You destroyed the law of the valley?”\n“It just happened.”\nIt wasn’t strange for a mage powerful enough to defeat the Vortex Serpent to possess White Elixirs.\nThough rare, such people did exist in Purgatory. Merchants called them border people or those from the community outskirts.\n“But how do you form a contract?”\n“I don’t know exactly, but I’ve seen border people do it. They hold the spirit and mutter something, and it disappears.”\nSpirits lack reason, so it likely wasn’t a keyword activation. The remaining possibility was Incantation Magic.\nSpeaking and repeating it was key. Resonating with fire was crucial.\nUsing the key given by the merchant, Amy unlocked the iron cage. Holding the spirit in both hands, she improvised an incantation.\n“Fire spirit, dwell within me.”\nAs the fire spirit entered Amy, a warm sensation filled her abdomen.\nContracting with a spirit was akin to discovering a new battery. Separate from the ignition battery, she could now ignite a new fire.\nSummoning the spirit, Amy watched the fireball rise and circle around. Pleased, she recalled the name of the legendary ancient flame.\nJack-o'-lantern.\nKnown as will-o'-the-wisp, this phenomenon remained a myth despite countless scholars’ theories.\nBut no longer. The Jack-o'-lantern existed as ancient magic in Heaven.\nThe fire spirit had strategic uses.\nIt activated independently of Ignite and moved along desired trajectories. It could even split into multiple illusions.\nAmy envisioned endless strategies: guided functions, tricks, multi-shot capabilities.\nRealizing Shirone’s gaze, she extinguished the spirit.\nThough she should thank him, the words wouldn’t come out, feeling awkward.\nIt wasn’t like receiving an expensive gift. Perhaps she had received Shirone’s heart.\nShirone smiled, turning away as if expecting her silence.\nAmy regretted not speaking. Did he understand her feelings? Or was the gift without special meaning?\nDespite his straightforward nature, Shirone was sometimes unreadable.\nShirone meticulously inspected the items.\nWatching Amy contract with the fire spirit made him realize that seeking items to bring back to the original world was naive.\nHeaven was perilous, and reinforcing their gear immediately was crucial. Finding such items, no matter the cost, would increase their survival chances.\nNor’s Haven mainly sold essentials for the heretics in the community.\nBut a few merchants had special items, which they didn’t display due to high prices.\nUpon learning Shirone had White Elixirs, a man discreetly placed an item on his stall.\nTess ran over and pointed at the item the merchant displayed.\n“Oh! Isn’t that...?”\nA beetle-shaped mechanical device.\nA drone created with Mecha technology.\nClove, realizing Shirone was a big spender, eagerly explained.\nIn addition to the known reconnaissance and language decoding functions, it had radio communication, map display, and more.\n“How about it? Want to trade for a White Elixir? You know drones aren’t just about having Elixirs. They’re exclusive to citizens.”\nShirone found the drone appealing. He had experienced its reconnaissance ability through Kanya. If Tes could use it, it would be an excellent auxiliary tool.\nArin suggested they might negotiate the price down. She sensed the merchant’s initial offer was inflated.\nBut the low price was curious.\nIf a fire spirit was a commodity, a drone was a limited item. Shouldn’t citizen items be priceless?\n-Arin, could there be a defect? Otherwise...\n-I have the same suspicion, but I’m not sure. The initial offer is certainly inflated. You’ll have to judge the rest.\nTess was fixated on the drone. Given her fascination with ancient artifacts, she would accept it regardless of defects.\nShirone asked on her behalf.\n“How did you get this? I heard it’s only issued to Mecha Tribe individuals.”\n“Of course, but there are heretics among the Mecha too. They might steal it before fleeing to Purgatory. Just one can sustain their livelihood. Look here, the strip between the drone’s edges? That means it’s unused. It’s fresh from the factory. The original owner likely worked in a Mecha Tribe facility.”\n“Where is that person?”\n“Who knows? They might have fled or died. Most Heaven’s items in the market come from such circumstances. Those stealing Heaven’s items for Elixirs often die in Purgatory, leaving the items behind.”\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

Just because an item belonged to a citizen didn't mean it was impossible to purchase.\nNevertheless, the limited-edition merit remained.\nMost importantly, the merchant knew Shirone's payment limit was two White Elixirs. The fact that he greedily set the price at one Elixir suggested it was actually much cheaper.\n\"Can anyone use it?\"\n\"As long as it's equipped, anyone can use it. Weapons like Sygna, Exed, and Arc are communal, but drones are individually encrypted. Even if you take someone else's, you can't use it. But this one hasn’t been claimed by anyone yet, so it’s for sale.\"\nShirone was unsure. If it was new, there shouldn't be any defects.\nWas it a simple misunderstanding due to not fully understanding this world? Or was the Fire Spirit that difficult to obtain?\nUnable to decide, Shirone asked Tess.\n\"Tess, do you want this?\"\n\"Yes! Shirone, I really want it. Please buy it for me. Other items are cheap and can be bought anytime later.\"\nShirone couldn't help but smile. Tess’s straightforward nature when asking for something was certainly different from Amy’s.\nUltimately, Elixirs should be used for everyone's benefit. So, he should buy it, but without knowing the defects, he couldn’t negotiate.\nAsking outright would make him vulnerable to the merchant, and Clove wouldn't be of any help.\n\"Why won't you sell it? I brought exactly what you asked for!\"\nAt that moment, they heard Kanya's voice.\nEveryone turned to look. Unlike Kanya, the merchant wore a relaxed smile.\n\"Look, miss. There's no such thing as a set price in Purgatory. It’s an auction. If the price goes up, you can't just lower it at your whim.\"\n\"You said a month ago that one Green Elixir was enough for Epinephrine! And now, even with 30 Red Elixirs, you won’t sell it. Why?\"\nEpinephrine.\nShirone recalled the white potion recommended by the herbalist.\nBut Kanya’s reaction was too intense for it to be just an awakening potion. Why would she need to stay awake in Heaven?\n\"A month ago, yes. But now the price has increased.\"\n\"No! Even two months ago, three months ago, you never said that! This is extortion!\"\n\"Miss, auction prices are determined by the buyer's desire. The more you want it, the higher the price. Isn’t the ritual only a few days away?\"\n\"You...!\"\nKanya’s face turned pale. No matter how much of a merchant he was, how could he say that?\nEven Clove, typically shameless, frowned this time.\nThe merchant remained unfazed by Kanya’s outburst. From the start, he never intended to sell to a citizen.\n\"Wanting Epinephrine today means someone in your family is dying within days. Thus, you must buy it, and I demand a high price. What’s wrong with that?\"\n\"I won’t let you get away with this!\"\nKanya pulled out Arc, but Rena screamed and stopped her.\nViolence was prohibited in Nor’s Haven. Any violent incidents would lead to expulsion and worse.\nMaintaining the community relied on the rational agreement of the majority. Once the rules were broken, the community would collapse.\n\"Sis! Please calm down! If you fight here, we’ll be killed!\"\nRena pulled Kanya back, who continued to curse even as she was dragged away.\nThe merchant exchanged a look with the herbalist across the way.\nA silent agreement not to sell Epinephrine.\nIt was a cartel.\nThree months ago, when Kanya came to buy Epinephrine, the merchant demanded an unreasonably high price.\nIn reality, it could be exchanged for about 40 Red Elixirs, but he asked for Green Elixir.\nElixirs are not like money. While arbitrary exchanges are possible, if someone insists on Green Elixirs, no amount of Red Elixirs will suffice.\nKanya had to buy Green Elixirs at inflated prices. When she returned to purchase the item, the merchant refused to sell it at that price.\n\"Why is she so agitated? What’s this ritual?\" Shirone asked.\n\"It's the ritual of life regeneration,\" Gardrock answered. He had come out, disturbed by the noise.\nGardrock understood the situation from Kanya’s murderous expression alone. Though he had never met her as a guide, he was well-versed in the merchants' rumors.\n\"As you know, citizens have a set lifespan. When their time is up, they undergo the ritual of life regeneration to be reborn. That girl’s mother is the one affected.\"\n\"What exactly is this ritual?\"\nGardrock squinted.\n\"I’d rather not talk about it. As you can see, it's a sensitive matter. Citizens call the ritual a blessing. Most heretics, however, feel aversion to it and flee Heaven. The merchants are the same. They’re not tormenting her over the Elixirs.\"\n\"But Kanya’s mother is nearing the end of her lifespan. What role does the awakening potion play? Will it save her?\"\n\"No. The laws don’t change. By heretic standards, Kanya’s mother will soon die. Even so, she’s buying Epinephrine...\"\nGardrock groaned.\nHe, too, had once been a citizen. Knowing what Kanya wanted to do even if it meant risking her life, he felt a twinge of sympathy.\n\"It’s nothing. Just a ray of hope in despair. Like administering anesthesia to a dying patient.\"\nShirone felt heavy-hearted. He didn’t fully understand the differences between citizens and heretics, but he believed the intention to ease a parent's suffering was universal.\nYet the laws drew even this into distinction.\nKanya resumed bargaining. It was clear she was struggling to hold back her anger to buy Epinephrine.\nThere were two stalls selling Epinephrine, and today might be her last chance.\nShirone checked the herbalist at the other stall. He averted his gaze, perhaps feeling guilty.\nWouldn’t it solve everything if Shirone bought Epinephrine from him and gave it to Kanya?\nSensing Shirone's thoughts, the herbalist discreetly hid Epinephrine. Contracts were absolute for the Norins, and he wanted to avoid a commotion.\nKanya made her final offer.\n\"Fine! I’ll buy on credit. I’ll get the Elixirs by any means necessary. Just give me the Epinephrine.\"\n\"What can you bring?\"\n\"Anything! I’ll hunt for a lifetime if I have to!\"\n\"So, what will you bring?\"\nThe merchant no longer hid his emotions.\nHe hated citizens intensely. He hated Heaven. No matter how good the medicine, he couldn’t erase his memories of living in Heaven. La’s laws were that strong.\n\"Even if I give you everything, you still refuse. So, tell me. What will it take for you to sell the potion?\"\n\"Alright. Since you insist on buying, let’s see... what could I want...\"\nThe merchant pretended to ponder, then looked at Shirone.\n\"How about all the Elixirs that boy has?\"\nShirone realized the merchant's strategy had suddenly changed.\nHe must have calculated from the moment Kanya brought Shirone along.\nIt was natural for a merchant. But it was cruel.\nSeeing the White Elixir sparked his greed, but he had no high-value items. So, he entangled Kanya.\nStrategically, it was sound.\nNorins were known for their shrewd business skills. He was a capable merchant, but not a great one.\nKanya was at a loss for words. The clearer her position became, the more she realized she was being played by a con artist.\n\"Now I see. You never intended to sell it. For three months, you enjoyed watching me struggle in Purgatory! What did I ever do to you?\"\nShirone felt sorry for her. Emotional responses were ineffective against merchants. They were adept at using others' psychology to their advantage.\nTo provoke a mage, you had to fight fire with fire.\n\"You make me the villain. This only makes it harder for you. It’s not an impossible request, is it? Hunting for a lifetime is much harder than taking that boy’s Elixirs. Don’t you think?\"\n\"That’s theft! Robbery! And we can’t fight here! How am I supposed to get Elixirs from someone unrelated?\"\n\"There are ways. You’re a girl, he’s a boy. Figure it out.\"\nKanya's lips quivered. She wanted to blast his face with Arc. But knowing this was her last chance calmed her.\nWhat would Shirone’s reaction be if she asked for Elixirs? Elixirs that were life to heretics.\nEven so, maybe... he might help. Rena had a good eye for people despite being naive.\n\"I don’t like him because he’s handsome, but because he’s kind.\"\nKanya had scoffed then, but Shirone was different from normal heretics. Maybe he would give the Elixirs. The precious White Elixir? Maybe. Maybe!\nIt was all hypothetical. Yet, relying on hypotheticals was her only option.\nShe’d do anything for her mother. She couldn’t let her mother, who had lived half the life of an ordinary citizen, die.\nLeaving the merchant's sneer behind, Kanya approached Shirone. His expression was calm, already understanding the situation.\nKanya felt a chill. What was he thinking? It couldn't be good. Why are you coming here? What do we have to do with each other?\nEven so, she had to plead. She was prepared to give up everything.\nKanya spoke miserably as she reached Shirone.\n\"Um...\"\n\"Here.\"\nShirone extended his hand. A White Elixir lay in it.\nKanya felt a rush of emotions. It felt like anger, but it didn’t hurt.\nWhy is he doing this? Shouldn't he at least make me beg? Isn’t the point of charity to buy feelings? What’s the meaning of such mercy?\nShe felt she needed to ask. But doubted she could speak properly.\n\"Why...\"\n\"Just go buy the Epinephrine. It’s important to you.\"\n\"But...\"\nIt’s not important to you.\nShe wanted to say, but her throat tightened, and no sound came out.\nThis boy was different. Not like humans or extraterrestrials. Even... different from Ra.\nAt that blasphemous thought, Kanya felt a thrill. Was this the precursor to corruption?\n\"Thank you.\"\nKanya could barely utter the words as she returned to the merchant.\nIndeed, Purgatory was different from Heaven. She felt strange emotions she had never experienced before.\nWith weary steps, she handed the Elixir to the merchant.\n\"Here. Now give me the Epinephrine.\"\n\"No. I can’t sell it for this.\"\n\"Why... why again?\"\nKanya lacked the strength to shout. The thought of holding back tears was the only thing keeping her standing.\n\"I said all the boy’s Elixirs. According to my calculation, he still has one left.\"\n\"No. I have no Elixirs left.\"\nJoin our discord at\nhttps://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!",

He was so moved he could barely hold it properly.\nIt wasn’t a Red, Green, or Yellow Elixir, but a White Elixir.\nFlipping his palm, Shirone spoke.\n\"How about it? Is it settled now? Give Kanya the item.\"\n\"This won't do. That Elixir must also be mine for the deal to proceed.\"\"Then take it from him.\"\nThe merchant’s eyes twitched, realizing Shirone’s actions weren’t mere provocations.\nShirone turned to the merchant fondling the Elixir and asked.\n\"So, what will you do? Will you give it back?\"\n\"No, no! The deal cannot be canceled!\"\nThe merchant panicked, waving his hands.\nSure, the Mecha Tribe drone was valuable, but only if it was usable.\nThe drone he sold was practically worth only a Yellow Elixir. To exchange it for a White Elixir was a once-in-a-lifetime gain.\n\"So, what now? Are we going to have a fight among heretics? Seems to be your specialty.\"\nThe herbalist’s face hardened.\nThis was indeed a tricky situation. He could be shameless in customer negotiations, but conflict among merchants brought no benefits. Especially for lower community merchants who mainly dealt in daily necessities.\nThe herbalist then scrutinized Shirone.\nThe way he pressured like this meant he was undoubtedly a Norin, and not an easy one.\nShould he accept just one Elixir and move on? Trading Epinephrine for a White Elixir would be a legendary deal.\nBut it was a matter of pride. He didn’t want to accept that things had gone the citizen’s way.\n\"Fine, I won’t sell. So enjoy your toy. Do you realize you’ve crushed this girl’s hopes?\"\nThe merchant had thrown in the towel. He chose the satisfaction of victory over profit.\nAs a merchant, it was a zero-point deal, but he didn't care as long as he could see the citizen despair.\nShirone knew he had won the game.\n\"No, you must sell the potion. Otherwise, you’re violating the contract.\"\n\"What? How am I violating any contract?\"\n\"You said you would sell the potion if I brought all my Elixirs. Kanya did that. Suddenly canceling the deal is a breach of contract. You know what happens to a merchant who loses credibility, right?\"\nIt wasn’t just knowing; it was the end. At the very least, he would lose his foothold in the community.\nBut he also felt a bit wronged. Shirone was being stubborn.\n\"Be clear. When I proposed the contract, you had two Elixirs. After the deal was made, you bought the drone, so I haven’t violated anything.\"\n\"How do you know when I bought the drone?\"\nThe herbalist’s eyes widened in shock. Though he had lost his cool, his long experience in trading had given him a hunch.\nHe was at a disadvantage.\n\"I already had a contract to buy the drone. I just hadn’t handed over the Elixir yet. As a merchant, you should have confirmed that before making a deal. If you doubt it, feel free to check.\"\nThe herbalist ground his teeth. His hunch was right.\nThe merchant who sold the drone would back Shirone no matter what. Proving his contract with Shirone meant the White Elixir’s ownership would transfer.\nThis was a common occurrence on the mainland. He had no right to complain, having exploited monopolies himself.\n‘Why am I at a disadvantage? It should be the opposite.’\nAs he reviewed the situation, the herbalist realized Shirone had known the drone’s lower value.\nHow Shirone figured it out was unclear, but without it, the current situation wouldn’t exist.\nThe merchant sided with Shirone because he made several times the profit.\nHe let out an exclamation. Shirone understood human nature’s relationship with material goods. Even mainland merchants would find him formidable.\n\"So, what do you think? We had the first contract, right?\"\n\"Of course, we did. We made a verbal agreement to trade the drone for a White Elixir before the girl started yelling.\"\nThough unrequested, Shirone confirmed it directly.\nNow, there was no way out. If he had a deal with another merchant, it was his fault for not checking the customer’s limit.\nShould he back down? One White Elixir was an incredible gain, but it was a matter of pride.\nThe herbalist played his lowest card as a merchant.\nHe went for self-pity.\n\"My mother was a citizen of Heaven. But she didn’t undergo the ritual. Do you know why?\"\nWhen no one answered, the herbalist continued, tapping his head.\n\"She went mad. My father was murdered in Heaven by a lunatic who had a crush on my mother. Do you know what punishment he got? Forty years off his lifespan. But he still had forty years left. My father was dead. My mother cursed that man all her life. But the ritual’s date was set. Alongside the man who killed my father.\"\nKanya’s eyes shook.\nShirone didn’t grasp the significance, but everyone else was horrified.\n\"So, my mother killed herself. The ritual’s target decreased, and I had to bear the remaining punishment. That’s why I fled Heaven. So, do you get it? I hate citizens. They make me sick. Do you think I’ll sell the potion?\"\nIn short, he was ready to blow everything up.\nShirone snorted.\nA truly suicidal person wouldn’t explain their reasons. If both parties would die, the process didn’t matter.\nWhat he wanted was an emotional victory, and Shirone wasn’t going to give it to him.\n\"So, will you sell the potion or not?\"\n\"I won’t. And I won’t give up the Elixir either. Do as you please.\"\n\"Then I’ll take it by force.\"\n\"Do it. But remember, using violence means you can’t stay in the community. You’ll be a wanderer forever.\"\nShirone extended his hand. Photon energy condensed into a vibrating white sphere.\nThe herbalist was terrified. Such magic was impossible. Only those contracting with the Spirit of Light from the community outskirts could do this.\n\"Are you a border person?\"\n\"The Vortex Serpent was quite strong. Thanks to it, I got three White Elixirs.\"\nShirone remained expressionless.\nThe herbalist knew that a mage was most ruthless when emotionless.\n\"What kind of Elixirs might be in your body?\"\nEveryone knew the herbalist's survival depended on his answer.\nThe herbalist struggled for a long time, realizing he couldn’t win. Finally, he raised his hand with a bitter smile.\n\"None. I don’t have any Elixirs in me. So spare me.\"\nShirone fired the Photon Canon. A beam of light grazed the herbalist’s nose and hit the ruins' pillar.\nThe pillar exploded with a loud noise.\nThe herbalist, now somber, looked at Shirone.\n\"Don’t laugh. You may be bluffing, but I’m serious. I don’t care about the laws or the community. One more trick, and I won’t forgive you.\"\n\"Okay, okay. Calm down.\"\nThe herbalist realized the seriousness of the situation.\nShirone had shown maximum hostility without using violence. Like a swordsman drawing his blade or a beast baring its fangs, there would be no further leniency.\nUnderstanding this, the herbalist threw Epinephrine to Kanya.\n\"There, satisfied? The deal is done.\"\n\"One more thing. Apologize to Kanya.\"\n\"Why should I? You have no right to interfere with my personal feelings.\"\n\"But you’ve been through pain, too, right?\"\n\"What does that have to do with an apology?\"\n\"I’m not asking for a meaningless apology. Words without sincerity are worthless. But didn’t you want someone to understand your past wounds?\"\nIs that so? Have I still not escaped?\nThe herbalist glanced at Kanya’s sorrowful face. She said her mother was awaiting the ritual.\nHis mother had lost her mind back then. She screamed and self-harmed daily. The terror she felt was even more intense for him as a child.\n“Tch, who says I know how to apologize?\"\nSnorting, the herbalist packed up his stall. He tossed a purple potion to Kanya as he stood up.\n\"It’s called Corfin. It strengthens the nervous system. Consider it a service since I made a good haul. Using it with Epinephrine might help. Though it’ll be futile.\"\nWalking towards the tent village, the herbalist glanced back at Shirone.\n\"And kid, everything I said was a lie. Beating me is impressive, but if you can’t spot that, you’ll get crushed on the mainland.\"\nArin communicated through the mental channel.\n-Shirone, should I check if it was a lie?\n-No, it's fine.\nShirone watched the herbalist’s retreating figure with a hint of sadness.\nNor’s Haven.\nA place where wanderers of Purgatory rested.\nPerhaps what they left behind here were not their weary bodies but the scars in their hearts.\nThe eventful shopping concluded.\nShirone comforted Kanya, who couldn’t hold back her tears. Beside them, Rena pouted, watching over them.\nAmy’s group, excluding Shirone, began a discussion.\nThe items bought with the three White Elixirs were the Fire Spirit, the drone, and Epinephrine.\nEven though it was the best outcome for the situation, it was hard not to feel like they had lost out. Tess, in particular, couldn’t hide her guilt.\n\"I know I was the one who asked for it, but are we sure about this?\nThere were items that could have been more useful in battle. And Epinephrine was outrageously overpriced.\"\n\"What’s the big deal? We can hunt for more if needed. No point worrying about the past.\"\n\"Rian’s right. And monetary loss isn’t the only loss. Shirone used the Elixirs most efficiently, and that’s what matters.\"\nComforted by Amy, Tess pouted.\n\"What good is efficiency when the situation was a mess? I support Shirone’s choices, but if the herbalist hadn’t pulled his tricks, we could have gotten the drone for half the price.\"\nCanis smirked.\n\"Amy didn’t mean it like that. Shirone didn’t lose out at all. He bought something that couldn't be obtained, even for all the White Elixirs.\"\n\"What? Was the Fire Spirit that valuable?\"\n\"No. The most valuable was Epinephrine.\"\nTess thought Canis was joking.\nEven the thought of buying something that could be bought with Red Elixirs for a White Elixir was infuriating.\nRian asked in confusion.\n\"Why was Epinephrine the most valuable? It’s a common potion.\"\n\"True, but today its price was beyond imagination. Most importantly, its owners are Kanya and Rena, citizens of Heaven.\"\n\"Oh...\"\n\"See? It wasn’t about Epinephrine. Shirone bought a ticket to Heaven for a White Elixir.\"\nIndeed.\nThinking back, it was a far-fetched idea to find a way into Heaven. But now they had a foothold. With Kanya’s help, they could enter Heaven.\nJoin our discord at https://dsc.gg/wetried\n***\nDiscord: https://dsc.gg/wetried\nLink to donations in the discord!\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.
