When he came to his senses, he was lying in a garbage dump.Starving, he was drawn like a zombie is to blood to a hangover soup restaurant, where he realized that he had fallen into South Korea, eight years in the future.In this era, disaster alerts notify people of rift openings in advance, ASMR videos of slimes gathered from dungeons were trending, and idle hunters livestream unboxings of A-rank longswords.Unlike the past, where people trembled in fear of an impending apocalypse, the future was surprisingly peaceful, leaving Cha Eui-jae feeling empty. Since things had turned out this way, why not start a second chapter of life as a part-timer at the hangover soup restaurant, rather than being a hunter?“That’s strange.”“…”“Have we met somewhere before?”Cha Eui-jae’s plan to quietly spend his remaining days as the only part-time worker at the decades-old hangover soup restaurant goes awry when he encounters a mysterious, gas-masked individual…DISCLAIMER: The story isn't mine",

      "content": "Chapter 1: Prologue\n\"Thank you! Please come again!\"\nWith a cheerful voice from the employee, the automatic door of the supermarket opened. A young man wearing a gray hoodie and carrying a strawberry-patterned shopping bag filled with various ingredients headed towards the bus stop.\n\"A rift has appeared at the intersection, and traffic is being controlled. Please cooperate.\"\nThe young man tilted his head at the unfamiliar scene unfolding on his usual route. Someone wearing a fluorescent yellow safety vest over a suit and a yellow safety helmet was blocking the passage, waving a red flashing baton. Over their head, the entrance of a shimmering blue rift was visible.\nBelow it, hunters were desperately fighting monsters that had squeezed through the rift.\n\"Kyahaaa!\"\n\"Ugh! Not yet?\"\n\"Just a little more…!\"\nA lizard the size of a car swung its spiky tail fiercely, emitting a bizarre cry. A hunter with a shield blocked the attack, but the lizard, excited, thrashed its tail around wildly, as if sweeping the surrounding area. The hunter barely managed to fend off the relentless attacks and cursed.\n\"Damn it, die! Fireball!\"\nA bright red flame engulfed the lizard. Seizing the moment of hesitation, another hunter shot an arrow at the lizard. The arrow pierced the lizard's eye, causing it to writhe in agony and scream.\n\"Kieeek!\"\n\"Wow, that was awesome…\"\n\"Do not approach the barricade!\"\n\"I'm gonna record it for YouTube Shorts.\"\n\"Yeah, I'm already doing that.\"\nPeople stood a little distance from the barricade, filming videos and watching. The young man, not joining the commotion, walked briskly. The strawberry-patterned shopping bag swung as he moved.\nAs he stepped into a deserted alley, he encountered a gigantic figure blocking the narrow path. A purple toad was rummaging through a pile of trash and turned its head sharply toward the young man, sensing his presence. A long green tongue flicked out of its mouth, snatching up an empty plastic bottle and swallowing it. It was clearly a monster that had leaked from the rift.\n\"Damn those rift management guys. Can't they do their job properly…\"\nThe young man grumbled, rummaging through his shopping bag and drawing out something long like a sword. From the soft curved tip to the straight stalk and the solid root at the bottom.\nIn his hand… was a fresh green onion.\nThe toad croaked and turned towards the young man. Each step of its heavy legs shook the entire alley like an earthquake. The young man carefully set down his shopping bag, skillfully twirled the green onion, and gripped it firmly. Then,\nHe leapt onto a trash can lid and soared like a butterfly—\nWhacked the toad's head with the green onion!\nBam!!\nThe clear, sharp sound of impact echoed loudly in the alley. The toad, unable to even let out a death cry, flipped its eyes and trembled all over. Sadly, the center of its head was deeply indented in the shape of the green onion.\nThe young man caught his breath and dusted off his hands. As the hoodie slipped off from the recoil, his cool face was revealed.\n\"Green onions are expensive… What a waste.\"\nHe squatted in front of the toad, stuffing the remnants of the green onion into its mouth with his bare hands while taking out his phone. After some time, when someone answered the call, he spoke.\n\"He- Hello… There's a dead monster in the alley here. It looks like a hunter killed it and just left…\"\nThe young man's voice trembled at the end, as if he were scared and even on the verge of tears. However, unlike the voice that seemed as if it would faint at the slightest touch, his current actions were indifferent.\n\"This is the alley going to Deukero Mart… The monster? It looks like a toad, but it's too big and gross to see clearly. Please handle it. Yes, no need to contact me… Uh, you'll be here in 5 minutes? Thank you, no problem. Yes, thank you…\"\nThe young man sniffled and ended the call. Even after hanging up, he remained crouched, shoving the green onion pieces into the toad's wide-open mouth. Despite claiming the monster was too gross to look at, his eyes were fixed on the toad.\nFive minutes until the hunters arrive.\n'It'd be troublesome to encounter them.'\nThe young man stood up and erased his footprints from the trash can lid. The toad seemed to have died instantly with only the green onion-shaped dent in its head as an injury. With no other traces left, it would be hard to track down the person who dealt with the monster.\nHaving cleaned up the evidence, it was time to flee. The young man picked up his shopping bag, lightly bounced a couple of times in place, and reviewed the phone call he had just made.\n'…Should I have sounded more shocked when I reported it?'\nWell, it was too late to regret it now. The young man easily jumped over a wall taller than himself.\n***\n\"Is this the right alley?\"\n\"Yes, it is!\"\nA few minutes after the young man leisurely disappeared, two people arrived at the scene— a man and a woman wearing fluorescent vests over their shirts. The urgency on their faces melted away upon seeing the toad's corpse.\nThe woman, Yang Hye-jin, an A-grade hunter from the Rift Management Bureau, gasped as she looked at the toad with its tongue sticking out.\n\"Wow, this is insane.\"\n\"Why, ma'am? Let me see… Whoa.\"\nThe newcomer, who had followed closely behind, was startled and whispered to his senior.\n\"Wow… Can someone really take down a swamp toad this cleanly, ma'am?\"\n\"It doesn't make sense. This thing was taken out in one hit. If you're even slightly off in timing, it sprays strong acid everywhere. It's a nightmare, melting buildings and people alike…\"\n\"It's really impressive.\"\nThe newbie, once again in awe, straightened his yellow safety helmet that had gotten crooked in the rush. Yang Hye-jin, with a sharp look, inspected the surroundings and gave instructions.\n\"Check if there's any trace left. Someone this skilled is no ordinary person.\"\n\"Yes, ma'am!\"\nThe newbie rummaged through the trash can and the surrounding garbage.\n\"Whoever did this… They did it so cleanly that the post-cleanup isn't difficult.\"\n\"Right. It's so clean we could donate this to the monster research team. I wonder why such a skilled person didn't dispose of the body and just left.\"\nSpeaking sarcastically, Yang Hye-jin put on white gloves and opened the toad's thick mouth. Toad-type monsters swallowed anything that touched their tongues and spat out poison or strong acid. A helpful toad, like in fairy tales, was a unicorn in reality.\nIn any case, it was necessary to check thoroughly as the toad might have swallowed a person on its way from the rift. Yang Hye-jin took out a flashlight and inspected the inside of the toad's mouth. Fortunately, she found no human remains, just a few partially melted plastic bottles. Relieved, she sighed.\n\"Looks like it didn't swallow any people…\"\nMeanwhile, the newbie, using a radar-equipped device to scan the alley, called out to Yang Hye-jin with a distressed look.\n\"Ma'am, whoever took down this toad must be a real pro. There's no trace left.\"\nYang Hye-jin, dusting off her hands, tilted her head.\n\"They must have used their ability, right? No trace of it? Look carefully.\"\n\"I'm looking! But there's no sign of any ability or any trace. Nothing at all.\"\n\"What, did they take it down barehanded?\"\nAlthough she accidentally guessed close to the truth, unaware of this, she shook her head.\n\"Phew, must be another of those hidden strong ones. Why are there so many hidden powerful hunters? Cartoons and novels have ruined everyone.\"\nAfter turning off the flashlight and getting up, Yang Hye-jin stretched to relieve her tired body.\n\"Anyway, a 4th-grade monster came out, but it didn't eat anyone or destroy any buildings, so we should be grateful. Let's take the toad and head back. You write the report today.\"\n\"Yes, ma'am. Who should I list as the one who dealt with the monster?\"\n\"List it as unknown.\"\n\"Understood. By the way, ma'am…\"\n\"Yeah. What?\"\nThe newbie, looking awkward, asked.\n\"Do you smell green onions?\"\n\"…Now that you mention it?\"\nSniffing around for a while, Yang Hye-jin shrugged.\n\"Maybe the toad picked up some green onions off the ground. Anyway, we're going to have dinner together after work, right?\"\n\"Yes. The usual place?\"\n\"Yeah, the hangover soup1\n***\nAt that time, in an old, decades-old hangover soup restaurant…\n—I'm against this marriage!\n—Father! How can you say that!\n—Actually… You two are siblings!\n\"Oh dear…\"\nThe old brown TV was showing a rerun of 'Couple Clinic: Love or War' on a cable channel. Someone, sitting in the prime spot where the screen was clearly visible, was peeling garlic with their eyes fixed on it.\n—Don't scold the kids! You're no saint either!\n—Mother-in-law, don't intervene! This is about my child's marriage!\n—I never intended to reveal this secret, but given the circumstances, I have no choice. The truth is… we're siblings too!\n\"The mother-in-law and son-in-law are siblings?\"\nThe busy hands dropped the garlic they were holding. Without paying attention to the next scene, the person came to their senses to find a bald lawyer declaring, \"See you in four weeks,\" and announcing a mediation period. The hands, which had been stiff as stone, only started to move again with a rustle after a few commercials had passed. Once a considerable amount of garlic peel had piled up, the body that had been sitting down stood up straight.\n\"Taking out the trash~\"\nThe voice, humming a tune while looking for the trash can, was slightly low but pleasing to the ear. The figure walked across the hall with long strides, although he was significantly taller than average, his head did not quite touch the ceiling, so there was no difficulty in moving.\nThe young man, having thrown out the garlic peels into the trash can, glanced at the clock. There was still a little time left before the evening shift began. His gaze drifted to one corner of the shop, and he momentarily frowned.\n\"Ah, I should have hit it with something else…\"\nWith a sigh, the young man tidied up the area where he had been sitting and headed toward the door. He took down the break time notice and casually tossed it to the spot he had been eyeing earlier.\n[Ingredient preparation time from 2 PM to 5 PM.]\nUnderneath the haphazardly discarded sign lay a crumpled strawberry-patterned shopping bag, completely empty.",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Prologue\nIn a secluded corner of an obviously old alley, there was a restaurant operating without even a signboard. The only clue as to what kind of place it was was a \"Hangover Soup\" sticker attached to a creaky iron sliding door, yet the place was packed. The inside was as busy as it was crowded outside, with people lining up.\nThe only items on the menu were a fifteen-thousand-won hangover soup and alcoholic beverages. Near the menu on the wall, there were some faded posters and autographs taped up haphazardly. Not celebrity autographs, but rather;\n[Hangover Soup Restaurant – Hunter Bae Won-woo]\n[It's a great restaurant! – Hunter Yang Hye-jin]\nThey were autographs from hunters.\nAmong the crowd, a young man with black hair skillfully navigated his way. Wearing a gray hoodie and a black apron with a soju brand logo, he nimbly moved through the narrow shop, even with a tray full of boiling hot stone bowls in both hands.\n\"The hangover soup is ready.\"\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\"Boss, we need two more hangover soups here!\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"Also, add two bowls of rice, please.\"\n\"Sure, coming right\nThe young man memorized the table with his eyes and busily headed to the kitchen. Just then, a man with a shaved head asked in a booming voice from behind.\n\"Excuse me, can we get another bottle of soju?\"\n\"No, you've already had two bottles of soju.\"\n\"What are you talking about? This is only our first bottle.\"\n\"I saw you put the empty bottle in the inventory earlier. No more.\"\nThe young man pointed to a spot next to the simple menu with his index finger. The hastily scribbled note on an A4 paper in black marker showed the firmness of its writer.\n[Soju limited to two bottles per table]\n[※ To prevent nuisances and fights]\nThe young man gathered empty dishes and stone bowls from the next table and went into the kitchen. As the shaved head man awkwardly pulled out the empty soju bottle from his inventory, the man opposite him scolded him, saying he knew this would happen.\n\"See, I told you, it's not allowed. That part-timer is very strict about how much we drink. It's always two bottles.\"\n\"He's sharp as a hawk. I slipped it in quicker than when I catch monsters. Isn't he a hunter?\"\nCorrect\nBut the man opposite shook his head.\n\"I heard from Team Leader Han that he already asked and the guy said he's just an ordinary person.\"\n\"What? Is that the trend now? Hidden-power hunters? Or is he unregistered?\"\n\"Come on, you know how severe the penalties are for unregistered hunters. And if he were a hidden-power hunter, he'd be raking in money in dungeons, not working part-time at a hangover soup joint.\"\nThe young man's back flinched for a moment, but the shaved head man didn't seem to notice. Instead he nodded in agreement.\n\"True. Those hiding their power are always after some grandstanding.\"\n\"Team Leader Han is waiting to recruit him once he awakens. If he's this good before awakening, he'd be at least a B-grade after.\"\nWith the murmuring voices of the hunters behind him, the young man who entered the kitchen poured water into the dishwashing basin and chuckled. 'I bet I awakened before you did. Instead of bringing in some far-off veteran hunter…'\nThe young man, named Cha Eui-jae, had an exceptional vision that could spot the empty soju bottles being hidden, and the superhuman strength to carry several boiling stone bowls at once. Despite being a hidden-power hunter, there was a reason why he chose to settle in this old and shabby restaurant instead of taking the easy way out in dungeons.\n***\nSeveral months ago, Cha Eui-jae woke up in a garbage dump. How long had he been unconscious? He blinked his eyes for a long time before his twisted senses slowly started to return.\n\"Where am I, ugh…!\"\nAs soon as the unpleasant stench hit him, bile rose from his stomach. Despite having eaten nothing, his exhausted body heaved uncontrollably. The world spun, and he had no strength to move even a finger.\nMonsters had poured endlessly from the white ruin. Yes, he remembered fighting the basilisk at the end, and stabbing its head. And then…\nWhen he finally opened his eyes, he saw a giant black hole in the middle of the dark blue night sky. It had appeared as if to herald the end of the world, but by now, it had become a familiar sight to the extent that one couldn't imagine the sky without it. Commonly referred to as the Black Hole.\nBlack holes are not visible within rifts. That meant he had returned to reality. As his consciousness became clearer and he grasped the situation, the next thing that came was a physiological need.\n\"I'm hungry…\"\nHe had to eat something. Cha Eui-jae used the trash piled up around him to prop himself up. Leaning against the dirty wall, he caught his breath for a moment. He then pushed his weak body forward, using the wall to steady himself like an invertebrate.\nAs he forced his wobbly legs to keep walking, the smell of meat wafted in from somewhere. His instincts made him open his eyes wide and scan his surroundings. At the end of the alley, he saw a solitary light. He continued to drag himself toward it.\nHe arrived at a shabby place with no signboard. Through the glass of the iron sliding door, an old woman was sitting alone. Hearing a presence, the old woman who had been peeling garlic with her back to the door slowly turned her head. Cha Eui-jae leaned his face against the glass and mumbled.\n\"Is it… possible… to get food…?\"\nOf course, he looked like a wreck, with a haggard and emaciated body, barely able to stand on shaking legs, so it probably sounded more like, \"Isht… passhible…to get fud…?\" But he had no time to be self-aware. Despite looking like a homeless person who had barely escaped from a psychopathic murderer, the old woman opened the door for him instead of screaming.\n\"What are you doing standing there? Hurry and come in.\"\nThe warm atmosphere and the smell of meat broth enveloped him as he entered. Cha Eui-jae looked down at the old woman who opened the door with a blank expression.\n\"What happened to you? Did you roll in the dirt? Did you come back from a dungeon or something?\"\n\"Uh…\"\nClicking her tongue, the old woman gestured for him to sit anywhere and disappeared into the kitchen. Cha Eui-jae awkwardly sat at the table in the farthest corner. After a while, a bowl of white bone broth1 and a bowl of rice were placed in front of him.\n\"Eat up. The hangover soup will take some time.\"\n\"…\"\n\"If you're not going to eat it, throw it away.\"\nLooking bewildered at the bowl of rice, Cha Eui-jae finally bowed his head and looked back at the old woman. Without waiting for his response, she turned and resumed peeling garlic.\nFaced with food, his appetite soared far beyond what it had been earlier. As if possessed, he devoured the bowl. As the white bone broth entered his empty stomach, the cold and hunger that had made him shiver began to subside. Cha Eui-jae thought that maybe the light he saw in the alley was the old woman's kindness, and he scooped rice into the broth.\nAfter satisfying his immediate hunger, Cha Eui-jae started to notice the interior of the restaurant. There was an old CRT TV on a shelf, faded soju posters, a worn-out wall fan, and a large wall calendar from some association. It was a restaurant that bore the marks of time.\nHow long has it been since I entered the rift? Cha Eui-jae closely examined the calendar.\n'20… what year is it?'\nHe blinked his eyes in disbelief. The year on the wall calendar showed eight years had passed. He rubbed his eyes thinking he saw it wrong, but the printed numbers on the paper did not\nCha Eui-jae held his breath. The sense of reality he had barely regained was slipping away again. He tried to calm his swirling mind by taking another sip of broth. Just then, the TV on the shelf began to broadcast a calm narration.\n—…Eight years ago today, a Grade 5 rift occurred over the West Sea.\n…Eight years? Cha Eui-jae took another sip of broth.\n—When the rift suddenly upgraded to Grade 1, the government deployed S-grade Hunter J, along with 14 A-grade and 30 B-grade hunters. The rift disappeared after a week. Unfortunately, the hunters dispatched did not return.\nFamiliar faces flashed across the screen. These were the people he had desperately searched for among the piles of corpses.\nCha Eui-jae felt a pang in his heart but ignored it, maintaining a calm expression as he continued to watch the TV. After the pictures of B-grade and A-grade hunters passed by, a final image showed S-grade Hunter J wearing a black mask that covered his entire face.\n—The Awakened Management Bureau acknowledged the deaths of all hunters who entered the rift three months after it closed.\nWith that, the screen changed. Cha Eui-jae, holding an empty spoon, put it in his mouth.\n'All dead?'\nEven S-grade Hunter J?\nHe continued to move his hand in the air, not realizing he was still spooning an empty spoon. The screen now showed a middle-aged man giving a closing remark.\n[Song Jo-heon | S-grade Awakener | Guild Leader of Samra Guild]\n—Without J, our country would not have a future. Eight years ago, we lost a hero in Incheon. J and 44 hunters bravely entered the rift. They gave us a future. We have a duty to look forward and move ahead.\nA man with a somber expression spoke solemnly as he looked at the screen.\n—This concludes the documentary commemorating the 8th anniversary of the West Sea Grade 1 Rift, 'To J'.\nA caption appeared at the bottom of the screen: [This program was produced with the support of the Pado Guild and the Awakened Management Bureau], followed by a moment of blackout on the screen. Cha Eui-jae replayed what he heard several times to ensure he had heard correctly.\n—It has been confirmed that all the hunters who entered the rift perished.\n—Eight years ago, we lost a hero in Incheon.\n—The 8th anniversary commemorative documentary, 'To J'.\nIs this a dream? If I close my eyes and open them again, will I wake up? However, it was clear to him that this was reality. The black hole he saw earlier, his belly filled like an empty bowl, and the spoon he had unintentionally dropped with a clang, all proved it.\nCha Eui-jae couldn't hide his astonishment and clutched his head. All the hunters dispatched to the West Sea rift perished? As far as he knew, that was absolutely not true. No, it couldn't be true.\nBecause Hunter J, Cha Eui-jae, was the sole survivor and was sitting here eating soup!",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Prologue\nUm, may I use the phone?\"\n\"Sure, go ahead.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nCha Eui-jae headed straight to the counter inside the store as soon as he finished speaking. He grabbed the old receiver and dialed the direct line to the Awakened Management Bureau Director, a number only he knew. His hand trembled constantly as he dialed. However,\n—The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and dial again…\nHe tried calling again just in case, but the result was the same. Cha Eui-jae slowly put down the receiver. His heart, which had been quiet as if doused in ice water, started to beat faster, and before he knew it, he was breaking out in a cold sweat.\nDid I really fall eight years into the future? Or, more importantly… am I really dead?\nHowever, he couldn't be sure of anything. Maybe the director just changed their number. Cha Eui-jae didn't want to see the situation in a purely negative light. As he hurriedly turned to leave the store, he remembered an important fact.\nHe had no money. Before entering the rift, he had only packed consumables like potions. He had even used up all the potions, leaving nothing. He was completely broke. He didn't even have money to pay for the meal.\nSneaking a glance at the old woman, Cha Eui-jae cautiously spoke up.\n\"Um, Grandma.\"\n\"Mm?\"\n\"Well, I…\"\nAs he rubbed his sleeves awkwardly, unable to continue, the old woman looked at him silently. She then slowly walked over to him and took his injured hand in her wrinkled one.\n\"It's okay, kid.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"Just come back to eat again sometime.\"\nTwo crumpled 10,000 won bills were placed in Cha Eui-jae's hand. He opened and closed his mouth repeatedly, unable to speak, and just bowed his head. The old woman went into the kitchen and soon returned with an old navy jacket and a black hat.\n\"Wear this.\"\n\"No, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.\"\n\"If you wander around in that state in daylight, you'll get caught. Wear it.\"\nThe old woman's words were indisputable. Cha Eui-jae, while taking off his tattered jacket, noticed the silver watch on his left wrist. It was something he had since the moment he awakened. This is it! Cha Eui-jae hurriedly took off the watch and handed it to the old woman.\n\"Grandma, take this.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"A watch. This is all I have right now.\"\n\"What for? I don't need it.\"\n\"No, please take it. Or think of it as a pawn. I'll come back for it later.\"\nCha Eui-jae forced the watch into the old woman's hand, pulled the hat over his head, and left the store, bowing repeatedly. The old woman called after him urgently as he ran away, but he ignored her and kept running.\nLooking up at the sky after running for a while, he saw that it was already getting light. A long line at the bus stop, cars filling the road, people walking on the wet pavement with tired faces. Many were going about their own ways.\nIt was a peaceful scene, but to Cha Eui-jae, it felt unfamiliar. This South Korea, which he estimated to be eight years into the future, was vastly different from his memories. Cha Eui-jae watched the moments of everyday life with a sense of emptiness.\nThen it happened.\nBeeeep— An alarm started blaring loudly around him. People took out their phones to check something. Two boys in school uniforms were chatting.\n\"Damn, a rift is opening in 30 minutes.\"\n\"Do you think we'll see any hunters? If a ranker comes, let's film it and put it on YouTube.\"\n\"Yeah. Man, I should've brought my drone.\"\nA rift is opening? Cha Eui-jae looked around in bewilderment. However, despite the rift alert, people seemed calm. It was as if rift alerts had become a normal part of life. Confused, Cha Eui-jae grabbed a passing woman and spoke to her.\n\"Excuse me, I'm sorry. Is a rift about to open?\"\n\"Huh? Yes, we just got an emergency alert. Didn't you see it?\"\n\"Oh, no. I left my phone behind.\"\n\"Ah, I see. Here, look.\"\nThe woman showed him her phone.\n[Rift Management Bureau]\n[A rift is expected to appear east of Wirae-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul at 7:42 AM on November 14. Residents should evacuate to designated shelters. If pre-evacuation is not possible, contact the Awakened Management Bureau.]\nA rift is essentially a 'sudden dungeon entrance'. Unlike regular dungeons, which have fixed entry points, rifts appear randomly and open an entrance. If not quickly subdued, they pour out monsters. But to predict the location and time of a rift appearance?\nAs Cha Eui-jae stood frozen, lost in thought, the woman asked cautiously.\n\"Um, are you okay…?\"\n\"Oh, yes… I'm fine. Thank you for showing me.\"\nThe woman nodded, still looking concerned, and walked away. After watching the people's backs in a daze for a moment, Cha Eui-jae also started moving.\nAs the sound of car exhausts roared, the hallucinations he had tried so hard to ignore began to trouble his ears again. The sound of bones breaking, flesh tearing, necks snapping, voices begging for mercy… The familiar screams and noises overlaid the peaceful city scene. This strange sensation made Cha Eui-jae stop in his tracks. And he thought.\nDid all those sacrifices mean anything?\nThe world eight years after J's disappearance was so peaceful and perfect. In fact, this was the very scene he had longed for.\nBroken asphalt roads, buses crushed under monster feet, collapsed buildings, burning and bent streetlights, people holding their breath in fear of monsters appearing at any moment. The past scenes were as vivid as if they had happened yesterday.\nCha Eui-jae had sincerely wished for this. To have a daily life without fear. Even if he wasn't there to see it. But now that such moments were unfolding before his eyes, his feelings were\nWould anything change if J, presumed dead for eight years, returned? The moment J announced his return, the world's peace would be shattered. Everyone would flock to him, demanding to know what happened in the rift, how he survived alone, and why it took him eight years to return.\nCha Eui-jae wiped away his cold sweat. He felt like his insides were twisting.\nHe believed that he should inform the world of his comrades' sacrifices, of course. He remembered all their names, faces, and how they died.\nBut…\n\"Eui-jae, remember.\"\n\"The world has changed, and since you have power, everyone will rely on you. They will expect you to save them all.\"\n\"But Eui-jae, you're still young…\"\n\"You don't have to save everyone.\"\n\"You can run away.\"\nCha Eui-jae recalled his aunt's words as she had held his shoulders and advised him.\nHis aunt, who had also awakened as a B-grade hunter after losing her two sons when Cha Eui-jae's family was swept away by a rift, was the only other survivor in that hellish rift. They weren't really related by blood, but they depended on each other like family. She had been the one to advise him to hide his identity.\n'Now I understand, Aunt.'\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his eyes unnecessarily.\nHunter J was already dead, and no one knew Cha Eui-jae as a person. People wouldn't even know he existed. Even after eight years, twenty-year-old Cha Eui-jae was still twenty. He still vividly remembered his aunt congratulating him on becoming an adult. However, in this world, he was twenty-eight.\nPeople passed him by indifferently. Cha Eui-jae stood alone for a long time in the crowd. Quietly, lonely.\nAnd finally,\nCha Eui-jae decided to run away for the first time.\n***\nA few months later… back at the hangover soup restaurant.\nCha Eui-jae, who had been about to wash the piled-up dishes in the kitchen, had to come back out to the hall due to the constant orders and calls from customers.\n\"Check, please!\"\n\"Yes, just a moment.\"\nOne important thing Cha Eui-jae realized while working at this restaurant was that even though he had switched from being a hunter to a hangover soup restaurant part-timer, this wasn't a place where he could live while completely hiding his power.\n\"More kimchi1 and radish2, please!\"\n\"And some more cheongyang peppers3!\"\n\"Alright, just a moment.\"\nThis place had too many customers, especially hunters who ate quickly and a lot. As a result, Cha Eui-jae was pretending to be an ordinary person who was just a bit stronger and more agile, using his awakened abilities only slightly.\n\"Excuse me, could we borrow some pepper…?\"\n\"Oh, yes, sure.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"Hurry up and clear the table! We need to eat quickly and head to the dungeon!\"\n\"We'll wipe the table ourselves! Can we use the cloth over there?\"\n\"If you give us the peppers, we'll slice them ourselves.\"\n\"This guy's a B-grade hunter. He's really good at slicing with his sword.\"\nIn the short time Cha Eui-jae had returned to the kitchen, the customers had started to divide roles as if they were raiding a dungeon. Finally escaping the bustling hall that resembled a newly opened rift, Cha Eui-jae took out containers of kimchi and radish from the fridge and took a moment to catch his breath. He moved mechanically, his eyes now empty.\n'I should set up a self-serve bar for kimchi and cheongyang peppers as soon as possible.'\nGathering up two bags of rice and chili peppers, he quickly came out of the kitchen, rapidly assessing the hunters with his eyes. It seemed best to leave the task of chopping the peppers to the B-grade hunter.\n\"You there, please chop these chili peppers, and take the kimchi, radish kimchi, and rice. I'll handle the bill.\"\nFollowing his instructions, the hunters seamlessly fell into their roles as if tackling a dungeon raid. The B-grade hunter, using a dagger that looked like at least a C-grade weapon, chopped the peppers. A C-grade hunter used tongs to serve kimchi and radish kimchi, while other hunters lined up with their bowls, waiting for their turn. Cha Eui-jae processed their payments at the card reader, watching the harmonious\nIs this the peace I've protected…?\nFormerly the number one hunter in South Korea and the first S-grade hunter of the nation, known by the hunter name J. Eight years ago, he closed the first-grade rift in the West Sea and was declared a national hero after his death. His real name, unknown to anyone, was Cha Eui-jae. And now…\n\"Thank you, have a nice day. Welcome, how many in your party?\"\n…He is currently a part-time worker at a hangover soup restaurant.",

      "content": "Chapter 4: The Day of the Rift\nThe world was turned upside down on an otherwise ordinary day 11 years ago, when thunder struck so loudly it felt like the sky was falling.\nAwoken by the unusually loud thunder, people looked up to see a massive black hole in the sky. As if waiting for everyone to wake up and see, the thunder suddenly stopped when people gazed at the sky.\nFrom the black hole, monsters no one had ever seen before began to pour out.\nThe rift instantly sucked in everything around it, and monsters swarmed out of the newly opened dungeon entrance without a moment's rest. These invaders from another world destroyed buildings and ravaged the land. Many people were injured, went missing, or died. The weapons of humanity, products of scientific civilization, were useless against the monsters.\nPeople despaired in the face of these insurmountable supernatural phenomena. They had thought the world would end in a nuclear war, not due to monsters straight out of a fantasy novel! Humanity was powerless before this sudden disaster.\nBut then, an entity appeared that stopped the impending doom, as if defying the law that said they had to do nothing and perish.\nIt was a mysterious white screen resembling a status window in a game, commonly referred to as \"the System.\"\nThe System appeared before certain individuals and awakened mysterious powers within them. Those who came into contact with the System began to awaken new powers and fight back against the monsters. This marked the advent of the first-generation Awakened, who would later be known as hunters.\nTrue to the saying that humanity is an adaptable species, people began to quickly adjust to the new era and rebuild their fallen civilization. Leading this charge was the United States, and surprisingly, South Korea was right behind them. South Korea was one of the few countries whose government and law enforcement did not collapse on the Day of the Rift, largely thanks to the sudden appearance of an S-grade Awakened known as J.\nThe only publicly known information about J was the hunter name and gender. J was a mysterious hunter who concealed their name, face, and age. J first appeared dramatically, slicing a second-grade monster, Sasquatch, in half while covering their face with a white scarf. From then on, J plunged into rifts and dungeons without hesitation, saving countless lives. Truly, a hero in troubled times, the very embodiment of Captain Korea.\n[J tears apart Sasquatch (physically)]\nAfter communication networks were restored, a video someone uploaded to YouTube amassed billions of views, turning J into a global celebrity. Even though J was just a tiny dot in the video, the sight of a single black dot tearing apart a monster the size of a building was captivating to anyone who watched it.\nIt was fitting for a hero from South Korea, an information and communication powerhouse where even amidst world-ending chaos and monster attacks, mobile phone cameras remained functional. Thanks to J's exploits, the world seemed to regain a bit of stability.\nBut the hard-won peace did not last long.\nThree years later, a fifth-grade rift appeared over the West Sea. Despite the efforts of the Awakened Management Bureau and nearby hunters, all contact with those who entered the rift was lost, and the rift continued to voraciously consume everything. It was predicted that if left unchecked, the rift would eventually swallow not just the islands of the West Sea but also Incheon.\nThe government escalated the threat level of the West Sea rift from fifth grade to first grade and made a decision.\n\"We will deploy S-grade hunter J, 14 A-grade hunters, and 30 B-grade hunters to stop the expansion of the rift.\"\nThe dispatched hunters entered the rift to the cheers of the people. Soon after their entry, the rift began to gradually stop expanding, and a month later, it completely disappeared. People rejoiced and waited for the return of the heroes. But they did not come back.\nThree months later, after an investigation, the Awakened Management Bureau concluded that the hunters had perished along with the rift and officially announced their deaths, delivering the tragic news. The government erected a memorial to honor the brave hunters who had ventured into the rift. J's name was inscribed at the top of the memorial.\nEight years have passed since then.\nNow, 11 years after the first Day of the Rift, the government was actively researching how to use monster corpses and dungeon by-products as alternative resources. Naturally, guilds shifted their operations from simply destroying dungeons to extracting as much value as possible before closing the rifts, hoping to find useful by-products.\nIn this era of great hunters that replaced the fifth industrial revolution, the Metaverse stepped aside! The central figures of the current era were none other than the hunters.\nGiven that hero movie series had been hugely popular in Korea for ages, the explosive popularity of real-life heroes who fought like superheroes without CGI was only natural. Their popularity soared daily.\nHunters had birthday billboards like idols, were flooded with advertising offers, and there were countless movies and dramas starring hunters. Some hunters even juggled dual careers as models, just like Honeybee.\nThe world became where people longed to become hunters and dreamed of awakening powers, with more than 80% of children named \"hunter\" as their future dream job. Dungeon slime ASMR videos became a trend, and idle hunters broadcasted unboxing videos of deliveries with A-grade long swords. This was the current state of South Korea.\n***\n'Is this... really okay?'\nHowever, to Cha Eui-jae, who lived through the transition to the great hunter era, all of this just seemed... surreal. Cha Eui-jae frowned as he glared at the bestsellers displayed in the bookstore.\n1st place, [Even Hunters Were Once Newbies]\n2nd place, [Noryangjin Hunter Public Official Academy Star Instructor's Secret Tips! Finish the Exam in Half a Year!]\n3rd place, [It Hurts Because I'm a Hunter]\n.\n.\n.\nWhat do you mean it hurts because you're a hunter? If it hurts, you're a patient. Cha Eui-jae frowned even more as he looked further down the list. Putting \"hunter\" on every useless thing... how pretentious.\nAs he glanced away, pretending not to see, he made eye contact with a man with a kind expression, wearing a suit and giving a thumbs-up in a public service advertisement on the wall.\n[For inquiries about Awakened registration, call hotline 777. To report unregistered Awakener or Awakened-related crimes, call 555!]\nEven after turning away from the bestseller list, Cha Eui-jae's frown did not disappear.\nNine years ago, when dungeons and rifts had relatively stabilized, the government, troubled by the increasing crimes committed by idle Awakeners, was planning to establish a new government agency to manage them. At that time, news of a police academy student awakening as an S-grade reached the officials.\nAh! This was surely a heaven-sent opportunity. The government seized the chance, immediately establishing the Awakened Management Bureau and recruiting the newly awakened police academy student.\nThat person was the man in the advertisement, S-grade public servant hunter Jung Bin.\nCha Eui-jae had encountered Jung Bin a few times while he was active as J. They weren't personally close, but they exchanged greetings. Back then, there were only two S-grade hunters in the entire country, so there was a certain internal bond. But now...\n'What happened to you?'\nWhat did you go through in those eight years? Cha Eui-jae's eyes now carried a hint of pity.\nTo exaggerate just a little, Jung Bin appeared in every public service advertisement currently in existence. In Cha Eui-jae's opinion, since Jung Bin was a public servant, the management bureau just found it convenient and cheap to send him everywhere.\nJust the other day, he was promoting smoking cessation in a TV ad, and not long ago, he was promoting the 333 brushing rule in a bus ad. Now, he was here promoting Awakened registration. Jung Bin might be the most famous hunter in Korea, at least in terms of face recognition.\nWhile Cha Eui-jae was mourning his former colleague's path, a girl with a determined expression and her hair tied in a ponytail approached with quick steps. A star-shaped name tag dangled from her backpack's zipper.\n[Park Ha-eun, Saetbyeol Elementary School, 2nd grade, class 2]. Beneath the clumsily written words, the hangover soup restaurant's phone number and address were neatly inscribed.\n\"Uncle, I picked my book.\"\nAt being called Uncle, Cha Eui-jae naturally turned his head towards her. Of course, they weren't really uncle and niece. Park Ha-eun was the only granddaughter of the hangover soup restaurant's owner, and Cha Eui-jae's family had all died on the Day of the Rift.\nBut at some point, Park Ha-eun began calling him uncle, and Cha Eui-jae didn't bother to correct her. It reminded him of his past relationship with his aunt.\n\"What did you choose?\"\n\"This.\"\n[What? The Day of the Rift]\nThe cover of the comic book Park Ha-eun held up featured several cutely drawn monsters and a masked young man. It was a familiar children's educational comic series to Cha Eui-jae.\nEven after the world nearly ended, these educational comics are still coming out. As Cha Eui-jae admired this, his eyes caught the face of the young man in the drawing. Aside from the black hair and white scarf, the mask he was wearing looked excessively familiar. It was because...\n'Isn't this an invasion of privacy?'\n...it was the same mask Cha Eui-jae wore to hide his identity when he was active as J.",

      "content": "Chapter 5: The Day of the Rift\nBlack hair and a white scarf. The only mask that couldn't possibly be mistaken for anyone else.\n'Isn't this an invasion of privacy?'\nThe character drawn here was unmistakably Hunter J, Cha Eui-jae himself. Should he call this a violation of his image rights, or infringement of the mask's copyright? Just because he's presumed dead, isn't it too reckless to use his likeness so freely?\nIn fact, this wasn't the only book where J appeared. Whether it was because people thought it was okay to use J's name since he was dead, or because he was convenient to include when explaining the post-Day of the Rift era, J appeared in all sorts of media just as often as Jung Bin.\nSeeing himself on TV didn't bother him much, but seeing it printed like this felt strangely unsettling. Maybe he should have created a foundation with the royalties as a commemoration of his S-grade awakening. Cha Eui-jae, feeling uneasy, smacked his lips and gestured to Park Ha-eun to head to the counter.\n\"That'll be thirty thousand won.\"\n'The price of two bowls of hangover soup.'\nCha Eui-jae nonchalantly pulled out cash from his wallet, paid, and with the book in one hand and holding Park Ha-eun's hand in the other, left the bookstore.\nSince the Day of the Rift, prices had soared through the roof. Even the hangover soup from the grandmother's old restaurant, which used to be seven thousand won, had risen to fifteen thousand won due to the increase in the cost of ingredients. And that was considered cheap compared to the prices in the area. Perhaps that's why so many Hunters came by... despite having plenty of money.\n\"Uncle.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nThe sudden call snapped Cha Eui-jae out of his thoughts. Park Ha-eun pointed at the book in Cha Eui-jae's other hand.\n\"I want to carry the book.\"\nSince the book wasn't too heavy for a child, he handed it over willingly. Park Ha-eun let go of her uncle's hand and cradled the book in her arms with both hands. She seemed thrilled to have something she wanted.\n\"Where are we going now?\"\n\"Going somewhere? I'm going to take you home and then head to the restaurant to prepare for the evening shift.\"\n\"That's boring.\"\nPark Ha-eun pouted at his unhesitating reply, clearly wanting to go to the restaurant with him. Cha Eui-jae shrugged, showing there was no choice.\n\"There's a lot to prepare for the evening. I'll buy you ice cream, so go home and eat it with grandma.\"\n\"..Okay.\"\nHe patted her round head as she reluctantly nodded, and they walked side by side. Despite everything, Cha Eui-jae found Park Ha-eun, who clung close to him, adorably cute, so he placed his hand on her small shoulder.\n***\nToday, as usual, Cha Eui-jae, not Hunter J, had to cook hangover soup for the Hunters. The routine at the hangover soup restaurant went as follows;\nAt 6 a.m., the restaurant opened. Hunters, who had gone on a binge drinking spree up to the fifth round, came for a sixth round at the hangover soup restaurant, or those drenched in overtime work clung to the door like barnacles1 and hurriedly found seats. Customers at this hour were mostly zombies. Their orders were usually something like,\n\"Uhm... friend?\"\n\"Yes, two bowls of hangover soup.\"\nHearing this repeatedly, Cha Eui-jae considered becoming a zombie interpreter as his third job.\nAfter the zombies staggered out, more normal customers began to arrive. Most of them came for breakfast before going to work, carrying their fatigue with them, but they were at least better than the zombies.\nThen came lunchtime, from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. It was the busiest time for the restaurant. Customers, mostly Hunters, came in waves, filling the place and then leaving just as quickly.\nSometimes, during this period, a Hunter would receive an emergency call and run out in the middle of their meal, prompting sympathetic glances from other Hunters. Watching a pitiful Hunter leave their beloved hangover soup behind, they knew it could be them the next day.\nAfter the chaotic lunchtime ended, Cha Eui-jae would put up a sign indicating the preparation time for ingredients. A break time was essential to run the business catering to the hearty appetites of Hunters. During this time, he would pick up Park Ha-eun from school, do the piled-up dishes, and prepare ingredients for the evening shift.\nFinally, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. was the evening shift. Though lunch was hectic, the hangover soup restaurant was even busier in the evening. Aside from the similarities to lunchtime, dealing with Hunters demanding another bottle of soju was particularly bothersome.\nSeeing them hide empty bottles to drink more made him sigh. Their methods were always the same— putting bottles in their inventory. Despite not getting drunk on non-special alcohol, they still ordered soju. Cha Eui-jae couldn't understand their psychology.\n\"Ahh...\"\nNow, at 10:20 p.m., having chased out the last lingering customer with a stainless steel ladle, the restaurant returned to its usual quiet. Stretching his back while cleaning the tables, Cha Eui-jae sighed deeply. Another hard day's work was done.\nAfter cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor, and washing the dishes, he grabbed a basket of garlic from the kitchen corner and sat at a table next to the counter. Living in the storage-cum-single room attached to the hangover soup restaurant, closing and opening the shop naturally fell to him.\nAs he skillfully peeled the garlic, Cha Eui-jae thought,\n'Living like this isn't so bad.'\nNot having to be summoned by the management bureau or wrestle with monsters, just sitting and peeling garlic— this was luxury. Maybe this was the life he had always wanted.\nHis recent concern was the grandmother's leg health. She had been struggling with mobility lately, so Cha Eui-jae had taken on most of the restaurant's work. He needed to take her to the hospital, but what if she needed surgery?\nCha Eui-jae sighed deeply. Closing the restaurant for a day was difficult due to its busy nature, and affording the surgery was a bigger problem. Unlike J, who lived without financial worries, Cha Eui-jae didn't. After deciding to live quietly, he donated all his money to the West Sea Rift Foundation. Even with the monthly support payments, it was far from enough for surgery.\nHe frowned, lost in thought as he peeled the garlic.\n'If worse comes to worst, I should secretly raid a dungeon and sell some loot.'\nDungeon spoils fetched good prices and might help cover the surgery costs. As he pondered how to proceed, the phone at the counter unexpectedly rang. Cha Eui-jae picked up the receiver while continuing to peel garlic.\n\"Hello, this is the hangover soup restaurant.\"\nHe was ready to say the restaurant was closed and they didn't do deliveries, but the unexpected voice on the other end made his fingers stop.\n—How should I put it, Eui-jae...\n\"Grandma?\"\nIt was grandmother. Her voice trembled slightly, something felt off. Cha Eui-jae held his breath, waiting for her next words. After a moment, she spoke.\n—Ha-eun is missing.\n\"What? Ha-eun is missing?\"\nCha Eui-jae, flustered, adjusted his grip on the receiver. Grandmother, struggling to calm herself, continued urgently.\n—Ha-eun is gone. I don't know when she left without me noticing. The world is so dangerous these days, and she went out alone...\nCha Eui-jae glanced at the clock. 10:20 p.m. It was too late for a young child to be out alone. He pushed away the dark thoughts creeping into his mind.\n\"I'll contact the police first. I'll also go out and look for her, so please try to stay calm. I'm sure everything will be okay.\"\nCha Eui-jae deliberately spoke cheerfully as he set down the knife and garlic. Grandmother asked worriedly.\n—Are you sure everything will be alright?\n\"Yes, don't worry too much.\"\n—Be careful. Ha-eun couldn't have gone far, right? Don't stay out too late and come back soon, okay? Be safe.\n\"Yes. I'll call you shortly.\"\nAfter hanging up, the image of Park Ha-eun happily buying the book came to mind. As he prepared to leave, Cha Eui-jae's face was now tense, unlike his earlier reassuring voice. His words were meant to calm himself as well.\nWearing his mask, Cha Eui-jae briskly opened the door and stepped out of the restaurant. Locking the door, he hung the red 'Closed' sign. The night air was quite chilly.",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Crazy Guy\nCha Eui-jae swung the stainless steel ladle he brought along in the air. It was obviously more durable than a green onion, making it a decent tool for self-defense. He continued to twirl the ladle, thinking of places Park Ha-eun might have gone.\nThere were no emergency rift alerts, so she wouldn't have left her grandmother to evacuate somewhere... Did she go to the playground at this hour? Or maybe she sneaked out to buy more ice cream after finishing the one she had earlier. Cha Eui-jae pondered rapidly as he headed towards the main street.\nHe had to find Park Ha-eun and bring her home before it was too late. With this resolve, Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes.\nWhen he opened his eyes again, they glowed blue. The scenery before him simplified into lines and surfaces like a building's blueprint, allowing him to see even inside the structures. 'Tracker's Eye' was a skill that let him see someone's unique light, useful for situations like this when he needed to find someone.\nWhere people had been, white lights flickered like candles in their place. A child's light was slightly smaller than average. Cha Eui-jae scanned the area intently, but it seemed Park Ha-eun wasn't nearby.\nAs he expanded the skill's range, suddenly— wham!\nA blazing purple flame caught his eye. It was the brightest and largest flame he had ever seen, burning fiercely enough to consume its surroundings.\n...A flame?\nThe decision was quick. Cha Eui-jae hurriedly moved towards the flame.\nOnly awakened individuals, including hunters, appeared as flames rather than simple lights. Although this area had many hunters, such an intense flame indicated someone of extraordinary caliber. It wasn't a typical hunter; the flame was as sharp and immense as a monster's.\nSo, he had to check it out himself. Was it just a strong-willed hunter, or a potential threat? If it was the latter... Park Ha-eun could be in danger. Cha Eui-jae gripped the ladle tightly.\nThe flame was burning in an alley not far from a hangover soup restaurant. As he got closer to the flame, he heard thuds and muffled groans growing louder. Someone was beating another person.\nAt the end of the alley, under the bright moonlight, a large figure in black was mercilessly kicking someone curled up on the ground, at the center of the fierce purple flame. The oppressive aura coming from the figure pricked Cha Eui-jae's skin.\nAt the same time, Cha Eui-jae's keen instinct flared. He could sense it instinctively. The size of the flame and the overwhelming presence akin to a monster. The figure before him was...\nThe same grade as me— S-grade.\nThe figure kicking the man turned his head sharply towards Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae quickly deactivated his skill and took a step back. Now, the figure obscured by the flame became clear.\nA man wearing a gas mask covering his entire face, dressed in black tactical gear, and wearing shiny leather shoes stained with blood. He looked unmistakably like a hunter. After a long silence, the man in the gas mask pointed directly at Cha Eui-jae with his gloved hand.\n\"You.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae stood still, unflinching at the voice calling him. The gas mask spoke lazily.\n\"I saw everything, Chum Churum apron.\"\n\"...\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae stepped back into the shadows, the gas mask added, as if to warn him against running away.\n\"Holding a ladle too.\"\nCha Eui-jae discreetly hid the hand holding the ladle behind his back. Did he see it because it's stainless steel? Damn, the guy has sharp eyes. Should I start wearing a tactical apron from now on?\nJust then, the man on the ground twitched, and the gas mask kicked him in the stomach again, still staring at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Ugh!\"\n\"This bastard crawls out the moment he sees an opening...\"\nMuttering in irritation, the gas mask pressed his foot into the man's stomach, still glaring at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Are you a civilian?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Working late...?\"\nThe follow-up question seemed perfunctory. After another silence, the gas mask added a question.\n\"But what are you doing out here with a ladle at this hour?\"\n\"Came out to find my niece. She's not home.\"\nCha Eui-jae answered in a deliberately calm voice, gesturing with his hand around his waist level.\n\"Have you seen a girl about this tall? An elementary schooler with a ponytail.\"\nCha Eui-jae brazenly asked, and the gas mask shrugged.\n\"No.\"\n\"I see. Then can I go now?\"\n\"Wait. Let me ask him too.\"\nThe foot pressing down on the man briefly lifted, then kicked his side again. But the man, seemingly unconscious, only groaned.\n\"Sorry. This guy doesn't know anything. His brain's fried on drugs.\"\nDespite his words, the gas mask didn't sound sorry at all. He probably just wanted an excuse to kick the man again. But Cha Eui-jae, more concerned about finding his niece than a black-clad thug beating someone up, said nothing more and shook his head.\n\"No, it's fine. Thanks for the trouble. I'll be going then.\"\n\"Hold on.\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae turned to leave the alley, the gas mask suddenly stopped him. After staring intently at Cha Eui-jae's face for a while, the gas mask tilted his head slightly. His voice, leisurely, seemed to make every action appear slow.\n\"Strange.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Have we met before?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"...Really?\"\nCha Eui-jae stared back at the gas mask with a look that said he genuinely didn't recognize him. There was no hint of deception; they were indeed meeting for the first time. There was no way he'd forget someone with such a distinctive look. Cha Eui-jae guessed this black-clad guy must be a newly awakened hunter while he was inside the West Sea rift.\nAfter scrutinizing Cha Eui-jae for a moment, the gas mask pressed a finger to his lips, signaling him to keep quiet about what he saw. Dealing with the police or the management office would complicate things, after all.\nCha Eui-jae, understanding the hassle of getting caught beating someone in an alley, nodded willingly. There was no one he could tell anyway, so it was easier to just pretend he hadn't seen anything. The gas mask waved his hand, indicating he could leave.\nJust then.\nCreak... Creak...\nScreeeech!\nSharp spikes burst from the back of the man on the ground, shooting towards Cha Eui-jae. Even seeing the spikes hurtling towards him, Cha Eui-jae didn't panic. Instead, he calmly stepped to the side, adjusted his grip on the ladle, and braced himself. Then...\nKaang!!\nHe perfectly deflected the spikes with the ladle!\nMaybe he should have pursued a career in baseball. He might not hit home runs, but a triple seemed within reach. Feeling proud, Cha Eui-jae opened and closed his hand a few times, inadvertently looking at the gas mask. The gas mask was holding the spike Cha Eui-jae had deflected in his hand.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nDid... did he catch it for me?\nIt seemed so. The basic principle for hunters was to protect civilians, and Cha Eui-jae, after all, was supposed to be a civilian out searching for his niece in the middle of the night. Even if he had just swung a ladle to hit the spike, he was still a civilian in need of protection.\nA cold sweat trickled down Cha Eui-jae's back. The awkward silence dragged on.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nFuck.\nWhat kind of civilian swings a ladle at a spike flying towards them? Cha Eui-jae wanted to slap himself for failing to play the role of a terrified, innocent bystander. Running away was obviously not an option here. Then the only choice left was to knock the gas mask guy out. How hard and where should he hit to just knock him out and not kill him? Awakened ones could take a harder hit, right?\nWith the ladle as his weapon, it was hard to gauge the force needed. The gas mask guy wasn't someone to be taken lightly, especially after catching that spike barehanded. Cha Eui-jae, lost in deep contemplation, stood frozen like a malfunctioning robot.\nMeanwhile, the gas mask guy stuffed his gloves into his pocket and slowly crossed his arms, seemingly waiting for Cha Eui-jae's reaction. Cha Eui-jae finally snapped back to reality and faced him.\nHa...\nLife sucks...\nIn this situation, the only option was a direct approach— or rather, a direct escape. Cha Eui-jae stared into space for a moment before bowing politely.\n\"...I'll be going now. I really need to find my niece.\"\nEscape from reality protocol initiated.\n\"Hey—\"\nBut the gas mask guy wasn't done. He dragged out his words and stepped closer. 'Don't talk to me anymore.' Cha Eui-jae took two steps back, but the gas mask guy had already closed the distance. His shadow, elongated by his tall frame, completely covered Cha Eui-jae. A chuckle seeped through the gas mask.\n\"What's your name?\"\n\"No name.\"\n\"Ah... you haven't decided on a hunter name yet?\"\n\"No, I just don't have a name.\"\n\"Should I give you one?\"\n\"Do you run a naming service or something?\"\n\"I'm thinking of starting a temporary one.\"\nThe more Cha Eui-jae tried to escape, the deeper he sank into the conversation, like a foot caught in quicksand. The only way out of a quicksand pit is to stop struggling. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath and steadied his voice.",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Crazy Guy\n\"Seriously, I have to go. There's an elementary school student wandering around at this hour. Aren't you worried about a child roaming the streets alone at night?\"\nIt was a statement so touching, it could have been a narration for a public service announcement.\n'Please understand.' Staring at the inscrutable black gas mask, Cha Eui-jae prayed silently.\n\"Right, that's true.\"\nBut despite Cha Eui-jae's desperate plea, the gas mask's voice remained relaxed. It sounded almost like it was mocking him, suggesting that such tactics wouldn't work. After nodding a few times, the gas mask took out a phone from his pocket, typed something in, and then waved the phone smugly.\n\"Our guys will find the missing kid. Just wait a bit, okay?\"\nBut this time, Cha Eui-jae quickly moved to the next step. He shook his head firmly and spoke decisively.\n\"No, I decline. I'll call the police. I'll ask for help from the protectors of the people.\"\n\"Yeah... then I'll call the Awakened Management Bureau.\"\n\"Why call the Bureau?\"\n\"Because it's faster for Hunters to use their abilities to find someone than the police. Do you like Jung Bin? I can call him right now. Should I?\"\nTaken aback by the gas mask's immediate retort, Cha Eui-jae was momentarily at a loss for words and stared at him openly.\nAre you serious?\nYeah, I am.\nAfter quickly reading each other's expressions, Cha Eui-jae felt drained, lacking the energy to continue the confrontation. He raised his hands slightly, indicating a temporary concession.\nIf there was a Hunter specialized in tracking, finding the child would indeed be easier, as the gas mask said. However, Cha Eui-jae's reason for taking a step back wasn't just that. It was that the gas mask's offer to call Jung Bin didn't sound like an empty gesture at all.\nJudging by his demeanor of beating people up, this guy was likely a marked individual in the Awakened Management Bureau's database. With his strict adherence to the law, Jung Bin would rush over immediately upon receiving this guy's call. That would definitely make the situation more complicated.\nOkay, just from this brief conversation, it's clear this guy isn't someone to get involved with.\nSigh... Cha Eui-jae sighed deeply, running a hand through his hair irritably. Time was ticking, and if they kept bickering, the conversation would never end.\n\"What do you want from me?\"\nAbandoning formal speech and getting straight to the point, Cha Eui-jae asked, causing the gas mask to chuckle lightly. Stepping closer, the gas mask whispered softly.\n\"I'll ask you two questions.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded slightly, signaling him to go ahead.\n\"First question. Choose.\"\nThe gas mask made a V sign with his large, straight fingers. Thanks to the moonlight, his hand was clearly visible even in the dark. The tips of his outstretched fingers were all stained black.\nWithout prolonging the silence, the gas mask spoke again, not waiting for Cha Eui-jae to choose.\n\"One, that ladle is an S-grade weapon unknown to the public. Is that correct?\"\nSuch an upgrade for a 6,900-won ladle, how ridiculous...\nElevating a ladle like this just because it knocked down a few spikes... Is the gas mask unexpectedly naive or just an idiot? Cha Eui-jae deliberately pondered irrelevant thoughts, standing with his hands behind his back without answering.\nAfter a long silence with no response, the gas mask sighed and slowly folded his index finger, turning his wrist halfway so the back of his hand faced Cha Eui-jae. He asked with the same composure as when he made the V sign, but this time with his middle finger pointing firmly.\n\"Two, you're an unregistered Awakener. Is that correct?\"\n\"You little...\"\nAre all Hunters this disrespectful nowadays? Cha Eui-jae stared at the annoyingly extended middle finger, exasperated.\nEight years ago, when Cha Eui-jae was active, such insubordination was unimaginable. No matter when this guy awakened, he couldn't possibly be a senior to Cha Eui-jae. Of course, I'm the first S-grade Awakened in South Korea!\nEven though it had become the era of great Hunters, it wasn't like the Confucian values1 that had persisted for hundreds of years had been discarded. As Cha Eui-jae was swallowing his anger at the insolence of the younger Hunter, the gas mask spoke with a laughter-tinged voice, driving the nail in deeper.\n\"Well... since it doesn't seem like an S-grade weapon, you must be an unregistered Awakener, right?\"\n\"I'm not unregistered.\"\nIn any case, he was officially registered as an Awakened. Strictly speaking, he wasn't unregistered... Although he might have been recorded as missing or deceased and thus erased from the records, eight years ago, he was definitely registered, so he didn't feel guilty saying so.\nHowever, the gas mask scoffed as if hearing the most absurd thing.\n\"If you're going to lie, at least put some effort into it...\"\n\"I'm telling the truth.\"\nBefore Cha Eui-jae could finish his sentence, the gas mask vanished from his sight. And in the very next moment,\nKAANG-!!\nCha Eui-jae blocked an unexpected strike from behind with his ladle. Beyond the gas mask's lens, a violet eye gleamed coldly. Despite his attack being blocked, the gas mask didn't withdraw his hand but instead gripped the ladle tightly. The already dented ladle crumpled under the pressure.\nSssss—\nShortly after, the ladle began to melt and turn black in the gas mask's hand. The acrid smell of burning metal stung Cha Eui-jae's nose.\n'Is it some sort of corrosion or decay ability?'\nDrip, drip, black liquid fell to the floor, and wherever the liquid landed, it turned pitch black. Cha Eui-jae had seen such a sight recently. The master of the West Sea rift, the Basilisk's Fang, caused everything it touched to melt similarly.\n'Poison, then.'\nA poison comparable to the Basilisk's venom. I thought the gas mask was just a concept...\nAs Cha Eui-jae furrowed his brows, the gas mask seemed to smirk behind his mask. Satisfied with the answer he had gotten, he stepped back, shaking his hand off.\n\"Just an ordinary ladle.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And you're an unregistered Awakener who blocked my attack...\"\n\"I told you, I'm not unregistered.\"\n\"Well.\"\nThrough the round lenses of the gas mask, violet eyes gleamed brightly.\n\"There's no way I wouldn't know someone at your level.\"\nIt could be taken as a compliment, but why did it feel so unpleasant? Cha Eui-jae pondered why, while meeting the persistent gaze. Soon, he realized one thing.\nThis guy has been speaking informally to me the whole time.\nHow dare he speak informally to someone he's never met before? Cha Eui-jae, who had been accustomed to extreme politeness during his time as a Hunter, found this behavior deeply irritating. There's a hierarchy even for cold water. Cha Eui-jae adjusted his posture and glared.\n\"Hey,\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"How old are you?\"\nPerplexed by the out-of-the-blue question, the gas mask tilted his head before dropping his assertive demeanor and answered innocently.\n\"Twenty-four.\"\nTwenty-four? Twentyyy-foouur? Cha Eui-jae shifted his weight onto one leg and stood with his arms crossed.\n\"You little brat, speaking informally to a stranger.\"\n\"You seem about my age too.\"\n\"Hey, I've eaten at least five thousand more bowls of rice than you.\"\nOf course, Cha Eui-jae still couldn't believe he was twenty-eight instead of twenty, but it was effective to use his age here. He hadn't literally eaten five thousand more bowls of rice, but! He had to use whatever advantage he had. His eight years of extra life experience was all he had over the gas mask.\nThe gas mask tilted his head again at the sudden old-fashioned statement. Despite the menacing mask, his actions seemed childlike and endearing.\n\"Oh... So?\"\n\"Your way of speaking is too informal.\"\n\"I see...\"\nThe gas mask chuckled briefly and lowered his head slightly toward Cha Eui-jae. His eyes curved in a smile as he whispered.\n\"Shall I use honorifics for you?\"\nGiven that this guy had just attacked him, the gas mask exuded an odd aura. If Cha Eui-jae hadn't had extensive experience fighting monsters as a Hunter, he might have felt intimidated.\nBut Cha Eui-jae was a veteran Hunter who had been through countless battles, almost to the point of disappearing from wear and tear. He was more exasperated than intimidated by the gas mask's subtly pointed soft tone. However, he hadn't matured enough to let it go when a guy four years younger was speaking informally to him.\nPhysically, he remained twenty, but mentally, he felt like he was 280. Maybe his temper suited his perceived age of 280 better.\nWhether the gas mask knew how annoyed Cha Eui-jae was or not, he fiddled with his black mask and added,\n\"Not a fan? Sorry. It's been a while since I used honorifics.\"\nIs this what they call receiving a bow after asking for one? Even after hearing the honorifics he wanted, Cha Eui-jae felt even more irked. It felt like being a grandfather dealing with a disobedient grandson who wouldn't listen and gave two bows when asked for one bow.\nCha Eui-jae tried to calm himself, reminding himself,\n'I'm just a regular civilian now. Just a civilian. Not Hunter J. That guy is a precious Hunter, and I'm a regular civilian. To find Ha-eun quickly, I need his help.'\nRecalling his reason for coming outside today helped cool his head a bit.\n—Ha-eun is missing, what should we do? I don't know when she left without a trace. The world is so dangerous these days...\nBut what if I could've found Park Ha-eun already instead of wasting time arguing with this guy? As his thoughts reached this point, Cha Eui-jae's self-control began to crack. Something was rising from within.\nRight now, I'm not J, just a well-meaning and ordinary...\n\"Even twins born a minute apart can distinguish between who's older and younger!\"\nEventually, Cha Eui-jae's inner old man erupted.",

      "content": "Chapter 8: Crazy Guy\n\"Even twins born a minute apart can distinguish between who's older and younger!\"\nCha Eui-jae, flaring up with anger, snapped, and the gas mask responded with a compliant answer.\n\"Okay. I understand, Hyung.\"\nHyung? Suddenly being addressed so familiarly left Cha Eui-jae looking up at the gas mask with a bewildered expression.\n\"Hyung?\"\n\"Would you prefer if I called you by your name?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Or should I call you apron?\"\n\"No, not that either.\"\n\"Hmm, how about ladle?\"\n\"You just melted my ladle.\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae rejected every suggestion, the gas mask spoke in a sullen voice, realizing he was getting nowhere.\n\"You won't tell me your name. You don't like apron or ladle, so all that's left is Hyung.\"\n\"No, just don't call me anything.\"\n\"Shall I call you Hyung?\"\n\"I said don't call me.\"\n\"Yes, Hyung.\"\nThe gas mask pretended not to notice Cha Eui-jae's dumbfounded expression and smoothly settled on the title. Cha Eui-jae's plan to cut off the conversation with the gas mask had completely failed. He sensed that if he kept responding, he'd get caught up in this guy's pace.\nHe could argue more, but Cha Eui-jae had a lot to do. He needed to find Park Ha-eun and prepare for the morning's business before dawn.\nHe thought about asking if the gas mask would take responsibility if today's business failed because of him, but looking at him, he figured he was the type who would do more harm than good in the kitchen. No way could the gas mask handle prepping green onions, chopping garlic, boiling broth, or blanching meat. Though he couldn't see the face behind the mask, he knew it was true.\n\"Enough with dragging out the time by splitting hairs. I won't be playing along anymore.\"\n\"I never did that.\"\n\"You've already asked two questions.\"\n\"One was a lie, and you didn't answer the other.\"\n\"I told you it wasn't a lie. If you don't believe me, that's not my problem. And I didn't agree to answer all your questions, did I?\"\nAn eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Cha Eui-jae decided to stoop to the gas mask's level and be petty. He thought if the gas mask showed any signs of being flustered or taken aback, he would just leave to find Park Ha-eun.\nBut the gas mask seemed to find the situation amusing, staring at Cha Eui-jae as if he were having the time of his life. Just as Cha Eui-jae was about to snap at him, the gas mask's phone vibrated. The gas mask answered the call, still looking at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Oh, really? Bring her here.\"\n\"...\"\nThe gas mask smiled, unable to hide his pleasure.\n\"Alright, I'll send someone to pick them up.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Take good care of her. Don't let her cry...\"\nAfter ending the call, the gas mask paused before speaking.\n\"Hyung, they found your niece.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"The playground next to the nearby church.\"\nIt was close to the alley they were in. If this guy's presence hadn't distracted him, he could have picked Park Ha-eun up without wasting time. The gas mask continued speaking.\n\"They said they'd bring her here... but it seems she wants to stay put. Since her guardian is here, they can't force her to move...\"\nThe gas mask shrugged.\n\"Go ahead. My guys will be nearby.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nCha Eui-jae had already turned halfway toward the direction of the church playground when the gas mask mentioned it. It would be rude to interrupt, so he waited until the gas mask finished speaking before moving. He waited patiently like a well-trained dog, then turned around immediately when the conversation ended.\nOh. Cha Eui-jae took a few steps before looking back at the gas mask.\n\"...Thanks.\"\nAfter expressing his gratitude, which he almost forgot, he was about to hurry away when the gas mask lightly grabbed him.\n\"Hyung.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Who's that?\"\n\"My name.\"\nThe eyes inside the gas mask narrowed slightly.\n\"See you next time.\"\n'No, let's not meet again. I appreciate you finding Ha-eun, but I don't want to encounter a crazy guy like you again.' Without returning the farewell, Cha Eui-jae hastened his steps. At the end of the alley, he glanced back, half-expecting Lee Sa-young to follow. But Lee Sa-young remained where he was, unmoving.\nFor some reason, that sight stuck with Cha Eui-jae.\n***\nLee Sa-young stood still until Cha Eui-jae's figure completely disappeared. Even after that, he waited a bit longer until Cha Eui-jae's presence had fully faded before moving.\nHe approached the motionless corpse lying on the ground. Without hesitation, he grabbed the head of the body, which had spikes protruding from it, by the hair and lifted it.\n\"They've been appearing more frequently these days...\"\nAs his hand touched it, the hair began to burn, and the flesh turned black and melted away. Soon, the corpse vanishes, leaving only a small black puddle.\nA black cat jumped lightly onto the narrow alley wall behind Lee Sa-young. From the cat's shadow, a round head popped out. It was a man wearing sunglasses.\n\"Guild Leader.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLee Sa-young wasn't surprised by the sudden presence. As he knelt and swept his hand over the puddle, the last trace of the corpse vanished, leaving only a shallow dent. The man, cradling the cat, reported.\n\"Reporting. The guardian has just arrived at the playground and reunited with the child. We confirmed the child calling him uncle and hugging him.\"\n\"Any other notable details?\"\n\"None. Should we follow them just in case?\"\n\"Follow them. Check where they go and report back immediately.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nThe man gently scratched the cat's soft fur and bowed to Lee Sa-young.\n\"And a message from the Vice-Guild Leader. He asked if a meeting at 11 a.m. the day after tomorrow regarding the dungeon bid is okay.\"\nLee Sa-young nodded in acknowledgment.\n\"Alright, I'll relay that.\"\n\"Seo Min-gi.\"\nAs Seo Min-gi, having set the cat down, started to slip into its shadow, Lee Sa-young called out.\n\"Yes? What is it?\"\n\"Help me find someone.\"\n\"Just tell me.\"\n\"Go through the Awakened Management Bureau database and compile a list of males over 25, around 180 cm tall, with at least a B-grade Awakening. Exclude those with strange faces.\"\n\"What? The Awakened Management Bureau database?\"\nSeo Min-gi pointed at himself with his thumb.\n\"Me?\"\n\"Why? Can't you do it?\"\nThe Awakened Management Bureau database. Established under the Awakened Special Law enacted a few years ago, it stored information on all Awakened individuals in South Korea. Though managed directly by the Awakened Management Bureau, its existence was treated as a state secret, and most civilians were unaware of its existence. Its security was also very tight.\nBut to hack such a place? Seo Min-gi, also known as the Hunter \"A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi,\" replied, flustered.\n\"Given some time, I can hack it, but...\"\n\"Then hack it.\"\nLee Sa-young's attitude implied it was no big deal. Seo Min-gi, already feeling overwhelmed by the thought of breaking into such a secure place, wiped away a tear secretly. Office life sure isn't easy...\nSeo Min-gi nodded, shoulders drooping. But his relentless superior didn't stop the orders.\n\"And that elementary school student we just found. Did you get the name?\"\n\"Park Ha-eun, second grade, class 2 at Saetbyeol Elementary School.\"\n\"Check her family relations.\"\nThe instructions were increasingly difficult. Afraid of getting reprimanded for being nosy, Seo Min-gi hesitated but still asked bravely.\n\"Why her family relations...?\"\n\"...\"\nAs Lee Sa-young calmly put on black leather gloves, he replied indifferently.\n\"I've taken an interest in her uncle.\"\n***\nPark Ha-eun's and her grandmother's home was an old single-story house. After finally bringing home Park Ha-eun, who had insisted on playing more, and confirming her grandmother scolding her stubborn granddaughter, Cha Eui-jae felt at ease. As he took a moment to catch his breath, Park Ha-eun's grandmother offered him barley tea and asked,\n\"Cha Eui-jae, are you staying the night?\"\n\"Oh, no. I need to go back to the restaurant and prepare for tomorrow's business.\"\n\"How's the business going? I should come out and see...\"\n\"It's going fine, Grandma. You know I'm strong. I can handle it alone. How's your leg these days?\"\n\"My leg? Almost healed.\"\nLies. Cha Eui-jae silently watched as the grandmother walked toward her sleeping granddaughter. It's easy to pretend everything's okay, but you can't hide the subconscious favoring of an uninjured leg.\nThe grandmother sighed as she stroked Park Ha-eun's head, now fast asleep under a blanket in the living room.\n\"This girl gives me heart attacks all the time. What's she doing outside at night? Doesn't she know it's dangerous...\"\n\"I'll have a talk with her tomorrow, so please don't scold her too much.\"\nLaughing, Cha Eui-jae set down the cup and subtly checked outside through the window. Something had felt off since earlier. He hadn't sensed any presence on his way to the playground to get Park Ha-eun, so it seemed he was being followed on the way home.\n'Did that guy order it?'\nIt seemed suspicious that they'd let him go so easily. Still smiling, Cha Eui-jae stood up.\n\"Good night, Grandma.\"\n\"Leaving already?\"\n\"Yes. Can I use your window?\"\n\"Why the window?\"\n\"There's something I need to take care of. I'll call to check in tomorrow.\"\nCha Eui-jae headed to the window on the opposite side of the entrance, holding his shoes in his hands.\nUsing a skill to mask his presence, Cha Eui-jae contorted his body to slip outside. He quietly closed the window, then hastily put on his shoes and listened intently to his surroundings.\nTwo men watching the front door, two more waiting in the alley. Since they weren't making any moves, it seemed they hadn't noticed his escape in this direction.\n'I could just beat them all up, but... cleaning up would be a hassle.'\nFollowing right on his heels indicated they were part of an organized group. There was no need to cause trouble and make enemies with Lee Sa-young and his group.\n'I'll just... knock them out.'\nCha Eui-jae sighed tiredly as he massaged the back of his neck. All hunters had a duty to protect civilians. So, if these guys had any sense, they wouldn't harm grandmother and Park Ha-eun.\nHowever, in extreme situations, laws and rules became meaningless, and there was always a worse scenario than the worst. Cha Eui-jae always prepared for the worst. This time was no different.\n'I need to give them a warning.'\nAfter stretching his wrists, he disappeared in an instant.",

      "content": "Chapter 9: Crazy Guy\nMeanwhile, in a narrow alley near the house, two men dressed in identical long padded coats had entered. One of the men, holding a walkie-talkie, muttered.\n\"This seems to be the target's house, but there's no movement.\"\n\"What's this? Min-gi-nim warned us a lot too... Seems anti-climactic. Did he just go to bed?\"\nA man crouched on the trash can lid, chewing gum noisily. As the streetlight's glow poured over him, the word \"PADO\" written in white on the back of his long padded coat was revealed.\n\"Hey, it's cold. Let's wait for 30 more minutes... If there's no movement by then, let's head back.\"\n\"Understood.\"\n\"And buy some fish-shaped buns on the way back.\"\n\"Sounds good. Man, what kind of overtime is this?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nThe last agreement came from an unfamiliar voice. Before the two men could react, a plastic bag was suddenly thrown over their heads.\nThud! Something heavy struck one man in the stomach. He let out a gasp and crumpled to the ground. The hit was so powerful that sweat started pouring from him with just one kick. Damn... it hurts like hell! But the pain was so intense he couldn't even struggle. A strange voice muttered.\n\"This should be enough...\"\n\"Wh-who are...?\"\n\"Oh, sorry.\"\nWhack! This time, a strong pain hit the back of his head. As his consciousness dimmed, the strange voice gently echoed.\n\"I didn't hit hard enough.\"\n'Fuck, I was just supposed to keep watch...'\nWhat kind of courtesy is hitting again after saying it was too soft? This kindness is unnecessary. With that thought, the man passed out with his eyes rolling back.\n\"...Is it done?\"\nCha Eui-jae checked the condition of the two fallen men. Their pulses were fine, and the plastic on their faces was rising and falling, showing they were breathing well. After confirming they were properly unconscious, Cha Eui-jae removed the \"Family Delivery\" plastic bags he had put on them before the assault.\nHe thought one light hit would suffice, but since they were awakened, they were tougher than expected and needed another blow. Cha Eui-jae squatted beside the men and muttered.\n\"Sorry, I'm going to check your wallets.\"\nHe politely asked the unconscious men for their understanding as he searched their long coat pockets. Fortunately, without much effort, he found a wallet in the first pocket he checked. Is there a business card? He rummaged through the contents and smirked. There it was.\n[Pado Guild Combat Support Team 1]\n[Rank B Woo Chang-hyuk]\n'Pado Guild, huh...'\nThe long padded coats the men were wearing also had \"PADO\" written on them, so the business card didn't seem fake. It was also a name he had heard frequently from the regular hunter customers at the hangover soup restaurant.\nAfter carefully putting the wallet back in the man's pocket, Cha Eui-jae placed the business card on the ground. He then took a pen from his apron pocket and,\nClick. He scribbled some crooked words with his left hand.\n[Touch them and you're dead]\nWhere should he put it so it would be seen immediately? After looking around, Cha Eui-jae decided to just place it in the man's hand. He propped the two unconscious men against the wall and walked away leisurely.\n***\nWhen he returned to the restaurant, the old clock was already pointing to 11:45.\n\"Ah, the time is tighter than I thought.\"\nDue to the uninvited guests who came in succession, he now had to prepare diligently to open the restaurant on time. Fortunately, Cha Eui-jae didn't need much sleep, so staying up all night wasn't a big problem. He put on a sanitary hat and mask, then looked down at the apron he was wearing.\nA Soju brand logo was boldly displayed in the center of the apron, as if it was showing off. It made him automatically picture Lee Sa-young's insolent face.\n\"I saw everything, chum churum apron.\"\n\"Holding a ladle too.\"\nDamn. Cha Eui-jae irritably took off the apron and replaced it with one that had a cute toad drawn on it. He then slapped his cheeks with his palms. There was no time to waste if he wanted to finish preparing to open the restaurant. After washing his hands three times, he took out the meat that had been soaking to drain the blood.\nAs he mechanically went through the familiar tasks, his thoughts kept drifting back to Lee Sa-young. Why did he go out of his way to tell him his name? Was it confidence that they'd meet again? An invitation to look him up? Whatever the reason, Cha Eui-jae didn't like it.\nHe tapped the strainer against the pot with a grim expression.\n'It feels like I'm losing.'\nMoreover, it was odd that he let him go so easily when he expected him to stick around annoyingly. Was it confidence that he could find him wherever he hid?\n'Try finding me all you want. Let's see if you can.'\nThough he had been tailed once, that house was where Grandmother and Park Ha-eun mainly lived. Since hunters wouldn't harm civilians, he just had to avoid going there unless absolutely necessary.\nThey'd never think he'd be cooking hangover soup in the restaurant. Cha Eui-jae drained the blood from the meat and shook off the water. The important thing now was gathering information. Knowing the enemy was the only way to figure out how to deal with them.\nAs he filled the pot with fresh water, Cha Eui-jae spoke clearly.\n\"Hi Nexby, search for Lee Sa-young.\"\n—Searching for Lee Sa-young on the internet.\nIt didn't take long for Nexby to display the search results on his phone screen.\n\"...What?\"\nIs this really the search results for Lee Sa-young? Cha Eui-jae stared at the screen in disbelief while his hands moved mechanically. There were so many search results that the scrollbar was incredibly tiny. Just who the hell is this guy!\n[The third S-grade awakener in South Korea is born!]\n[New rank 1 Lee Sa-young, who is he?]\n[「Cheonsujin Column」Can the new number 1 fill J's void?]\n[Lee Sa-young speaks for the first time after awakening... 'Pado Guild will be operated by a select few']\nNo way... was he really that famous?\nCha Eui-jae scanned the headlines of the articles and posts one by one.\n[Unwavering number 1 Lee Sa-young, attitude controversy at official events...]\nThe fact that the rude gas mask-wearing punk was an S-grade hunter was not surprising to Cha Eui-jae, who had felt it firsthand. But that he was the current number 1 in South Korea?\n'Why do I have to run into the number 1?'\nCha Eui-jae wiped his forehead with his wrist instead of his wet palm. No, why was the supposedly strongest guy in the country beating up people in an alley? Is life that leisurely for him?\nIn the past, Cha Eui-jae would have thought, 'This country's fucked if that punk is number 1!' But now, he didn't have time to worry about the country's future because his own fate was too harsh. In fact, South Korea had been in worse shape eight years ago.\n'Things have become more livable now.'\nHe had intended to spend his remaining years quietly cooking hangover soup. But why did it have to be a hangover soup restaurant popular among hunters? Cha Eui-jae traced back his memories to the root cause of all the trouble like a salmon swimming upstream.\nWho would have known that so many hunters would come to this restaurant? Cha Eui-jae had only found it because of the [help wanted: looking for a kitchen aunt] sign posted by the door by the benefactor grandmother. Maybe it was a problem that he came even though he wasn't an auntie.\nAfter starting work, it was strange that every customer was a hunter, so he looked it up and found numerous posts introducing the place as a well-known spot among hunters. Regretting not searching beforehand, by the time he realized, he had already become a master server. After this incident, Cha Eui-jae developed a habit of searching the internet for everything.\n\"My luck is just terrible.\"\nCha Eui-jae felt wronged. He had joined the hangover soup restaurant to live a quiet life hiding his strength, not knowing it was such a place, and the person who found out his strength turned out to be the number 1 hunter. Why did these rare chances always happen to him?\nWith a deep sigh, Cha Eui-jae continued washing the meat under cold water. Thoughts of Lee Sa-young naturally led to today's events. Reflecting on the day, Cha Eui-jae paused for a moment.\n'That thorny guy and the rank 1 showing up to deal with it personally...'\nThere were many puzzling points. Cha Eui-jae grabbed his phone again.\nEven after searching keywords like thorn, hedgehog, nothing relevant came up. Those thorns were too large and noticeable to hide, yet there were no reports or similar results.\nSo, it had to be one of two things. Either the information was still underground, or it was being controlled by higher-ups.\nEither way, Cha Eui-jae was familiar with the scenario. In a time where hunters were considered national assets, any information deemed to be of national interest was often classified. J himself was an example of such a case. Cha Eui-jae's mind raced.\n'The current threats are... Lee Sa-young finding me, and Grandma and Ha-eun's safety being compromised.'\nThe latter was concerning since Pado Guild had managed to find the address of the house where grandmother and Park Ha-eun lived. But Pado Guild was quite famous, largely due to its Guild Leader Lee Sa-young's reputation, so they likely wouldn't harm civilians recklessly. They were under the watchful eyes of the Awakened Management Bureau.\n'And well, I already gave a warning.'\nNow, the only concern was whether Lee Sa-young could find him. Cha Eui-jae sighed again as he chopped a radish in half. Fortunately, he had worn a mask that covered most of his face and hadn't given his name.\nWhat that guy knows is... Cha Eui-jae glanced at the apron hanging on the wall. That damn apron and the soup ladle that had been used for over five years in the restaurant— which had tragically been destroyed by Lee Sa-young today— were all he had left.\n'He might try to get information through Ha-eun, but... since she's not family, nothing will show up in official records.'\nHe hadn't signed a formal employment contract, so it would be impossible to track him through official documents.\nBut... a slight unease took root in his mind. What if, by some incredible chance, Lee Sa-young came to this restaurant? Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes tightly and shook his head to dispel the ominous feeling.\n\"No way that's gonna happen.\"\nCha Eui-jae muttered to himself, trying to sound upbeat as he chopped green onions. Yeah, a pretentious guy who wore a gas mask as a fashion statement wouldn't set foot in a restaurant known for curing hangovers. Yet, the cheerful chopping didn't last long.\n'...I should have killed them instead of knocking them out.'\nCha Eui-jae let out a short sigh and stared into the pitch-black darkness of the early morning.\nHe had only been hiding his power for a few months, and already a crisis was upon him. Life just never seemed to go as planned.",

      "content": "Chapter 10: Crazy Guy\nIn hunter-dominant South Korea, if one were to list the most famous guilds, there would be three without dispute.\nFirst, Pado.\nSecond, Samra.\nThird, Seowon.\nThe Samra Guild was officially South Korea's first guild. Led by Song Jo-heon, who revealed that post-awakening rank increases from A to S were possible, Samra built a solid foundation over a long period and became a substantial pillar in the Korean hunter community.\nThe Seowon Guild was famous for a different reason. Their main building housed a giant library connected to another dimension. It was like an ark of knowledge collected after the Day of the Rift. They pursued knowledge over money or fame and focused more on research than actual combat.\nAnd lastly, Pado. The Pado Guild needed no lengthy introduction. Two words were enough to summarize it.\nThe elite team, and Lee Sa-young.\n***\nOne side of the spacious meeting room in the Pado Guild was a glass wall that offered a panoramic view of the city. Bae Won-woo, the Vice-Guild Leader of Pado, walked across the room holding a tablet and knocked to draw attention.\n\"Alright, let's start checking attendance... Does anyone know why four people are missing?\"\nHe had set up chairs for the exact number of attendees, but four seats were empty. He hadn't received any notifications of absences. Was there an emergency rift somewhere? As Bae Won-woo scratched his head, a woman with bright red hair tied in a half-ponytail raised her hand.\n\"Vice-Guild Leader~ They're in the infirmary. It's been a day, I think.\"\n\"What? Why? They didn't even enter a dungeon.\"\nAt his puzzled question, the red-haired woman, Kang Ji-soo, shrugged.\n\"I don't know. They came back beaten up from somewhere.\"\n\"What? Who the hell beat up our members? Are we just going to let that slide?\"\n\"Of course, we wanted to hit back. But the Guild Leader told us to leave it alone.\"\nBae Won-woo's eyes quickly darted to Lee Sa-young, who was sitting at the head of the table, fiddling with something with an indifferent expression. Sensing the gaze, Lee Sa-young tilted his head slightly.\n\"What?\"\n\"Our guys got beaten up, and you just want to let it go? That's not the Pado way.\"\n\"Leave it. It's an order from the Guild Leader.\"\nLee Sa-young replied lazily, still disinterested. Bae Won-woo squinted, trying to see what Lee Sa-young was so engrossed with. It looked like a crumpled business card.\n\"What's that in your hand?\"\n\"A letter.\"\n\"A letter? From who?\"\n\"You're awfully curious...\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head towards the guild members.\n\"Let's start the meeting.\"\n\"Jeez... Ji-soo, make sure to brief those who are laid up later.\"\n\"Ugh, why is it always me?\"\nKang Ji-soo grumbled, but Bae Won-woo didn't respond and stepped onto the podium, adjusting the microphone. Clearing his throat, he began.\n\"Let's proceed with the quarterly dungeon bid meeting. Open the files sent by the support team on your tablets.\"\nThe meeting, which started with data on several dungeons, ended faster than expected as everyone's opinion converged on one dungeon. Bae Won-woo, standing at the podium, adjusted the microphone and announced the result.\n\"Uh... unless there are objections, we will participate in the bid for the Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon for the fourth quarter. Any objections?\"\n\"None!\"\n\"Alright, Jongno 3-ga is convenient in terms of transportation, and the materials inside are good.\"\n\"Isn't that where life recovery potion ingredients are found? Why did the government release such a prime spot for bidding?\"\n\"Probably because they need money. The bid price will be exorbitantly high.\"\nAfter it was revealed that dungeon and monster byproducts could be monetized, hunters went a step further by leaving useful dungeons open. They began to regularly explore almost-cleared dungeons and collect byproducts for profit. Additionally, the government and the Awakened Management Bureau researched unowned dungeons and auctioned off the valuable ones.\nNormally, the Guild Leader and Vice-Guild Leader would discuss and participate in auctions, but this quarter had too many valuable dungeons, making it a difficult decision. Hence, Bae Won-woo had convened today's meeting to gather everyone's opinions. Although it ended simply.\n\"With this, the meeting is over...\"\n\"Wait.\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been quietly listening throughout the meeting, raised his hand. The guild members, who had been preparing to wrap up, focused their attention. Bae Won-woo, who was about to conclude, blinked.\n\"What's up, Sa-young?\"\n\"Do you have something to say...?\"\n\"Is there an issue?\"\nCurious eyes turned to Lee Sa-young. Was there something he didn't like? A bid for another dungeon? Were they planning to snatch another guild's bid rights?\nBut what came out of his mouth was unexpected.\n\"Has anyone seen a man wearing an apron with a soju brand logo around here?\"\n\"A soju brand apron? Out of the blue?\"\n\"Yeah. Black. He also carries a ladle about this big.\"\n\"A ladle?\"\n\"He has a delicate face and black hair... or was it grey?\"\n\"A delicate face? Black but grey hair?\"\nLee Sa-young made a round shape with his hands. Bae Won-woo, the sturdy shield of the Pado Guild, looked around as if asking if this was some kind of joke. But everyone was just as puzzled, offering no insight.\n'None of you know?'\n'If the Vice-Guild Leader doesn't know, who would?'\nIt was as if their silent thoughts echoed in the air.\nNo! Lee Sa-young wouldn't have brought this up for no reason right before the meeting ended. As Bae Won-woo racked his brain, he scratched his cheek and asked.\n\"Did you see... a soju promotion event?\"\nBae Won-woo was a diligent and reliable tanker but lacked keen intelligence. His deduction was way off, but since no one else had any better ideas, they went along with it.\n\"Oh~ Guild Leader, did you visit a supermarket?\"\n\"No way, if he had, it would've been all over social media by now.\"\n\"That's true.\"\n\"Isn't it odd to walk around wearing an apron in the first place?\"\n\"Well, if he works at a restaurant, it makes sense.\"\n\"Why is the Guild Leader looking for a restaurant worker?\"\n\"Beats me. Maybe he had a great meal and forgot to take off the apron.\"\n\"Usually, the owner tells you to leave the apron behind when you pay, though.\"\n\"You're all useless.\"\nAfter listening to various suggestions, Lee Sa-young coldly assessed.\n\"No, who brought up the apron-wearing guy in the middle of a bid discussion?\"\nBae Won-woo banged the podium in frustration. The wooden podium dented under his fist. The head of the administration team adjusted his glasses, which flashed as he seized the moment.\n\"Vice-Guild Leader, I'll send an invoice for the podium replacement.\"\n\"Oh, come on. Can't you let it slide just once?\"\nAmid the sudden commotion, Lee Sa-young stood up, rolling his shoulders and slipping the crumpled business card into his pocket. Ignoring Bae Won-woo, who was pleading with the admin team leader, Lee Sa-young waved his hand to signal the end of the meeting.\n\"That's enough. Meeting adjourned. Go eat.\"\n\"Hey, Sa-young! Don't skip meals again!\"\nLee Sa-young left the meeting room first without replying to the affectionate nagging that followed him. Watching him leave, Bae Won-woo sighed deeply. Kang Ji-soo shrugged.\n\"Isn't it normal for him to skip meals? Let's just eat.\"\n\"Alright, let's go get some hangover soup.\"\n\"Ah! If you're having hangover soup again, I'm not eating with you.\"\n\"Want to join me? My treat.\"\n\"Ah, I can't hear you. I'll eat at the cafeteria. Enjoy your meal alone.\"\nBefore Bae Won-woo could persuade her, Kang Ji-soo swiftly escaped the meeting room. With a last glimmer of hope, Bae Won-woo asked the remaining members.\n\"Anyone want to join me?\"\nAs soon as he spoke, the hunters quickly left the room. They weren't even this fast when fleeing from a second-tier monster!\n\"Isn't it disrespectful to Pado's spirit for the Guild Leader to be so detached from loyalty!\"\nIn the end, Bae Won-woo had to head to the hangover soup restaurant alone. The old, well-known hangover soup restaurant he frequented was famous, but that wasn't the only reason for his daily visits.\nFirst, where people gather, rumors spread quickly! By chatting with the hunters there, I can gather information and build connections! This profound reasoning was Bae Won-woo's justification for his regular lunch visits. The satisfaction of seeing his autograph on the restaurant's old wallpaper was a bonus.\nSecond, the restaurant maintained its old prices even when the economy was crazy, served delicious food, and offered generous portions. It made you wonder how they even made a profit. The brusque welcome from the elderly owner added to its charm. The hangover soup restaurant was the only place that remained unchanged since the Day of the Rift.\nIt was a few months ago that a young man in his early twenties suddenly appeared in the restaurant.",

      "content": "Chapter 11: Crazy Guy\nAccording to what he heard, the young man was said to be the second cousin eight times removed of the owner's grandnephew at the hangover soup restaurant. Because of the Rift, he lost his entire family and was searching for surviving relatives when he barely managed to find his grandmother. With nowhere else to turn, he ended up helping out at the only blood relative's restaurant he had left in the world.\nIn truth, Bae Won-woo half-listened to the young man's tragic and grand backstory. A story of losing one's entire family and surviving alone wasn't even that unusual.\nHowever, everyone praised the young man as an unprecedentedly devoted grandson. These days, young people either prepare for the hunter civil service exam in Noryangjin or aim for non-awakened positions in hunter guilds. No matter how much of a family business it was, who would work at such a shabby hangover soup restaurant!\nBecause of this, Bae Won-woo and the other hunters viewed the young man with great favor. In fact, even they felt guilty about how much they ate, thinking it was too much for the grandmother to handle alone. The healthy and robust young man was efficient at his work, easily carrying several earthenware bowls at a time.\n\"He seemed like someone who had worked in a hangover soup restaurant for 30 years.\"\nConsidering his appearance and his family background, it was definitely his first time working in such a restaurant, yet his serving skills were extraordinary. Since he started working, the turnover rate of tables had definitely increased, and they weren't scolded by the grandmother for eating too much! For the hunters who liked to eat quickly and a lot, his arrival was welcome news.\nHowever, recently it seemed like the young man was running the restaurant alone. When asked subtly, it seemed that the grandmother's legs weren't in good condition. It was a pity.\n\"Welcome.\"\nThe young man bowed his head and greeted them, and Bae Won-woo responded with a friendly smile and looked for an empty seat. The only remaining seat was across from a lone diner at a table for two, but fortunately, the person occupying the seat was a hunter Bae Won-woo knew. He was as much of a regular as Bae Won-woo, and they had built up quite a bit of internal familiarity from meeting at least every other day. Bae Won-woo asked good-naturedly.\n\"Mind if I sit here?\"\n\"Go ahead. You timed it well before the waiting line got too long.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nThey naturally exchanged greetings and small talk as Bae Won-woo joined the table and briefly observed his surroundings. To gather the information the guild leader requested, he nonchalantly brought it up into the air.\n\"By the way... Where do they use soju aprons these days?\"\nHis voice wavered slightly at the end, but Bae Won-woo thought he had brought it up quite naturally. The hunter across from him widened his eyes and asked back.\n\"Excuse me? Soju aprons? All of a sudden?\"\n\"Well, um, I was just curious.\"\nAs he casually mentioned it, the people at nearby tables also chimed in, adding to the conversation.\n\"Don't they usually use them in restaurants to prevent food from splashing on your clothes when you wear white?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Yeah. You see them in restaurants, hanging on the wall for customers to use.\"\n\"I went to a chicken rib place in front of Maduk Guild recently, and they had them there too. It's certified as a delicious place on HunterNet, and it really was good.\"\n\"Wow, I went there once but gave up because the waiting line was too long.\"\n\"If you go there on a Friday evening, you might see Maduk Guild members having a gathering.\"\nFeeling a sense of pride as he watched the hunters happily talk about food, Bae Won-woo suddenly thought. Isn't this a restaurant too? Didn't they also provide aprons to prevent red broth from splashing? As he looked around, he saw a black apron dangling on a lattice-shaped hanger on the wall.\nYes, like that. Just as Bae Won-woo's eyes sparkled with recognition, the young man came over with kimchi and radish kimchi and placed them on the table. Then he pulled out a pen and a new receipt from the apron pocket...\n...an apron!\nBae Won-woo felt a flash of realization cross his mind. Didn't this diligent part-timer always wear an apron? The apron the young man was wearing had the Cham Soju logo boldly printed on the chest.\n...a soju brand apron?\n\"One hangover soup, right? Should I bring a lot of chili peppers?\"\nBae Won-woo was so mesmerized that he forgot to respond, staring at the young man as if in a trance.\nCome to think of it, when he first saw him, he wondered what an actor was doing in a hangover soup restaurant. His appearance was strikingly handsome, with sharp but clear black eyes and neatly trimmed black hair. Enough to make you wonder, 'How can such a beautiful and handsome person be in such a shabby place?' Momentarily, Bae Won-woo squinted his eyes.\n'Huh?'\nThe part-timer's hair... wasn't it... somewhat different? The round crown of his head under the fluorescent light looked much lighter than black today.\n'If it's gray hair...'\nSomehow... didn't it match the description Lee Sa-young gave? He said it was a rare gray color and that the person was quite good-looking. Even gray hair is uncommon!\n\"Sir?\"\nThis is a hangover soup restaurant, so... they must have a ladle, right? Bae Won-woo unconsciously looked around.\n\"Sir.\"\n\"Hunter Bae?\"\nBae Won-woo snapped out of it only when the hunter he was dining with called his name. Two pairs of eyes were looking at him strangely. Bae Won-woo nodded awkwardly with a sheepish smile.\n\"Uh, yes. That's right. A lot of chili peppers, please.\"\n\"Okay. Just a moment.\"\nClicking the pen, the young man turned and headed to the kitchen. Bae Won-woo watched his back blankly, then shook his head vigorously. No way, it can't be. Why would Lee Sa-young be looking for a part-timer at a hangover soup restaurant? There's no way they've even met or crossed paths.\n...But just in case?\nBae Won-woo kept glancing towards the kitchen where the young man went, considering the slight possibility. But soon,\n\"Your hangover soup is here.\"\nThe last trace of doubt in his mind melted away with the steaming hangover soup. Bae Won-woo smiled contentedly and finished the bowl cleanly before energetically shouting.\n\"One more bowl!\"\n***\n\"Pado Guild Blind Post\"\n[※ Please use manners while posting!]\n[※ Posts that don't follow the rules may be deleted without notice.]\nTitle: [Anonymous] Why is the guild atmosphere so tense today?\nI can barely breathe.\nComments (12)\n—Why do you think so?\n—Did you see 2401 today?\n⤷No, I was late today.

His mood was plummeting like a free-falling gyro drop. Even though his expression was completely hidden behind his gas mask, the ominous aura around him was so palpable that it was impossible to ignore.\nWhat had happened was beyond the understanding of Lee Sa-young, or indeed anyone knowledgeable about hunters in Korea.\nSouth Korea is a country that prides itself on its excellent database of personal information. When gates first opened and awakened individuals appeared, the government quickly established the Awakened Management Bureau and created the concept of 'public servant hunters' under state jurisdiction. It took less than a few years to systematically manage all awakeners' information.\nThe reason Lee Sa-young had let the suspicious 'Hyung' go so easily was because of his trust in this database. From the moment they parted, he was certain that the man was at least an A-grade hunter. It was impossible to completely hide abilities from an S-grade like himself.\nHunters who concealed their powers usually received a B-grade rating and lived comfortably, so 'Hyung' was likely pretending to be a B-grade publicly.\nAnyone B-grade or higher would surely be registered in the database. Based on this judgment, Lee Sa-young instructed Seo Min-gi to check the Awakened Database and report back. Given his abilities, he had no doubt it would succeed. But after a few days, Seo Min-gi returned with dreadful news.\n\"I got caught by Jung Bin-nim.\"\nIt was the worst possible news. As a habit, Lee Sa-young rubbed the crumpled business card with his fingertips and massaged his forehead.\n\"Your abilities are specialized in stealth, and you're ranked 33rd, right?\"\n\"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\"So how did you get caught?\"\n\"Well, that's because Jung Bin-nim is ranked 3rd and he's S-grade... Oh, no.\"\nSeo Min-gi quickly swallowed back his words, but it was too late. Lee Sa-young's languid voice sarcastically cut in.\n\"I'm ranked 1st and S-grade. So, you're saying Jung Bin is scary, but I'm not?\"\n\"No, Guild Leader. You're really scary.\"\n\"What did Jung Bin say?\"\n\"Well... he said...\"\nSeo Min-gi mumbled gloomily.\n\"He said you should visit the Awakened Management Bureau in person. He thinks a meeting is necessary...\"\n\"Shit.\"\nBecause of this, today Lee Sa-young ended up arriving late to work and personally visiting the Awakened Management Bureau. While enduring Jung Bin's constant nagging from one ear and out the other, he diligently scoured through the Awakened Database. Throughout his search, Jung Bin kept saying,\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi, the Awakened Database shouldn't be used for personal gain.\"\n\"Are you listening? I said you can't do that.\"\n\"Hunter Lee Sa-young, could you at least pretend to listen?\"\nDespite all this nagging, he didn't stop searching.\n\"If that person isn't registered here, it means there's at least a B-grade unregistered awakener walking around freely. Don't you want to confirm that?\"\nWith Lee Sa-young's reasoning, even the stern Jung Bin fell silent.\nThus, while preparing to be reprimanded and indeed getting reprimanded, they searched every possible place, but found no information whatsoever.\nSouth Korea's pride, the Awakened Database, did not have 'Hyung'.\nJust in case, they checked all the way down to F-grade three times, but the face he encountered that day was nowhere to be seen. He even looked through it again in reverse order, thinking it might differ from the ID photos, but it was the same.\nBoth men were in shock for the same reason.\nAn unregistered awakener exist in South Korea?",

      "content": "Chapter 12: Crazy Guy\nThe laws related to Awakened individuals in South Korea were strict, especially concerning the Awakened Registration Act. If one did not visit the center to register within a month of awakening, they would face fines of at least several hundred million won. Thus, while there might be hidden hunters who concealed their grade and abilities during registration, there could not be any who were entirely unregistered. That was the kind of country South Korea was.\nLost in thought, Jung Bin rubbed his chin.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi, are you sure that Awakened person is at least B-grade?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"How can you be so sure?\"\n\"He blocked my attack.\"\n\"Your attack?\"\nWhen Lee Sa-young nodded, Jung Bin quickly accepted it.\n\"Then it must be at least a B-grade.\"\n\"He also fended off the spikes that suddenly emerged from the addict's body.\"\n\"If he handled that much, he must be quite experienced in using his abilities. He's probably not newly awakened.\"\nLee Sa-young agreed with that opinion and nodded again. Then he briefly added,\n\"With a ladle.\"\n\"What? A ladle?\"\nLee Sa-young thought that the apron he was wearing wasn't just for fashion. He guessed that the man was either a part-timer or the son of the store owner. Even though he was older than Lee Sa-young, he looked like he was in his early twenties at most. He probably didn't have the money to pay the fines and yet, he was risking various penalties by not registering. What kind of courage was that?\nLee Sa-young couldn't understand it. He was getting more and more annoyed because he couldn't understand it. He wasn't even this annoyed when the guys who had been tailing 'Hyung' returned with just a business card and were carried in on stretchers. He had been confident he could find him quickly, and seeing his skills again after he had taken out four elite guild members at once reassured him.\n[Touch them and you're dead]\nLee Sa-young looked at the crumpled business card with its scrawled writing ten times a day. His patience was running thin. Finally, he turned on the microphone connected to the secretary's office.\n\"Tell Hunter 'A Small Miracle' to come to the Guild Leader's office. As quickly as possible. No, just call him over the PA system.\"\n—Hunter \"A Small Miracle,\" real name Seo Min-gi, please come to the Guild Leader's office immediately. Again, Hunter \"A Small Miracle,\" real name Seo Min-gi, please come to the Guild Leader's office...\nForty minutes before the end of the workday, Lee Sa-young called Seo Min-gi to the office.\nSoon after, Seo Min-gi entered the Guild Leader's office, looking haggard with dark circles under his eyes. He bowed his head gloomily.\n\"You called for me?\"\n\"Why do you look like that?\"\n\"...You called me to torment me, didn't you?\"\nLee Sa-young replied with a perfectly innocent face.\n\"Torment? Are you busy right now?\"\n\"...You'd call me even if I were busy.\"\n\"You're right.\"\nLee Sa-young's tone was matter-of-fact. In truth, Seo Min-gi felt a tiny pang of conscience every time guild members asked, 'Why does 240 always act like that?' because he knew he was partly at fault. He sighed and muttered in a resigned voice.\n\"Anything except hacking into the Awakened Database.\"\n\"Oh, good.\"\nLee Sa-young smiled like a satisfied cat.\n\"That kid I asked you to find before. What was her name?\"\n\"Park Ha-eun, 2nd grade, Class 2 at Saetbyeol Elementary School?\"\n\"Yes, her.\"\nLee Sa-young glanced at the business card on the table and clasped his hands.\n\"I asked you to investigate her family relations too...\"\nOh, dear. Seo Min-gi's face turned pale. He had completely forgotten about that while focusing on hacking into the Awakened Database. He hadn't even succeeded in hacking it, so he had accomplished nothing.\nLee Sa-young spoke coldly as Seo Min-gi began to tremble.\n\"Investigate it right away.\"\n\"...Yes! I'll do it right now.\"\nAfter Seo Min-gi rushed out, Lee Sa-young picked up the business card again. Moments later, the phone screen lying beyond his hand crumpling the card lit up with an incoming call.\n[Seowon Guild Nam Woo-jin]\nSeeing the caller, Lee Sa-young answered.\n\"What is it?\"\n—Jung Bin said he collected the body of an addict. It was reported.\n\"...\"\n—We've taken it in for now, but it's quite interesting. I thought you might want to come and see it yourself, so I called.\nLee Sa-young glanced at the clock. 5:25 PM. He put the crumpled business card into his inventory and stood up.\n\"I'll be there soon, so wait for me.\"\n***\nAt 2:40 PM the same day, the sign outside the hangover soup restaurant indicating \"preparing ingredients\" marked the most leisurely time of the day. Park Ha-eun, who had been sitting at a green table for 20 minutes, rolled her eyes to look up at Cha Eui-jae and pointed at his head.\n\"Uncle, the inside of your hair is getting lighter.\"\n\"Really? It is?\"\n\"Yes. You should dye it.\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at Park Ha-eun's study sheet. In the answer box for question one, there was a random drawing of two worms sitting on a leaf instead of the answer. Cha Eui-jae propped his chin on his hand, looking serious.\n\"Just out of curiosity, is the answer to question one 'worms'?\"\n\"Yes. And Uncle, I'm telling you because you don't look in the mirror. You need to dye your hair.\"\n\"Okay. Thanks for telling me. I'll check the mirror, so try to solve question one again.\"\n\"Fine, I'll try.\"\nPark Ha-eun pouted and started scribbling on her study sheet again. Cha Eui-jae got up and stood in front of the mirror on the wall, lifting his hair to check underneath. He thought it might be a trick of the fluorescent light, but the gray hair he had covered was showing at the roots again. He pulled at the ends of his hair, feeling annoyed.\n'How long has it been since I dyed it?'\nFrom the moment he escaped the West Sea rift, his hair had turned gray. To avoid drawing attention, he regularly dyed it black, but whether due to his regeneration ability or some unknown reason, it quickly reverted to gray.\n'Hair dye isn't cheap either.'\nHis hair didn't take dye well, so he had to use two or three boxes at a time, and the dyeing intervals were short. He dyed his hair more frequently than a celebrity trying to change their image. Today, he had planned to spend a relatively free afternoon after preparing plenty of ingredients. He might as well touch up his roots. He untied his apron strings.\n\"Ha-eun, Uncle is going to dye his hair. Don't open the door for anyone, even if they hang on the door.\"\n\"Even if they hang on it?\"\nSometimes, even with the \"preparing ingredients\" sign up, desperate hunters would cling to the door, begging for a bowl of hangover soup. These were mostly hunters who had just completed dungeon raids and were on the verge of collapse. Cha Eui-jae nodded firmly.\n\"Yes. Even if they hang on, don't open the door. If it gets too bad, call me immediately. Try to solve your study sheet as best as you can. Promise.\"\n\"Okay, promise.\"\nPark Ha-eun answered absentmindedly, not looking at Cha Eui-jae. Judging by the movement of her pencil, she wasn't writing but drawing. Her focus seemed more on creativity than solving problems. Cha Eui-jae chuckled softly and hung the apron on the wall.\nHe went to the side room attached to the hangover soup restaurant, took out two packs of squid ink hair dye, and headed to the bathroom.\n[Unique Trait: Hands of a Master (S+) activated.]\nWith his gloved hands moving swiftly, Cha Eui-jae applied the dye thoroughly to every part of his hair. His unique trait, 'Hands of a Master,' allowed him to handle any task with exceptional skill and precision. Whether wielding a weapon for the first time or making hangover soup as if he had been doing it for 30 years, his skill made him proficient. It was thanks to this skill that Cha Eui-jae could run the restaurant alone without the owner's help.\nWhile others would envy this supreme skill, Cha Eui-jae primarily used it to dye his hair more efficiently. This would make some people cry tears of blood if they saw it.\nCha Eui-jae set down the comb and looked at his reflection. The dye was evenly applied with no spots missed. He smiled, satisfied. Perfect.\n'If I can't work at the restaurant, maybe I should become a hairdresser.'\nAfter coming up with a new career idea following his brief stint as a zombie interpreter, Cha Eui-jae hummed a tune. Thanks to his extraordinary skill, he had many options for making a living without being a hunter. He removed the dye-covered gloves and checked the time on his phone. He had to keep the dye on for another 30 minutes.\nAs he finished cleaning up and grabbed the bathroom door handle, his phone buzzed twice with a short vibration.\nHa-eun: Uncle\nHa-eun: There's a weird person at the door\n'...Weird person?'\nPark Ha-eun, the granddaughter of the owner of a restaurant certified by hunters, had seen all kinds of hunters and had a high threshold for weirdness. For her to call someone weird, they must be quite abnormal.\nIn other words, if Ha-eun said someone was strange... it meant the person was not normal by any standard. Cha Eui-jae's expression hardened. There was an odd aura lingering nearby.\nCha Eui-jae used a skill to erase his presence and carefully opened the door. He stuck his head out just enough to check the entrance of the hangover soup restaurant.\nA shabby-looking man was clinging tightly to the door. His shoulders hunched and his body trembled as he muttered incomprehensible words, biting his nails. Occasionally, he banged his head against the glass.\nCha Eui-jae found the man's appearance oddly familiar. He furrowed his brows, trying to recall where he'd seen it before. The raspy breathing and inhuman aura...\n\"Sorry. This guy doesn't know anything. His brain's fried from drugs.\"\nAh.\nThe strange gas mask. The guy who attacked with spikes the day he met Lee Sa-young! The moment he realized this, Cha Eui-jae dashed out of the bathroom and shouted loudly.\n\"Park Ha-eun, lock the door right after I go out!\"\nWithout hesitation, he ran outside and kicked the man's face.\nSmack! The man's face was hit squarely by the kick, and he rolled into a pile of trash. Grabbing a broom set outside the door, Cha Eui-jae approached the man with determined strides. The man was trying to get up, still grinning. Blood was dripping from his crushed face, but the smile didn't waver. Blood soaked the trash bags around him.\n\"Cree... hee hee, hee... hic!\"\n\"Stop laughing, damn it. The kid can hear you.\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced back at the hangover soup restaurant. Fortunately, the interior was not visible from the door. Park Ha-eun was a smart kid, so she would know to stay hidden inside. However, the noise might still reach her, so he had to handle this quietly... No.\n'Snapping his neck would be quicker.'\nJust as he reached out to grab the man's neck, the man's body convulsed. From Cha Eui-jae's viewpoint, only the bloodied face and neck were visible. The man's creepy grin momentarily froze.\nAnd then...\nSwish!\nBlack spikes shot out from the man's body, hurtling toward Cha Eui-jae.",

      "content": "Chapter 13: Crazy Guy\nIn an instant, the black spikes shot out towards Cha Eui-jae with ferocious speed. Ignoring the spikes coming at him, Cha Eui-jae twisted the man's neck with a calm expression.\nSnap! He distinctly felt the neck bone breaking in his grasp. The man's neck twisted in a bizarre direction, and the last light in his dull eyes vanished as his body went limp.\n\"This bastard was a pain till the end.\"\nCha Eui-jae muttered in an annoyed tone as he checked his own condition. His clothes were torn in several places, but his body didn't have a single scratch. Some of the spikes that tried to penetrate his body had even bent outwards.\nShaking the blood off his hands, Cha Eui-jae stood up and tilted his head in thought.\n'Isn't this supposed to only happen at night?'\nIf such conspicuous beings roamed around in broad daylight, their existence would surely be known. Regular hunters would definitely have mentioned them.\n'But I've never heard of anything like this.'\nSuddenly, the image of the gas mask flashed through his mind. Cha Eui-jae let out a bitter laugh as he muttered to himself.\n\"I thought it meant not to talk about hurting people...\"\nWhat if it meant not to reveal their existence at all? Information control for confidentiality was common enough that it wasn't surprising...\nCha Eui-jae frowned. If that were the case, why did the gas mask let him go? It would have been easier to kill him rather than let him live while ensuring his silence.\nAt that moment, he heard small movements and sobbing sounds from the hangover soup restaurant. Park Ha-eun seemed to be approaching the door, having noticed the quiet outside. Cha Eui-jae quickly hid the man's corpse with trash. Then he ran to the door and knocked on it with the back of his hand.\n\"Ha-eun, it's your uncle. Can you open the door?\"\nHe made sure to show his face close to the glass and waved his hand. After a small moment, the lock clicked open. Park Ha-eun was sitting on the floor, hugging her school bag tightly and trembling. Upon seeing Cha Eui-jae, she seemed to relax as her legs gave out from under her.\nCha Eui-jae crouched down to her level and looked into her eyes.\n\"It's okay. There's no more strange person. He's gone far away.\"\n\"Gone?\"\nHer tear-filled eyes looked at Cha Eui-jae. Seeing her tear-streaked face, Cha Eui-jae bit the inside of his cheek.\n'...Did I kill him too cleanly?'\nPark Ha-eun dropped her school bag and reached out to Cha Eui-jae. Her small hand seemed to overlap with the bandaged hand he had once held.\nThe boy who lay wrapped in bandages, unable to speak. The only way he could express himself was by slightly moving his fingers. When he did, Cha Eui-jae would either pat his head or hold his hand tightly.\n'Damn it...'\nHis stomach churned. Cha Eui-jae lowered his eyes, hugged Park Ha-eun, and gently patted her back with his left hand.\n\"It's okay.\"\n\"Mm...\"\n\"It's all okay now. Were you scared?\"\nPark Ha-eun responded with a sob. Cha Eui-jae slightly tilted his head back, worried that the dye on his hair might touch her skin, and spoke gently.\n\"I'll tell the hunters everything. So nothing like this will happen again.\"\n\"Mm...\"\nAfter patting her back for a while, she seemed to calm down. Park Ha-eun mumbled in a nasal voice.\n\"Tell Jung Bin and Honeybee too.\"\n...That might be difficult. They had never been to the hangover soup restaurant, so there was no way to inform them. But he couldn't flatly reject her and make her feel worse, so Cha Eui-jae changed the subject with a slightly awkward smile.\n\"Can I go wash off this hair dye first?\"\n\"Mm... actually, it smells a bit.\"\n\"Make sure to say it's hair dye smell. Other people might misunderstand.\"\nFinally, Park Ha-eun laughed. Cha Eui-jae sighed briefly and began thinking about how to deal with the body hidden in the trash. He also thought about the regulars who would come to the hangover soup restaurant in an hour.\nA body that an ordinary person couldn't handle. His identity that he needed to hide.\n'Then I should ask a hunter for help.'\nFrom now on, it was time to thoroughly act like an ordinary person.\n***\nA man in a black gas mask strode into the clean lobby of the Seowon Guild. The security guards did not stop him, as if the gas mask was his identification. A boy in a white coat, standing in front of the central staircase, saw the gas mask and ran over with small steps.\n\"You've arrived, Lee Sa-young.\"\nLee Sa-young looked down at the boy with indifferent eyes.\n\"Where is Nam Woo-jin?\"\n\"He's in the operating room. I'll show you the way.\"\nThe boy led him down the right corridor, with Lee Sa-young following. The corridors of the Seowon Guild were complex like a maze and intertwined like an ant nest.\nAfter walking for a while, they finally reached a plain door with a red 'In Surgery' light on above it. The boy carefully opened the door and stepped aside.\n\"Master, Lee Sa-young is here.\"\nIn truth, the place was more like a scientist's laboratory than an operating room. The walls were lined with books and documents, surgical tools and medical devices were scattered around, and a large operating table was in the center of the room.\nA man sitting in a chair slowly opened his eyes. He had white hair tied back, heterochromatic eyes, a white coat over green surgical scrubs, and silver-framed glasses. Even in an era full of hunters with all sorts of hair and eye colors, his appearance was unique. Lee Sa-young nodded slightly in greeting.\n\"Nam Woo-jin.\"\nNam Woo-jin, ranked 6th in South Korea, the only A-grade healer in the country, stood up.\n\"I thought I'd have to wait three hours because you're so busy. But you came quickly.\"\n\"You know I'm busy. Let's get to the point.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nStanding in front of the operating table, Nam Woo-jin pulled off the white sheet covering it. Revealed was the corpse of a man with a crushed face, twisted body, and black spikes protruding from various parts. It was what they called an 'addict.' Lee Sa-young muttered indifferently.\n\"The condition is terrible.\"\n\"According to Jung Bin, it was like this when they found it. The face was caved in from a very strong blow.\"\n\"That alone wouldn't kill it.\"\n\"Right. The direct cause of death is a broken neck. Someone twisted its neck.\"\nThere were bruises shaped like handprints on the neck. Lee Sa-young's eyes sparkled as he saw the marks.\n\"This...\"\n\"Yeah. Someone grabbed it with their bare hands and snapped it.\"\nNam Woo-jin mimicked twisting something in the air.\nThe bodies of those who started mutating after taking drugs were extremely tough. It would take considerable force to break their bones and subdue them. Lee Sa-young, observing the corpse, straightened up.\n\"Who reported this?\"\n\"Yang Hye-jin. An A-grade hunter from the Rift Management Bureau.\"\nA familiar name. Lee Sa-young tapped the operating table with his fingertips and asked.\n\"Did she handle it?\"\n\"No. We don't know who did it. There was a separate first discoverer. A part-timer at a hangover soup restaurant found it while taking out the trash... and got scared out of their wits when they saw its appearance.\"\nNam Woo-jin glanced at the corpse with its black spikes.\n\"It's natural for an ordinary person to be terrified. They were so shaken they didn't know what to do and asked Yang Hye-jin, who came to eat hangover soup, to report it.\"\n\"...Hangover soup?\"\n\"Yeah. Apparently, it's a famous place... I haven't been there, so I don't know the details.\"\nWhen it came to hangover soup restaurants, there was only one that Bae Won-woo was obsessed with, going there regularly. Lee Sa-young frowned. His fingers tapping on the operating table slowed down.\n\"Where exactly was this found?\"\n\"This is interesting. Hey, show him.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\nThe boy handed over a tablet displaying a map. Lee Sa-young zoomed in on the screen.\n\"Doesn't the location look familiar? It's near the recycling center in the alley where an addict was found last time.\"\n\"...\"\n\"We need to check if a new supplier has appeared in the area. Keep that in mind.\"\nIndeed, the discovery location this time was very close to the alley where Lee Sa-young had met his 'Hyung.' Was it really a coincidence?\n\"Oh, and there's something else unusual... Look at this.\"\nNam Woo-jin pointed to some of the black spikes protruding from the corpse's body. Among the many spikes, several sticking out of the abdomen and chest were bent as if they had hit something hard.\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slightly and focused on the twisted spike tips. A strange sense of déjà vu hit him.\n\"I've never seen spikes bent like this. It looks like they suddenly collided with something very hard... Have you seen this before?\"\nYes.\nThe spikes that his 'Hyung' had bent with a ladle looked just like this. Having replayed that day's events countless times in his mind, Lee Sa-young recognized it immediately. His previously stiff mouth curved into a smile.\nWhen he couldn't find a single trace in the database, he nearly lost his temper. After some time passed, he was determined to track him down and punish him. But now that he finally found a clue, he couldn't help but laugh. Nam Woo-jin, resting his chin on his hand, muttered.\n\"Looks like you know something.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Sa-young smiled contentedly.\n\"I finally caught his tail.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 14: Crazy Guy\nThe next day, at the Pado Guild, there was a meeting to decide on the team to tackle the Jongno 3-ga Dungeon. Lee Sa-young had no intention of participating, but as a decision-maker, he had to sit in the meeting room.\nWith the unanimous agreement of the guild members, Bae Won-woo's team was chosen to tackle the dungeon. As soon as the decision was made, Lee Sa-young was the first to leave the meeting room. His mind had already wandered off before the meeting even ended. As he opened the chocolate-colored door, Seo Min-gi, who had been waiting outside, greeted him.\n\"Guild Leader.\"\nSeo Min-gi tried to start speaking with a tired look on his face, but Lee Sa-young cut him off.\n\"Go ahead.\"\nSeo Min-gi swallowed hard at Lee Sa-young's direct approach, while other guild members gathered near the door, murmuring.\n\"Hey, why are you blocking the way?\"\n\"What's this traffic jam?\"\n\"Are you really going to say it now?\"\n\"Hurry up. The others are waiting behind.\"\nThe guild members in the meeting room grumbled because Lee Sa-young was blocking the door, but he didn't pay any attention to them. Seo Min-gi felt like crying. He wanted to tell the Guild Leader to step aside for a moment, but he had to hold back for his own safety.\nSneaking a glance at the guild members, Seo Min-gi eventually followed Lee Sa-young's order.\n\"Yes... Park Ha-eun, 8 years old, her parents were victims of the Anyang Dungeon incident. She survived alone at the age of three and was about to be sent to an orphanage when her paternal grandmother took her in.\"\n\"That's enough. What about her uncle?\"\n\"Well... she doesn't have an uncle.\"\nLee Sa-young furrowed his brows as if questioning what Seo Min-gi meant. Seo Min-gi scratched his head and explained.\n\"Neither of her parents have brothers. Her mother was an only child, and her father only had sisters.\"\n\"Then... where did this 'uncle' come from?\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nSeo Min-gi rolled his eyes and suggested.\n\"We can't rule out the possibility that she calls someone unrelated 'uncle'. Given that we can't find anyone, it's unlikely to be a blood relative. Here, take this file.\"\nSeo Min-gi handed over a thick file. Lee Sa-young took it and flipped through it quickly.\n\"The only family she has, her grandmother, runs a hangover soup restaurant nearby. It's been there for quite a while.\"\nBefore Seo Min-gi could continue, a voice came from the meeting room.\n\"A hangover soup restaurant? The one in the alley?\"\n\"You know it?\"\nAt Lee Sa-young's question, Kang Ji-soo answered with a weary face.\n\"It's the Vice-Guild Leader's second workplace.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"The Vice-Guild Leader eats there all the time! He doesn't get tired of it. He shows up at the guild once a day, but goes to that restaurant twice for lunch and dinner... so it's practically his first job.\"\nLee Sa-young was aware that Bae Won-woo often ate at the same restaurant. It was a familiar scene in the Pado Guild, to the extent that guild members would avoid him when he invited them for lunch because he went there so often. It was a coincidence that the restaurant was run by Park Ha-eun's grandmother.\nInside his gas mask, Lee Sa-young's lips curved slightly upward. He had a good feeling about this.\n\"Eh? Hangover soup restaurant? Why?\"\nAt that moment, Bae Won-woo, who had given up on leaving the meeting room and was now cleaning the floor, joined the conversation.\n\"Bae Won-woo, do you know this hangover soup restaurant?\"\nLee Sa-young read out the address from the file, and Bae Won-woo, who had been listening quietly, nodded. His voice sounded a bit more excited than usual at the mention of the restaurant.\n\"Ah, that's my regular place. My autograph is even there. Why? You want to go check it out?\"\n\"Oh, this feels ominous. Guild Leader, please step aside.\"\nSensing danger, Kang Ji-soo urgently waved his hand, and Lee Sa-young, who had been blocking the way, took a step back. In that moment, the redhead darted out of the meeting room, and Bae Won-woo slowly made his way over like a substitute in a game. Seo Min-gi took this opportunity to bow his head.\n\"That's all the noteworthy information I have. I'll take my leave now.\"\nLee Sa-young didn't stop Seo Min-gi. There was no need to anymore. As the two hunters left and the new target approached, Lee Sa-young spoke slyly.\n\"Going to the hangover soup restaurant today?\"\n\"Huh? Yeah. How did you know?\"\n\"Great. Take me with you.\"\nThrough the lens of his gas mask, Lee Sa-young's eyes curved into a smile. Suddenly, the indoor temperature seemed to drop by about three degrees, and Bae Won-woo felt goosebumps all over. Did a guild member who still couldn't control their powers come upstairs? He looked around, but the hallway was empty except for the two of them.\n\"Why the sudden interest?\"\n\"I haven't eaten out for a while.\"\nStill smiling innocently, Lee Sa-young urged Bae Won-woo. Although it was hard to see because of the gas mask, Bae Won-woo, who had spent years with Lee Sa-young, could tell.\nTo Bae Won-woo, Lee Sa-young was like a younger brother he kept by his side, whether he liked it or not. So when this guy said he wanted to eat out for the first time in ages? And at my favorite place?\nLee Sa-young rarely ate out. His ability to produce poison was deadly to both allies and enemies, so he had his own set of rules for safety.\nThat's why he preferred solo missions and held back his abilities even in team battles. Knowing this, Bae Won-woo felt a pang of emotion at Lee Sa-young's desire to eat out. He couldn't help but feel a subconscious concern for Lee Sa-young, who was always cautious about having people around him.\n\"Ah, fine, fine. You should eat out occasionally.\"\nBae Won-woo quickly shook off the eerie feeling from a second ago and looked at Lee Sa-young with a kind smile. Lee Sa-young smiled back in a similar way, although his smile hid a cunning intention.\nBae Won-woo slapped his chest confidently.\n\"I'll buy lunch today!\"\n\"Is the food good there?\"\n\"Of course! Once you try it, you'll want to come every day.\"\n\"You might as well transfer your job there.\"\n\"I'm considering it, you punk.\"\nWith that, the two went their separate ways to their offices, planning their lunch. Oblivious to the hunters who didn't want to get involved in the Guild Leader and Vice-Guild Leader's lunch plans...\nAt the highly anticipated lunchtime, Bae Won-woo led Lee Sa-young to the hangover soup restaurant with a triumphant look on his face. When they arrived, it was already busy with lunch service. Lee Sa-young, scanning the shabby exterior of the restaurant, asked suspiciously.\n\"Is this place really a good restaurant?\"\n\"Hey, don't you trust me?\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Sa-young's skepticism wasn't entirely unfounded. The entrance was so low that it felt like his nose would touch it, and the shabby exterior looked like it could collapse at any moment. This rundown place was definitely not to Lee Sa-young's taste, who liked clean environments.\n\"Even if you don't trust me, trust my taste.\"\n\"What's on the menu here?\"\n\"Hangover soup.\"\n\"What else?\"\n\"Rice.\"\n\"What else?\"\n\"Soju, makgeolli1.\"\n\"That's it?\"\nBae Won-woo shook his head, looking at Lee Sa-young's discontented face.\n\"Think about it. How good must it be if they only serve hangover soup? Haven't you been deceived enough?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"You're too skeptical, man.\"\nDespite his words, Lee Sa-young found them somewhat convincing. If the restaurant had been operating for a long time, it meant it had many customers. Lee Sa-young finally let go of some of his doubts and peeked inside through the sliding door's glass.\nWhat he saw inside the hangover soup restaurant was... hunters everywhere. It wasn't just a lot; it was a field of hunters! It looked like a dungeon auction was about to be held. Lee Sa-young stepped back from the glass and looked suspiciously at Bae Won-woo.\n\"Why are you looking at me like that? What's up?\"\n\"...Are you thinking about transferring to another guild?\"\n\"What nonsense? Do you know how much time and effort I've invested in Pado?\"\n\"But why are there so many hunters here? Even the HB Guild's HR team leader is here.\"\nOnly then did Bae Won-woo remember a fact he had forgotten in his excitement about the hangover soup.\nThis was a paradise for tired and hungry hunters. A rest stop for hunters, a hunters' approved restaurant. And he had brought the ill-mannered Guild Leader here. If he got annoyed and released his poison while eating...\nWe're fucked.\nThe overwhelming sense of doom washed over him like being launched into space. If a fight broke out here, it wouldn't just be a disaster; it could make the 9 o'clock news.\nShould we just leave now? Go eat at a dosirak2 place instead?\nWhile Bae Won-woo agonized over this, Lee Sa-young slipped through the sliding door as soon as the previous customers left. His agile movement, typical of the top-ranking hunter, left no chance to stop him.\nLee Sa-young ducked slightly to avoid hitting the low ceiling, then looked up and straight ahead. In front of him...\n\"Welcome...\"\nThe face he had been looking for appeared. Although it was half-covered by a mask that night, Lee Sa-young was certain.\nA young man wearing an apron with a soju brand on it, holding a hot pot instead of a ladle.\n\"...Found you.\"\nAs if to confirm Lee Sa-young's certainty, the young man's face crumpled in real-time. Lee Sa-young raised the corners of his invisible mouth and greeted softly.\n\"Hello, Hyung.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 15: Crazy Guy\nThere are days when, from the moment you open your eyes in the morning, everything feels unusually off. For Cha Eui-jae, today was exactly one of those days.\nDoesn't everyone have such a day? The kind of day where you wake up thinking, \"It can't be this refreshing,\" as you are greeted by the chirping of sparrows and warm sunlight. A day where you fall out of bed as soon as you wake up, barely get ready, and find yourself on the verge of being late. On top of that, a day where you realize you haven't laced up your new shoes and end up crying as you lace them at the front door. A day where everything seems to go wrong.\nCha Eui-jae hadn't felt this ominous premonition in a long time. He took out his phone and called his AI assistant.\n\"Nexby, search for today's fortune.\"\n—Searching for today's fortune.\nHis AI assistant began to read out today's fortune in a monotone voice.\n—It's a day where you could get hurt even by falling leaves, so be very careful and cautious in everything. Danger lurks around you. Don't overlook anything and be meticulous.\n\"Is this today's fortune or a murder warning...?\"\nContrary to Cha Eui-jae's hope for some reassurance, Nexby continued with the unsettling fortune.\n—It's best to spend today quietly and cautiously. In the afternoon, there might be a pleasant encounter, so consider going out for a bit.\nTo sum it up, it was essentially saying, \"Your fortune is trash today.\" Cha Eui-jae's sharp intuition, which was usually spot-on, matched the fortune perfectly. Today seemed like it was going to be rough. He has to be careful... Cha Eui-jae stretched and resolved to be cautious.\nHowever, there was one thing Cha Eui-jae overlooked; no matter how careful you are, fate will find its way to you eventually.\nJust like how Lee Sa-young barged into this restaurant today!\n***\n\"Hello, Hyung.\"\nThe low, leisurely voice was familiar. Was it because the brief encounter had left a strong impression? Or because their first meeting was so intense?\nCha Eui-jae froze with the hot pot in hand. He didn't want to believe his ears, but his sharp hearing wouldn't mistake the person's identity. Moreover, the sight before him perfectly matched the appearance of that guy in his mind.\nA gas mask-wearing person, taller than most, stood with hands in pockets, looking this way.\n\"I got your letter, Hyung.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ah, you're wearing a different apron today.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It suits you.\"\nThe eyes behind the gas mask's lenses gleamed like a cat playing with a toy.\nCha Eui-jae wasn't the only one shocked by Lee Sa-young's appearance. The moment the man with the gas mask entered, everyone in the restaurant turned their heads towards the door as if cursed with slowness.\nAnd just like someone pressed a pause button, everyone's faces hardened. These hunters, known for their assertiveness, were united in this moment.\n'Why are you here...?'\nEventually, someone muttered a sigh.\n\"Shit...\"\n'Why is this high-profile guy in such a humble place?'\n'Is he someone who eats out? Doesn't he usually avoid crowded places?'\n'Sure, maybe he does eat out sometimes, but why here of all places?'\n'Is he bored with life? Why come to such a rundown restaurant when there are better places?'\nIf you could measure the heat of the hunters' glares with a digital thermometer, it would easily exceed 100 degrees. The air would have boiled water and melted the pot.\nAnd at the center of it all stood Cha Eui-jae, managing his expression despite being shocked.\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\nFortunately, he had a trait that helped him manage his expression. He was never more grateful for it than today. Cha Eui-jae let the trait handle his expression while he quickly scanned the area to find the culprit. He spotted one.\n\"Let's sit at that table. Haha...\"\nIt was Bae Won-woo, who entered the restaurant looking like someone who spilled spicy soup on a white carpet, nervously glancing around. As soon as Bae Won-woo appeared, the hunters' piercing gazes shifted to him.\nFrom the hunters' perspective, it was as if a meteor emitting toxic gas had fallen into their dining area!\nLee Sa-young, ignoring the hunters' stares and Bae Won-woo's bitter expression, walked straight to the center of the restaurant. A hunter, who had just finished eating three bowls of hangover soup, gasped and stepped back, allowing Lee Sa-young to sit as if he had reserved the seat.\nCha Eui-jae, who was massaging his temples, spoke up.\n\"Excuse me, we haven't cleared the table yet. Could you sit somewhere else...?\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Sa-young crossed his long legs and clasped his hands over his knees, answering casually.\n\"Take your time clearing it. I like this spot. I can see the TV well.\"\n\"Oh, okay...\"\nWhat are you going to do with that small TV?\nCha Eui-jae tried to calm himself with the phrase \"The customer is king.\" He needed to handle this situation without escalating it. This wasn't his restaurant, after all. A fight could result in the restaurant and the whole street being obliterated.\nShowing discomfort would be like digging his own grave. And who would believe that the guy working in the hangover soup restaurant knew Lee Sa-young?\nCha Eui-jae cleaned the table Lee Sa-young sat at and took out a pen and order pad from his apron pocket. Watching him, Lee Sa-young asked innocently.\n\"What's on the menu here?\"\nBae Won-woo looked at Lee Sa-young with accusing eyes. We talked about this before coming in, you idiot. There's only hangover soup...\nCha Eui-jae replied shortly.\n\"Hangover soup.\"\n\"Is that all?\"\n\"Yes, just hangover soup.\"\n\"Hey, I told you they only serve hangover soup.\"\nBae Won-woo tried to intervene, but Lee Sa-young continued to look around the shop deliberately.\n\"Can you run a business with just hangover soup?\"\n\"Customer.\"\n\"Oh right, you also sell rice and soju. But those aren't main dishes.\"\n\"If you're going to complain, please leave.\"\n\"Ah, hahaha, we'll just have two hangover soups.\"\nBae Won-woo raised his voice a bit to mediate. Cha Eui-jae sighed and scribbled '2' on the order pad. He stared at Bae Won-woo for three seconds without saying anything.\nBae Won-woo, a regular who even had his autograph hanging in the shop, visited every day for lunch and dinner, often polishing off at least three bowls each time. Cha Eui-jae didn't want to blame anyone, but he felt like aiming his irritation at Bae Won-woo for a moment.\nPerhaps sensing Cha Eui-jae's icy gaze, Bae Won-woo averted his eyes and stared at the table, gulping down water.\n'Consider yourself lucky you're a regular.'\nCha Eui-jae headed to the kitchen with the order, thinking it wouldn't change anything to blame someone, but feeling the irritation build up.\n'Oh well, the water's already spilled.'\nEver since falling eight years into the future from the rift, Cha Eui-jae had learned to accept things. Blaming Bae Won-woo wouldn't make Lee Sa-young disappear. He tried to calm himself, reminding that despite the circumstances, Lee Sa-young was a paying customer.\nAlright, mind control complete. Cha Eui-jae placed two bowls of hangover soup on the stove, hoping Lee Sa-young would behave, at least until the soup was ready.\nA short while later, the hangover soup restaurant welcomed a somewhat bleak scene.\nPrecisely, the tables around Lee Sa-young were empty. On the tables were crumpled bills left behind by the fleeing customers, and a few stood near the counter, waiting to pay. Among this chaos, Lee Sa-young sat calmly.\n'Damn, does he think he's the eye of the storm?'\nCha Eui-jae peeked outside. Far away, he saw the backs of the hunters who had been eating, running off in a hurry.\n\"Excuse me!\"\n\"Thanks for the meal—!!!\"\nLeaving the hangover soup on the tray, Cha Eui-jae quickly followed them out, but the hunters responded loudly and disappeared swiftly. They moved so fast it was reminiscent of fleeing monsters in a dungeon.\nStaring blankly at the empty alley, Cha Eui-jae turned his gaze back to the restaurant. Near the door, hunters waiting for seats were clinging to the wall like barnacles.\nCha Eui-jae pointed to the empty seats inside.\n\"There are empty seats. Come in. I'll clean up quickly.\"\nBut they all shook their heads and waved their hands.\n\"It's okay! We're not that hungry.\"\nGrowl.\nYour stomach doesn't seem to agree. But the number one in line was resolute, clenching his fists and declaring with determination.\n\"We can wait a bit longer!\"\nIf you insist... Cha Eui-jae looked at the second in line, who quickly pulled out his phone and put it to his ear. After a brief hesitation, he started speaking awkwardly, like reading a textbook.\n\"Oh, right! Boss, that thing was due today! I completely forgot! Yes, I'm coming!\"\nWhat even is that? And you started staccato1 but finished like a rap.\nThe second hunter covered the speaker and whispered to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Oh, I lined up, but I need to run an errand for my boss. I've been so forgetful lately... Please let someone else go in first.\"\nBut the phone screen, visible from the reactivation of the proximity sensor, showed no dialed number, just the background wallpaper. If you're going to lie, at least make an effort...\nCha Eui-jae looked at the third in line with a cold gaze.\nThe third hunter in line stood expressionless, seemingly calm despite the situation. Thinking that this customer would be manageable, Cha Eui-jae turned to look at him, and the hunter opened his mouth.\n\"Can you call me when that guy leaves? I'll give you my number. 010...\"\nForget it. He wasn't calm at all.\nAs the unprecedented refusal-to-enter situation unfolded, the suspicion that had been brewing in Cha Eui-jae's mind turned into certainty. That gas mask had definitely found him after seeing him with a ladle and apron that night and was here to cause trouble. Failing to refill customers for the first time since he started working at the hangover soup restaurant, Cha Eui-jae returned inside, grabbed two boiling hot stone bowls of soup, and headed to Lee Sa-young's table.\nCan I report him for obstructing business to the police? But what if the troublemaker is a hunter? Should I call the Awakened Management Bureau instead?\n\"Sir.\"\nCha Eui-jae placed the boiling stone bowls on the table with a thud.\n\"Here are your two orders of hangover soup.\"\nEven after serving the food, he remained standing there. No matter how deeply immersed in his persona he was, surely he wouldn't eat with a gas mask on. Let's see that shameless face of his, Cha Eui-jae thought as he glared suspiciously at Lee Sa-young.\nA black-gloved hand moved towards his face, and Lee Sa-young slowly removed the gas mask, setting it down on the table. Beneath slightly tousled bangs, his violet eyes gleamed sharply. Their gazes met, as if Lee Sa-young had been watching him all along.\n\"You're going to bore a hole in my face.\"\nFor some reason, Cha Eui-jae couldn't look away from him, just like that night he first encountered Lee Sa-young in the alley.",

      "content": "Chapter 16: Crazy Guy\n\"You're going to bore a hole in my face.\"\nLee Sa-young said lazily, resting his chin on his hand. The voice that had come from inside the gas mask now flowed from his lips. His black hair and calm violet eyes matched his voice well. His long, thick eyelashes cast shadows with every blink.\nWith a smoothly curved nose and a small mole just below his plump lips, he had an overall delicate and finely drawn appearance. Although he had a refined and ornate look, there was also a hint of languor.\nOddly enough, Cha Eui-jae understood why Lee Sa-young wore a gas mask. If he went around showing that face to everyone, it would surely cause a lot of trouble.\nThough Cha Eui-jae found many things about Lee Sa-young unpleasant, he objectively acknowledged that his face was captivating in a different way compared to the gas mask. With the mask on, he was just a crazy person to avoid, but without it, he was a crazy person who lived up to his looks.\nSome of the remaining hunters glanced at Lee Sa-young, but he didn't seem particularly uncomfortable. He appeared accustomed to being the center of attention. On the contrary, when they met Lee Sa-young's gaze, the hunters quickly looked away as if they had been stung.\nLee Sa-young silently cleaned up around him and picked up his spoon. Simultaneously, Cha Eui-jae, having finished his task, started to walk away. He was curious about what Lee Sa-young would say about the hangover soup. Slowing his pace to eavesdrop, he overheard Bae Won-woo trying to scratch his itch.\n\"How is it? Tasty?\"\n\"The broth is hot.\"\n\"It's fresh off the stove, so of course it's hot, you crazy fool. I meant the taste.\"\n\"The meat is tender.\"\n\"Right? The meat here separates from the bone really easily.\"\n\"Yeah, it's okay.\"\nLee Sa-young gave a small nod. Though it was a tepid response, it was reassuring not to hear any complaints. Cha Eui-jae felt slightly relieved.\nWhile finishing up the dishes in the kitchen, Cha Eui-jae kept glancing at the hall. Contrary to how he had picked a fight before ordering, Lee Sa-young was now eating quietly without causing any more trouble. A brief peace settled in the hangover soup restaurant while the two ate in the eye of the storm.\nWhen he was almost done with the dishes, Lee Sa-young was the first to get up. Shortly after, Bae Won-woo also stood in front of the counter and called out to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Hey, part-timer, can you take the payment?\"\n\"Yes, just a moment—\"\nCha Eui-jae removed his rubber gloves and wiped the moisture off his hands on a nearby cloth. On his way to the counter, he noticed the table with two stone bowls, one completely empty and the other with a bit of broth left. Though they hadn't ordered extra, Cha Eui-jae was surprised that Bae Won-woo had only eaten one bowl.\n\"It's thirty thousand won.\"\nLee Sa-young handed over two fifty-thousand won bills. Was he showing off his money? Cha Eui-jae thought, 'What a weirdo,' as he took only one bill. When he returned twenty thousand won as change, Lee Sa-young looked more perplexed.\n\"That includes the cost of the tableware.\"\n\"...Why?\"\n\"Didn't I tell you my name?\"\n\"Yes, you did.\"\n\"Didn't you look me up?\"\nBlinking lightly, Lee Sa-young said in an impressed tone.\n\"You really don't know who I am.\"\nThen he slightly opened his mouth and revealed his tongue. It was black from root to tip, unlike the usual crimson. Confirming that Cha Eui-jae's eyes were fixed on it, Lee Sa-young lightly bit his tongue with his front teeth.\n\"I have poison in my mouth too, so—\"\n'Wait a second, what the hell.'\n\"I don't usually eat out.\"\nNo wonder there was a circle of space around this guy! Cha Eui-jae unconsciously glanced back at the table where Lee Sa-young and Bae Won-woo had eaten. He had thought the gloves were enough for safety, but who would have guessed this snake had poison in its mouth too? This is why you should read the entire article, not just the headline. There was a reason for the gas mask. Lee Sa-young smiled sweetly.\n\"Huh... we really need to get to know each other better.\"\n'No, you crazy bastard.'\n\"I'll be back.\"\nCha Eui-jae's next words came out aloud.\n\"Don't come back.\"\n\"Next time, tell me your name.\"\n\"I said don't come back.\"\nCha Eui-jae glared openly at Bae Won-woo, signaling them to get lost. Catching the hint perfectly, Bae Won-woo started to gently push Lee Sa-young's back. But Korea's number one ranked hunter wasn't that easy to move. As he was barely budged, Lee Sa-young suddenly spoke.\n\"Your hair.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"It's black? Did you dye it?\"\nDamn, how did he know that? Thankfully, his poker face trait was still active. Cha Eui-jae shamelessly replied.\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"It seemed a bit gray before.\"\n'Why does this masked guy have such good eyesight?'\nIt was fortunate that Park Ha-eun reminded him to dye his hair again, Cha Eui-jae thought he should get her the slime toy she wanted as a reward. He answered.\n\"You must have seen wrong. Why would a normal person have gray hair?\"\nLee Sa-young didn't bother to respond to Cha Eui-jae's rebuttal and continued.\n\"And your eyes.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"They're black.\"\n\"Koreans have black eyes.\"\n\"That's odd.\"\nLee Sa-young, now wearing his gas mask again, looked at Cha Eui-jae through the lenses.\n\"When I saw you then, they were blue.\"\nCha Eui-jae's spine tingled for a moment. Had he noticed before he turned off the tracker's vision in that brief instant?\n'This guy is really troublesome.'\nAs Cha Eui-jae's lips began to tighten, Lee Sa-young's violet eyes narrowed, and he stepped back.\n\"Well... that's all for today. See you, Hyung.\"\n\"Goodbye, customer.\"\n\"Won't you call me Sa-young?\"\n\"Just go.\"\nLee Sa-young left with a small chuckle. Bae Won-woo, scratching his head in confusion, gave a bow and left the restaurant. A silence filled the hangover soup restaurant after the storm had passed. Cha Eui-jae looked at the two fifty-thousand won bills left on the counter and muttered.\n\"What a crazy bastard...\"\n***\n\"Pado Guild Blind Post\"\n[※Please use manners while posting!]\n[※Posts that don't follow the rules may be deleted without notice.]\nTitle: [Anonymous] We've been having team dinners at the hangover soup restaurant almost every day lately\nIs this normal?\nI'm starting to suspect we're being harassed at work as a team...\nThe soup is good... but eating it every day is a bit much...\nComments (14)\n—Is it the vice guild leader's team? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n⤷Yeah...\n—The vice guild leader loves hangover soup, doesn't he? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ is he taking the whole team now?\n⤷The guild leader pre-paid 5 million won at the soup place.\n⤷???\n⤷What?\n⤷Not the vice guild leader, but the guild leader?????\n⤷Five million won?\n⤷Yeah, he tried to pre-pay 15 million won, but the part-timer and the vice guild leader stopped him, so he only did 5 million.\n⤷Why didn't he pre-pay at a high-end beef restaurant?

[Question] I'm being harassed by a hunter while working\nHello, I work at a small shop. If a hunter harasses me, where should I report it?

[Selected Answer]\nAccording to the Awakened Special Law, cases involving Awakeners should be reported to the Awakened Management Bureau. If you report it to the police, it will be transferred to the Awakened Management Bureau anyway, which will take more time. Report it directly to the Bureau from the start.\nI don't know what kind of harassment you experienced... is it abuse of power by a hunter? You could use the public's bad sentiment towards abusive hunters by posting anonymously to get the issue publicized. If the hunter belongs to a guild, their legal team will likely contact you to settle.

      "content": "Chapter 17: Butterfly Effect\nInside the empty hangover soup restaurant after business hours. Cha Eui-jae was deep in thought, staring intently at his cell phone while sitting at a clean table. On the screen was a series of questions and answers on JisikON, filled with numerous replies and comments.\n\"If it's a well-known hunter and there's solid evidence, the Bureau's hunter will come directly.\"\nCha Eui-jae slumped onto the table. Damn it, the problem was that South Korean public officials worked too diligently. It seemed impossible to handle this quietly once reported. Reporting Lee Sa-young for business disruption might even bring the head of the Awakened Management Bureau directly.\nWith a deeply furrowed brow, Cha Eui-jae scrolled down the screen with his finger. The frivolous comments below the helpful answer he had just read were mostly impractical. What? Reveal his initials? Sorry, but if I recklessly expose him, South Korea could be split in half.\nThat's the nature of being ranked number one. His every move sparked endless debates between those who criticize and those who defend him. Cha Eui-jae knew this well from past experience. No matter how obnoxious Lee Sa-young was, causing an internet eruption just to make himself comfortable was out of the question.\nA magic stone recorder was too expensive, and he would never do an interview unless he was crazy. As Cha Eui-jae scrolled down further, he unconsciously banged his head on the table. Startled by the noise, he checked the table, relieved that it wasn't cracked. Rubbing the spot on his forehead where it had hit, he flipped his phone over and slumped back down.\n'Damned if you do, damned if you don't...'\nThe reason for Cha Eui-jae's dilemma...\nWas none other than a certain pesky bastard who had stormed into his peaceful life as a part-time worker at a hangover soup restaurant.\n***\nAs a famous hunter eatery, the hangover soup restaurant had quite a few guilds that pre-paid for their meals. Many hunters found carrying cards cumbersome and often had to dash out without even putting down their spoons when sudden calls came. It was a common practice.\nWhen Cha Eui-jae first started working, he was taught about the pre-payment ledger. So, pre-payments were nothing new. But he could guarantee that no one had ever crazily offered to pre-pay 15 million won on the spot like Lee Sa-young did. Who on earth considers 15 million won a trivial amount?\nCha Eui-jae glared daggers at Bae Won-woo, who had brought along this troublemaker.\n'Stop this crazy bastard.'\nThat's the gist of his glare.\nBae Won-woo jumped 0.5 cm in place, and— or maybe it was just in Cha Eui-jae's thoughts— seemed to catch the meaning behind his sharp look like an upgraded artificial intelligence and earnestly tried to dissuade Lee Sa-young.\n\"Let's pay and get back to the guild. Didn't you say you were super busy?\"\n\"Not really.\"\n\"Don't you have to go to the Awakened Management Bureau? Aren't you meeting Jung Bin?\"\n\"I can postpone it.\"\nEven facing an interview with the Awakened Management Bureau, which others would dread, Lee Sa-young remained unperturbed. Bae Won-woo, feeling desperate, changed his approach and spoke with a hint of personal desire.\n\"Hey, instead of pre-paying 15 million won, buy me new armor. There'll be an equipment auction in Songdo by Hong Ye-seong.\"\n\"How can you buy equipment with just 15 million won? Are you a beggar?\"\nWow... so obnoxious.\nEvery word out of his annoying mouth was a work of art. Not only Cha Eui-jae, but all the hunters who heard the conversation likely thought the same. Cha Eui-jae hoped that Lee Sa-young's card would melt away that night, just like the precious 6,900 won ladle that melted gloriously... Cha Eui-jae was standing firm, refusing to take the card when Bae Won-woo shouted bravely.\n\"...5 million!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Just swipe for 5 million. We'll come here often for meals with the team. 15 million is too much.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"With 15 million, you could eat hangover soup three times a day for 333 days!\"\n'I could manage that. You already do that anyway.' As Lee Sa-young stared at Bae Won-woo incredulously, he glanced at Cha Eui-jae. As their eyes met, Cha Eui-jae quickly flashed the smile of a weary part-timer. Hurry up and swipe. That's the gist.\nPretending to contemplate for a moment, Lee Sa-young nodded.\n\"Alright...\"\nHe slammed his card into the machine, maintaining eye contact with Cha Eui-jae, adding,\n\"Let me know when you finish it. I'll pre-pay again.\"\nJust leave already.\nLee Sa-young swiped 5 million won and left surprisingly easily, almost as if paying for the day's ruined business. It was an anticlimactic departure compared to the intense encounter. Would he come back at night? Just in case, Cha Eui-jae stood by all night in his small room with a ladle. He was ready to confront him if he saw a single hair of his head.\nFortunately or unfortunately, Lee Sa-young did not return that night. Instead,\n\"Mmm... sth, sth...\"\n\"Sorry, what?\"\n\"Mmmph... mmm... sth, sth...\"\n\"Yeah, that's right.\"\nSince that day, he started coming regularly like clockwork to eat hangover soup!\nIgnoring Bae Won-woo's whispered curses and only responding to Cha Eui-jae's grinding teeth, Lee Sa-young took out a disposable cutlery set from thin air. He even brought his own utensils to avoid deducting the cost from his pre-paid amount. Couldn't he also bring a clay pot? Damn it. How does his inventory hold up?\nOkay, let's assume his inventory holds up and he had spare disposable cutlery. Maybe he genuinely developed a taste for hangover soup.\nHowever, the empty tables surrounding Lee Sa-young every time he appeared were intolerable. The notoriously self-centered and uncooperative hunters were diligently practicing social distancing without being told! Cha Eui-jae chuckled bitterly.\n'Damn it, this is clearly business interference.'\nThe pride of the hangover soup restaurant was its high turnover rate and low prices, but every time Lee Sa-young showed up, an \"Exclusion Zone\" appeared, turning it into a disaster. Forget turnover, even sales plummeted. Thanks to die-hard hangover soup fans, the restaurant was barely scraping by... But at this rate, they might lose even their regulars.\nAs a result, Cha Eui-jae had been researching online about hunter abuse, hunter crime reporting laws, and the Awakened Special Law, and had finally concluded.\n'To resolve this... I either need to become a hunter again or get some money!'\nIt might seem like a sudden outburst, but Cha Eui-jae had his reasons.\nTo expose Lee Sa-young's misdeeds, solid evidence was required. Vague testimony alone might backfire, accusing him of falsely smearing the top-ranked hunter in Korea.\nThe most reliable way was to release a recording of Lee Sa-young's misdeeds. But, as a JisikON answerer pointed out, a regular recorder wouldn't even come close to capturing evidence against an S-grade hunter. S-grade hunters could easily detect and destroy a recorder or camera.\nSo, he needed a recorder made from dungeon materials or one that couldn't be detected... But these items were not only hard to find,\n'They're damn expensive.'\nWhen he was Hunter J, he didn't realize it, but items made from dungeon materials were ridiculously pricey. For a modest hangover soup restaurant part-timer, they were impossible to afford!\nHe was content receiving a modest portion of the restaurant's profits as his wage, which was more than enough. He didn't need much— just a few sets of clothes and a pair of sneakers to rotate. If Lee Sa-young hadn't barged into his second life, he wouldn't be worrying about this.\n...Should he register as a hunter?\nGoing to the Awakened Center to measure his abilities and get ranked was all it took, but... what if the data of J, which he didn't know about, still existed? And what if he couldn't control his power during the measurement? What if he accidentally broke the measuring device?\nHis peaceful life would be over. For someone hiding their strength, that was too much. The only relief was that when he awakened, the Awakened Management Bureau didn't exist, and when he did register, he received special treatment as J, skipping the identification process, so there was no need for fake IDs.\n\"If it weren't for that bastard Lee Sa-young...\"\nLately, Cha Eui-jae had been gradually understanding why other hunters avoided getting close to Lee Sa-young. He was like a snake, circling its prey and slowly constricting it.\nEven though he could have outright threatened him after that night, he kept coming back, subtly pressuring him. What was he thinking? Since his first visit, Lee Sa-young hadn't asked Cha Eui-jae's name again. Did he already know his identity or not?\nLee Sa-young's actions were like poking still water with a finger. The previously calm water would ripple greatly with just a small movement. Even without major damage, this constant probing was...\nAnnoying.\nIt felt like his territory was being invaded. Staring blankly, his face contorted, Cha Eui-jae unconsciously reached into his inventory.\nThe inventory was filled with empty potion bottles. They were all from the West Sea rift. He should have thrown them away, but he kept putting it off. There were also items he had picked up from the rift: a black longsword and a Basilisk's Fang. Gaze lingering on the Basilisk's Fang, Cha Eui-jae shifted his attention to something else.

But these days, magic stones seem to be widely used, don't they? From what he had overheard from regulars at the hangover soup restaurant, quite a few pieces of equipment were made by processing magic stones.\n\"...Should I sell one?\"\nIf he sold this, he could probably buy a decent recorder.\nCha Eui-jae stealthily took out a magic stone from his inventory and started polishing it with his apron.",

      "content": "Chapter 18: Butterfly Effect\nHowever, selling magic stones wasn't something just anyone could do simply because they wanted to.\nMagic stone transactions mainly occurred in Hunter Markets, which required an Awakened Registration Certificate for entry, making it inaccessible to the general public. Even though it seemed like some deals were made through online Hunter communities, those also required a certificate.\n'So, the general public can't even approach this.'\nHe thought about selling it to the regulars at the hangover soup restaurant, but it was obvious that word would get out. And they'd all ask the same thing.\n'Hey, where did you get such a pure magic stone when you're not even a hunter?'\nIf an ordinary person possessed such a high-purity magic stone, even he would be curious about its origin. There were so many things to consider. The life of an ordinary person was truly arduous.\n'Should I just say a regular gave it to me to help with living expenses?'\nCha Eui-jae shook his head at his own question. The regulars at the hangover soup restaurant were more like a community than just customers now. Even if it was someone he barely knew, they'd quickly find out there was no one who would give something like this to a mere part-timer. In the end, Cha Eui-jae, an ordinary person, had only one option left.\nThe local secondhand trading app, \"Tomato Market.\"\nTomato Market, which had been in service since before the Day of the Rift, greatly helped survivors share information and seek rescue when the world began to fall apart. People who didn't even know their neighbors relied on the warmth of their community through Tomato Market.\n'It was quite helpful in rescuing survivors....'\nWould the magic stone sell if he posted it on Tomato Market? It was worth a try. Cha Eui-jae immediately downloaded the Tomato Market app and attempted to log in. However, his old account seemed to have been deleted after being dormant for eight years. Naturally, he clicked the sign-up button.\n[Please set your nickname.]\nWhat should he choose? He tried entering garlic, hangover soup, blood sausage, bone soup, but all were taken. Even 'hangover soup1234' was rejected, making Cha Eui-jae a bit annoyed. He ended up entering random letters.\n[EZ]\n[Welcome to Tomato Market, EZ! Please turn on GPS and register your area!]\nGreat. Having successfully registered, Cha Eui-jae logged in and explored the app.\nFortunately, there was a new Hunter category! Although most of the items were Hunter civil service exam guides and famous Hunter merchandise, it wasn't exactly what Cha Eui-jae was looking for.\n'Should I post it for around 80 million won?'\nHe wasn't sure if a deal worth tens of millions would go through easily, but he could try, and if it didn't sell, he could sell it to a regular. If he asked them to keep it secret and matched their desired price, they might agree out of loyalty.\nCha Eui-jae carefully laid a newspaper on the green table, placed the glittering golden fragment at an angle that showed it well, and took several photos.\nClick.\nClick.\nHe chose the best shot and posted it on Tomato Market.\n[Title: magic stone for Sale]\n[Author: EZ]\n[Price: 80,000,000 won]\n[High-purity magic stone without impurities.]\n[Negotiable, please chat.]\nFeeling a bit relieved after adding a negotiable note out of last-minute conscience, Cha Eui-jae felt a little better.\n'If this sells, I can buy Ha-eun and grandma winter coats, help with the surgery costs, and even get a new ladle.'\nIt was a perfect plan without any flaws. Just as Cha Eui-jae posted the listing on Tomato Market with a happy heart, his phone started vibrating uncontrollably.\nBzzz—\nBzzz—\nBzzz—\nBzzz—\nHis phone shook like someone thrown into -30 degrees Celsius. It was still under contract; what was happening? Worried that it might be broken, Cha Eui-jae hurriedly checked his phone and saw the notifications piling up.\nMajangdongStayer: **Hey, I'm reporting you to the authorities for fraud ㅋㅋ if it's not fraud, please reply? Can you be merciful?\nXLevel: Let's do a direct deal.\nGoodNeighbor: ** Scammer ** Legend\nPooPatPongCurry: Where are you? I'll come to you with money. Just give me your address. I can come immediately with cash.\nWhite: Did you post a bait product to kidnap someone?\nGoodWordsForYou: Where at?\nHi: Do you have more magic stones like this?\nMackerel: Address?\n.\n.\n.\nHe was met with a torrent of real-time chat alerts on Tomato Market.\nWithin 30 seconds of unlocking his phone, the cute tomato icon was already covered with a red +99 speech bubble.\n'I'm fucked.'\nThe continuously piling new messages seemed to whisper, 'Yeah, you're fucked.' It had been a while since he had cold sweats like this. This was clearly not a wise choice. It was undoubtedly a colossal mistake!\nDid he post it too cheaply? Was the magic stone worth more than he thought? Of course, ha Eui-jae hadn't posted the price arbitrarily; he had spent time surfing the sea of information before listing the magic stone. But every time he clicked on a post about magic stone prices, a window popped up asking for Hunter verification, so he guessed and added a few million won to the price.\nHe had heard prices had risen significantly since the past, but by how much?\nCha Eui-jae, hands clasped and eyes closed in a praying posture, needed a brief moment away from reality.\n'Life is really tough.'\nSince the system spat him out into South Korea eight years later, his life had been one twist after another. But as the saying goes, \"He who tied the knot must untie it,\" Cha Eui-jae decided he had to resolve this mess himself. He quickly gathered his scattered thoughts and came to a conclusion.\n'...I need to run.'\nIn the end, Cha Eui-jae decided to ignore all the chats and run away. Responding to the flood of messages was impossible anyway. He ignored the endless chat notifications, went into his account settings, and clicked deactivate.\n[Is this goodbye? We'll miss you.]\nEven at this moment, the chats kept pouring in. Cha Eui-jae fervently hoped Tomato Market wouldn't hold him back. But Tomato Market clung to him like an old friend. It felt as tenacious as the tentacles of a giant octopus he had once fought off years ago in Namhae.\n[We're curious why you're deleting your account, EZ.]\nEven in his hurry, he felt he should at least answer this. Calmly, he ticked two boxes.\n[ Too many people are engaging with my post.]\n[ I encountered rude users.]\n[Other: People curse at me on first encounter, these **.]\nDeactivate. Delete app.\nQuickly and accurately, Cha Eui-jae completed all the steps and slumped back into his chair, staring blankly at the ceiling.\n'That was pretty fast, right?'\nBut once entangled, his life wouldn't straighten out so easily...\nIn the anonymous Hunter community Cha Eui-jae couldn't access, HunterNet, a post was heating up the place hotter than hell.\nTitle: [Anonymous] Tomato Market Latest...JPEG\n(Photo)\nYesterday, an A+ grade magic stone was posted on Tomato Market and deleted in two minutesㅋㅋㅋㅋ\nComments (99+)\n—Tomato Market is the future\n—So brilliant\n—Wow...

      "content": "Chapter 19: Butterfly Effect\nA man in a suit with a gentle impression, public official Jung Bin, was sitting on the wooden porch with his legs crossed, watching the world's only S-grade artisan perform a protest show on the ground.\n\"Give me that magic stone!\"\n\"Um— Hong Ye-seong-ssi, you didn't see anything.\"\n\"Aaah, get it for me.\"\nFlailing his limbs on the ground, he looked like a child throwing a tantrum in the toy section of a store. With a flick of his hand, Jung Bin signaled an Awakened Management Bureau employee standing at the entrance of the traditional house to approach and bow. Jung Bin quietly whispered.\n\"Since when did the Jang-in Village get such good Wi-Fi? Didn't you cut the Wi-Fi when Hong Ye-seong-ssi was admitted this time?\"\n\"Of course, we cut it off... but Lee Sa-young-ssi reconnected all the communication lines and Wi-Fi and in return commissioned the production of gloves.\"\n\"That guy is really no help. Cut it off here again as soon as this project is over.\"\n\"Yes, understood. And this information probably came from the Hunter Channel. The magic stone talk was all over the channels.\"\n\"I've asked everyone to cooperate. They have no business ethics.\"\nEven as Jung Bin clicked his tongue and sighed briefly, Hong Ye-seong kept repeating the same words like a broken record.\n\"I want to go to Seoul. Give me the magic stone.\"\n\"Seriously, you asked to be locked up in Jirisan. Sir, you can't leave until you finish making all the weapons.\"\nThis man, rolling around in the dirt despite wearing white fleece, was none other than Hong Ye-seong, ranked 7th in Korea and the only S-grade artisan known as \"Genius.\"\nSix years ago, a gate opened in the middle of the Korea National University of Arts campus. It was evening, so there weren't many students on campus, but the problem was the fourth-year art students who were becoming ghosts in their studios preparing their graduation projects. They faced a dilemma.\nTheir graduation project or their lives?\nMost chose their lives, of course. They were too young and too resentful to die just working on their graduation projects. Facing heaven just after finishing a project seemed too cruel! Since the gate was a natural disaster, surely the professors would understand! The students grabbed hammers and saws, trembling as they hid in the corners.\nBut one student, fourth-year ceramics major Hong Ye-seong, remained seated in his studio despite the gate opening. Even as monsters from the gate climbed the building's walls, broke windows, and entered the studio, he stayed in place, making pottery.\nAnd then he awakened. As an S-grade artisan.\nThe government initially kept his awakening episode under wraps. If they announced that a college student became an S-grade artisan while ignoring gates and monsters to make pottery, more students might refuse to evacuate during gate incidents. For public safety, the story had to be sealed.\nAnyway, Hong Ye-seong, the biggest output of the ceramics department and the one who raised the department's entrance scores nationwide, was the world's first S-grade artisan to appear after the Day of the Rift. Moreover, he had an incredible trait.\n[Trait: Deadline Finisher (L)]\n[Work efficiency and speed increase as the deadline approaches.]\n[(If work is completed under the effect of this skill, quality increases by an additional 50%)]\nThe government and officials from related organizations gave a standing ovation when they saw his Awakener data. A precious S-grade artisan with a Legendary trait! He was a talent who would greatly enhance Korea's hunter competitiveness.\nBut once the world learned about Hong Ye-seong and his trait, headhunters from abroad flocked to Korea. After all, Hong Ye-seong was the world's only S-grade artisan! As more countries and organizations wanted him, the Korean government grew increasingly anxious, desperate to keep him in Korea.\nCitizens also fervently wished for him to stay. The internet was rife with extreme suggestions like confiscating his passport, tearing it up, and banning him from leaving the country. The media constantly discussed the value he could create. Then one ordinary day,\nDriven to neurosis by headhunters knocking on his hotel door every night, Hong Ye-seong shouted, \"F**k you, I'm Korean!\" and requested protection from the Korean government. Along with the protection, he made one more request.\n\"When my work deadline approaches, no matter what I say, please lock me up in a place with good water, air, and energy, and no contact with the outside world.\"\nHe requested 'confinement.'\nThe government, already worried he might leave for another country, was thrilled at his request.\n\"Pardon? Oh, very good— uh, ahem. What's the reason?\"\n\"Actually, I have another trait.\"\nNo one is perfect, it seems. Hong Ye-seong had one fatal flaw.\n[Trait: Procrastinator (L)]\n[You feel the urge to delay everything. (A lot.)]\nThe system gave an S-grade artisan but balanced it with a trait. A trait to delay and delay until barely finishing just before the deadline. A genius controlled by a trait. The embodiment of cramming under a looming deadline.\nBut still, the Korean government designated several locations with good energy nationwide to confine him gently when the time came. After Seoraksan and Gyeryongsan, it was now Jirisan Jang-in Village's turn.\nJung Bin sighed deeply, resting his chin on his hand. Watching the white lump rolling on the ground, he spoke.\n\"I canceled my prior engagement with Lee Sa-young and came here to capture Hong Ye-seong-ssi. You know that, right?\"\n\"Hey, Official-nim.\"\nInstead of answering, Hong Ye-seong called out to Jung Bin. Unlike his earlier whining, his voice was slightly calmer.\n\"If I make a weapon with that magic stone, I can produce at least S+ grade. I can tell just by looking at the picture.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nJung Bin raised his eyebrows slightly, surprised. So far, the highest-grade equipment Hong Ye-seong had made was S-grade. He had said that both materials and skills needed to be at their best for higher-grade items. So, the mention of an S+ grade weapon naturally piqued Jung Bin's interest.\nJung Bin had also been briefed about the unknown magic stone seller while flying to Jirisan by helicopter. Specifically, someone crazy had posted a glowing magic stone on the Tomato Market.\nThat rare item hadn't been listed on the Hunter Market, so it must be shady, but seeing Hong Ye-seong react like this confirmed its quality. Even from the photos, the magic stone seemed excellent to Jung Bin. It was also a type that had never circulated domestically.\nBut where did it suddenly come from?\nWas it extorted from someone? Or smuggled from overseas? While considering various hypotheses, something flashed through Jung Bin's mind. The reason Lee Sa-young stormed into the Awakened Management Bureau recently and overturned the Awakened Database. Wasn't there a skilled unregistered Awakener running around?\nJung Bin sprang up from his seat and squatted next to Hong Ye-seong, who was flopping like a freshly caught fish.\n\"Hong Ye-seong-ssi.\"\n\"Ah, get me the magic stone and then talk.\"\nThe slightly clearer look in his eyes from earlier was gone. Back to acting like a 5-year-old throwing a tantrum, Jung Bin gently coaxed him.\n\"Listen to me first. That magic stone is incredibly good, right?\"\n\"Of course. Just by looking at it, I can tell it's top-grade without impurities or monster energy. Ah, give me the magic stone!\"\n\"Only a few people could get such a magic stone, right?\"\n\"At least a top 100 ranker.\"\n\"Top rankers usually don't leave traces like that in transactions, right?\"\n\"Of course. There's the black market and the Hunter Market, why would they use the Tomato Market? They must be stupid.\"\nSpeaking curtly, Hong Ye-seong started thrashing again.\n\"Ah, it's ridiculous... I can't see the Seoul Tomato Market because I'm stuck in Jirisan! Ack! Next time, confine me in Bukhansan!\"\n\"Yes, I'll tell the director the next exile site will be Bukhansan. And,\"\nJung Bin stood up and dusted off his knees.\n\"I'll find that magic stone.\"\n\"...Really?\"\nAt Jung Bin's cheerful words, Hong Ye-seong lifted his head. Covered in dirt on his white fleece, his eyes gleamed with pure madness, looking like a Pomeranian that had drifted 30 times in a dirt field during a walk.\n\"Yes.\"\nJung Bin smiled with a trustworthiness score of 100% as often shown in public service ads. There was even a subtle confidence in his voice.\n\"I feel like we'll discover a gold mine while looking for that magic stone.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 20: Butterfly Effect\n'Why are my ears so itchy?'\nStanding in front of the gas stove, Cha Eui-jae scratched his ears irritably as he cooked hangover soup.\nToday, for some reason, the hangover soup restaurant was bustling as usual since Bae Won-woo and Lee Sa-young, along with the members of the Pado Guild, hadn't shown up. The hunters even had bright smiles on their faces for a change. Cha Eui-jae, too, had managed to forget the painful failure of Tomato Market and was having a relatively peaceful day. However...\n\"Did you see the post on HunterNet yesterday?\"\nA young hunter whispered, starting a buzz in the restaurant.\n\"Yeah, apparently some lunatic posted an A+ grade magic stone on Tomato Market for 80 million won? The guilds are in an uproar.\"\nThe word \"lunatic\" hit Cha Eui-jae's ears hard.\n'Lunatic, huh.'\nCha Eui-jae made a displeased face, but the other hunters, oblivious to his reaction, continued their conversation skillfully, separating meat from bones.\n\"Isn't it a clickbait post? They could've just posted a picture they found online.\"\n\"Hey, Hong Ye-seong even offered a reward for anyone who finds that magic stone, saying he'd make them a weapon for free.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah, check Hong Ye-seong's InHeart.\"\n\"Oh my god, it's true. We need to find it immediately.\"\nCha Eui-jae's hand, which was holding tongs to adjust the pot, froze. Even though he had recently distanced himself from the hunter world, he knew the name Hong Ye-seong and that he was an S-grade artisan. Most of the hunters who frequented the hangover soup restaurant wanted to buy Hong Ye-seong's equipment.\nBut Hong Ye-seong put up a reward? ...Why?\nBefore Cha Eui-jae could sort out his confused thoughts, the hunters' conversation continued.\n\"Damn it, I should've bought it. Even if I bought it for 80 million won and resold it, I'd make tens of billions. What the hell?\"\n\"I installed Tomato Market as soon as I saw the post.\"\n\"Me too.\"\n\"I hope EZ posts another one.\"\n\"But I heard they deleted their post and deactivated their account.\"\n\"Are they messing with us? Give and take away. Tell them to rejoin immediately.\"\n\"I'm going to Noryangjin Fish Market today to ask the mackerel.\"\n\"Can the mackerel really find it?\"\n\"If not, they better give up their title as Korea's top information dealer.\"\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\nAt this point, his mind was so overwhelmed that his specialty activated automatically. Cha Eui-jae sprinkled a handful of green onions into the boiling pot with a calm face. But his head was still spinning. That magic stone is worth... tens of billions?\n'I used to play jacks with magic stones because they were so useless!'\nOf course, that was something only J could do, but Cha Eui-jae didn't care.\n\"Who do you think posted it?\"\n\"Given the price, maybe a regular person who picked up a magic stone on the street?\"\n\"Shit, if I could pick up an A+ grade magic stone on the street, I'd quit being a hunter and walk 100,000 steps every day.\"\n\"Agreed.\"\nMy magic stone... was higher grade than I thought? Eavesdropping on the hunters' conversation, Cha Eui-jae realized something he had overlooked all this time.\nJ's belongings were rare treasures that ordinary hunters couldn't even dream of seeing.\nEight years. Just two years short of a full cycle of changes, the world had undergone another upheaval, different from the Day of the Rift. One of the major changes was the value of magic stones, which had gone from trash to gold. Back then, the uses of magic stones could be summarized in two ways.\nFirst, collectibles for the rich.\nSecond, trophies for hunters.\nIn the past, magic stones were items that only people with money would buy, but now, good magic stones were worth their weight in gold.\nResearch results showing that magic stones could efficiently extract energy without environmental destruction, unlike traditional energy sources like coal and oil, were the main reason for this shift. F-grade magic stones, which used to be thrown away inside gates, now fetched at least 100,000 won each.\nIn fact, even when J was active, he never directly dealt with dungeon by-products. Since he was hiding his identity, his aunt handled all transactions of dungeon items, and in those days, there were no hunter markets or craftsmen, so it was rare to buy equipment with money.\nGiven this background, it was natural for Cha Eui-jae not to know the current market prices for magic stones.\nThe government did provide monetary rewards for hunters entering cracks and dungeons, but J didn't use the money for any significant transactions. Occasionally, he bought potions, but they were for emergency treatments for survivors inside the cracks, not for his use.\nAnd today, his past actions had snowballed into a massive wave coming straight at Cha Eui-jae.\n'Is news about one mistaken post spreading this much?'\nCha Eui-jae was genuinely dumbfounded. He wished everyone would just stop for the sake of his quiet life, but the hunter community was more connected, faster, and more organic than he thought. And the hangover soup restaurant was an excellent place for gathering and spreading information.\n\"Tomato Market...\"\n\"How much...\"\n\"magic stone...\"\n\"hangover soup is delicious...\"\n\"Around here...\"\n\"Which lunatic...\"\n\"A hidden powerful hunter...\"\n\"Michelin star for the hangover soup restaurant...\"\nRumors about the unidentified magic stone were still spreading. There were some inaccuracies mixed in, though.\n***\n\"Uncle, your face looks weird.\"\n\"My face? Why?\"\n\"Like this.\"\nPark Ha-eun pushed her chin up with both hands. Was she saying his jaw had become sharper? Cha Eui-jae rubbed his jawbone and smiled.\n\"I haven't been sleeping well lately. It's fine.\"\n\"Uncle never sleeps.\"\n\"Exactly, so it's the same as usual. I'm just a bit tired. Do you need anything for school tomorrow?\"\n\"School supplies... cardboard and modeling clay.\"\n\"Art class?\"\n\"Yeah, I'm going to make pottery with modeling clay. Like Hong Ye-seong.\"\nDamn it. Cha Eui-jae almost bit his tongue at the sudden mention of the name.\nAfter hearing that Hong Ye-seong had put a bounty on the magic stone, Cha Eui-jae had downloaded InHeart for the first time and followed Hong Ye-seong's account. That crazy guy was another kind of madman, different from Lee Sa-young— at least knowing what he was up to made it easier to deal with him.\nHong Ye-seong wasn't someone who posted often, but after the magic stone incident, he had been posting at least once a day. Today, he had posted a picture of a lone egg in a chicken coop with this caption;\nxxYeahsungH\nGolden round magic stone... #missingit #waitingforyou #daily #communication #egg #magicstone #missyou\nLikes 532k\nHoneybeezx\nShouldn't we send this guy to counseling? It seems like he's affected by some mental contamination skill\n@jungvin80 @SEOWON_GUILD\nCha Eui-jae strongly agreed with Honeybee's opinion. Even to him, Hong Ye-seong seemed insane. He couldn't understand the brain structure of today's hunters.\nAfter placing rabbit-shaped apple slices in front of Park Ha-eun, Cha Eui-jae grabbed two bunches of green onions and a cutting board and sat at a side table. Recently, he hadn't been able to visit grandmother, which bothered him, so he asked Park Ha-eun quietly.\n\"How's Grandma's leg?\"\n\"Hmm, still limping.\"\n\"Okay... We need to take her to the hospital.\"\n\"Does she need surgery?\"\n\"We won't know until we see the doctor.\"\n\"...I hope she doesn't need surgery.\"\nPark Ha-eun groaned, resting her chin on her hands. Cha Eui-jae felt the same way but expressed it by chopping green onions.\n***\nEven after the Tomato magic stone incident had somewhat settled, the hangover soup restaurant remained abuzz with talk of magic stones. Whenever the conversation seemed to die down, Hong Ye-seong would throw more fuel on the fire through InHeart.\nThe influence of the only S-grade artisan was immense. If Lee Sa-young was a storm in the hangover soup restaurant, Hong Ye-seong was causing an earthquake from afar, reaching all the way here. And the aftermath of that earthquake...\nBrought another S-grade to the hangover soup restaurant.\n\"This place has a nice atmosphere.\"\nA familiar voice. The same tone heard in a public service announcement right after this morning's drama ended.\nCha Eui-jae deliberately turned his head slowly. It was a near-instinctual attempt at reality avoidance. However, it only allowed him 3 seconds of mental escape before reality snapped back, and the tall, well-dressed man standing at the door didn't disappear.\nWith his tall height, honey-colored hair, slightly drooping eyes, and clean suit with a civil servant badge around his neck, the man was indeed Jung Bin, the star of Korea's public service announcements.\nWhy... are you here?\nFor a moment, Cha Eui-jae even wondered if he had accidentally reported Lee Sa-young to the Awakened Management Bureau. As soon as Jung Bin made eye contact with Cha Eui-jae, he bowed politely.\n\"Hello.\"\n\"...Welcome. Just you?\"\nIt's okay. Jung Bin doesn't know Cha Eui-jae. He only knows J with the mask. Cha Eui-jae reassured himself as he got up from his seat.\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\n\"Yes, just me.\"\n\"Please sit here. You can check the menu on the wall and place your order.\"\nJung Bin sat quietly in the seat that Cha Eui-jae had indicated and looked at the menu on the wall. Only then did the hunters around them start murmuring.\n\"Insane...\"\n\"That's Jung Bin.\"\n\"Who did something that would get them arrested? Which one of you is it? Come on, just turn yourself in.\"\n\"Oh, I'm not here on official business today. I'm just here for dinner. I happened to be in the area on a business trip.\"\nJung Bin waved his hand with a gentle smile. However, the hunters who had suddenly found themselves sitting near him were already burying their heads in their bowls, gulping down the hangover soup like water.\nSomehow, these actions seemed familiar. Outside the sliding door, one could feel a presence peeking into the shop. By now, Cha Eui-jae could foresee the future clearly. Soon, there would be a Jung Bin ZONE in addition to the Lee Sa-young ZONE.\nIn other words, today's business was over.\nHaving to deal not only with guild-affiliated hunters but now with public servant hunters disrupting his business, where could he possibly file a complaint about this? Cha Eui-jae felt like grabbing someone and venting about why these trials kept coming to his once peaceful hangover soup restaurant.\n\"...\"\nBut there was no time to feel aggrieved because a second uninvited guest was approaching the shop in quick succession.\nFootsteps so quiet you could only hear them if you paid close attention. The presence was masked, but Cha Eui-jae could feel a fiery aura. A dark figure steadily approached the shop.\nAll circumstances pointed to one person alone.",

      "content": "Chapter 21: Butterfly Effect\nThe sliding door slid open, and as someone entered the shop, the previously relaxed atmosphere froze solid once again. The hunters who had been chewing their rice stopped their chewing motions, and someone who nearly choked managed to stifle it through sheer willpower.\nA figure, bent over with a gas mask, stopped in its tracks, seemingly assessing the situation. An almost absolute silence, where not even breathing could be heard, prevailed.\nIt was the one standing by the door who broke the silence first.\n\"Strange.\"\nLee Sa-young sneered as he walked briskly across the hall.\n\"Why is a government official here?\"\nJung Bin responded calmly.\n\"Of course, I'm here for dinner. I didn't expect to see you here, Lee Sa-young-ssi.\"\n\"Hmm... you seem free.\"\n\"Haha, not really. Even without Lee Sa-young-ssi stirring things up, Korean civil servants are always busy.\"\nDespite the clearly barbed words, Lee Sa-young scoffed and went to sit in a corner. The hunter who had been sitting at that table, shoveling down hangover soup, gasped and threw money on the table before fleeing.\nDamn it, those bastards are scaring away all my customers. Cha Eui-jae looked forlornly at the other hunters starting to stir and shuffle their seats as one left. Regardless, the two uninvited guests continued their conversation.\n\"Anyway, since we've met... Lee Sa-young-ssi, I have something to say.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's not something to discuss in a public place like this. Would you please start responding to official communications?\"\n\"One hangover soup.\"\nA complete brush-off. Yet, Jung Bin continued speaking steadily without showing any sign of frustration.\n\"Even if I go directly to the Pado Guild, you're always unavailable. When we send official documents, we only get responses saying the Guild Leader is busy with external matters. But I hear you regularly visit this nearby hangover soup restaurant. So I came here just in case, and you really were here.\"\n\"Lots of radish kimchi.\"\n\"Oh, I'll have one hangover soup as well.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae, who was writing down the order on a notepad, glared at the two. If you guys are going to fight, do it outside. Don't drag the part-time worker into a hunter fight. Cha Eui-jae pressed his pen to his temple. The tense atmosphere was giving him a headache.\nAfter glancing around, Jung Bin continued his speech.\n\"And the director said you must pay for the last mess you caused.\"\n\"...\"\nThis time, Lee Sa-young, who had remained silent throughout Jung Bin's speech, nodded his head.\n\"Oh, and... just a moment.\"\nJung Bin pulled out a round, cotton-like object from his inventory. As he pressed it with his thumb, an opaque barrier enveloped them, concealing their figures. The air, which had been stagnant, suddenly felt open and free. The hunters, who had been holding their breaths and watching the two, sighed in relief.\n\"Wow, he's even using a spatial separation item. Must be a really important conversation.\"\n\"Come on, don't leave us hanging here.\"\n\"No way, getting caught up in that could really screw us. Let's finish eating and get out.\"\n\"They wouldn't start a fight here, would they?\"\n\"Surely not, there are civilians here.\"\n\"I wouldn't put it past Lee Sa-young.\"\nStop saying such horrible things. Cha Eui-jae shut his eyes tightly.\nHe knew Jung Bin wasn't the type to cause trouble in a place like this, but with Lee Sa-young involved, anything was possible. He didn't want his hangover soup restaurant to make the news as the battleground between the top-ranked hunter and the nation's star hunter.\nCha Eui-jae fiddled with his pen, clicking it absentmindedly. Although spatial separation items are often used for private conversations, they have a critical flaw; an awakened person of higher rank than the item's grade can easily see through it.\nJung Bin's item was probably around grade A. He couldn't be sure, but there was no reason to use an S-grade item in a shabby hangover soup restaurant. When Cha Eui-jae slowly opened his eyes, the barrier he had seen earlier was gone, and Jung Bin and Lee Sa-young were clearly visible.\nBingo. Cha Eui-jae inwardly rejoiced and pretended not to notice as he moved closer to peel garlic.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi, you were looking for an unregistered individual, weren't you? You even overturned the entire Awakened Management Bureau's database.\"\n\"...\"\n\"This unregistered individual is presumed to be quite skilled. Skilled enough to withstand your attacks...\"\nAn unregistered individual who could withstand Lee Sa-young's attacks. Despite no subject being explicitly mentioned, Cha Eui-jae knew exactly who they were talking about. That guy went through the entire database just to find me? No wonder he let me go so easily, his neck felt cold.\n\"Have you found that person?\"\nCha Eui-jae held his breath. For a moment, he felt as if the purple gaze inside the gas mask was directed at him through Jung Bin's shoulder. Before he could determine if it was his imagination, a short answer came.\n\"No.\"\n\"Really?\"\nJung Bin's eyes scanned Lee Sa-young's masked face, as if searching for something. Lee Sa-young, seemingly annoyed by this scrutiny, leaned his chin on his hand and asked coldly.\n\"Shouldn't you explain the situation before interrogating me?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just blurting out your agenda makes me unhappy too.\"\nThe two faced each other in silence for a while. But soon, Jung Bin raised his hands, signaling surrender.\n\"Understood. I'll explain.\"\nLee Sa-young showed no reaction, but it was clear he was listening. Jung Bin took out his phone, tapped it a few times, and then showed a photo to Lee Sa-young.\n\"You know about the A+ grade magic stone that was listed on Tomato Market recently, right?\"\n\"If you don't know about that, you should quit being a hunter.\"\nQuit being a hunter, huh. Cha Eui-jae felt increasingly disturbed by how tangled and complicated things seemed to be getting. Maybe he was more famous than he thought.\n\"And you know Hong Ye-seong-ssi is locked up in Jirisan, making equipment, right? Of course, you do. You're the one who set up the internet there for him.\"\n\"Yeah, so?\"\n\"Do you know that Hong Ye-seong-ssi threw a fit, asking for a magic stone?\"\n\"He probably did.\"\n\"In conclusion, I believe the unregistered individual you're looking for is the owner of that magic stone.\"\nDamn, this guy is sharp. Cha Eui-jae continued to peel garlic calmly, pretending to know nothing. Lee Sa-young's lips curled into a smile. His voice, which had been prickly before, turned surprisingly gentle.\n\"That's a big leap in logic.\"\nDespite the words, the tone was far from kind. Jung Bin pocketed his phone and continued.\n\"If someone can acquire a magic stone of that caliber, they must be at least within the top 100 rankings. And such people naturally use the hunter market. It's secure for high-value transactions since both the seller and buyer's identities are guaranteed.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If the fees and taxes are burdensome, there's always the black market. It's not ideal to discuss this as a public official, but it's a way to handle things quietly without causing a fuss. There are plenty of discreet methods.\"\nLee Sa-young's gloved fingers started tapping the table slowly.\n\"So why would that magic stone be listed on Tomato Market? And at such a ridiculously low price?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Probably because the seller couldn't use the hunter market due to not having a registration. That's why they listed it on Tomato Market. So it's either one of two things: an ordinary person or an amateur unregistered awakener. But the likelihood of an ordinary person possessing such a magic stone is... nearly zero.\"\n'Amateur.' A word that stabbed former rank 1 J's heart like a dagger. Cha Eui-jae's pace of peeling garlic quickened. With the rustling sound as background music, Lee Sa-young asked.\n\"So?\"\n\"That narrows it down to one thing. The magic stone owner is an unregistered individual.\"\n\"I see...\"\n\"The person capable of obtaining a magic stone of that level is... the one you are looking for, Lee Sa-young-ssi.\"\nJung Bin's reasoning was quite accurate. Having graduated from the police academy and spent considerable time in the hunter world, his intuition seemed sharper than ever. If I hadn't heard this, it could have been a disaster. Cha Eui-jae felt the need to be even more cautious in his actions from now on.\nTok, tok, tok.\nThe black-gloved fingers were still tapping the table. Just as Cha Eui-jae's gaze was drawn to Lee Sa-young's fingertips, they moved slowly, tracing out the words that seemed to burn into his eyes in slow motion.\nDid\nYou\nHear\nEverything\n?\nThe corners of Cha Eui-jae's mouth twitched. He looked up at Lee Sa-young. His hand, mechanically peeling garlic, faltered. He was so nervous he couldn't even tell if his poker face was holding up.\nThe expression visible through the gas mask was clear.\nLee Sa-young was smiling.",

      "content": "Chapter 22: Butterfly Effect\nDid you hear everything?\nIn a brief moment, countless thoughts flashed through my mind. Should I pretend not to know and just run away? But I had made eye contact with Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young, resting his chin on his hand, was openly staring at Cha Eui-jae. Ignoring Jung Bin who was sitting right in front of him, Lee Sa-young's brazen attitude made Cha Eui-jae want to put a gas mask on him backward. So he couldn't see anything.\nCha Eui-jae had invaded the space that Lee Sa-young had separated with an item, so this time, he was the uninvited guest. If he acted recklessly, he might attract Jung Bin's attention instead.\nFortunately, he had a good excuse... Hangover soup! Cha Eui-jae had temporarily forgotten it while eavesdropping on the interesting conversation, but as a part-time worker at the hangover soup restaurant, he had an obligation to serve hangover soup to these two troublesome customers.\nCha Eui-jae stood up slowly, watching Jung Bin's reactions. He raised both middle fingers toward Lee Sa-young and silently mouthed,\n\"Screw you.\"\nThen he naturally turned and headed to the kitchen. He heard a very small laugh. Jung Bin's puzzled voice followed.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi?\"\n\"No, it's nothing. The possibility of another unregistered person?\"\n\"Since Hong Ye-seong-ssi's equipment auction is coming up, so a few people might have entered the country. But no skilled person would cause this kind of commotion. They would come and go quietly.\"\nJung Bin answered firmly. He seemed to think the culprit of this incident was an amateur who had just awakened recently, an ignorant newbie. Cha Eui-jae, who had become an 'amateur, newbie, ignorant fool' out of nowhere, felt wronged. Information didn't spread this quickly when he was active. A languid voice suggested another possibility.\n\"There's an S-grade who awakened a few months ago. How about that one?\"\nThere were already three S-grades here, and another one had awakened? Why were there so many S-grades in this small country? It seemed Korea could maintain its safety just fine without him. After a brief silence, Jung Bin replied gloomily.\n\"That person is... as you know, still a minor, and probably doesn't have time for this kind of thing. She's not a combat hunter either.\"\n\"Oh, she's a high school senior, right.\"\n\"Yes. She's preparing for the college entrance exam. She'd probably rather study an extra passage in the exam prep book than enter a rift.\"\n\"Well... if you say so.\"\nCha Eui-jae listened carefully while putting the finished hangover soup in a tray. Would Lee Sa-young reveal everything? A part of him started to get a little anxious.\nIf he admitted that the owner of the magic stone was the same person as the unregistered one he met. And if he revealed that the unregistered person was Cha Eui-jae.\nIf he lost this peaceful life he had barely obtained.\nThe tray in his hand was gripped tighter. At that moment, Lee Sa-young spoke slowly.\n\"I still haven't found him either.\"\nA light remark that made Cha Eui-jae's sharp readiness seem pointless. Cha Eui-jae looked out at the hall with wide eyes. Jung Bin's voice followed with a disappointed tone.\n\"If even Lee Sa-young-ssi hasn't found him yet....\"\n\"Well... it could be bait set by some shady folks.\"\n\"We can't rule out that possibility either.\"\nAs Jung Bin nodded in agreement, Lee Sa-young motioned towards the air with his chin.\n\"Since the conversation is over, how about we deal with this first?\"\n\"Let's do that. Talking further... doesn't seem appropriate for a hangover soup restaurant.\"\nWith a snap of fingers, Cha Eui-jae also came out of the kitchen with the tray. Seeing the hunters glancing at them and whispering, it seemed the item was released. Cha Eui-jae approached at a moderate pace and placed the bowls on the table.\n\"Two hangover soups are ready.\"\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\nJung Bin politely thanked him and picked up a spoon. Cha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young was thoroughly ignoring Cha Eui-jae, as if he hadn't just spoken to him.\n***\n\"Thank you for the meal.\"\n\"...Yes, thank you.\"\n'If you're done eating, just leave.' Cha Eui-jae held back his words as he watched the hunters leave in a group. While he was counting the cash, Jung Bin, who was looking at the autographs on the wall, asked.\n\"Are those signatures from regular customers?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, yes.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nMost of them were people who came here almost daily, so they could be considered regulars. As Cha Eui-jae nodded, Jung Bin smiled.\n\"Haha, I wonder how many times I'd have to come to get my signature up there. I guess I'll have to visit often.\"\nNo, don't come. Don't ever come back.\nIt sounded like polite small talk, but Cha Eui-jae hoped he wouldn't return. He earnestly prayed as he saw Jung Bin off. Lee Sa-young had also disappeared at some point without a sound. Only after the two S-grades left did peace return to the store and to Cha Eui-jae's heart.\nIt was when he was filling the sink with water after finishing the day's business, wearing pink rubber gloves. Leaning against the sink, listening to the sound of water, he heard a faint sound. It was so small that Cha Eui-jae could barely hear it with his keen sense of hearing. Then, the sound began to be heard regularly: tap, tap, tap. He turned off the faucet and peeked around to find the source of the sound.\nA gas mask was tapping on the sliding glass door with its fingertip.\nIf this had been a scene from a B-grade disaster or horror movie, the protagonist would scream, but to Cha Eui-jae, it looked like an annoying customer interrupting his closing time. Instead of screaming, he replied loudly enough for the voice to be heard outside the door.\n\"We're closed—\"\nThe gas mask also leaned its forehead against the glass and replied briefly.\n\"I need to talk to you.\"\n\"I said we're closed.\"\n\"You'd better hear me out unless you want to see Jung Bin again tomorrow.\"\nAt the half-threatening words, Cha Eui-jae rushed to the door and grabbed the handle with his rubber-gloved hand. Since it was just the two of them now, there was nothing to hide. His eyes burned intensely as he looked at the gas mask.\n\"Is it you?\"\nDid you call Jung Bin here? The indifferent voice came through the crack of the door.\n\"Why would it be me?\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you look at it, you're the one who called him here.\"\n\"I clearly heard you say you were looking for someone.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae retorted with a dumbfounded expression, Lee Sa-young responded as if it was obvious.\n\"If you hadn't thrown a nuclear bomb on Tomato Market, he wouldn't have come here.\"\n\"What are you talking about? What does Tomato Market have to do with me?\"\nThe gas mask stared straight at Cha Eui-jae through the glass.\n\"Don't you understand the seriousness of the situation?\"\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\nCha Eui-jae decided to keep playing dumb. The black gloves stopped tapping on the glass.\n\"Fine. Whoever comes, just keep pretending you don't know anything. That's what you ought to do.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you're not opening the door, should I just melt this?\"\n\"Try it. I'll report you to the authorities right away.\"\n\"Why do you keep looking for Jung Bin... I'm right here in front of you.\"\nIt was a high-class threat, implying he'd call Jung Bin right away if Cha Eui-jae didn't open the door. Cha Eui-jae eventually opened the door. He couldn't let Jung Bin return here after finally sending him off. As soon as Lee Sa-young came in, he took off his gas mask and brushed back his hair.\n\"They'll keep coming. Those kinds of guys.\"\nLee Sa-young, who had just called Jung Bin, Korea's 3rd-ranked S-grade public hunter, \"those kinds of guys,\" popped a peppermint candy into his mouth. His pale cheeks puffed out in the shape of the candy. Lee Sa-young had an uncanny talent for saying dreadful things nonchalantly. Cha Eui-jae shuddered.\n\"Don't say such horrible things.\"\n\"Then why did you put it up on Tomato Market? You should have put it on Second-hand World or Thunder Market.\"\nLee Sa-young continued his scolding disguised as advice while sitting on a chair.\n\"Of all places, you put it on Tomato Market where the area is specified, causing this mess.\"\n\"I told you, it wasn't me.\"\n\"Fine, then. The crazy person who put the magic stone on Tomato Market.\"\n\"Watch your mouth. They probably didn't know any better.\"\n\"All the hunters I know installed Tomato Market now. Many are trying to track the owner of the magic stone.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It was practically giving it away for free, and you put it on Tomato Market with the area verified. It seemed like you wanted to advertise your location.\"\n\"...That person probably regrets it now.\"\n\"Really? They didn't seem like it at all.\"\nLee Sa-young didn't back down even a bit. He even seemed slightly upset for some reason. But since this incident was clearly Cha Eui-jae's fault, he couldn't tell Lee Sa-young to shut up.\nJust moments ago, Cha Eui-jae had been thinking of countless ways to chase away the unwanted guest, but now he changed his mind.\nCurrently, the only person who knew that Cha Eui-jae was hiding his strength was Lee Sa-young. In other words, the only person who could help maintain Cha Eui-jae's quiet life was Lee Sa-young. Since things were already messed up, why not use the information power of the number 1? After all, this guy was an active hunter.\nCha Eui-jae clasped his hands together and, with unusual politeness, called out to Lee Sa-young.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi.\"\n\"What's gotten into you, using honorifics all of a sudden? You've eaten at least five thousand more meals than I have.\"\nHis grudge was impressively long-lived. Cha Eui-jae decided to abandon formal speech immediately.\n\"Shut up. Anyway, I need some advice.\"\n\"Hm...\"\n\"There's a friend of mine who made a big mistake...\"\nLee Sa-young was looking up at him with a seemingly serious expression, listening to the story. Whether he was truly paying attention or just pretending, Cha Eui-jae wasn't sure. Cha Eui-jae continued with the most crucial points.\n\"He didn't know it was a big mistake.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"And he didn't think it would escalate this much.\"\n\"Poor guy.\"\nLee Sa-young offered sympathy that sounded entirely insincere.\n\"By the way, Hyung, do you even have friends?\"\n\"I do. What do you know?\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae shook his fist in the air, Lee Sa-young mimed zipping his lips. Then, placing his hands together and resting his chin on them, he smiled with his eyes. His fancy face was filled with the kind of mischievous curiosity one might have for an interesting toy.\nThough it was an obvious lie, Lee Sa-young seemed to signal that he would humor it. Cha Eui-jae, matching his expectations, continued shamelessly.\n\"It seems the mistake was bigger than he thought. All sorts of people are buzzing around him.\"\n\"Too bad.\"\n\"But this friend wants to fix his mistake as quietly as possible. Without anyone knowing.\"\n\"Why?\"\nTheir eyes met. Staring at Lee Sa-young's mischievous face, Cha Eui-jae answered.\n\"Because he wants to live quietly.\"\n\"Ah...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Wants to live quietly, huh.\"\nAfter a short silence, Lee Sa-young bit into his candy with a crunch and laughed softly.\n\"I really like that.\"\nLee Sa-young stood up silently and clasped his hands behind his back. His long shadow seemed to engulf Cha Eui-jae. Whispering like an incantation, his low voice reached Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Let's make a deal.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll clean up the mess you made.\"\nThe subject had subtly shifted back from 'friend' to Cha Eui-jae, but Cha Eui-jae didn't bother correcting him.\n\"It won't be for free.\"\n\"Of course. It's a deal.\"\n\"What do you want?\"\nLooking up at Lee Sa-young's face from his reversed vantage point, Cha Eui-jae had no idea what condition this madman might propose. Perhaps he'd ask for help with a task, assistance in dungeon raids, or even for Cha Eui-jae to join his guild.\nGiven the intricately crafted face, the conditions were likely to be equally precise and potentially dreadful. In the worst-case scenario, Lee Sa-young might ask him to kill someone. If it came to that, Cha Eui-jae would have no choice but to refuse and look for another solution.\nHowever, Lee Sa-young's proposal was unexpected. He held up one finger and spoke.\n\"A person who is unknown.\"\n\"...\"\n\"A person whose existence no one knows.\"\nLee Sa-young smiled angelically.\n\"I want you, Hyung.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 23: Butterfly Effect\n\"I want you, Hyung.\"\nTheir eyes met, and Cha Eui-jae forced a smile. What? An unknown person? No one knows I exist? Cha Eui-jae recalled the educational comics featuring caricatures of himself and the documentaries he had glimpsed. There couldn't be anyone as famous as him, this guy....\n\"A skilled person who doesn't belong anywhere and is not known to the public. The fewer people who know, the better.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Is that too demanding?\"\nLee Sa-young silently moved, slowly circling around Cha Eui-jae. It felt like a snake slithering through the underbrush.\n\"I was about to give up finding the right person, but then you showed up.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Like destiny.\"\n\"Are you a believer in fate?\"\n\"I never believed in such nonsense, but now I'm thinking of starting.\"\nSuddenly, Lee Sa-young was right behind Cha Eui-jae, bending slightly at the waist.\n\"I've learned a bit about you.\"\nBlack fingers wrapped around Cha Eui-jae's shoulder, and the owner of those fingers whispered gently.\n\"The high school you attended, and even the area around your home, was entirely swallowed up by a rift, leaving nothing to find... Both parents died on the Day of the Rift, and you have no remaining relatives to investigate... If you had a job, there would be contracts, but there are no contracts, no bank transaction records, and your first phone activation was only a few months ago. There are no records before that.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The owner of this place and her niece aren't your real relatives, are they? They're complete strangers.\"\nCha Eui-jae remained silent. Lee Sa-young continued speaking, undeterred.\n\"There's really nothing.\"\nThat was only natural. While he was active as J, Cha Eui-jae lived entirely as J, not as Cha Eui-jae. It was no wonder Lee Sa-young couldn't find any trace of 'Cha Eui-jae' that he was searching for. Lee Sa-young let out a long sigh.\n\"I initially planned to scout you nicely, meeting any conditions you had. But...\"\n\"...\"\n\"It seems like this shop is the only thing that matters to you now.\"\nThe voice, which had been soft and pleasant, moved closer to Cha Eui-jae's ear. Cha Eui-jae involuntarily held his breath for a moment.\n\"Is there anything you want?\"\nWant?\nNo one in the world wants nothing.\nWhenever he closes his eyes, he still hears the desperate screams and cries. The hands clinging to his feet, begging to be saved, and the stench of blood lingering at the tip of his nose intrude on him unexpectedly. The slimy sensation of desperately digging through the piles of corpses to retrieve even a piece of flesh or bone is vivid.\nCha Eui-jae wished he could retrieve the bodies left behind in the West Sea rift. Though he had escaped and hidden here, that feeling was genuine. He wanted to send them back to where they belonged. He wanted to fulfill the last duty of the survivor. Because that place... is too lonely.\nBut he knew it was impossible.\nSo, Cha Eui-jae could only say he wanted nothing.\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"...Really?\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae gave a brief reply, Lee Sa-young slowly blinked and then smiled slightly.\n\"Then let me suggest something.\"\nHe took out a tablet from the air and placed it in front of Cha Eui-jae. On the screen was a photo of a sharp-looking man wearing glasses. Lee Sa-young reached over Cha Eui-jae's shoulder and slowly swiped the photo to the side. The man with long, white hair tied back and wearing a doctor's coat appeared.\n\"Do you know Nam Woo-jin? He's an A-grade healer.\"\nCha Eui-jae remembered seeing his name when looking up information about Lee Sa-young.\n—Currently ranked 6th in South Korea, Nam Woo-jin, the Leader of the Seowon Guild. South Korea's only A-grade healer. Before awakening, he was an orthopedic surgeon at a university hospital, raising questions about whether pre-awakening skills affect awakening abilities....\nThat was roughly what he recalled. As the vague memory came back, he nodded, and Lee Sa-young smiled.\n\"How about having Granny's leg treated by Nam Woo-jin?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I heard she has trouble with her leg.\"\nFrom the ability to float 2cm in the air to lifting an entire building, countless abilities had emerged since the Day of the Rift, but there were very few awakeners with healing skills. When Cha Eui-jae was active, there was only one B-grade awakener in the United States with such skills.\nMoreover, the only A-grade healer in South Korea. Ordinary people wouldn't even get to meet such a person. Cha Eui-jae let out a short laugh.\n\"An A-grade healer treating a common person? That makes no sense.\"\n\"The Seowon Guild and our guild are in a cooperative relationship, so I can ask him to treat one person. He was an orthopedic surgeon before awakening, so he can handle general treatments as well.\"\n\"...\"\n\"What do you think?\"\nIt was an incredibly tempting offer. But Cha Eui-jae was not naive enough to be swayed by sweetness without considering the surroundings. All these deals and conditions were peripheral, not the essence.\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Yes, Hyung.\"\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae turned to meet Lee Sa-young's violet eyes. Lee Sa-young was staring intently at his face. Instead of avoiding his gaze, Cha Eui-jae raised the corners of his mouth in a grin.\n\"Why are you going to such lengths to drag me in, investigating me thoroughly and finding my weak points, and then offering me such a tempting deal?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Are you going to expose me as an awakener to everyone if I refuse?\"\n\"...\"\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"Well...\"\nLee Sa-young's eyes, devoid of laughter, scanned Cha Eui-jae's face. The answer came surprisingly quickly, considering how long he had been beating around the bush.\n\"I did consider that option.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But simply threatening you would be a bad move, and...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I concluded that you wouldn't be the type to respond to such tactics.\"\n\"At least you made a decent judgment.\"\n\"Thanks for the compliment. Anyway, to answer your question.\"\nA short silence followed. Lee Sa-young asked in a low voice.\n\"Do you remember the guy you hit with the ladle that time?\"\nOf course, he remembered. If it weren't for that guy, he wouldn't be sitting here facing Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae nodded, and Lee Sa-young rubbed his finger on the tablet screen and continued speaking.\n\"A strange drug started circulating a few years ago.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Of course, ordinary drugs or narcotics don't usually affect awakeners... but this drug caused an unusual reaction.\"\n\"For example?\"\n\"Increased aggression, addiction. And...\"\nHis long fingers swiped to reveal another photo. A grotesquely twisted body with black spikes protruding from it, looking like a dried-up tree. It was once a human, now something else. Cha Eui-jae had seen this form before.\n\"Physical mutation.\"\nSuddenly, he remembered what Lee Sa-young had said when they first met.\nThe guy Lee Sa-young was beating up was an awakener addicted to this drug. The thing in the picture looked even more like a monster than the man he had seen before. Observing the unnaturally bent body in the photo, Cha Eui-jae muttered.\n\"Just by taking the drug, you turn into that?\"\n\"...That's the troublesome part.\"\nLee Sa-young, echoing Cha Eui-jae's muttering, turned off the tablet screen.\n\"Anyway, I'm looking for the people spreading this drug. But,\"\n\"...\"\n\"People like me or my guild members are too well-known... If we dig a little deeper, they'll notice and cut us off.\"\nThe Pado Guild was small but had famous hunters. Their every move would stand out. Tracking and scouting such targets would be a significant handicap if the target were an awakener.\n\"And we can't just send anyone in. They'd either get killed or end up crawling around addicted.\"\n'A skilled person who doesn't belong anywhere and is not known to the public. The fewer people who know, the better.'\nTo track a well-hidden target, one must be similarly concealed. Since the target is an aggressive enhanced awakener, someone with the skills to fight and defeat an awakener must take on the job.\nCha Eui-jae could see the logic behind Lee Sa-young's conditions. Those conditions perfectly matched himself. But—\n\"Then why?\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Why are you after them?\"\nWhy was Lee Sa-young going after these people?\nFor the sake of awakeners? No. To protect South Korea? No way. To protect ordinary people? Impossible.\nBased on what he had seen, Lee Sa-young wasn't someone driven by high ideals. Despite the short time they had known each other, Cha Eui-jae instinctively understood.\nLee Sa-young moved solely according to his standards. Pride as South Korea's number one, responsibility, or even the Awakened Special Law prioritizing the protection of ordinary people wouldn't be strong enough motivations for him.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been silent, placed a finger over his lips.\n\"That part is a secret.\"\n\"Hey.\"\n\"I'll tell you if you agree to the deal.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh, and the drug story is confidential. Keep it secret, or Jung Bin will visit you again.\"\nThis guy chained me with a secret under the pretense of sharing it. Cha Eui-jae's expression turned cold. On the contrary, Lee Sa-young's face was full of a satisfied smile.\nLee Sa-young put the tablet back into his inventory and lightly squeezed Cha Eui-jae's shoulder a couple of times. Cha Eui-jae had swatted his hand away, and Lee Sa-young laughed out loud without showing any sign of irritation. As Cha Eui-jae got up from his seat, he waved his hand dismissively.\n\"Go quickly. I have to close up.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nLee Sa-young began to put on his gas mask again. Now once again, Lee Sa-young had transformed into the suspicious figure in the gas mask. He suddenly extended his hand. What, was he asking for a handshake? Cha Eui-jae looked at him skeptically, but Lee Sa-young's gloved fingers wiggled slightly.\n\"Your phone.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"To give you my number.\"\n\"I don't need it.\"\n\"My number's valuable, you know.\"\n\"I'll sell it on Tomato Market.\"\n\"Then we'll see each other often, won't we?\"\nThreatening but not quite threatening, Lee Sa-young laughed as if he found the whole situation amusing. Despite his words, he didn't retract his hand, so Cha Eui-jae finally handed over his phone. Even if he intended to refuse the deal, it seemed wise to leave at least one last resort for any unexpected situation.\nLee Sa-young quickly entered his number and left the store without hesitation. Alone, Cha Eui-jae opened the contacts app.\nOriginally, his contacts list contained only two numbers: the home phone number of grandmother and Park Ha-eun, and Park Ha-eun's mobile number. There had been no need to store any other numbers.\nBut now it was different. Below the two previously lone entries in his contacts, a new name had been added.\n[Sa-young]",

      "content": "Chapter 24: Butterfly Effect\nAlthough Lee Sa-young had proposed a deal first and even given his phone number, he didn't come back to the store for several days. During that time, Cha Eui-jae didn't delete his number. Nor did he sell it on Tomato Market. Instead, Cha Eui-jae found himself staring at Lee Sa-young's contact information, lost in thought more often.\nAs Lee Sa-young had ominously predicted, strange individuals started flocking to the store like carp chasing food.\nFor example...\n\"Yes, this is the hangover soup restaurant.\"\n—Hello, this is Kim So-young, a writer from MBB Broadcasting. May I speak with you?\n\"I'm sorry, but we don't do deliveries.\"\n—It's not about delivery. I wanted to ask if you'd be interested in appearing on a show. Our program airs live on weekdays at 7 PM, and...\n\"We don't appear on broadcasts.\"\n—If we promote your place as a hunter's hotspot, it would help with...\n\"I'm not interested. We're busy with customers, so I'll hang up now.\"\nOr there were incidents like this happening once a day,\n\"Sir.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Turn off the camera in your bag.\"\n\"What? Where do you see a camera? Did you see it? This is ridiculous.\"\n\"Unauthorized filming is illegal.\"\n\"Hey, punk! I can hear the camera running. This guy is underestimating hunters' ears.\"\n\"Why are you filming people eating soup? Who is this guy?\"\n\"...Damn, that guy makes controversial content for YouTube!\"\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"Damn it, just you wait!\"\n\"If we don't catch him, two people here will get wrapped up in an online article.\"\n\"Why are you just sitting there staring? Catch that guy!\"\n\"Don't clear my soup. I'll go catch him before it gets cold.\"\n\"I have a warming artifact. Your soup will be safe.\"\n\"Lee Won-ho-ssi...!\"\n\"Kang Doo-chil-ssi...!\"\n\"It seems those two will end up in a dating rumor.\"\nNot to mention all sorts of incidents and accidents happening frequently...\nxxYeahsungH\nSometimes, I...\nI cry...\nSometimes I can't hold back my tears because it hurts...\nCrying out loud...\nIs a good thing.\n#daily #communication #magicstone #waitingforcontact #tears #sadness #depression #cantfocusonwork\nLikes 874k\n—Don't cry YS\n—(Crying emoji)\n—Damn it, Ye-seong, I'm looking for your magic stone, so just wait a bit. When you cry, my heart tears apart too ㅠㅠ;;\n—Jung Bin, please confiscate Hong Ye-seong's phone.\n—Ye-seong, I love you, but this InHeart is a bit overwhelming.\nAnd then there were emotional posts on Instagram from Hong Ye-seong, along with a tearful selfie, and...\n[This is really delicious ^^ – Hunter Jung Bin]\nThere was even an autographed picture of Jung Bin that arrived in a registered mail. After encountering such things, Cha Eui-jae couldn't even be bothered to worry about them anymore.\nAn autograph from Jung Bin could be quite valuable. Cha Eui-jae considered selling it on Tomato Market but decided against it to avoid another barrage of messages. Instead, he quietly stuck it on the wall. Park Ha-eun liked it, so it turned out well in the end.\nRecently, people with telephoto cameras had started hovering around the store, likely trying to get photos of famous hunters. Instead of a quiet life, Cha Eui-jae found himself increasingly entangled with the wider world, which was starting to annoy him.\nAt 12:24 PM, during a brief moment of free time, Cha Eui-jae was sweeping the front of the store when he frowned. He could feel a camera from afar taking pictures of him. Unfortunately, he didn't have the ability to manipulate electricity to destroy the camera from a distance. He could throw the broom to hit the camera, but...\n'Should I just throw it?'\n\"Sir! We need more kimchi!\"\n\"Yes.\"\n'I am a weak civilian. Civilians can't break cameras with brooms. I am a weak civilian...'\nFortunately, the timely call pulled Cha Eui-jae out of his bad thoughts. He trudged back into the store, reminding himself that he was a good-natured civilian working at a hangover soup restaurant. This situation couldn't be simply because of one magic stone.\nA very rare magic stone listed on Tomato Market in this area? That might cause some buzz among hunters. Some crazy person listed an A+ grade magic stone for a giveaway price, so they decided to search the area for the owner of the stone. And while they were at it, why not try the famous soup?\nBut if Korea's number one ranked hunter Lee Sa-young and the national public servant hunter Jung Bin both ate at the same hangover soup restaurant? That's a big deal.\nFrom that moment on, the store was bound to receive all kinds of attention. Unknown cyber stalkers and people with telephoto cameras started showing up after Jung Bin's visit, so the timing matched up.\n'It must be because of Jung Bin and Lee Sa-young...'\nCha Eui-jae was taking out the kimchi container while half-listening to Jung Bin's voice giving tips on preventing frozen pipes on TV.\nVroom—\n\"Ahh!\"\n\"Damn!\"\n\"Help!\"\nThe loud exhaust and piercing screams shattered the quiet of the alley. Cha Eui-jae glanced outside. He prided himself on not being easily surprised anymore, but seeing a sleek black motorcycle blocking the door was a new sight.\nThe hunters waiting in line outside were pressed against the wall to avoid the motorcycle, and the hunters eating soup craned their necks to see what was going on.\nSomeone wearing a black leather rider jacket, dark blue jeans, black boots, and a helmet stood in front of the sliding door. The rider briefly peeked into the store, then roughly took off the helmet. Lustrous golden hair tied high fell gracefully.\nThe hunters holding their breath watching the rider gasped.\n\"The Hornet...!\"\n\"Why is the Hornet here?\"\n\"Who called her the Hornet? Do you want to die?\"\n\"Sorry!\"\nWithout bothering to hide her menacing aura, the Hornet flung the sliding door open and stormed inside. High-tied golden hair and the nickname Hornet. She was someone Cha Eui-jae had seen while looking up information about Lee Sa-young.\n—Ranked 5th in South Korea, A-grade hunter, hunter name Honeybee. Real name Yoo Chae-hyun. Despite the hunter name Honeybee, many call her the Hornet because of her combat style and personality.\n...But why would a 5th-ranked hunter come to this shabby hangover soup restaurant? Could it be to eat soup? Cha Eui-jae's thoughts were cut short by Honeybee's booming voice from her diaphragm.\n\"Lee Sa-young, come out!\"\nAlright, so it was Lee Sa-young causing trouble again. Cha Eui-jae's expression turned icy as he thought about how he would have to put another hunter's autograph on the wall.\nHoneybee noticed his gaze and whipped around to face him. Her pretty face scanned him up and down, and her voice became relatively kind, perhaps thinking he was just a civilian.\n\"Is there a problem?\"\nDid she really not know? Cha Eui-jae thought there were already too many problems to count. This wasn't just a problem; it was a catastrophe.\nParking a motorcycle at the entrance! Shouting for Lee Sa-young and barging in!! Blocking the door arrogantly!!! Making the waiting customers stick to the wall like gum!!!! And lastly, a bad feeling that a Honeybee ZONE would soon appear!!!!! Everything was a problem.\nWhen Jung Bin showed up, Cha Eui-jae was just flustered to meet someone he knew after a long time, but handling such hunters was actually easy for him. With a dumb, innocent expression like when he called the Rift Management Bureau, Cha Eui-jae said,\n\"Wait a moment.\"\n\"...\"\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\n\"You're Honeybee, right?\"\nIf it's come to this, I'll use my civilian disguise strategy.\nThe stronger and more famous a hunter, the more they care about their reputation. They tend to be kind and soft towards civilians. Cha Eui-jae employed a sure-fire line to prove that he was an ordinary, kind-hearted citizen.\n\"Wow, I'm a big fan.\"\nHearing about a fan, Honeybee quickly shifted gears. She let down her tied hair, brushed it back smoothly, and struck a signature pose from a hair dye commercial. The heater blew just at the right time, making her hair flutter.\n\"Change your color!\"\n'Really?'\nCha Eui-jae hesitated briefly but quickly collected himself. He beat on the kimchi container like a drum and cheered, \"Wow!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 25: Butterfly Effect\nHoneybee, South Korea's 5th-ranked hunter, and the advertising model for CyC, a hunter-exclusive dye made from dungeon byproducts, was busy giving fan service while flaunting her shiny blonde bleached hair in a traditional hangover soup restaurant.\nWhen Cha Eui-jae, channeling the excitement of meeting a star hunter, responded enthusiastically, the other hunters, caught off guard, also clapped along. Honeybee withdrew her fierce aura and bowed politely.\n\"I'm sorry for startling you. I didn't mean to intrude so suddenly.\"\n\"It's alright.\"\n\"No, really, I'm sorry. I lost my temper for a moment...\"\nShe laughed heartily with Cha Eui-jae, but while her face bore an elegant smile, the hunters' eating pace quickened. Among the clattering noises, a familiar voice broke through.\n\"Who parked a motorcycle like this? Ugh.\"\nAll eyes turned to the newcomer, Bae Won-woo, who was blinking while holding Honeybee's motorcycle overhead. Honeybee gasped.\n\"Are you crazy? Put that down right now!\"\n\"Honeybee? What are you doing here?\"\n\"First, put down my bike.\"\n\"Your bike? You should park it properly then. Blocking the entrance like that.\"\nBae Won-woo grumbled as he gently set the bike aside. Honeybee, who had been massaging her temples, looked up with a start.\n\"Hey, Shield Guy. Did you come alone? Where's Lee Sa-young?\"\nHaving earned the nickname \"Shield Guy,\" the epitome of manliness, Bae Won-woo shuddered.\n\"I told you, don't call me by my hunter name. Please use my real name.\"\n\"Where's Lee Sa-young? Didn't you come together?\"\n\"Huh? Sa-young? I don't know. Why are you looking for him?\"\nBae Won-woo asked, puzzled. Instead of answering, Honeybee scanned the area. It wasn't common to witness conversations between top 10 hunters, so the other hunters were all ears. But as Honeybee shot them a sharp look, they quickly pretended to be preoccupied.\nAt that moment, a thunderous stomach growl echoed through the restaurant. Rubbing his belly, Bae Won-woo muttered pitifully.\n\"I'm curious about your story too, but can we order first?\"\n\"...Sure. I need to cool down a bit anyway.\"\nHoneybee fanned herself. Just then, two hunters who had devoured their hangover soup tossed 30,000 won on the counter and hurried out. Bae Won-woo skillfully picked up a rag and waved it at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"I'll clean up and sit down. One hangover soup with plenty of cheongyang pepper. Honeybee, what do you want?\"\n\"What do they have here?\"\n\"hangover soup.\"\n\"...Only hangover soup?\"\n\"Yep. But it's good.\"\nBae Won-woo flashed a toothy grin and a thumbs up. Honeybee, massaging her temples and shaking her head, answered reluctantly.\n\"Alright, hangover soup for me too.\"\n\"Great.\"\nBae Won-woo flashed a V-sign at Cha Eui-jae, who responded with an okay sign before filling a bowl with kimchi and radish kimchi. He set the table quickly, and Bae Won-woo, who had even brought his own soup spoon, clapped his hands.\n\"Now, tell me. Why are you looking for Sa-young? What did he do this time?\"\nHoneybee glanced around again before gesturing for Bae Won-woo to come closer. As he leaned in, she cupped her hands and whispered.\n\"You know the magic stone listed on Tomato Market, right?\"\nOf course, Cha Eui-jae heard it all. Not the magic stone again. With everyone who came in talking about it, he was getting neurotic. Cha Eui-jae stoked the fire under the stew pot. Bae Won-woo whispered back.\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\"I really, really need that magic stone.\"\n\"Huh? That much?\"\n\"If I bring it, Hong Ye-seong will make me a weapon. I desperately need an S-grade weapon.\"\n\"Oh... right. Your weapon broke, didn't it?\"\n\"Yeah. And the system ranking update is coming soon. After getting the magic stone to Hong Ye-seong, I'll commission my custom S-grade weapon and beat Gyu-Gyu in the ranking update. It's the perfect plan.\"\nGyu-Gyu was the ranker just above her. Like everyone else, she had her grand ambitions visiting this hangover soup restaurant. Cha Eui-jae vowed to punch Hong Ye-seong someday if he ever met him. For reference, Hong Ye-seong still posted about his longing for magic stones daily on InHeart.\nBae Won-woo nodded with a dubious expression.\n\"Well, that makes sense. But why are you looking for Sa-young?\"\n\"Because that crazy guy blocked all the info sources!\"\nBang! Honeybee slammed her fist down. Fortunately, before her hand hit the table, Bae Won-woo swiftly intercepted it with his palm. Seeing Bae Won-woo save the table, Cha Eui-jae gave him a thumbs-up from behind the counter.\n'Damn, tanks protect property these days too.'\nCha Eui-jae added an extra meaty bone to Bae Won-woo's stew. Honeybee, still fuming, calmed down a bit.\n\"Did the table break?\"\n\"No, I saved it.\"\n\"Thanks. Anyway, until a few days ago, information was circulating.\"\nHoneybee's long-winded explanation boiled down to this: A sudden magic stone listing and deletion by EZ on Tomato Market. Normally, this would be a mere curiosity, but Hong Ye-seong's promise of a custom weapon skyrocketed its importance.\nA custom weapon from Hong Ye-seong! A priceless item worth hundreds of millions. Hunters eager for quick riches swarmed to track EZ, and Honeybee, having recently lost her precious weapon, joined the hunt anonymously. Together, they formed a tracking team, sharing and analyzing every scrap of information.\nHoneybee tugged at her golden hair in frustration.\n\"We enhanced the magic stone photo, looking for reflections, analyzed the phone model, and even compared the background newspaper to identify the publication. We dissected that photo down to the nano level, chasing every lead.\"\n'...That far?'\nListening quietly, Cha Eui-jae broke out in a cold sweat. The technological advancement and hunters' obsession were terrifying. Even Bae Won-woo looked a bit overwhelmed.\n\"...That far?\"\nHe echoed Cha Eui-jae's thoughts. Honeybee groaned, collapsing onto the table. Bae Won-woo swiftly caught her head before it hit, saving the table once again. Cha Eui-jae decided to give Bae Won-woo a free bowl of rice.\n\"But suddenly, all talk stopped a few days ago. It's not like everyone went into a dungeon! The tracking team went silent. So I asked if something happened.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"They said they were quitting the chase. Those passionate guys!\"\n\"Wow.\"\n\"So I kept digging. Turns out, they got contacted by the Pado Guild's legal team. Told to drop the EZ chase.\"\n\"What? Our guild?\"\nBae Won-woo looked genuinely shocked. Honeybee, disheveled, muttered gloomily.\n\"That's all they said. Like they'd been gagged. But it wasn't you, so it's got to be Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"That's... probably true.\"\n\"And he doesn't meet people much... so I can't ask him directly.\"\nCha Eui-jae wanted to gather more information from their conversation, but any longer and the stew would boil over. He carried out two hot bowls of hangover soup, rice, kimchi, radish kimchi, and chopped cheongyang pepper on a tray.\nJust then, Honeybee was slumped over, and Bae Won-woo was staring blankly.\n\"Your hangover soup is here.\"\n\"Oh! Thank you... wait, we didn't order rice.\"\nBae Won-woo looked at Cha Eui-jae with a blank face. Cha Eui-jae responded nonchalantly.\n\"It's on the house.\"\nBae Won-woo's blank expression turned into one of gratitude and amazement. Honeybee quickly lifted her head. Cha Eui-jae coolly returned to the kitchen.\nThe restaurant grew quiet again. A small service brought back peace and information. Easy. Cha Eui-jae finished the dishes and handled Bae Won-woo and Honeybee's additional orders smoothly.\nA bit later, Bae Won-woo waved from the counter.\n\"Hey, part-timer! Check, please!\"\n\"Sure. That's ninety thousand won.\"\nAfter processing the payment and handing back the card, Honeybee suddenly produced a rolled-up item.\n\"What's this?\"\n\"Unroll it.\"\nCarefully, Cha Eui-jae unfolded it to reveal Honeybee's poster with a big signature on one corner. It would be a prized possession for her fans. Cha Eui-jae's expression momentarily turned odd.\n'Why are you giving me this?'\nAnd where did she get it from all of a sudden? She didn't have it when she made her grand entrance. Smiling smugly, she cleared her throat.\n\"I saw others had autographed posters on the wall?\"\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\"It's a gift. Put mine up too.\"\nCha Eui-jae almost stared at Honeybee dumbfounded but remembered he wasn't supposed to show his feelings. So he smiled widely.",

      "content": "Chapter 26: Butterfly Effect\n\"It's a gift. Put mine up too.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, this kind of fan service is basic. It's not because I was grateful for the rice.\"\nHoneybee brushed her shimmering hair back. She looked ecstatic to meet her fan, anyone could see it.\nIf a quick-witted person had been nearby, they would have teased her for acting so out of character, but fortunately or unfortunately, the only one with her was the clueless Bae Won-woo. He was genuinely impressed.\n\"Oh~ are you a fan of Honeybee, part-timer?\"\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n\"Hey, come by more often. He says he's a fan.\"\nShut up.\n\"Well, I'm really busy, but I might come by again.\"\nPlease, never come back.\nHoneybee and Bae Won-woo left the shop together. Cha Eui-jae stared blankly at the ceiling, holding the signed poster under his arm.\n'I could get rich just selling signatures.'\nHowever, since Cha Eui-jae's Tomato Market account was suspended, Honeybee's signed poster would end up next to Jung Bin's signature. That afternoon, when Park Ha-eun got home from school, she noticed the Honeybee poster and immediately ran up to it.\n\"Uncle, what's this?\"\n\"It's a Honeybee poster.\"\n\"The real Honeybee?\"\nSomehow, her voice seemed to get louder. Cha Eui-jae, who had been putting away the groceries, looked at Park Ha-eun with a puzzled expression. She was practically glued to the wall, almost rubbing her cheek against the poster.\n\"Did Honeybee come by today?\"\nHer voice was almost a scream now.\n\"Yeah. She even signed it right there.\"\n\"I, I.\"\nPark Ha-eun, close to rubbing her cheek against the poster, began to tear up.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Uncle, I...\"\n\"Why, what's wrong?\"\n\"I want to see Honeybee!\"\n'Damn it.'\nHe had cursed her not to come back, but now he had to cancel that curse within a few hours.\n***\n\"Sa-young, did you skip a meal again?!\"\nThud, thud, thud. With heavy footsteps, the Vice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo burst into the Guild Leader's office. Lee Sa-young frowned slightly but it wasn't visible because of his blindfold.\nHe was lying on the sofa in the Guild Leader's office, firmly equipped with a black blindfold and earplugs. Bae Won-woo approached and started nagging out of habit.\n\"People live on food, you know. You seem to be eating well lately, why are you skipping meals again?\"\nIt wasn't the first time Lee Sa-young had a small appetite. Bae Won-woo clicked his tongue and brought a tablet to stand in front of him. He didn't care if Lee Sa-young had earplugs on or not.\nAfter all, for Lee Sa-young, earplugs were just a tool to slightly reduce noise. That's what it means to be an S-grade awakened.\n\"The Awakened Management Bureau sent an official letter. They're requesting cooperation as they'll activate the emergency response system on the day of the ranking announcement.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young responded by wiggling his foot.\n\"Okay.\"\nBae Won-woo flipped the screen.\n\"The dungeon at Jongno 3-ga will be handled by our team. The advance team will clear it first, and then researchers will enter for resource investigation.\"\nWiggle.\n\"And Seowon Guild is asking for a visit sometime.\"\nWiggle.\n\"That's the urgent stuff... Oh, and I'm thinking of doing a commercial.\"\n\"...\"\nWhoever had filled his head with such ideas, it wasn't worth responding to, so Lee Sa-young stopped wiggling. But Bae Won-woo kept talking.\n\"The part-timer at the soup restaurant is a fan of Honeybee. I thought he wasn't interested in hunters at all, but I guess you can't ignore public exposure.\"\n\"...What?\"\nLee Sa-young slowly lifted one side of his blindfold.\n\"Say that again.\"\n\"What? That you can't ignore public exposure?\"\n\"No, before that.\"\n\"I'm doing a commercial?\"\n\"You... are you doing this on purpose?\"\n\"No, what did I do?\"\n\"You mentioned the part-timer.\"\n\"Oh, the part-timer? Said he was a fan of Honeybee.\"\n\"...What?\"\nThere was only one part-timer Bae Won-woo could be referring to. The part-timer at the soup restaurant.\n\"Honeybee even signed a poster for him. I should learn from such fan service.\"\nBae Won-woo started enthusiastically talking about the proper attitude of hunters. Lee Sa-young, still holding the blindfold he had half-lifted, fell into thought. Come to think of it, Cha Eui-jae treated him and Jung Bin differently. And now, he was a fan of Honeybee?\nCommon traits of Jung Bin and Honeybee...\n'Commercial stars.'\nHa, Lee Sa-young let out a dry laugh. It seemed like Cha Eui-jae had a peculiar taste for high-profile individuals.\nRoughly throwing off his blindfold, he gestured to Bae Won-woo, who had been babbling about his rosy future as a top-ranking hunter after shooting a commercial.\n\"Stop fantasizing and call the head of promotions.\"\n\"Wow, Sa-young. Are you really letting me shoot a commercial?\"\n\"Quickly.\"\n***\nWith the evening rush over, Cha Eui-jae was organizing the account book at the counter of the soup restaurant. Today's count was easy since there weren't many unfortunate hunters who threw money and stormed out.\nJust then, two text messages arrived on Cha Eui-jae's phone.\nSa-young: CBS\nSa-young: Turn it on\nWhat could this guy, who hadn't contacted him or visited the shop in a while, want? Lee Sa-young had asked him to turn on CBS, but there was no need to change the channel. It was already on, having just finished the popular weekend drama. Cha Eui-jae glanced at the TV.\n—Change your color. CyC.\nThis guy couldn't have contacted him just to watch Honeybee's commercial. What was the next program? Cha Eui-jae was trying to recall the schedule.\nThe dye company logo disappeared, and now there was a beautiful single house with a large yard. A happy family was watching a retriever run around the yard, laughing. Ha ha ha, ho ho ho, woof woof.\nAnd then, appearing against that background...\nA gas mask.\n'...Gas mask?'\nThe pen Cha Eui-jae was using to record the amount on the ledger stopped mid-air. He couldn't help but gape at the screen.\nClink—\nThis was the sound of a hunter dropping his glass while watching TV by the water dispenser.\nHunters are sensitive to loud noises. Instinctively turning towards the source of the noise, they first saw the hunter who had dropped the glass, then his dumbfounded face, and naturally followed his gaze.\nAnd they saw 'it'.\n\"Crazy...\"\nOne hunter dropped the spoon he was holding. Another spit out water like an actor in a drama spitting out orange juice. One even made the sign of the cross and started praying. The entire soup restaurant was thrown into shock and horror.\nThe writing next to the gas mask-wearing figure in front of the family read:\n[Pado Guild Leader Lee Sa-young]\nThe gas mask-wearing figure in a neat suit stretched out his left hand. With his right hand, he made a V sign with his index and middle fingers, overlaying it on his left palm. Although both hands were in black gloves, making it hard to see.\nA low, mechanical voice spoke.\n—For inquiries about awakening registration, call the Awakened Bureau hotline 777. For unregistered reports and awakened crime reports, call 555.\n—The Korea Awakened Management Bureau is always by your side.\nHa ha ha, ho ho ho, 555.\nThe happy family and the gas mask figure waved their hands side to side. As the screen darkened, the music faded out with it. Silence filled the air. A professional voice actor quickly recited a disclaimer like a rap.\n—Failure to report an awakening without special reasons within a month will result in a fine of up to 100 million won. Please visit the nearest Awakened Registration Center for an awakening checkup. Public Service Advertisement Council.\nEveryone in the restaurant was speechless for a long time. Even after the ad ended, no one spoke first. It was like they were under a collective silence spell.\nIt wasn't until the next program began that the hunters started exhaling roughly. One even pulled out a potion and chugged it in one go.\n\"Wow...\"\n\"Huff. Huff. Crazy. What did I just see?\"\n\"I felt like I was hit by a confusion debuff.\"\n\"Me too.\"\n\"Is this real?\"\n\"I think my mental strength just dropped.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young is nuts. Now he's attacking our minds too.\"\n\"I need to go buy some mental strength-boosting gear.\"\n\"Does this mean we'll see that ad every time we watch TV?\"\n\"I'm starting digital detox from today...\"\n\"Shield Guy-nim.\"\nAll eyes in shock turned to one person. Sitting like a mountain, quietly eating soup, was the Shield Guy. Indeed, his presence alone drew everyone's attention, fitting of Korea's top tank. A hunter sitting at the same table cautiously asked.\n\"What... is that?\"\nShield Guy, Bae Won-woo, replied gloomily.\n\"A public service announcement.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"Reminding awakened individuals to register... something like that.\"\n'Was that what it was about?'\nListening to their conversation, Cha Eui-jae nearly dropped his pen again. It wasn't a threat that the gas mask guy would come and kill you if you didn't register?\n\"Why did Lee Sa-young suddenly shoot a PSA? He always refused all commercial offers.\"\nThat question wasn't unique to that hunter. Everyone started sharing their own theories.\n\"Isn't the annual ranking announcement coming up soon? Maybe he did it to secure first place.\"\n\"He'd be first place even without doing something like this.\"\n\"Did Jung Bin get some dirt on him?\"\n\"No way.\"\n\"Well...\"\nBae Won-woo's lips moved as if he wanted to say something but he ended up just burying his face back into his soup bowl.\nThe man of loyalty, the guy among guys, Bae Won-woo couldn't bring himself to say it.\nThat Lee Sa-young had personally contacted the Korea Broadcast Advertising Corporation, practically forcing them to let him do a public service announcement. The government employees, who had been delighted to hear that the famously ad-averse Lee Sa-young had reached out, and the promotion team, who had been thrilled that their guild leader was finally going to be in a commercial, were all left speechless at the result.\n\"If this airs, it's the end of Pado Guild.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If this was going to happen, he should have never done a commercial in the first place! Why did he do this?\"\nThe promotion team leader wept, clinging to Bae Won-woo. But Bae Won-woo was utterly powerless.\nInstead of explaining, he chose silence. He took a big spoonful of the soup and put it into his mouth. The spicy chili pepper made his eyes water. Sniffling, Bae Won-woo wiped his nose with a nostalgic look.\n'Sa-young, I kept my loyalty...'\nCha Eui-jae, who had been staring blankly at the TV screen, snapped out of it when his phone buzzed with a message.\nSa-young: Did you see?\nA brazen message had arrived. He was so dumbfounded he didn't know how to reply.\nSa-young: I heard\nSa-young: you like people who do commercials.\nSa-young: ^^\n\"What the hell is he talking about, this crazy guy...\"\nCha Eui-jae... resolved that, if he ever found out who spread the false rumor, he would kill them.",

      "content": "Chapter 27: Things Not to Do at a Funeral\n11:48 PM, Awakened Management Bureau Field Response Team 1 Office. The spacious office was brightly lit despite the late hour.\n\"Team Leader, would you like a snack?\"\n\"Ah, yes. Just bring me an energy bar, please.\"\nDiligent public servant Jung Bin had volunteered for duty tonight. It wasn't that there was overtime work or urgent tasks, but it was a customary practice at this time of the year.\n—We're almost there. In just 12 minutes, we'll be able to see the new rankings! I'm really curious about how the system has calculated the rankings.\nToday was the day all hunters eagerly awaited— the ranking update day. With one hand in his pocket and a paper cup in the other, Jung Bin bit down a couple of times on the edge of the cup.\nOnce a year, the system assigns rankings to all the awakened based on their abilities and achievements. New hunters and veteran hunters alike awaited the ranking update day. The new ranking served as proof of their abilities and influenced their chances of joining new guilds or getting new advertisements.\nHowever, there were often cases where hunters who didn't get their desired rankings caused disturbances, so the Awakened Management Bureau was on high alert during this period. The two anchors on the screen pointed at the data.\n—While the exact calculation method of the system's ranking is not disclosed, it is understood that it considers not only the hunter's grade but also their activities throughout the year.\n—That's why an A-grade awakened can be ranked higher than an S-grade. There have been many hunters who emerged like comets and showed remarkable activities over the past year. This year's rankings could see significant changes.\n—Nevertheless, experts predict that there will be no major changes within the top 20. Let's look at the expected rankings.\n1. Lee Sa-young (S)\n2. Matthew – Mok Tae-oh (S)\n3. Jung Bin (S)\n4. Gyu-gyu – Ban Gyu-min (S)\n5. Honeybee – Yoo Chae-hyun (A)\n6. Doctor – Nam Woo-jin (A)\n7. I Am An Artisan – Hong Ye-seong (S)\n8. Ham Seok-jeong (A)\n9. Song Jo-heon (S)\n10. Shield Guy – Bae Won-woo (A)\n.\n.\n.\n—Oh, the expected rankings are... the same as the current rankings. They predict no changes at all?\n—Yes, that's right. It has been like this for the past two years as well.\n'Familiar faces.'\n\"Team Leader, here you go.\"\n\"Ah, thank you.\"\nJung Bin and the team members started eating their energy bars while standing in front of the monitor. After checking the expected rankings, the team member asked,\n\"Do you think the rankings will stay the same, Team Leader?\"\n\"Hmm... Yes.\"\nFor the past two years, the top 10 rankings hadn't changed. The higher-ranked hunters were more active, meaning their innate abilities had a greater impact, so as the panelists said, there would likely be no change in rankings this year.\nThe real shift happens in the mid-tier rankings. Everyone thought so, and Jung Bin agreed.\n\"Unless Honeybee obtains an S-grade weapon, it seems the rankings will stay the same this year.\"\nJust as he finished folding the empty packaging into a note, there was a pop, like a firecracker going off in the air. Startled, Jung Bin looked up at the suddenly appearing white screen.\n[RANKING CHANGE!]\n[Would you like to check it right now?]\nIt was a sound he hadn't heard in nearly two years. The alert sound only played when there was a change in the rankings. Upon checking the new rankings, a slight crack appeared on Jung Bin's face.\nRank 4. He had been 2nd even when J was around. After J's death, he briefly rose to 1st, but with Lee Sa-young's arrival, he was pushed back to 2nd. The \"eternal second place\" title bothered him, but with the emergence of another S-grade, Matthew, he was pushed down another spot.\nAnd now, he was pushed down to 4th. There were only two possibilities for this change:\nA new 1st or 2nd place emerged, or the existing 1st and 2nd places died. Either scenario would have significant repercussions. And soon, Jung Bin faced an entirely unexpected third situation.\n[Region: South Korea]\n1. J\n2. Lee Sa-young ▼1\n3. Matthew ▼1\n4. Jung Bin ▼1\n5. Gyu-gyu ▼1\n6. Honeybee ▼1\n7. Doctor ▼1\n8. I Am An Artisan ▼1\n9. Ham Seok-jeong ▼1\n10. Song Jo-heon ▼1\n11. Shield Guy ▼1\nEveryone dropped one rank in the expected ranking, with the new 1st place being...\nA name everyone knew, J.\nIt had been eight years since that day, but his name could still be heard everywhere— in documentaries about the West Sea rift, in history books about the Day of the Rift, and even in childish internet arguments about who the world's strongest was.\nHe was believed to have died in the West Sea rift eight years ago. No one saw his body, but the rift closed, and his name disappeared from the hunter rankings. Since a closed rift never reopened, everyone assumed he was dead.\nBut now, J suddenly reappeared in the rankings.\nWhat this meant was...\n—Oh? Wait, what is this!\n—Hold on. The 1st place...\n—Has the 1st place changed?\n—J?\nJ was alive.\nAnd he was likely still in the West Sea rift.\n'In the worst-case scenario... the West Sea rift might have reappeared.'\nThe smile vanished from Jung Bin's face. The team member, having checked the rankings, stuttered.\n\"T-T-Team Leader.\"\nJung Bin grabbed the suit jacket hanging on the chair and strode toward the door. The team member hastily followed.\n\"No, Team Leader! This... Did I see it right?\"\n\"How many people can move right now?\"\n\"Uh, excluding those on standby at the scene... about ten in total.\"\n\"Leave the minimum personnel and have everyone head to Incheon. Also, mobilize all standby personnel.\"\n\"Incheon?\"\n\"Yes. To the West Sea rift.\"\n\"Understood!\"\n\"The Director will issue guidelines for media response. Those remaining should respond accordingly...\"\nBefore he could finish his instructions, his pager buzzed. He glanced to confirm understanding with a gesture and pressed the receive button.\n[Director Ham Seok-jeong]\nThe calm voice of a middle-aged woman flowed through the speaker.\n—Team Leader Jung.\n\"Yes, Director.\"\n—Thank you for working late. Did you see the rankings?\n\"I did. We're about to depart for Incheon.\"\n—Alright. I trust you know what to do.\n\"Yes. We will verify if the West Sea rift has reappeared, and if J and other hunters are still alive, we will conduct a search in the vicinity.\"\n—If J is not in the West Sea. And if the rift hasn't reopened...\nA brief silence followed. Ham Seok-jeong, the Director of the Awakened Management Bureau, spoke firmly.\n—Find him at all costs.\n\"Understood.\"\n—By any means necessary.\n***\nIncheon, in front of the memorial.\nJung Bin hurriedly fixed his tousled hair after jumping out of the helicopter. His target was the memorial.\nThere was already someone there, standing tall with a head much higher than others. Recognizing him from a distance wasn't difficult. Jung Bin paused for a moment to catch his breath and approached the dark figure.\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, hands in his pockets, stared intently at the top of the memorial. At a glance, he seemed calm, but Jung Bin sensed something.\n'He's really lost it.'\nThe sinister aura, whether not yet subdued or intentionally left unchecked, was palpable. It was so overwhelming that a weak person might faint. Jung Bin signaled to his team members to prevent anyone from approaching.\nThe team spread out seamlessly. No journalists or regular hunters should approach someone in this state. The oppressive pressure, sharp enough to tear a person apart, weighed down the air. Jung Bin stood three steps back, watching Lee Sa-young. Eventually, Lee Sa-young spoke.\n\"Rift?\"\nHe probably meant if they had come to check the rift. Jung Bin replied cautiously, not letting his guard down.\n\"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\"It's not open.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young pointed to the calm sea with a defiant chin gesture. Under the moonlight, the waves gently broke. His gaze remained fixed on the topmost letter on the memorial.\nOriginally, the West Sea rift was managed jointly by the Rift Management Bureau and the Awakened Management Bureau. It was too large and left too many scars to be handed over to a single guild. Besides, no guild would bid for it. After the disaster in the West Sea, who would want to keep a ticking time bomb?\nBut one day, Lee Sa-young suddenly demanded ownership of the West Sea rift in exchange for sharing the research results from the Pado Guild's research lab. The government, already seeing it as a headache, handed over the bomb without hesitation.\nSince then, Jung Bin had harbored a small question.\n'Why did Lee Sa-young take ownership of the West Sea rift?'\nAnd now. Why was Lee Sa-young here? Was it to check for anomalies in the guild's rift? Or was it because of the anger of losing the top spot to J?\n\"Once you confirm, go back and manage your hunters.\"\n\"...\"\nIt was a clear dismissal. The gas mask's gaze shifted slightly from the memorial to the empty air. He must be seeing the same thing as Jung Bin.\n+82 [CH.1]\"J has entered the chat\"\nJ had appeared on the channel.\nCould he be nearby? Having confirmed the safety of the rift, it was time to carry out the second mission. Just as he moved his finger slightly to give the command,\n\"Stop before I break your fingers.\"\nA languid voice murmured.\n\"Tell Ham Seok-jeong.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The ownership of the West Sea rift belongs to the Pado Guild.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young slowly turned to face Jung Bin. Ah, Jung Bin suddenly realized.\n\"Everything that comes out of the rift...\"\nLee Sa-young said,\n\"Is mine.\"\nFor this day...",

      "content": "Chapter 28: Things Not to Do at a Funeral\n[Remember This is for Recycling Sorting!]\nWhoosh. The faded laminated paper stuck with blue tape fluttered in the cold wind. A thick, bug-like figure squatted busily in the alley.\nWearing a thick padded jacket, a toad apron, rubber gloves, track pants, and three-striped slippers, Cha Eui-jae was peacefully sorting recyclables in his winter house look. As he removed the label from a PET bottle, Cha Eui-jae muttered like a complaint.\n\"Why is there always so much trash, no matter how much I throw away...\"\nHe gathered the labels and put them in a plastic bag, then stepped on the PET bottle to remove the air. This time, he picked up the sack full of soju bottles.\nBang!\nAt that moment, a sudden firecracker-like sound exploded from the empty air. Cha Eui-jae, thinking it was some kind of bad luck, looked up and was met with a familiar white screen.\n[Congratulations, J!]\n[You have become the new number 1 in 'Region: South Korea.']\n\"...What?\"\nThud. The heavy sack fell to the ground. An empty soju bottle rolled out of the sack and clattered across the asphalt.\n'What kind of bastard announces a number one rank while I'm sorting recyclables?'\nCha Eui-jae was so taken aback by the absurd system message that he didn't even think to question its validity.\nNumber one? Me? If there was someone to answer, Cha Eui-jae would have grabbed them by the collar and demanded an explanation. He couldn't understand why such news had suddenly intruded on what could have been an ordinary day.\nInstead of asking the system for information, Cha Eui-jae hastily opened an internet app on his phone. Fortunately or unfortunately, breaking news about the Hunter rankings was plastered all over the portal site's main page.\n[「Breaking News」South Korea's New Number 1, J]\n[「Breaking News」Unshakeable Number 1 Lee Sa-young Falls to 2nd, Overtaken by J.]\n[「Breaking News」Awakener Management Bureau: \"There cannot be duplicate Hunter names, no identical names.\"]\n[「Breaking News」Awakener Management Bureau: \"Possibility of system error exists, verification in progress.\"]\n[「Breaking News」Jung Bin Spotted Boarding a Helicopter... Heading to Incheon?]\nThe more he refreshed the page, the more articles popped up. The system, as if to be helpful, even displayed a new ranking window.\n1. J\n2. Lee Sa-young ▼1\n3. Matthew ▼1\n4. Jung Bin ▼1\n5. Gyu-gyu ▼1\n6. Honeybee ▼1\n7. Doctor ▼1\n8. I Am An Artisan ▼1\n9. Ham Seok-jeong ▼1\n10. Song Jo-heon ▼1\n11. Shield Guy ▼1\nEvery name except J had a blue down arrow next to it. Just looking at it was destructive.\n\"Shit.\"\nCha Eui-jae couldn't help but recall a photo he'd seen on an internet post a long time ago.\nLet's learn about things you shouldn't do at a funeral\nThat is...\n(Raising Hand Emoji)\nResurrection!\nSuddenly coming back to life would be shocking for everyone, right?\nSee you next time\nIndeed, Cha Eui-jae had unintentionally... committed the ultimate faux pas.\nJ. As embarrassing as it was to say with his own mouth, during his time as a Hunter, he saved countless people and was famous enough to be portrayed as a hero in children's educational comics who sacrificed himself alongside the rift.\nThat such a person would resurrect after 8 years? And immediately reclaim the top spot upon his return?\n'Of course, they'll be desperate to find me no matter what.\nHe could hear the sound of his peaceful, quiet life slowly slipping away. Cha Eui-jae finally realized. Oh, right. That firecracker sound he heard earlier wasn't anything else.\nIt was the sound of his small, precious, quiet life exploding...\nDenial of reality made him mechanically refresh the screen, and with each increased refresh count in the corner, his chest filled with anger. He grabbed an empty soju bottle from the sack and, holding the mouth, started gesturing angrily at the status window.\n\"Hey, what did I do to deserve being number one?\"\nIt made sense that he was number one in the past. J was strong and constantly sliced through all kinds of monsters. In terms of ability and achievements, he could confidently say he didn't fall short anywhere.\nBut Cha Eui-jae? After escaping the West Sea rift, all he did was clean, sort recyclables, do the dishes, make hangover soup, collect discount coupons, shop for groceries, take care of Park Ha-eun, donate to the West Sea rift Foundation, occasionally catch monsters that popped out while pretending to be an ordinary person and report them to the Rift Management Bureau. That was about it.\nIf he became number one just for doing that, then anyone could be number one.\n[A special reward for being number one is given.]\n[Claim]\n'Bring me a reject button.'\nCha Eui-jae searched for a reject button somewhere. However, there was no reject button, not even a small X mark. Instead, the system emphasized the 'Claim' text in red.\nDo you think I'll press that? Absolutely not. Cha Eui-jae intentionally looked away from the system. He planned to ignore it until it got tired and disappeared.\nBut the system, displaying a new window wherever he looked, this time provided different options instead of 'Claim.'\n[ some of the previously deleted authorities are being restored.]\n[Restoring authority...]\n[Access to South Korea Channel 1 has been recreated.]\n[Do you want to access South Korea Channel 1?]\n[Yes]\n[▷Yes]\nIt seemed to have increased the options in response to his opinion. The problem was that nothing had changed.\nThe Hunter Channel was a group messenger created by the system. It was a group messenger where they could share information, chat, and make announcements. Cha Eui-jae had always thought it was probably created because Hunters played solo too much.\nAnyway, the channel had access criteria to match users' levels, and Channel 1 was accessible only to those ranked from 1 to 50.\nIn other words, Channel 1 had Jung Bin, Honeybee, and Bae Won-woo hanging out there. Of course, Lee Sa-young as well.\n'Do you think I'll go there?'\nHe had tried to live quietly, but the world wouldn't leave him alone. Cha Eui-jae picked up the soju bottle that had rolled far away and separated the cap and the glass bottle.\n\"I'll never enter, so get rid of the window.\"\n[...]\nThe system didn't respond.\n'Finally, it's quiet.'\nCha Eui-jae let out a sigh of relief and began gathering the empty bottles and the sack on the ground.\n[!!Error!!]\n[Selection time has expired.]\n[You will be automatically connected to Channel 1.]\n\"What?\"\nCha Eui-jae was horrified. What the hell was this rude system saying now?\n+82 [CH.1]\"J has entered the chat\"\n'I'm fucked.'\nThis damn system didn't even have a nickname change function! Suddenly resurrected with the old name J and forcibly connected to Channel 1, Cha Eui-jae lost all will in an instant.\nEven if it was absurd, he couldn't help but laugh helplessly.\n\"Ha, haha.\"\nWhether the others knew his feelings or not, the temporarily frozen chat burst into a flurry of messages.\n.\n.\n.\n[50] Romantic Opener: Crazy\n[50] Romantic Opener: Wow\n[11] Shield Guy: Whoa\n[6] Honeybee: ?\n[6] Honeybee: Real?\n[34] A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi: Isn't this a system error?\n[50] Romantic Opener: No, wow\n[50] Romantic Opener: Truly legendary continuous updates ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n[8] I Am An Artisan: No way, haha\n[8] I Am An Artisan: This must be a hidden camera, haha\n[8] I Am An Artisan: System must be pranking us with this reaction, haha\n[8] I Am An Artisan: This must be some reality show, haha\n[8] I Am An Artisan: Like a hidden camera show, haha, got it\n[6] Honeybee: Escaping reality is wild\n[4] Jung Bin: Hong Ye-seong-ssi ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: I'll temporarily disconnect the WiFi in Jang-in Village.\n[4] Jung Bin: Please be careful not to leak any information.\n[8] I Am An Artisan: (Crying Emoji)\n[29] Marble Seller Boy: Isn't it possible someone else took the name?\n[43] Ddeun: There's no way it's the real J, right;;\n[4] Jung Bin: As you all know ^^; duplicate Hunter names are impossible.\n[4] Jung Bin: I understand this is very confusing.\n[4] Jung Bin: We are verifying it, so please wait a moment. ^^\n[29] Marble Seller Boy: In online games, they periodically release names of long inactive users...\n[15] No Nickname: But this isn't a game.\n[3] Matthew: Jung Bin.\n[3] Matthew: Could there be a possibility that the West Sea rift reopened...\nAt Matthew's cautious question, the chat window, which had been unreadably chaotic, froze. Cha Eui-jae also held his breath. If the West Sea rift had reopened, Cha Eui-jae had to go there.\nHe had to go back to that hell, find what he had left behind, and atone for his sins, as that was the price to be paid by the one who survived.\nCrash!\nCha Eui-jae blinked. The soju bottle in his hand had shattered into pieces. His neck felt cold for a moment. He must have been sweating without realizing it. After letting out a long sigh, Cha Eui-jae tried to dismiss the annoying system window and looked up...\n[2] Lee Sa-young: X\nCha Eui-jae saw the message from Lee Sa-young. He blinked slowly.\n[11] Shield Guy: Excuse me, J?\n[11] Shield Guy: hoxy... Could you send a message in the chat?\nEven in this situation, Bae Won-woo was persistently clueless.\n'Would you do it if you were me?'\nSomehow, the tension eased. His chaotic mind began to calm down a bit. Squatting on the ground, Cha Eui-jae decided to use the power of artificial intelligence as a last resort.\n\"Hi, Nexby, find a way to leave the Hunter Channel.\"\n—Searching for a way to leave the Hunter Channel.\n—No results found.\nDamn it.\n***\n\"Huh? Why is this thing not working?\"\nIn the hangover soup restaurant still crowded with hunters, one of them was fumbling with the remote control near the TV. No matter how much he pressed the buttons, the TV showed no signs of turning on. Scratching his head, he called out to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Hey, why isn't the TV working? Is it broken?\"\nCha Eui-jae replied while stacking a tray full of empty bowls.\n\"Yes. It was broken when I checked this morning. I'll call a repairman tomorrow.\"\nOf course, it was a blatant lie. The TV was perfectly fine. The cord was just unplugged.\n\"Man, I wanted to watch 110-Minute Debate while eating.\"\nAs the man muttered in disappointment, other hunters began to chime in one by one.\n\"Is that on today? Whether to send a rescue team or not?\"\n\"Oh, I wanted to watch that too.\"\n\"We'll just have to watch it on our phones.\"\n\"Can't we call a repairman now?\"\n\"It's evening, so they probably won't come.\"\nDisappointed voices echoed from various corners. But Cha Eui-jae pretended not to hear any of it. Everything was to prevent the catastrophe of watching this week's 110-Minute Debate together, which they so eagerly wanted to see.\nToday, a week after J's name appeared on the Hunter rankings, a special live broadcast of 110-Minute Debate was set to air with the subtitle;\n[J's Return: Should We Send a Rescue Team to the West Sea Rift?]\nNone of this reflected the opinion of the resurrected person himself, even a tiny bit, so Cha Eui-jae had unplugged the TV cord as soon as he woke up. He clenched his fist tightly.\n'I'll make sure they can't watch it.'",

      "content": "Chapter 29: Things Not to Do at a Funeral\nTitle: [Anonymous] If J is alive\nIf there is a rift in the West Sea, shouldn't we send a rescue team?\nHe might be alive but unable to move.\nMaybe his legs are cut off...\nComments (99+)\n—Are there really no other survivors?\n⤷ Yes, I compared the names on the memorial with the rankings, and J's name was newly added. It looks like only J survived.\n—Do you know what it's like inside the rift? Do you know how many hunters have died there?\n⤷ But are we just going to leave someone trapped in a rift?\n⤷ Ha... They went in to save people like this, huh? ㅋㅋ Humanity is doomed.\n⤷ Don't you remember when the West Sea rift was expanding rapidly? If we open it, the country could be doomed.\n⤷ Is it the same now as it was back then? How much has our power increased? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ this isn't the time when the entire nation had to risk their lives for one person, J.\n⤷ Does it make sense to use all that power just to save one J??\n—Nope~ you can't even open a closed rift, see ya.\nAt first, people didn't believe it. Even among the hunters, most thought it was just a temporary error that would soon be fixed. However, Channel 1, which had directly confirmed J's existence, remained silent, waiting for the official announcement from the Awakened Management Bureau.\n—It's a lie~\n—Sigh, why tell such lies?\n—Even if there's an error, how can there be such an error? ㅋㅋ.\n—The system can also break down sometimes.\n.\n.\n.\n—Why isn't the error being fixed?\n—Could it be?\nIt didn't take long for people to attach a question mark, half doubting, behind the word 'could it be.' Days passed without the rankings changing, and people grew anxious.\nAs all sorts of media outlets began to spread baseless rumors, treating them as facts, the Awakened Management Bureau hurried to control the confusion. The press conference was scheduled for 3 PM, so Cha Eui-jae put up a \"Ingredient Preparation Time\" sign to watch the press conference alone.\nWhen the time came, a woman appeared on the screen, dressed neatly in a short haircut and a smart suit, holding a cane. Apart from her pale complexion, she looked similar to how Cha Eui-jae remembered. She was Ham Seok-jeong, the head of the Awakened Management Bureau, who had avoided public appearances due to health reasons.\nAfter a brief greeting, she spoke firmly.\n—This ranking update is not a system error.\nShe took a moment to catch her breath before continuing.\n—It's not a case of name duplication either. No one else has taken J's name... It's hard to believe, but according to our internal investigation, J is currently alive.\nThe murmuring and the sound of camera flashes grew louder. Journalists raised their hands one after another.\n—How can you be so sure?\n—Are there no other survivors besides J?\n—Eight years ago, the Awakened Management Bureau confirmed the death of the hunters who entered the West Sea rift. Why is the story changing now?\n—If J is alive, where is he now?\nDespite the barrage of questions, Ham Seok-Jeong raised her hand slightly to call for attention and responded calmly.\n—We are planning to dispatch a rescue team for a more accurate assessment of the situation. Please wait a little longer.\nHam Seok-Jeong and the hunters of the Awakened Management Bureau bowed.\nSeeing Ham Seok-Jeong's face, Cha Eui-jae suddenly realized that eight years had passed. The Ham Seok-Jeong in his memory was young and passionate, neither using a cane nor limping. When did she hurt her leg?\nAnd she...\n'How can she be so sure?'\nToday's press conference by the Awakened Management Bureau contradicted their previous statements. Given the attention, they couldn't have made such an announcement without irrefutable evidence.\nHam Seok-Jeong was that kind of person. Someone who moved only with undeniable proof and a clear justification, steady as a mountain. Cha Eui-jae stared at the still-bowing Ham Seok-Jeong for a while before turning off the TV.\nAfter the Awakened Management Bureau's press conference, the topic of J was everywhere in South Korea. It was incomparable to the previous special broadcast of \"110-Minute Debate.\"\nEvery day, breaking news and headlines were all about the West Sea Rift and J. Whether J should be rescued also split opinions sharply.\n'They fight over everything.'\nWhenever someone asked Cha Eui-jae what he thought about J's resurrection and rescue, he would brush it off with, 'Haha, I don't really know,' like a passive bystander— this had almost become his default response.\nBut all his attempts to avoid this topic eventually failed, because...\n[Why the whole world is shocked by J's incredible abilities, why Japan is furious, and why Americans are desperate to see J!]\nJ had taken over the trending videos on YouTube.\n***\nThe topics of conversation among the regular hunters at the hangover soup restaurant constantly changed, but the hot topic over the past few days was, of course, 'J.'\nIgnoring the tables, the hunters ate hangover soup and debated everything from J's survival to the state of the rift. Since all the participants were active hunters, various opinions emerged.\n\"Isn't it a system error? That seems the most likely.\"\n\"The Bureau said it wasn't in the press conference. They said J is alive.\"\n\"Then how are they so sure? Did they talk directly to the system or something?\"\n\"I don't know. But since Ham Seok-Jeong held the press conference herself, it must be certain.\"\n\"Anyway, there are some shady aspects to that place.\"\n\"Uncle, why are you saying that right in front of Jung Bin's autograph?\"\n\"Crap, when did this autograph get put here?\"\nThe most common but least credible theory was the system error theory.\nRankings are updated once a year, but usually, a hunter's name is immediately removed from the list upon death.\nSince people often checked the ranking to confirm life or death when contact was lost inside the rift, the accuracy of this system was guaranteed. So, people would suspect the system and then quickly dismiss the idea.\nThen, a new hunter, deftly chopping chili peppers, suggested an idea.\n\"Maybe he died and was recently resurrected?\"\n\"Is there an item that can revive dead people?\"\n\"With the world in this state, there could be one, right?\"\n\"Some healer might have saved him...\"\n\"Even Nam Woo-jin can't revive the dead.\"\n\"Maybe J had a unique resurrection item with an 8-year cooldown.\"\n\"This one sounds plausible.\"\n'What sounds plausible.'\nCha Eui-jae was fed up with hearing the resurrection after death theory.\nLogically, they were all dismissible nonsense, but J's return was bewildering enough. Naturally, not only at the hangover soup restaurant but also on the anonymous boards of the HunterNet, various theories emerged...\n—I'd rather believe a necromancer revived him ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n⤷ Is there a famous necromancer? Quick, find one.\n⤷ Necromancers have a ban on reviving humans, they'd never do it. ㅠㅠ\nSuch as the illegal necromancer revival theory,\n—He actually fought in another dimension for 8 years and returned, J the returnee.\n⤷ Seems like you read too many fantasy novels...\n⤷ Dude; since the Day of the Rift, fantasy novels = reality, didn't you know?\nThere were plenty of absurd theories like the returnee theory, but of course, no one got the right answer. The premise was wrong from the start. J had never died.\nAnd those debating the 'how' eventually realized that without J speaking up, no answers would come, and they moved on to another question.\nJ is alive. So where is he?\nThe last known sighting of J was in the West Sea rift. He clearly hadn't escaped, and people thought he had closed the rift and died inside. But the truth they had believed for eight years might not be the real truth.\n***\nIn the middle of the night.\nCha Eui-jae woke up suddenly. In the silence where even breathing couldn't be heard, he stayed still, holding his breath. His small room was quiet, but instinctively, he knew.\n'There's an intruder outside this room.'\nNo guest would come at this late hour. No matter how much someone craved hangover soup, they wouldn't break in through a locked door.\nThe only weapons were in the kitchen, and all he had was a sturdy body. As quietly and slowly as possible, he raised his upper body and clenched and unclenched his fists a few times. Fortunately, he was skilled in hand-to-hand combat.\n'Whoever this bastard is...'\nHe wanted to break every limb, but dealing with the aftermath would be a hassle. Breaking just enough to extract information before reporting would suffice.\nCha Eui-jae moved without a sound, opening the door to the small room and stepping onto the floor barefoot. After slipping out of the walls made of boxes, he saw the familiar hall. Dim streetlights faintly illuminated the dark restaurant, and in the middle,\nA figure in a gas mask was sitting.",

      "content": "Chapter 30: Things Not to Do at a Funeral\n...Why?\nCha Eui-jae stopped dead in his tracks, momentarily stunned at the sight of the dark figure trespassing in someone else's shop. How did that bastard open the closed door and get in, and why was he sitting in the middle of the hall as if staging a protest?\nThe number one, or rather, ex-number one hunter was committing all sorts of crimes, from obstructing business to trespassing. The gas mask-wearing figure, seated with legs crossed, slowly turned his head toward Cha Eui-jae. His eerie voice rumbled low.\n\"Did you sleep well?\"\nDespite the seemingly friendly question, his voice sounded like it came from the depths of hell. Waking someone up only to ask if they slept well— he had clearly given his conscience away to the dogs. Instead of answering, Cha Eui-jae countered with a question.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\nThough it was a reasonable question, the gas mask-wearing figure's aura became even more ominous. He seemed to be taking deep breaths to calm himself, but his purple eyes behind the lenses glinted fiercely as they stared at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"What am I doing?\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's what I should be asking you.\"\nCould it be... has he found out something about me? Given his past actions and information-gathering abilities, it wasn't an entirely unreasonable suspicion. Cha Eui-jae slowly clenched his fist, waiting for the next words to come out of his mouth.\n\"Why didn't you contact me first?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I waited two weeks, damn it.\"\nCha Eui-jae felt utterly deflated. Was that what this was about?\nJudging by the intense aura emanating from him, Cha Eui-jae guessed that Lee Sa-young was either angry or sulking like a child left out of something fun.\nThough it wasn't the right thing to think in front of someone who had been waiting for contact, to be honest, it wasn't that he hadn't contacted him—\n'I forgot...'\nCha Eui-jae had completely forgotten that he needed to respond to Lee Sa-young's business proposal.\nOf course, Cha Eui-jae had his reasons. The problem was they were reasons he couldn't tell anyone. In any case, if he were to be honest and say he forgot, the deal would surely fall apart. So, Cha Eui-jae offered the best excuse he could come up with.\n\"Well, I've been busy.\"\n\"Ha.\"\nLee Sa-young snorted, but Cha Eui-jae continued steadfastly.\n\"I've also been thinking it over.\"\n\"Oh, you actually thought about it.\"\nLee Sa-young sarcastically retorted, resting his chin on his hand as if challenging him to continue. Cha Eui-jae felt a sudden urge to give him a good smack on the head. Why was his nature so twisted?\nIn that moment, a thought suddenly flashed through Cha Eui-jae's mind.\nAh, maybe...\n'Because I took the number one spot from him?'\nThough that gas mask-wearing bastard seemed nonchalant, he had held the number one rank for six years in a row. Having his position taken overnight by someone thought to be dead must have been quite a shock.\nCha Eui-jae's gaze softened with pity. Lee Sa-young grumbled in irritation.\n\"Why are you looking at me like that?\"\n\"No, it's just... hang in there.\"\n\"Are you mocking me?\"\n\"Mocking? I'm being more sincere than ever.\"\n\"Ugh, whatever. I even shot a commercial because of you, and you left me hanging for two weeks. Do you know you're a real jerk?\"\nLee Sa-young waved his hand in disgust. But Cha Eui-jae also had his grievances about that public service announcement.\nThe so-called public service announcement that Lee Sa-young supposedly filmed because of Cha Eui-jae was inflicting mental agony on hunters who watched TV. Cha Eui-jae crossed his arms.\n\"What's with that commercial anyway? Why did you suddenly shoot it?\"\n\"Because you only like people who shoot commercials. What else could I do?\"\n\"What kind of nonsense is that?\"\n\"Jung Bin, Honeybee...\"\nCha Eui-jae couldn't keep up with Lee Sa-young's erratic train of thought.\nThe only commonality between Jung Bin and Honeybee was that he wanted to ban both of them from this shop. What was Lee Sa-young thinking when he did such a bizarre thing?\nLee Sa-young gestured towards the handwritten Honeybee poster.\n\"Is that your taste?\"\n\"Honeybee just gave it to me.\"\n\"And Jung Bin's autograph?\"\n\"He sent it by mail.\"\n\"Damn it, why not just sell that on Tomato Market?\"\nCha Eui-jae tightly shut his mouth and got up to head towards the water dispenser. As he moved, eyes followed him. The gaze was persistent and unrelenting.\nUnable to bear the staring, Cha Eui-jae finally turned around and asked, \"What?\"\nLee Sa-young pointed his chin at Cha Eui-jae's feet.\n\"Your feet.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Do you usually go around barefoot?\"\nOh, right. Only then did Cha Eui-jae look down at his feet. He had come out to ambush silently, but seeing Lee Sa-young sitting comfortably in the hall had made him lose the will to ambush, so he had been walking around the shop barefoot.\nWiggling his toes, Cha Eui-jae shamelessly replied.\n\"I didn't wear socks on purpose to wake myself up.\"\n\"You should at least wear slippers.\"\nLee Sa-young seemed somewhat displeased. Who did he think had made him run out barefoot in the middle of the night?\n\"If you've been thinking for two weeks, you must have an answer.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Let's make a deal. But I have a few conditions.\"\n\"Hold on.\"\nLee Sa-young took out a long, finger-length object from his inventory. It had a screen, buttons, and a blue magic stone embedded at the end. It was a magic stone recorder, something Cha Eui-jae had desperately tried to get, which had led to S-grade hunters flocking to Tomato Market and this restaurant.\n\"We should have solid evidence. It's better for both you and me.\"\n\"Recording, huh. What if the recording gets leaked?\"\n\"I'll use it only to draft the contract and then dispose of it immediately.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young showed off his gloved hand to Cha Eui-jae. He meant that he could melt the recorder like a ladle. For him, it was a disposable item.\nLee Sa-young pressed the button, and the recorder began to glow blue.\n\"Let's start.\"\nHe spoke as if familiar with such procedures. Cha Eui-jae nodded and raised a finger.\n\"First, no work during restaurant hours. Whatever you ask or demand, it has to be between 11 PM and 5 AM when the restaurant is closed.\"\n\"Aha.\"\nAfter a brief pause, Lee Sa-young nodded readily.\n\"Alright. What's the second?\"\n\"Help me register as a hunter.\"\n\"Huh? Didn't I tell you before?\"\nLee Sa-young, tapping his arm with his palm, tilted his head and spoke dryly.\n\"I need someone unknown.\"\n\"I know. Just listen.\"\nAlthough Cha Eui-jae had no intention of resuming his hunter activities, the situation had changed now that J's survival was known. It was better to create a completely new identity unconnected to J.\nPeople are looking for J. Even the Awakened Management Bureau will form search teams to find J.\nConsidering J is S-grade, being an unregistered awakener could lead to misunderstandings. It would be safer to disguise himself as a newly awakened hunter with no ties to J. That way, he would avoid detection.\nCha Eui-jae calmly continued.\n\"You'd agree that the scope of what we can do changes depending on whether I'm registered as a hunter.\"\n\"...\"\n\"My demand is for you to help me get the lowest possible rank.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If I'm E or D rank, no one will pay attention to me. I'll blend in.\"\nThe ranks for awakeners are from S to A, B, C, D, E, and F. The closer to F, the lower the awakening ability and physical ability, with F being just a bit stronger than an average person. Lee Sa-young slowly rubbed his gas mask's cheek.\n\"So... you want help to hide your true strength when registering?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"What else?\"\n\"Help my grandmother with her treatment.\"\n\"We talked about that last time. Anything else?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nLee Sa-young chuckled, pressing the recorder's button to stop it. The stone's glow gradually faded.\n\"Now it's my turn.\"\nHe took out a palm-sized dagger from his inventory and handed it to Cha Eui-jae. The blade was engraved with golden laurel leaves.\n[Laurel Branch of Contract (S)]\n[By drawing blood with this dagger, an unbreakable contract can be made.]\n[Curses upon the one who breaks the contract.]\n\"Do you want to stab yourself, or should I do it?\"\nWhat an absurd and crude statement. Was he serious? Cha Eui-jae couldn't hide his incredulous expression as he stared at Lee Sa-young.\n\"Of course I'll do it myself. Why would you stab my hand?\"\n\"Some people stab themselves in strange places. Someone even stabbed their thigh when I told them to cut their palm...\"\nCha Eui-jae squinted at him, wondering if he thought he looked like such an idiot. Did people like that really exist? Did they attempt self-harm during a contract?\nThough Cha Eui-jae thought it was ridiculous, Lee Sa-young's face was deadly serious. Lee Sa-young shrugged.\n\"It's more efficient if I do it. Less blood.\"\nEfficiency might end up killing someone at this rate. Lee Sa-young, despite his supposedly kind explanations, persisted as Cha Eui-jae refused to let go of the dagger.\n\"Don't worry, I'm good at stabbing. It won't hurt much. Just a little prick.\"\n\"Bullshit.\"\n\"If I do it, it won't hurt as much for you.\"\nIt was better to get this over with quickly. Cha Eui-jae deftly adjusted his grip on the dagger and asked,\n\"How much blood do you need?\"\n\"Just enough.\"\nWithout hesitation, Cha Eui-jae slashed his palm, allowing the crimson blood to drip down the thin line. Taking the dagger, Lee Sa-young asked,\n\"Do you have an antidote? Or any artifact for detoxification?\"\nAs if.\nCha Eui-jae glanced around the shabby hangover soup restaurant. Though he had a detoxification ability, there was no need to reveal all his cards to this dubious character in front of him.\nLee Sa-young placed a small glass bottle filled with a purplish liquid on the table. The liquid was thick and slimy, occasionally bubbling like a concoction from a witch's cauldron.\n\"That's my personal antidote.\"\n\"Your personal antidote?\"\n\"Can't have you dying on me during the contract. Drink it now.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae skeptically examined the bottle before reluctantly downing the antidote. Despite its appearance, the liquid went down surprisingly smoothly.\nLee Sa-young, now holding the dagger, spoke,\n\"I only have one condition.\"\nWithout hesitation, he slashed his palm. From the large wound, a dark liquid that barely resemble blood dripped down.\n\"Never betray me.\"\nWith his cold voice, the liquid burned through the table where it landed, leaving blackened, charred marks.",

      "content": "Chapter 31: Things Not to Do at a Funeral\nLee Sa-young grabbed Cha Eui-jae's hand tightly. The touch of their wounds felt like burning fire. It had been a while since he had felt pain.\nRed blood mixed with black blood and flowed down their wrists. Around their joined hands, golden vines blossomed. Something sharp and piercing burrowed into Cha Eui-jae's body, crawling up his arm and settling near his heart.\nAt the same time, a hot lump rose up from his diaphragm. Cha Eui-jae bit his lip, stifling a groan. It was hard to hold back the urge to retch.\n\"...Ugh.\"\n\"Hold on.\"\n[Trait: Basilisk's Venom (S+) activated.]\n'Wait.'\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened at the sudden system notification.\nHe had obtained the detoxification trait from capturing a basilisk in the West Sea Rift, but it had never actually activated before. It was a peculiar trait that didn't respond to weak poisons. So why now?\nCha Eui-jae coughed violently, unable to contain his bewilderment, and bright red blood spurted from his mouth. Amid the metallic taste of blood was a faint sweetness.\n'Ah, this bastard.'\n\"...Fuck, Hyung. What's going on?\"\nWhy are you swearing? I should be the one swearing. Cha Eui-jae struggled to keep his fading consciousness as he spat out blood between his teeth. He saw Lee Sa-young, who had frozen in shock.\n\"Hyung?\"\n'What kind of lunatic puts poison in someone's body?'\n\"Hyung, open your mouth quickly.\"\n'I told you I'd kill you if you messed with me...'\n\"Hurry!\"\nMuttering anxiously, Lee Sa-young shoved his gloved thumb into Cha Eui-jae's mouth. Instinctively, Cha Eui-jae bit down on Lee Sa-young's thumb. He wanted to bite it off with his teeth, but his head was too hot.\nCha Eui-jae glared at the white system screen that filled his vision, bloodshot eyes burning.\n'Why is an S+ grade trait so slow? Do you want me to die?'\n[Trait: Basilisk's Venom (S+) activated.]\n[Detoxifying.]\n[Trait: Basilisk's Venom (S+) activated.]\n[Detoxifying.]\n[Trait: Basilisk's Venom (S+) activated.]\n[Detoxifying.]\nThe system screen flickered as if protesting its innocence. It seemed to be trying to communicate that it was working hard, but Cha Eui-jae couldn't care less.\nHe disliked Lee Sa-young and the basilisk's venom both. What kind of bastard puts poison in someone's body? The antidote he was given seemed useless, so why make him drink it? What if he didn't have a detoxification trait?\nSoon, a cool liquid flowed down Lee Sa-young's thumb into Cha Eui-jae's mouth. The heat subsided little by little wherever the liquid touched. At the same time, a system notification appeared.\n[Detoxification complete.]\n[According to the effect of Basilisk's Venom (S+), you have gained resistance to the poison once detoxified.]\nGasping for breath, Cha Eui-jae tried to remember the last time he had coughed up so much blood. As the heat subsided and sensation returned to his fingertips, he realized one of his hands was still held by Lee Sa-young.\n\"Hyung.\"\nWith his free hand, Cha Eui-jae touched his forehead. As his vision cleared, he saw the gas mask staring intently at him.\n\"...Hyung.\"\nLee Sa-young called Cha Eui-jae again. Cha Eui-jae slowly calmed his breathing. Whether it was due to his trait working hard or the mysterious liquid Lee Sa-young had given him, his recovery was fast.\n'Alright, this much...'\nThere was still some lingering pain, but it was manageable.\nAs Lee Sa-young called him again, Cha Eui-jae was about to respond when the warm leather glove gently touched his cheek and jaw. The hand fumbled over his cheek before lifting his chin.\nThe black gas mask came into clearer view. Lee Sa-young whispered,\n\"Can you see me?\"\nOf course, he could see that black face clearly. Cha Eui-jae nodded quietly, his head fixed in place. Lee Sa-young muttered worriedly.\n\"Looks like you can hear too.\"\n\"...\"\n\"What about talking? If you can't, at least blink.\"\nNot trusting himself to speak without swearing, Cha Eui-jae blinked instead. He wasn't unable to speak, just choosing not to. He felt Lee Sa-young's grip on his cheek tighten slightly.\n\"...Did the poison damage your vocal cords?\"\n\"...\"\n\"What about other parts?\"\nWhat kind of poison does this guy have?\nCha Eui-jae couldn't believe what he was hearing. So, from what Lee Sa-young was saying, his poison could simultaneously damage vision, hearing, vocal cords, and internal organs? And it was strong enough to affect an S-grade Awakened?\n'Can a simple poison be this potent?'\n\"Cha Eui-jae.\"\nLee Sa-young's anxious voice interrupted his thoughts. A cautious hand touched the back of his neck. Cha Eui-jae suddenly wondered what kind of expression Lee Sa-young was making right now. So he reached out with his free hand to...\n\"...\"\n\"What are you—\"\nHe grabbed the gas mask hard.\nCrack. The front of the mask crumpled under his grip. As he twisted and yanked it off, a pale face appeared behind the torn mask. Wide, shocked violet eyes and slightly parted lips, with a few strands of hair stuck to his sweaty forehead.\n'Those eyelashes are really long.'\nLee Sa-young's face, usually indifferent, now filled with surprise and confusion, was quite satisfying. After examining Lee Sa-young's face to his heart's content, Cha Eui-jae tossed aside the remains of the mask. Then he removed Lee Sa-young's hand from his neck.\nRubbing the blood off his lips with the back of his hand, Cha Eui-jae spoke,\n\"I'm fine. My vocal cords aren't damaged.\"\n\"...\"\n\"This is the first time I've encountered such a strong poison... Do you have any conscience?\"\n\"...Shit.\"\nLee Sa-young's pretty face twisted into a scowl. He threw the torn mask to the floor and glared at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Why didn't you say anything? Are you joking?\"\n\"I kept quiet because I knew I'd start swearing at you if I spoke, why.\"\n\"...Damn it, really. So frustrating...\"\nLee Sa-young ran a hand through his hair irritably and turned away. Only then did Cha Eui-jae take a good look around.\nThe table, now stained with blood, was scorched in places, and the dagger he'd used to cut his palm lay discarded nearby, along with an unfamiliar bottle.\nCha Eui-jae picked up the bottle that had rolled close to him. As it wasn't an ordinary bottle, a system notification appeared.\n[Golden Tree Nectar (S)]\n[When consumed, it removes all status ailments and curses.]\n'...No way.'\nJust from the name, it was clearly something extraordinary.\nMost status ailment treatments specify the type and grade they can cure. An item that unconditionally removes all status ailments and curses was incredibly rare and valuable. And that precious item was now...\n[The bottle is now empty.]\n...Rolling empty on the table of a hangover soup restaurant.\nSo, the cool liquid he'd tasted must have been this. The crazy guy gave him a useless antidote and then put poison in him? Cha Eui-jae's anger at Lee Sa-young for that lessened a bit. Lee Sa-young had seemed quite shocked too, after all.\n'The nectar... What a waste.'\nIf he'd just waited a bit, his 'Basilisk's Venom' trait would have detoxified it on its own. Maybe he should have just mentioned his detoxification trait.\nCha Eui-jae, now holding an empty bottle, glanced sideways at Lee Sa-young, who was still turned away.\n\"...Hey, Lee Sa-young?\"\n\"...\"\n\"This nectar... Is it expensive?\"\n\"Say one more word.\"\nLee Sa-young growled, and Cha Eui-jae pursed his lips and watched his tone. Understandably, Lee Sa-young must have been upset. Asking about the price probably felt like rubbing salt in a wound.\nCha Eui-jae reflected on his actions. He had always been bad at consoling others. After some thought, he offered the safest response he could think of.\n\"Thanks, anyway.\"\n\"Ha.\"\n'Did I finally get it right?'\n\"Thanking someone who poisoned you. You're a saint...\"\n'You complain even when I thank you.'\nEven after a polite thank you, there was no praise in this modern society, just sarcasm. It was more frustrating than eating dry chicken breast without water...\nSeeing that continuing the conversation wouldn't yield any good, Cha Eui-jae carefully put down the empty nectar bottle and checked his palm. The wound from the dagger had already healed, but a faint golden chain-like scar lingered.\n'Looks like the contract was completed.'\nCha Eui-jae flexed his hand before addressing Lee Sa-young again.\n\"Now that the contract is done, how about finishing the explanation you started earlier?\"\n\"...\"\nFinally, Lee Sa-young turned back to him, his expression still slightly sullen. He slowly approached and sat across from Cha Eui-jae. After a moment of silence, he began to speak.\n\"There are people spreading drugs, and I'm looking for those people.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I mentioned this much, right?\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae nodded, Lee Sa-young continued slowly.\n\"The drugs are sold very cheaply. Easy to obtain anywhere. The easier they are to get, the quicker people get addicted, and the more they crave stronger doses.\"\nGenerally, Awakened individuals are more sensitive in every way compared to ordinary people. Their heightened senses mean more things to worry about. As a result, their lives are filled with more discomforts than joys.\nTo these awakened individuals, the stimulus of the drug was incredibly powerful. It was probably like a magical drug that eliminated the unpleasantness of everyday life and provided nothing but pure pleasure. It was understandable that they would fall for it, as it would be difficult to resist such a pleasure experienced for the first time in a long while.\n\"As they gradually increase their dosage, at some point, it won't be enough. That's when they seek out the suppliers themselves.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Most of the ones who get to that point have either undergone physical mutations or are on the verge of it. The suppliers take in those who come crawling to them.\"\n\"To where?\"\n\"To a laboratory.\"\nA chilling light passed over Lee Sa-young's face.\n\"The drugs are merely bait to gather test subjects.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 32: Things Not to Do at a Funeral\nA test subject? Cha Eui-jae slightly furrowed his brow at the unfamiliar term. No matter how suspicious the plan might be, the very fact that they chose awakened individuals as test subjects was puzzling.\nIt was obvious that it was much harder to attract or forcibly kidnap an awakened individual compared to a regular person. This meant there had to be something obtainable only from awakened individuals to make them worth the trouble of being used as test subjects. But even so, it seemed like an excessively laborious experiment. What were they trying to gain by going to such lengths?\nLee Sa-young, observing Cha Eui-jae's pensive face, spoke in a casual tone.\n\"Do you know how people awaken?\"\n\"Being chosen by the system, right?\"\nCha Eui-jae recalled the day the system appeared. Some scenes bring back other senses along with them. It could be the sounds heard, the smells, or the tactile sensations felt at the time. For Cha Eui-jae, the Day of the Rift was a memory that encompassed all of these.\nIn the chaos where everything was breaking and collapsing, Cha Eui-jae was crouched in the ruins of a building, clutching the bodies of his parents. The acrid smell of gunpowder and the stench of blood mixed into a foul odor. The cold, lifeless bodies. The sound of a monster's footsteps echoing through the ruins.\nLee Sa-young nodded.\n\"That's right. So, what criteria does the system use to choose the awakened?\"\nAs Lee Sa-young touched the glass with his finger, the black blood pooled and formed into shapes of a person and a monster. The black monster pounced on the small black person.\n\"The system,\"\nA square window appeared above the small black person's head.\n\"responds to a desperate wish.\"\n'I want to live.'\n'I don't want to die.'\nThe small black person also lunged at the monster without dodging. After a long struggle, the monster returned to black blood.\n\"When a human has a desperate wish, the system is drawn to that energy and finds the human.\"\n\"...\"\n\"This is common knowledge. That's why people caught in the rift have a higher chance of awakening than regular people. Because praying not to die is also a form of a wish.\"\nCha Eui-jae silently watched the lone black figure. Lee Sa-young moved his finger, and the black person turned into a small puddle.\n\"But there are people dissatisfied with this fact.\"\nCha Eui-jae slowly raised his head to meet Lee Sa-young's gaze.\n\"Do you understand what I'm saying?\"\nCurrently, the system is an absolute, omnipotent entity. Most people live by accepting this, but those who feel the system's selection is unfair would think differently. Perhaps they believe humans should be able to awaken their abilities on their own.\nReading the increasingly serious expression on Cha Eui-jae's face, Lee Sa-young propped his chin up and asked,\n\"Do you think it's possible that said-people are the same group as the drug dealers?\"\n\"Well, think more about it.\"\nLee Sa-young spoke with a hint of playful mischief in his voice.\n\"Do you think I told you all this just to ask that?\"\nFor a moment, Cha Eui-jae contemplated grabbing the nearby table and teaching this guy some manners, but he restrained himself given the situation. Lee Sa-young, despite his questioning, didn't seem impatient, allowing Cha Eui-jae to delve deeper into thought.\n\"You mentioned dissatisfaction with the system's choice.\"\nIf, as he suspected, there were unknown individuals who wanted humans to awaken their abilities independently and were selling drugs to achieve this, and if they were using the drugs as bait to gather awakened individuals as test subjects...\n\"They're doing all this to create artificial awakened beings?\"\n\"Correct.\"\nThis time, Lee Sa-young answered straightforwardly. Cha Eui-jae felt his skin prickling as if his hair was standing on end.\nCreating awakened beings not subject to the system's whims, solely through human effort. It seemed like a plausible claim on the surface, but Cha Eui-jae had a gut feeling that there was a darker motive behind it.\nAnd it was drugs. Drugs that, when addicted, explosively increased aggression, caused loss of reason, and ultimately led to death with human dignity desecrated. The purpose of those feeding such drugs to the awakened for experimentation couldn't be normal.\n\"Assuming they create artificial awakened beings, what then?\"\nWhat would they do with these awakened individuals? When Cha Eui-jae asked this while crossing his arms, Lee Sa-young shrugged.\n\"I don't remember well. Something about preventing the apocalypse, I think.\"\n\"The apocalypse?\"\n\"I didn't listen to their nonsense in detail.\"\nThe term 'apocalypse' brought back memories of people claiming the end was near right after the Day of the Rift. But that was already 11 years ago. In this era, where people could predict when and where a gate would open, were there still such people left?\nIt seemed Lee Sa-young wasn't lying about not listening carefully, as he looked uninterested.\n\"Anyway, there's nothing to ask of you right now.\"\nLee Sa-young put the forlorn dagger and the empty holy water bottle into his inventory. He then stood up, fiddling with his clothes as if he were about to leave.\n\"Let's first take care of the Awakened registration. I'll send someone over to you tomorrow.\"\n\"Alright. Oh, and one more thing.\"\nRaising an eyebrow as if to ask what else, Cha Eui-jae pointed to the blackened table.\n\"Take care of the table before you go.\"\n\"...\"\nHe couldn't very well seat customers at a table that had been melted by poison. Lee Sa-young's purple eyes looked at Cha Eui-jae as if to ask, \"Are you serious?\" but Cha Eui-jae stubbornly pointed at the table, wearing an expression that said, \"What's taking you so long?\"\nThey say beautiful people leave behind beautiful spaces, but with Lee Sa-young's temperament being anything but beautiful, he should at least live up to his handsome face. In the end, Lee Sa-young grudgingly put the damaged table into his inventory before leaving.\nEven after Lee Sa-young left, the hangover soup restaurant bustled with customers having their early morning meals before heading to work. Among them was Bae Won-woo.\nYawning loudly as he arrived at his second job, the hangover soup restaurant, Bae Won-woo blinked for a moment, standing by the entrance. The place seemed emptier than usual.\n\"Huh? Isn't there one less table?\"\n\"Oh? You're right.\"\nAnother Hunter, passing by, glanced around and nodded in agreement, noting Bae Won-woo's sharp observation.\n\"No wonder it looks a bit empty. Hey, where did the table that was here go?\"\n\"...\"\n'They only have sharp eyes for these things. If only they were like this all the time.'\nHunters were usually slow on the uptake when needed but had sharp eyes for trivial matters. Cha Eui-jae, looking wistfully at the empty center of the restaurant, replied,\n\"The table legs seemed about to break... so I put it away for now.\"\nWorking at a hangover soup restaurant honed one's skill at lying. But the Hunters saw Cha Eui-jae's wistful face and sensed there was more to the story. As they began to speculate, one Hunter cautiously asked,\n\"Did some bastard Hunter break the table?\"\nYes, the former ranking No. 1 did. Though Cha Eui-jae didn't answer, his melancholic face was as good as an affirmation. Enraged, the Hunter almost slammed the table but quickly diverted his hand to his thigh, not wanting to stoop to the level of the suspected table-breaking bastard.\n\"Damn it, that's why Hunter abuse is a societal problem.\"\n\"Who did it? Do they know how fragile our hangover soup tables are?\"\n\"We're already short on tables!\"\n\"Just give us the initials, and we'll take care of it.\"\nA barrage of criticism rained down on whoever had dared to mess with their beloved hangover soup restaurant. The last remark came from Bae Won-woo.\n'How could you handle Lee Sa-young?'\nInstead of retaliating, Lee Sa-young would likely strip Bae Won-woo down to his bones. Cha Eui-jae's sorrow deepened. While Bae Won-woo's gallant attempt to cheer him up was appreciated, it only made things worse. Especially today, having coughed up blood earlier, Cha Eui-jae's complexion was paler, and his sadness was doubled.\nThe Hunters, noticing this, began to comfort Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Don't be sad, part-timer.\"\n\"We'll ask our guild artisan to make a damn sturdy table.\"\n\"Let's replace all the tables and chairs while we're at it. We'll pool the money.\"\nTheir concern for the restaurant was touching. Or perhaps it was fear of fiercer seat competition. Cha Eui-jae smiled and declined their generous offers.\n\"Haha... it's not necessary.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 33: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\n2:40 PM the next day. Cha Eui-jae was making the most of the broth-boiling time to clean the store, with a sign that read \"Ingredient Preparation Time\" hanging up.\nA man in a suit approached the store and knocked on the iron door. Despite the sign indicating that ingredients were being prepared, he knocked anyway. Cha Eui-jae tightened his grip on the broom he was holding, but a voice suddenly flashed through his mind.\n\"I'll send someone over to you tomorrow.\"\nCha Eui-jae slightly loosened his grip on the broom and opened the door. The man in sunglasses bowed slightly upon seeing Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Hello, nice to meet you. Are you Cha Eui-jae-ssi?\"\n\"Yes, that's me.\"\n\"Hello, I am 'A Small Miracle' Seo Min-gi. Guild Leader Lee Sa-young sent me.\"\n'A Small Miracle' Seo Min-gi. It was such a long and strange name that, although I had only briefly seen it on the 1st Hunter Channel, it remained clearly in my memory. However, it wasn't polite to mention someone's unusual name upon first meeting, so Cha Eui-jae also bowed slightly.\n\"Hello.\"\n\"Yes, please accept my business card first.\"\nSeo Min-gi politely handed over his business card with both hands. Cha Eui-jae, who had placed the broom under his arm, also politely received the small rectangular piece of paper. Pado Guild Combat Support Team 1, 'A Small Miracle' Seo Min-gi.\n\"Today, I will assist you with the ability measurement and registration process. Just a moment.\"\nSeo Min-gi took out a tablet from his inventory and showed the screen.\n[Operation Get a Low Rating!]\nThe explosive background image and the title written in red Gothic font immediately caught Cha Eui-jae's attention. Cha Eui-jae's expression became odd upon seeing the bizarre design template, but Seo Min-gi had a very serious face.\n\"The goal is to get a low rating without standing out, correct?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh, you don't have to answer verbally. Just answer this survey with sincerity.\"\nAs Seo Min-gi flipped the screen, a survey appeared. Cha Eui-jae began answering the survey with the tablet pen that Seo Min-gi had handed over.\n[1. What rating would you like to receive upon Awakened registration? Please specify between S and F.]\nHe needed to receive a low and common rating. This was the condition Cha Eui-jae had proposed when accepting Lee Sa-young's offer, so he tapped the pen on his lips, contemplating for a moment.\nReceiving an F-grade would be too unrealistic given his true S-grade abilities, and he thought it would bring about too many explanations, just like when he was hiding as a non-awakened person. It's not as if an F-grade could kill monsters with bare hands by sheer luck.\nWith a serious face, he wrote down;\nE, D\n[2. What is your system rank? If you don't want to reveal it, please choose one of the following options. (F~C: Weak. B~S: Strong.)]\nThe question showed consideration and detail. It perfectly grasped what the customer wanted to achieve through the rank manipulation. On the other hand, it was so on point that it made him wonder if they had done this kind of deal with others before.\nStrong\nWithout much hesitation, Cha Eui-jae wrote the answer as per the example and looked down to check the final question.\n[3. Do you agree to use drugs and curses to manipulate your rank?]\nWait. Something seemed off about this question. After filling in the previous questions diligently, Cha Eui-jae raised his hand to call Seo Min-gi.\n\"Excuse me, 'A Small Miracle' Seo Min-gi.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"The third question seems a bit strange.\"\n\"Excuse me? Just a moment.\"\nSeo Min-gi craned his neck to check the screen and tilted his head.\n\"The third question is standard. Is there an issue with it?\"\n\"It mentions using drugs and curses. Is that correct?\"\n\"Yes. In order to hide your abilities, you'll need to go that far.\"\nIs this guy a fraud? Cha Eui-jae was ready to smack Seo Min-gi's head with the tablet if necessary. Sensing Cha Eui-jae's hostility, Seo Min-gi took a step back.\n\"Sir, do you know how the ability measurement process works for Awakened registration?\"\nCha Eui-jae knew the method from eight years ago, but he wasn't aware of the latest methods. Just like the price of magic stones had risen, the measuring methods must have changed. Having had a bad experience before, he shook his head instead of pretending to know. Seo Min-gi seemed to have been waiting for this and began explaining.\n\"First, you fill out a form by hand. Then, you measure your abilities with a device developed by the Management Bureau. The grade assignment process includes a demonstration of a representative skill.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Handwriting can include a few lies, which we recommend. For the representative skill, you just show one skill. Neither is that important. The most important thing is the measuring device.\"\n\"The measuring device?\"\n\"Yes. It's quite accurate, so hiding your grade from the officials is more challenging than deceiving the machine. However!\"\nSeo Min-gi confidently raised his index finger.\n\"The measuring device uses magic stones as its energy source. It doesn't react to ordinary people, only to awakened ones. In other words, it operates according to the system's rules, separate from our scientific knowledge.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So we follow the system's rules to trick the device. We use substances or curses from dungeons that lower an awakened person's grade.\"\nSeo Min-gi looked satisfied, as if asking what he thought of his argument.\n'Why does that sound convincing?'\nUpon hearing it, Cha Eui-jae also thought it made sense. Anyway, most drugs or curses wouldn't significantly harm his body, so it seemed like something he could endure with a bit of resolve. With only his sturdy body to rely on, he needed to make the most of it.\nCha Eui-jae, as if mesmerized, properly gripped the pen and wrote his answer to the last question.\n[3. Do you agree to use drugs and curses to manipulate your rank?]\nYes\nSeo Min-gi, satisfied, took back the tablet and spoke.\n\"Alright then... Oh, did you bring your ID card?\"\nLuckily, he had reissued his ID card after emerging from the rift. Cha Eui-jae pointed inside the store.\n\"It's in my wallet.\"\n\"Please grab it and join me in the car. Let's get going quickly.\"\nHe pointed to a blue cargo truck. Its appearance matched the alley so well that Cha Eui-jae couldn't imagine that was the vehicle they had brought. Cha Eui-jae alternated glances between Seo Min-gi in his neat suit and the dusty cargo truck.\n'Does the Pado Guild not have money?'\n\"You're not mistakenly thinking our guild is poor, are you?\"\nDoes this guy have mind-reading abilities? Cha Eui-jae quickly averted his gaze and shook his head.\n\"No, I didn't think that.\"\n\"Haha, I believe you didn't, but just for reference, this is a guild vehicle used for undercover operations.\"\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\"Why do you sound so unenthusiastic?\"\nAfter fetching his wallet from the counter, Cha Eui-jae went into the kitchen to check the boiling broth. He needed to skim off the foam a bit later, but if he left it on low heat, it should be fine as long as he returned in time. Cha Eui-jae skimmed off the foam, reduced the heat, and hung up his apron.\nCha Eui-jae, who had grabbed his wallet, climbed into the passenger seat, and Seo Min-gi mimed fastening the seatbelt. After confirming the seatbelt was fastened, Seo Min-gi started the engine.\n\"We won't go to the official registration center at the Awakened Management Bureau, but to a temporary registration center in Gwangjin-gu. It's faster, less conspicuous, and doesn't have strong awakeners.\"\n\"Wouldn't a newly opened place be more vigilant?\"\n\"That was true right after it opened, but the Gwangjin-gu center has been open for three months now, so it's a bit more relaxed. They're even more lenient now since the main building is almost complete.\"\nSeo Min-gi glanced at Cha Eui-jae and gestured toward a black box next to him.\n\"Do you see that black box next to you?\"\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\"There should be a pair of bracelets inside. Could you put them on?\"\nInside the box were two silver bracelets in the shape of a snake biting its own tail. As Cha Eui-jae took out the bracelets, item information appeared.\n[Shackles of Ouroboros (A)]\n[When one person wears a pair, it casts a weakening curse on the wearer.]\nIs this why they mentioned drugs and curses in the survey? Holding the suddenly presented cursed item, Cha Eui-jae spoke reluctantly.\n\"It's a weakening curse... item.\"\nSeo Min-gi nodded sincerely.\n\"Yes. To lower your rank, using a weakening curse item is the quickest and easiest method.\"\n\"Can this curse be lifted?\"\n\"Of course. We have the curse removal scroll ready, so don't worry. We'll remove it right after the measurement.\"\nIt was tough to lie systematically. Cha Eui-jae put both bracelets on his left wrist. His whole body felt heavier, like he was wearing a sandbag centered around his left arm.\n\"How does it feel?\"\n\"I do feel a bit heavier. But...\"\nCha Eui-jae touched the rattling bracelet on his wrist.\n\"Won't they notice if I use something like this to fake my grade? It seems like they could easily catch it.\"\nSeo Min-gi shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Ah, it's fine. They do inspect worn items, but that's only for hunters who are being re-evaluated.\"\n\"...\"\n\"When a newly awakened person is being assessed, they don't check items. They don't even think to do it. How could someone who hasn't even registered as a hunter get their hands on items? Unregistered individuals can't use the hunter market, after all. Besides,\"\nSeo Min-gi said this as he leisurely made a left turn.\n\"Everyone wants to receive a higher grade, not a lower one.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ah, I'm not trying to single you out, sir.\"\nWhy bother saying that? Cha Eui-jae glanced at his profile briefly, feeling a bit uncomfortable, but he quickly accepted it since it wasn't wrong. The bracelets on his wrist clinked and rattled as they shook.",

If not, you might need to drink the weakening potion too.\"\nCha Eui-jae moved his limbs slightly, assessing his own physical condition. It was far from sufficient. Even getting a B-grade would be a blessing at this rate. Cha Eui-jae shook his head.\n\"I think it's still not enough.\"\n\"That's what I thought. Just a moment.\"\nCoincidentally, the light was red. Seo Min-gi took out a large cardboard box from his inventory and handed it over. When Cha Eui-jae opened the lid, there were ten glass bottles neatly lined up, filled with a hazy liquid.\n\"These are A-grade weakening potions. They're masterpieces made overnight by the potion makers of the Pado Guild.\"\n\"...Really?\"\n\"Yes. The guild leader promised a 300% bonus, so everyone volunteered for overtime.\"\nWhat a waste of money. But that thought was fleeting.\n'It's not my money anyway.'\nWith a considerably lighter expression, he took out one of the bottles and held it up to the light. Seo Min-gi muttered with a determined look on his face.\n\"They're meant to be applied to weapons originally... but drinking them shouldn't cause any major issues. We conducted a perfect biological test yesterday.\"\nCha Eui-jae's head stiffened as he scrutinized the opaque liquid. Who on earth did they test it on? Cha Eui-jae glanced suspiciously at Seo Min-gi for a moment, then opened the lid and drank the potion without hesitation.\nHowever, the sensation that came over Cha Eui-jae's body was somewhat different from what Seo Min-gi described.\n'It doesn't seem any different.'\nUnlike the bracelet, which showed immediate effects, the potion didn't seem to cause any change. For something created from ominous biological tests, it felt too anticlimactic. With a perplexed expression, Cha Eui-jae opened a second bottle.\n\"How do you feel?\"\nWithout answering, Eui-jae drank the second bottle. But his condition remained unchanged.\n'There's really no difference?'\nSeo Min-gi cautiously asked.\n\"If it's not too much trouble, could you let me know? If you feel unwell, you should take the antidote immediately.\"\n\"Seo Min-gi.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Does it take time for the effect to show up?\"\n\"No. According to our tests, the effect is immediate upon consumption. The potion is so well-made that even one bottle can lower physical abilities and rank. We even got a system warning.\"\nThe story was getting stranger. Did he test it on himself? Cha Eui-jae kept inspecting the empty bottle and asked again and again to confirm.\n\"You said it triggers a system warning?\"\n\"Yes. Why do you ask?\"\nCha Eui-jae opened the third bottle without saying anything. By now, Seo Min-gi had noticed something was off. Drumming his fingers on the steering wheel, he asked,\n\"Um, just in case. I mean, it's unlikely, but just in case.\"\n\"Is it having no effect at all?\"\nGulp.\nDespite drinking three bottles, Cha Eui-jae felt no change. Seo Min-gi was almost in tears at this point. Why wasn't it working? After a moment of contemplation, Cha Eui-jae suddenly looked up.\n\"Seo Min-gi.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Is the weakening potion treated as a poison by the system?\"\n\"Ah, yes. Our guild leader drank it yesterday too, but since he's immune to most poisons, the weakening potion had no effect... oh...\"\nSeo Min-gi's eyes began to tremble violently. Cha Eui-jae quietly closed the box lid. It seemed like the Basilisk's Venom trait was neutralizing the weakening potion as soon as he drank it. It was likely that the system didn't even deem it worth showing a notification.\n\"Are you resistant to poisons, sir? I was told to be very cautious since you're supposed to be highly susceptible to them...\"\nSeo Min-gi muttered nervously, almost talking to himself.\n\"Excuse me.\"\n\"Yes? Yes, sir?\"\n\"Is there any other way to lower my rank?\"\nSeo Min-gi, deep in thought with his head down, suddenly looked up.\n\"...What if we go to the Hunter Market now and buy all the weakening curse items with the corporate card? I've always wanted to splurge like that once in my life.\"\n\"Rejected.\"\n\"...I thought so. Word would get out immediately.\"\nSeo Min-gi sighed deeply, looking gloomy.\n\"I'm truly sorry, but we hadn't predicted this at all... Yes, right now, the bracelet is all we have.\"\nThe atmosphere in the van grew tense. Seo Min-gi, seemingly shocked that his plan had failed, kept muttering with a vacant look.\nCha Eui-jae felt a bit lost too, but seeing the person next to him overly depressed, he decided to try small talk he learned while working at the hangover soup restaurant.\n\"Are you Buddhist?\"\n\"Uh, no? I'm non-religious.\"\nThen what about that rosary hanging from the rearview mirror? Cha Eui-jae almost asked but held back, just rubbing his nose slightly. However, his trained conversation skills wouldn't falter here.\n\"I saw the rosary.\"\nSeo Min-gi, only then realizing what it was, nodded with a small exclamation.\n\"I bought it for twenty thousand won at the souvenir shop in Bulguksa Temple. For the sake of realism. Doesn't it suit this vehicle perfectly?\"\nRealism, huh. Is that something a guy in a suit driving a van should say? Cha Eui-jae's eyes grew cold, but luckily, the small talk seemed to have worked. Seo Min-gi, a bit more animated, muttered excitedly.\n\"If I look Buddhist enough, it means it served its purpose. I'm glad I bought it and hung it up.\"\n\"Ah, yes.\"\nCha Eui-jae half-listened to Seo Min-gi's rapid speech and opened the glove compartment. Inside, it was filled with crude massage devices, foot massagers, and foldable fans. Taking out a fan and opening it, he was greeted by an image of Buddha with a serene smile amidst lotus flowers. Cha Eui-jae closed the glove compartment with a bang.\n'Did this guy just get conned?'\nWhile Cha Eui-jae's trust in Seo Min-gi plummeted, the van steadily made its way to the registration center. Seo Min-gi parked in a paid lot near the center.\nThe temporary registration center was a large container placed in the town hall parking lot. At the entrance stood life-sized cutouts of Jung Bin with a thumbs-up and Lee Sa-young with folded arms wearing a gas mask. A banner hung above the door.\n[We support your Awakened registration! —Awakened Management Bureau]\nIt was an intimidating sight, as if meant to demoralize visitors. Lee Sa-young's cutout seemed more polished, probably put up after the public service announcement. Seo Min-gi averted his gaze, perhaps to avoid looking at his superior's cutout.\n\"Although we've arrived, sir, I think the weakening effect of just the bracelet might not be enough for a D-grade. What if we make a strategic retreat and come back later?\"\n\"When?\"\n\"...I have an overseas business trip scheduled, so it will be in about three weeks.\"\nAre you serious? Cha Eui-jae glared coldly, needing to register as soon as possible to establish an alibi. Seo Min-gi bowed his head apologetically.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Any other options?\"\n\"...Honestly, today is the best time. This container is only operating until the main building construction is complete... By the time I get back from the trip, it'll probably be...\"\n\"So if we're going to rob an empty house, today is the day?\"\n\"Your choice of words is alarming but yes, that's correct. And the bracelet too.\"\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his wrist. Seo Min-gi spoke sorrowfully.\n\"If you don't get tested today, you'll have to stay like this until the next test. It's actually a one-time use.\"\nLiving under a weakening curse permanently didn't bother him much. However, Cha Eui-jae sensed Seo Min-gi's underlying message.\n\"You want me to just go and get tested now.\"\n\"Honestly, yes.\"\n\"But you just suggested a strategic retreat.\"\n\"That was out of politeness.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I believe in you, sir. You can do it.\"\nSeo Min-gi clasped his hands in support. Cha Eui-jae was exasperated. What made this guy so optimistic? Seo Min-gi muttered resolutely again.\n\"Don't worry too much. If the worst comes to worst, we'll use the last resort.\"\n'Just get me that D-grade without any drastic measures.'\n\"Come on, don't be stressed. I'll get some coffee and wait. Good luck!\"\nShould I hit him with that rosary? Cha Eui-jae glanced at the dangling rosary but decided to let it go. Leaving Seo Min-gi, who was enthusiastically cheering with clenched fists, he pulled up his hood and trudged towards the temporary center.",

Then, making eye contact with the serene Buddha once again, he reflected on why he had stuffed it into his pocket instead of the glovebox. Sighing softly, Cha Eui-jae put the fan back into his pocket.\nAs he reached the entrance, an employee standing in front of the container greeted him kindly.\n\"Hello. What brings you here?\"\n\"I'm here to register as an Awakener.\"\n\"Please take a number here and wait for a moment.\"\nSurprisingly, Seo Min-gi's claim that there were no people seemed to be true. In the temporary center, there were only Cha Eui-jae and the affiliated public officials.\nCha Eui-jae took a number from the machine, sat on a plastic chair, and checked the digital clock on the wall. 3:02 PM. The examination itself wouldn't take long, so if he moved quickly, it wouldn't interfere with the evening business.\nHe'd certainly be taken back to the hangover soup restaurant... Closing his eyes and waiting for a while, Cha Eui-jae's number was called.\n\"Number 93.\"\nCha Eui-jae walked to the counter and handed over his number ticket. The staff placed the ticket into a plastic basket and asked,\n\"What brings you here?\"\n\"I'm here to register as an Awakener.\"\n\"Congratulations on your awakening. How long has it been since you awakened?\"\nIt had been 11 years. But knowing that if he spoke honestly, he would be detained, Cha Eui-jae had no choice but to lie.\n\"It's been 3 days.\"\n\"Please give me your ID card and your phone number.\"\nCha Eui-jae handed over his ID card and recited his phone number. As the staff entered the number, several sheets of paper were printed from the nearby printer. After verifying his identity, the staff handed him the documents and his ID card, explaining in a businesslike manner,\n\"Please fill out only the highlighted parts here. Write your name, social security number, phone number, and address. For the skill name and description section, please refer to your system information and fill it out. You don't need to list all your skills, but make sure to properly write down at least one skill that you will demonstrate during the ability assessment.\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"There are pens over there. Once you've filled everything out, please bring it back to me.\"\nStanding up from the counter, Cha Eui-jae found a spot in the corner and gripped a pen, deep in thought. He could write the hangover soup restaurant as his address... Personal information could be filled out without much difficulty. Thoroughly managing the personal information of Awakeners was not something that existed during J's active period, making this part relatively easy.\nThe problem was the next part. He summoned the information window that he had deliberately avoided for a while.\n[Viewing Cha Eui-jae's information.]\n[There is a lot of information. Summary function is supported.]\n[Would you like to view the summarized content?]\n[Summary will display up to 3 traits and skills with the highest proficiency.]\n[Using the summary function.]\n[Error!]\n[Due to ■■, certain items are inaccessible.]\nCha Eui-jae slightly frowned but quickly relaxed as several overlapping system messages popped up. It wasn't that 8 years didn't exist just because he hadn't experienced them, so it was akin to collecting 11 years' worth of data.\nAfter waiting a bit longer, a summarized white window appeared.\n[Cha Eui-jae]\nHunter Name: J\nAge: 2■\nGender: Male\nGrade: A (Currently under a weakening curse.)\nTraits: Basilisk's Venom (S+), Enhanced Strength (S+), Poker Face (B)\nUnique Traits: Hands of a Master (S+), Omniscient (S+), ■■■ ■■■(?)\nTitle: ■■■ ■■■\nSkills: Tracker's Eye (S+), Heart Piercer (S), Soundless Steps (S)\nCha Eui-jae quickly skimmed through the information, then stared into the void, feeling overwhelmed. So, what should he write...\nSkills were a lifeline for Hunters; even a good skill at a low rank could allow one to be an active Hunter.\nAs society stabilized and Hunters' positions rose, the Hunters' association argued that disclosing all owned skills violated personal information protection laws. The Awakened Management Bureau vehemently opposed, but after a long battle, the Bureau eventually conceded. As a result, the requirement to register all skills during Awakened registration was changed.\nThanks to this, the skill section in the Awakened registration documents was reduced to a single field for the representative skill that would be demonstrated.\nThe one skill written would become the Hunter's signature. Though it wasn't particularly important for Eui-jae, who intended to hide his strength and identity. However, considering he had to demonstrate it, he couldn't just make up something that didn't exist. His eyes meticulously scanned the list.\n[Tracker's Eye (S+)]\nThe ability to track and find others wasn't a common skill. Revealing that he possessed this would make things twice as troublesome. Excluded.\n[Heart Piercer (S)]\nUpon use, it would definitely pierce the heart. It was also J's representative skill. If he used this now, after J's return, he'd be immediately captured by the Awakened Management Bureau. Excluded.\n[Soundless Steps (S)]\nPerfectly conceals presence upon use. It was unlikely a low-grade Hunter would possess such a skill. Excluded.\nThe lower-ranked skills were also too ambiguous to use. At this point, the only option was to use his imagination to craft a suitable lie. The problem was that his imagination was terrible.\n'...What's something inconspicuous and easy to fake?'\nCha Eui-jae was good at hitting and enduring. But claiming his representative skill involved beating people up wasn't an option... After pondering for a long time, Cha Eui-jae finally wrote down a skill.\nSturdy (D)\nStrengthens the body to make it tough.\n'Just get hit, then claim the toughness is due to the skill.'\nWith nothing but a sturdy body and resilience, he decided to switch to a tank role.\n***\nChoi Seok-yoon, a C-grade Hunter affiliated with the Awakened Management Bureau, was assigned to the temporary Awakened registration center in Gwangjin-gu due to his newbie status.\nIt was nice that there wasn't much work since it was a temporary center and they would soon move to the main building, but there was so little work that it was boring. Recently, he had binge-watched an entire season of a drama during work hours. If nothing special happened today, he might finish another season.\nDing-dong.\nChoi Seok-yoon, who was yawning so wide his mouth might tear, quickly checked the monitor at the sound of the alarm. Someone was finally coming for an ability assessment. He cleared his throat and raised his voice.\n\"Come in.\"\nThe person who entered was a tall young man in a gray hoodie. The young man approached Seok-yoon without hesitation and handed over his documents. Choi Seok-yoon was slightly taken aback by the confident movement. He quickly checked the documents.\n'Name: Cha Eui-jae. Age: 28. Skill is... Sturdy? What kind of skill name is that?'\nChoi Seok-yoon couldn't help but chuckle. After all, there were quite a few people with quirky skill names on HunterNet. Scratching his temple with a pen, he asked,\n\"Judging by the description, it seems like a defensive tank skill. Is that correct?\"\n\"Seems like it, but I'm not really sure.\"\nThe young man's voice trailed off, in stark contrast to his previously bold movements. Choi Seok-yoon glanced at him and then reviewed the documents again.\n'Awakening date... 3 days ago? That makes sense.'\nA self-enhancement buff would be hard to perceive on one's own, especially if it wasn't an attack skill. Choi Seok-yoon nodded and stood up.\n\"One moment.\"\nHe retrieved a dummy from the corner and turned it on. The wooden dummy creaked before standing upright. Choi Seok-yoon handed the dummy a wooden sword and gestured for Cha Eui-jae to approach.\n\"You'll be struck while in the skill's active state. The attack will be with the average strength of a D-grade Awakener. Is that alright?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"If it hurts too much, make sure to let us know. We'll give you a recovery potion.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nThe young man's voice was still somewhat timid, but considering he was about to get hit, it was remarkably composed. Choi Seok-yoon was impressed.\n'He has great composure... Tanks are rare, so a mid-sized guild might take him right away.'\nMeanwhile, Cha Eui-jae was...\n'Pretend the hit wasn't too bad, but act like it hurts because of the pain.'\nHe was preparing for a Hollywood-level performance.\n\"Have you activated your skill?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Alright, here we go.\"\nWhen Choi Seok-yoon pressed the button, the dummy raised the wooden sword and turned towards Cha Eui-jae. To Cha Eui-jae's eyes, it moved excruciatingly slow, but he couldn't dodge. He tracked the sword's descending trajectory with his eyes. It was aiming for his shoulder. As expected, the wooden sword struck his left shoulder.\n'Wait a second.'\nSnap!!\nHearing the ominous sound, Cha Eui-jae instantly realized something had gone terribly wrong. He had expected a somewhat heavy strike, not this light one. His anxious eyes shifted to the void.\nSure enough, the wooden sword that should have stopped upon hitting his shoulder...\n'Fuck.'\n...had snapped in two and was flying through the air.",

      "content": "Chapter 36: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\nSnap!!\nUsing his divine eyesight to locate the wooden sword, he fell into a brief dilemma. Should he catch it? No, if he catches it, it's all over.\nCha Eui-jae hoped his brain would work a little faster as he pondered. Or should he just pretend to be in pain? Yeah, that's better! After making a quick decision, Cha Eui-jae slightly leaned his body and grabbed his left shoulder. He didn't forget to let out a soft groan.\n\"Ugh, ouch.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh, it hurts so much.\"\nOf course, it didn't help much. His voice sounded very normal even to himself, and perhaps because he was flustered, he pretended to be in pain a bit too quickly. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes tightly. What kind of durability does a wooden sword have to break like that? Even a soup ladle from a hangover soup restaurant would be sturdier!\nThe wooden sword, drawing a perfect parabola, landed with a thud among the stacked boxes.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"It... really hurts...\"\nThough Cha Eui-jae continued to feign pain soullessly, he couldn't stop the dreadful silence from filling the container.\nChoi Seok-yoon looked back and forth between the broken wooden sword, the motionless wooden doll, and Cha Eui-jae holding his shoulder with a blank expression. Just as Choi Seok-yoon was about to say something, the right arm of the doll fell to the floor with a thud.\nThe dreadful silence now grew to a deafening level. Cha Eui-jae glanced at the doll's arm sprawled on the floor and gritted his teeth.\n\"Don't they check the equipment properly? Damn government employees, really slacking off...\"\nCha Eui-jae snapped back to reality, realizing it was not the time to blame the worn-out doll and fragile wooden sword! He needed to fix this hopeless situation quickly. Choi Seok-yoon was beginning to come to his senses.\n\"Um, Cha Eui-jae?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"That skill you used just now, is it really a D-grade?\"\nA hint of doubt appeared on Choi Seok-yoon's face. After calming himself, Cha Eui-jae answered.\n\"Yes, it's definitely a D-grade skill.\"\n\"Then why did the doll and the wooden sword break...\"\n\"That, I don't know...\"\nHe lowered his head. Scraping the floor with his worn-out sneakers, he muttered.\n\"It does say it strengthens the body, but I don't really know how...\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been mumbling and scratching his neck, gloomily asked.\n\"Um... sir. Do I have to compensate for this doll?\"\n\"What? Well, first...\"\n\"Is it... very expensive?\"\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\nWhen Cha Eui-jae, with a distressed face, rubbed his shoulder that was hit by the wooden sword, Choi Seok-yoon started to panic.\n'How could I say such things to someone who has just awakened!'\nThere's a joke in the hunter industry. New awakeners are extremely, very, exceptionally sensitive, and they should be handled delicately like dealing with a bomb!\nOf course, it's something well known by the staff at the Awakened Registration Center. It's not entirely unfounded. The trainers for new public servants shout it until their throats burst.\n\"Newly awakened individuals are extremely sensitive as they adapt to their suddenly changed environment. A small stimulus can lead to a big problem, so careful consideration is required when dealing with them.\"\nIn short, new awakeners are as sensitive and emotionally volatile as someone who hasn't slept for 72 hours, so don't provoke them and register them smoothly.\nLuckily for Cha Eui-jae, Choi Seok-yoon was a rookie. A rookie with fresh memories of the Awakened Special Law training, which emphasized and re-emphasized the need to handle new awakeners with care!\nHad he been a bit more perceptive, he might have noticed Cha Eui-jae's expression, which seemed ready to thrash someone, but unfortunately, the brainwashing-like training from the Awakened Management Bureau clouded his eyes. Besides, the fleeting glimpse of Cha Eui-jae's handsome face, despite being partially hidden by the hood, added to the trust.\n'Well, what would a newly awakened person who just awakened three days ago know?'\nChoi Seok-yoon's thoughts leaned towards soothing the new awakener before he could cause a bigger accident, thinking he'd soon return to the management bureau anyway and didn't want any trouble. He cleared his throat, picked up the broken arm, and spoke.\n\"It's fine. This doll is quite old. We were planning to replace it when moving to the main building anyway.\"\n\"Oh... really?\"\n\"Yes, don't worry too much. Let's wrap up the skill demonstration here and proceed with the ability measurement?\"\nChoi Seok-yoon pointed to the measuring machine with a gentle smile. Cha Eui-jae also smiled back, but inside, he thought that the real challenge was about to begin.\n'Damn it, it's one thing after another.'\nThis damn measurement wouldn't end.\nChoi Seok-yoon pointed to the platform.\n\"Please take off your shoes and step on here. The machine will verify the grade and abilities registered in the system and display them on the monitor. You just need to stand still. Easy, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIt was so easy that it was a problem. Even if he assumed his actual grade would be one step lower, Cha Eui-jae's current grade was A. There was a vast difference between the A-grade he wanted and the D-grade.\nCha Eui-jae quickly scanned his surroundings. There was only one monitor connected to the machine, placed on the desk. If the results were unsatisfactory, he could just destroy that.\nTo do so, he needed to divert Choi Seok-yoon's attention or send him out of the room altogether. Cha Eui-jae raised his hand as he was about to take off his shoes.\n\"Um, sir.\"\n\"Yes, what is it?\"\n\"My shoulder really hurts from the hit... could I maybe drink a potion?\"\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\nCha Eui-jae made the saddest face he could. The potion given to awakeners registering was a cheap consumable, so it wouldn't be in the personal inventory. Personal potions were too expensive to give away... which meant he'd have to go to the storage.\nAs expected, Choi Seok-yoon glanced around and scratched the back of his head.\n\"Ah, the potion is in the storage... I'll have to go get it. Will you be okay?\"\n\"Yes. I'll measure in the meantime. Since the machine does it anyway.\"\n\"Would you? Then I'll be quick! Just stand in the footprint marks. Try not to move too much. Once the bell rings, step down and check the results. I'll be right back!\"\nAs Choi Seok-yoon quickly left the room, Cha Eui-jae agilely took off his shoes and stepped onto the platform. A blue light started scanning from his feet up to his entire body. Soon, the bell rang, and a red letter appeared on the monitor.\n[Number 93, Cha Eui-jae's grade is A.]\n'I knew it, damn it.'\nCha Eui-jae sighed, thinking of Seo Min-gi, who had cheered him on with a \"Fighting!\" He wanted to shake him by the collar, asking if today's measurement was really the best decision, but it wasn't something Seo Min-gi could have predicted. He couldn't have known the potion he tested on himself wouldn't work.\nSince it's come to this, he'd have to mess with the computer a little. As Cha Eui-jae stepped off the platform and crumpled his shoes, the moment he was about to tamper with the machine...\nBang!\nSuddenly, the world shook violently. After a moment, the ground and container trembled, and a strong wind blew like a typhoon. Despite being in a windowless container!\nThe fierce wind blew off Cha Eui-jae's hood, which he had pulled down tightly. Cha Eui-jae stepped back, barely keeping his balance, while covering his face with his arm.\n\"Awakener! Are you okay...\"\nChoi Seok-yoon appeared at the door, holding a bundle of potions. His hair was a mess, probably due to struggling against the wind to get here. While checking his condition, Cha Eui-jae widened his eyes at the scene behind him. A blue glowing vortex was unfolding behind Choi Seok-yoon.\nA rift!\nCha Eui-jae urgently reached out to Choi Seok-yoon, shouting loudly.\n\"Grab my hand!\"\n\"Huh? Uh, uh? Aah!\"\nChoi Seok-yoon, looking bewildered, screamed as he was sucked into the rift. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth. A cold sweat trickled down his temples. His stomach churned. He felt something rising in his throat.\nWhat would happen if he was sucked into the rift as well? Cha Eui-jae began to breathe heavily as terrible scenes filled his mind.\nHands clinging, begging for life, corpses trampled by monsters beyond recognition, bloodstains left so heavily that it was impossible to tell whose blood it was. And left inside the rift...\n'Oh, shit.'\nA blue light surged over his head like a wave. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes tightly.",

      "content": "Chapter 37: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\nA franchise café in Gwangjin-gu, just a moment ago.\n[As I reported yesterday, I'm in Gwangjin-gu. The weakening potion didn't work, so the bracelet is the only thing being worn. Currently, the ability measurement is in progress.]\nShall I send it? Yes.\nSeo Min-gi sent a text message to the Guild Leader and adjusted his sunglasses as he looked around.\nHe had come to the café to keep his one-sided promise with Cha Eui-jae. As it was a weekday late afternoon, the franchise café was quiet, which was fortunate since the task needed to be discreet. Just then, his phone buzzed briefly.\nGuild Leader Lee Sa-young: OK\nSurprisingly, Lee Sa-young replied! Normally, he would have read the message and ignored it. Seizing the moment to send an additional report, Seo Min-gi was interrupted by a clear voice calling him.\n\"Coffee Saraminki-ssi, who ordered via Smart Order! Your Americano Grande and Java Chip, and Green Tea Frappuccino with an extra shot and extra whipped cream, are ready!\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nHe decided he would make the additional report once back in the truck. Holding the coffee in both hands, he pushed open the café's glass door with his shoulder and quickly walked out. The measurement process wouldn't take long, so he had to hurry back to the truck to monitor the situation and be ready for any sudden developments.\nSeo Min-gi sucked on the straw of the Green Tea Frappuccino loaded with whipped cream.\nWould Cha Eui-jae get a D grade without any issues? Unfortunately, it seemed highly unlikely. Even drinking all the weakening potions wouldn't have been enough, let alone just wearing a bracelet. A look of resolve flashed across Seo Min-gi's face.\n'I was sent for situations like this.'\nHunter name: A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi, real name: Seo Min-gi. Ranked 34th in South Korea, and the man who received a higher ranking than his superior, Lee Sa-young, in the annoyingly memorable Hunter Name Voting.\n'Don't worry, Guild Leader.'\nHe was,\n'I'll handle the manipulation perfectly.'\nA pro in stealth and infiltration.\nThe long shadow behind him wavered.\nThere was a reason Lee Sa-young assigned the 34th ranked hunter in South Korea to Cha Eui-jae. The measurement device developed by top researchers worldwide had almost no errors. Even trying to deceive it with weakening curses had its limits.\n'So, the only option is to manipulate the result itself.'\nSeo Min-gi was dispatched under the assumption of this worst-case scenario.\nIt would take a great deal of effort to infiltrate a securely guarded awakening management center, but it was a different story for a temporary registration center. In such an environment, infiltrating and manipulating information would be a piece of cake for Seo Min-gi. Of course, if caught, he would face a severe punishment, so getting caught was not an option.\n'Don't worry, Cha Eui-jae-ssi... Even if things go south, I can handle the cleanup.'\nWith a safety net in place, Seo Min-gi felt at ease. However, upon returning to the parking lot, he witnessed a shocking sight that made him doubt his own eyes. He even lowered his sunglasses to take a clearer look, but the sight remained unchanged.\nThe container meant for data manipulation was gone, and a blue rift was pulsating in its place...\n'...Why?'\nIt was chilling.\nUnconsciously, his hands trembled, causing hot coffee to spill, but that was the least of his worries. Fluorescent-vested Rift Management Bureau staff were running around, controlling the area near the rift.\nFamiliar faces appeared there. For instance, A-grade hunter Yang Hye-jin from the Rift Management Bureau was there, wearing a yellow safety helmet and a fluorescent vest, waving a safety baton.\n\"Move quickly!\"\n\"A 5th-grade rift has emerged at the Gwangjin-gu temporary registration center!\"\n\"I've contacted the management bureau!\"\n\"The disaster message?\"\n\"It will be sent soon.\"\n\"It might be an absorption-type rift, so make sure to control the surroundings.\"\n\"How many civilians were caught up in it...\"\n\"Is there any hunter nearby who can support?\"\n\"Ah, Matthew is nearby!\"\n\"Lee Sa-young is also here, but...\"\nYang Hye-jin's serious expression turned blank upon hearing that name.\n\"There's no way he'd come. Try contacting him, but don't expect much. Also, contact Matthew immediately!\"\n'...There's no way the center would have a rift. This isn't a movie.'\nSeo Min-gi tried to ignore the urgent voices. He was sure he was seeing things.\nIt seemed the effect of the weakening potion he tested yesterday hadn't worn off. Well, I did drink quite a lot. The weakening potion might have even caused mental weakness. After rationalizing, Seo Min-gi opened the truck door.\nBeeeep— The loud emergency alert tone shattered his escape from reality. He put the coffee on the car seat and hurriedly took out his phone.\n[Rift Management Bureau]\n[15:34 Seoul Gwangjin-gu Temporary Awakener Registration Center 5th-grade rift occurred, area under control, avoid approaching]\nWh... what the heck.\nSeo Min-gi despaired. Then he mentally prepared a Q&A as if he were writing on a knowledge-sharing platform.\n\"JisikON\"\nQ. [Question] Hello, Guild Leader. While I was out buying coffee, the target got caught up in a rift. What should I do?\nA. Die.\nSeo Min-gi's legs gave out, and he collapsed in front of the truck door like a mermaid. After receiving a special assignment from Lee Sa-young, he had simulated every possible scenario... but never imagined a rift appearing at the measurement site!\nFaced with a major crisis, his brain started spinning rapidly, leaning toward a rather extreme solution.\n'Should I just jump into the rift?'\nWith Rift Management Bureau staff controlling the entrance and reporters rushing in, it was possible to ignore them all and jump in, but doing so would lead to tomorrow's headline: \"A Brave Act by A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi (34th in South Korea)... as He Dives into a Rift,\" with his back featured prominently. The YouTube video of him diving into the rift would surely surpass a million views. He could already imagine the comments.\n—Username: \"The nickname is uniquely bad\"\n—Why is he being criticized? Isn't it good if a hunter jumps into a rift voluntarily?\n⤷He was reported to have entered a dungeon in Jongno this morning and then dived into a rift in Gwangjin-gu in the afternoon, hence the criticism.\n⤷?? How can someone who entered a dungeon also jump into a rift?\n⤷I'm curious about that too ^^\n'Absolutely not.'\nSeo Min-gi shuddered at the mere thought. As someone who made a living off stealth, such exposure would be unbearable. Moreover, A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi was supposed to have entered a dungeon in Jongno 3-ga with Bae Won-woo this morning!\nWho would have thought his well-prepared alibi would become a trap? Seo Min-gi was dismayed. The perception-disrupting effect of these sunglasses had its limits; getting publicly exposed would ruin his carefully crafted alibi.\nDamn it! Seo Min-gi clutched his head. He should've just ordered an iced Americano instead of a Green Tea Frappuccino with extra shot, extra whipped cream, and half Java chips blended and half drizzled. If only he had come a bit earlier, he might have been able to enter before the Rift Management Bureau hunters arrived. As he lamented endlessly, his phone buzzed at the perfect moment, as if to tell him to snap out of it.\n[Guild Leader Lee Sa-young]\nSensing his fate, Seo Min-gi stared into space for a moment.\nIf I answer this... I'm going to get scolded terribly. And if I don't, I'll get scolded five times worse and be made an example of in the meeting. Seo Min-gi respectfully pressed the call button with both hands.\n\"Yes, this is A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi...\"\n—You answered?\n\"Excuse me?\"\n—So, you're not inside the rift then.\nSeo Min-gi swallowed hard. The low voice was gently coaxing him.\n—What's the situation?\nAfter a brief silence, Seo Min-gi answered.\n\"...First, the current situation is entirely my fault. I am truly sorry.\"\n—Sorry?\n\"...The target seems to be inside the rift.\"\n—Seems?\n\"Yes. The temporary center container and part of the district office parking lot were swallowed by the rift. The Rift Management Bureau is in place, controlling the rift entrance. As it's a registration center rift, the Awakened Management Bureau should send support soon.\"\n—Should?\nIt was hard to tell if Lee Sa-young was nitpicking or agreeing. He had seemingly mastered the art of killing someone with words alone.\nSeo Min-gi's future looked increasingly grim, and he banged his head against the truck's body repeatedly. The truck's body dented bit by bit.\n\"I'm sorry. Should I just end it?\"\n—Forget it.\nLee Sa-young cut him off indifferently.\n—I'll be there soon, so wait.\n\"Excuse me?\"\nClick. The call ended abruptly. Soon? The Guild Leader? Here? Seo Min-gi wondered if he was hearing things wrong and rubbed his ears hard. Still dazed, he looked at his now-silent phone and asked again.\n\"Excuse me???\"",

      "content": "Chapter 38: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\n\"Squawk!\"\nAt the same time, inside the rift, a giant pterosaur, struck in the throat, flapped its wings frantically before going limp. Cha Eui-jae twisted the neck of the pterosaur, which resembled a bird but exuded an unpleasant aura, with the decisiveness of wringing a chicken's neck on a hot day.\nBefore entering the rift, he felt nauseous, but after fighting off a few monsters, he started to feel better. Since he didn't sense any more presence, it seemed he had dealt with most of the monsters around. After stacking the pterosaur corpses neatly in a corner, he dusted off his hands.\nWhether fortunately or unfortunately, the people swept into the rift seemed to have scattered. Thanks to that, he could slaughter the attacking monsters without hesitation. He stood over the dead pterosaur, rubbing his chin.\n\"It doesn't seem like a particularly dangerous rift... but should I reduce the number of monsters?\"\nHe had to keep his identity hidden, so he couldn't openly rescue people, but he could indirectly ensure their safety by killing the monsters. He couldn't let innocent people get hurt because he didn't do what he could. Cha Eui-jae adjusted his misaligned shoes and started walking.\nAfter wandering around for a while and destroying 24 pterosaurs and three herds of horned buffalo, he found a half-buried office chair with two wheels missing, a broken desk, and a half-buried cutout of Lee Sa-young near a field of blue reeds.\nWith a puzzled expression, Cha Eui-jae inspected the cutout. Despite being a thick piece of wood, it hadn't broken.\n\"Should I throw this away or not...\"\nAfter a moment of contemplation, he decided to keep the cutout. Even though it was just a familiar face, or rather, a familiar gas mask, it had become somewhat endearing due to frequent appearances in public service announcements. Recently, Park Ha-eun had been mimicking Lee Sa-young's strange hand gestures, making Cha Eui-jae acutely aware of the impact media could have on children.\nIn the end, he yanked out the familiar cutout and tucked it under his arm. He then stood the dirt-covered cutout upright under a tree shade and sat down on the broken chair. Though his body wobbled, his face was seriously pensive.\n\"Will the rescue team... come?\"\nThis rift occurred at a temporary registration center in the middle of the city. Logically, a rescue team should come. Probably.\nSince he had dealt with most of the monsters, the safety of the other survivors was ensured, and he didn't need to clear the rift himself. He just had to wait quietly for the rescue team with the Lee Sa-young cutout.\nHowever, waiting for the rescue team posed a significant problem for him.\n\"What about tonight's business?\"\nHe had to open his hangover soup restaurant at 5 PM.\nMoreover, he had a practical and crucial concern. To make clear broth, he had to keep skimming the foam off the top, and leaving it unattended for too long could affect the taste. He had also left the broth on low heat without turning off the stove...\nWhat if a fire broke out due to neglect? The thought alone was terrifying.\nCha Eui-jae checked his phone. The clock had stopped at 3:25 since he entered the rift. With electronic devices out of order, he couldn't contact his grandmother or check the current time.\n'...No way.'\nIf this continued, his pride in running the hangover soup restaurant without any incidents would be tarnished!\nStuck waiting for the rescue team, with his restaurant and possibly his heart at risk of burning down. Cha Eui-jae anxiously shook his legs.\nActually, the problem started with the possibility of meeting the rescue team. The plan agreed upon with Seo Min-gi was to minimize contact with other hunters and return under the guise of an ordinary hunter.\nBut being swept into a rift in the middle of Seoul, especially at a temporary registration center, had introduced a significant variable. The rescue team would likely include hunters from the Rift Management Bureau, the Awakened Management Bureau, and guild hunters responding to the support request.\nThe hangover soup restaurant was a popular spot among hunters, with all kinds of hunters frequenting it.\nIf a regular customer from the rescue team saw him, they would recognize him immediately.\n'What brings the hangover soup restaurant's staff to this rift?'\n'Right...'\nNaturally, they would be curious and engage in various conversations, inevitably revealing that he got swept into the rift while registering as an awakener. All the regulars at the hangover soup restaurant would know. The mere thought sent chills down his spine.\nHe wanted to live quietly, but he kept bumping into hunters at the hangover soup restaurant, meeting Lee Sa-young, dealing with the aftermath of the magic stone, and now getting swept into a rift while registering as a hunter.\nWith so many misfortunes piling up, Cha Eui-jae recalled a superstition he had heard somewhere.\n\"Shit... could this year be my samjae1?\"\nHe couldn't even ask Nexby about it due to being in the rift. His already messy life had become even more chaotic in the past few weeks. Something had undoubtedly gone wrong somewhere. He resolved to sprinkle salt around his shop once he got out of here.\nAnyway, whether it was bad luck or not, he couldn't let his quiet life slip away. Even if it was already half ruined thanks to the magic stone and Lee Sa-young, and he might have to put up a sign saying 'We're still quietly open for business'... he had to protect whatever was left.\nCha Eui-jae stood up from the chair and cracked his neck.\n'Time to make a plan.'\nHunters would come to rescue those trapped in the rift, but they weren't coming for him specifically. So, it was better to assume there would be no rescue team. Briefly, the faces of Mingi and Lee Sa-young flashed in his mind, but he shook them off.\n'They won't come.'\nIt's best not to have even the slightest hope in such situations. Always assume the worst and plan accordingly to handle unexpected situations calmly. This was the truth Cha Eui-jae had learned from his experiences.\nHe exhaled deeply, rubbed his face, and drew a sketch on the ground with his sneaker. He had to make an efficient plan to escape this place.\nTo close the rift, he had to deal with its core entity. Rescue teams prioritize rescuing survivors, usually leaving the core entity for later. This meant he would be late opening his shop.\nSo, while the rescue team was rescuing survivors, he would avoid them and kill the core entity alone. Perfect.\nCha Eui-jae smudged the drawing on the ground with his sneaker. The rescue team would take time to locate the scattered survivors. If asked where he was after the rift closed, he could just say he was hiding in a corner.\n'Kill the core entity as quickly as possible, escape, and return to the shop to manage the broth and open for evening business.'\nRevisiting his plan mentally, Cha Eui-jae took out a fan with a Buddha print from his hoodie pocket. He had grabbed it from the glove compartment of the delivery truck earlier.\nIf he fought barehanded and got his clothes dirty, it would delay opening time. You have to make do with what you have. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes.\n'Please cooperate, Buddha.'\nWhen he reopened his eyes, they glowed blue. Flames flickered on the flat ground map. Thanks to his earlier actions, the number of monsters seemed low. The human figures scattered around suggested the survivors were well-hidden.\nAfter confirming the number and location of the survivors, he turned his gaze elsewhere. At the rift's center was a large, green, flickering flame.\n'There it is.'\nWhite wind wrapped around his feet, concealing his presence. Cha Eui-jae started running silently towards the flame.\n***\nHunter Yang Hye-jin of the Rift Management Bureau, an A-grade hunter, stood in front of what used to be the Gwanggu Temporary Registration Center, her face marked by dark circles. The site where the container stood was now a rift-ridden ruin.\nShe had thought it would be a quiet day when she went to work this morning, but a major accident had happened.\n'This is why you shouldn't say it's quiet... It jinxes things.'\nHer fluorescent vest with \"Safety\" written on it flapped forlornly in the winter wind. She sniffled and muttered while lighting a cigarette.\n\"Sigh... Why did the rift have to appear here of all places? Our luck is terrible.\"\nAnother B-grade hunter, holding glowing safety wands in both hands, nodded as he glared at the rift's entrance.\n\"Yeah. Fortunately, most of those swept in are awakeners. We have some leeway.\"\n\"Leeway, my foot. Most of them are low-grade or administrative awakeners who can't fight properly. It'd be lucky if they're just hiding...\"\n\"Senior! Senior!\"\nTheir worried conversation was interrupted by a rookie, who had been controlling the surroundings, running up urgently. Yang Hye-jin exhaled a cloud of smoke.\n\"Did you come back? How many reporters showed up?\"\n\"Oh... There were about six! More will likely come.\"\n\"It can't be helped. What about support personnel? I heard the Awakened Management Bureau was coming too.\"\n\"Uh, that's... I came to tell you this!\"\nThe flustered rookie straightened up and shouted.\n\"L-Lee Sa-young is here! To raid the rift.\"\nAt the rookie's final words, Yang Hye-jin stopped halfway from lighting her cigarette. Despite her lack of response, the rookie continued to stand stiffly. Yang Hye-jin's face reflected more confusion than the rookie's anxious one.\n'Have I been giving this kid too much work?'\nShe stared blankly at the rookie, cigarette in hand, unintentionally slipping into a moment of self-reflection.",

      "content": "Chapter 39: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\nRight, it was clear that the rookie was seeing things due to being overworked. The idea of Lee Sa-young coming to a place like this was absurd. It was likely that he was so overwhelmed that he couldn't discern reality. There was no other explanation for such madness.\nYang Hye-jin looked at the rookie with pity. She thought of giving him a ginseng juice to revive him when they returned to the management office. Then she recited Lee Sa-young's profile in her head.\nLee Sa-young, who was dethroned from the top spot by J, a sudden newcomer or imposter, but had held the number one position for six years. Notable for... 'Ignoring most requests from the Awakened Management Bureau and the Rift Management Bureau.'\nSince Yang Hye-jin started working at the Rift Management Bureau, Lee Sa-young had never responded to a support request. The B-grade hunter standing next to her seemed to share her thoughts as he laughed.\n\"Hey, why would Lee Sa-young come here? You must have seen it wrong.\"\n\"No, really, it's Lee Sa-young...\"\n\"I've heard that more people have been dressing up in techwear with gas masks lately because of those public service ads. Could it be one of those posers?\"\n\"That's possible.\"\n\"Right? I get chills just from seeing those ads.\"\nAs they laughed off the absurd joke, something that everyone was familiar with abruptly froze the cheerful atmosphere— a lazy voice.\n\"Are you here to perform a ritual... in front of the rift?\"\n\"...\"\n\"It looked like a family gathering.\"\nThe voice was too familiar, as it was one they regularly heard on weekend entertainment shows. Yang Hye-jin slowly turned her head. A figure in a black gas mask nonchalantly crossed the restricted line they had set up.\nWith such a build, wearing black techwear, a sarcastic tone, and a chillingly low voice, there was only one person it could be.\nThe B-grade hunter, sweating since hearing the voice, started making a cross shape with a safety bar, looking like he was trying to exorcize a demon. Yang Hye-jin dropped her cigarette. She quickly regained her composure and stamped it out with her foot.\nIn the midst of the confusion, everyone had the same thought in their minds.\n'Why is this guy here?'\nA grade 5 rift wasn't an easy one, but it also didn't require an S-grade hunter. They had requested support knowing he wouldn't come, so his actual arrival was baffling, akin to winning the lottery with a ticket bought just for fun.\nStanding tall in front of the rift, Lee Sa-young tilted his head.\n\"What are you doing? Why aren't you going in?\"\nYang Hye-jin swallowed hard and cautiously asked.\n\"Are you here for support?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"...What for?\"\nHe nodded toward the swirling rift entrance.\n\"To get rid of this.\"\nBut why would the current number two come here for a mere grade 5 rift... Yang Hye-jin quickly gave up on getting a proper answer. Time was of the essence, and there was no time to argue with Lee Sa-young.\n\"Support staff from the Awakened Management Bureau are also on their way. Perhaps you should wait a bit and enter together...\"\n\"I don't need them.\"\n\"What?\"\nThrough the lenses of his gas mask, he glanced at the rookie, the B-grade hunter, and Yang Hye-jin in turn.\n\"Just take care of the survivors.\"\nBefore they could stop him, he strode into the rift. After the rift swallowed Lee Sa-young, the rookie looked between the rift and Yang Hye-jin, stomping his feet anxiously.\n\"Sen... Senior, what should we do?\"\n\"Hah...\"\nYang Hye-jin tossed her yellow safety helmet aside and ruffled her hair.\n\"What else? We need to follow him right away...\"\n\"What? Oh, yes!\"\n\"Lee Sa-young will handle the rift boss, so we focus on identifying and rescuing survivors. Move!\"\n\"Yes, understood!\"\n\"And... Rookie!\"\n\"Yes?\"\nThe rookie perked up. Yang Hye-jin, donning a thick bulletproof vest instead of her high-visibility jacket, pointed to the supply truck with her thumb.\n\"Bring more gas masks than the number of people, and grab all the antidotes and items with detox effects.\"\n\"Why...?\"\nWas there a monster using poison inside the rift? The rookie looked at Yang Hye-jin with a puzzled expression. She clicked her tongue and hurriedly motioned.\n\"If you don't want to die from Lee Sa-young's poison, hurry up!\"\n***\nWhile the Rift Management Bureau hunters frantically rummaged through the supply truck, Lee Sa-young, the very reason for their rush, moved leisurely. Though he seemed ready to charge at the rift boss any moment, he paused to inspect a purple ivy vine wrapped around a tree.\nAfter a few minutes, something round and black popped out of his shadow. It was the head of Seo Min-gi, wearing sunglasses.\n\"Guild Leader.\"\nSeo Min-gi, who lived by hiding in shadows, could only hide in others' shadows. Unable to enter the rift alone, he had waited for Lee Sa-young to arrive. After his head bobbed up and down for a moment, Seo Min-gi crawled out of the shadow and stood on two feet.\nLee Sa-young spoke.\n\"It's quiet.\"\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\nUsually, upon entering a rift, you'd make eye contact with monsters wandering about as if it were their backyard. But this rift had been eerily silent from the moment they stepped in, as if there were no living beings at all. Seo Min-gi pushed his sunglasses up and folded his arms behind his back.\nLee Sa-young picked up a red feather from the ground. It was glossy and free of dust. Seo Min-gi, after confirming the feather by lowering his sunglasses slightly, quickly muttered.\n\"It's a breast feather from a level 4 monster, the Red-breasted Pterosaur. They are ferocious, attacking anything in sight, whether human or other monsters, typically moving in packs of six or so. Judging by its condition, it seems to have fallen recently.\"\n\"Smart. You should handle the new recruit training next quarter.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nFeeling the sharp reprimand, Seo Min-gi shut his mouth. Lee Sa-young looked around after removing his gas mask.\nWhen hunters move, they leave a distinctive scent. Whether it's their body odor, the residual scent from wielding weapons, the smell of monster blood, or the breath they exhale, or even... the scent of humans who fell to monsters. Lee Sa-young was especially adept at picking up such scents.\nHowever, from the rift entrance to here, aside from the scent emitted by the rift's plants, there were no other scents in the rift.\n'Not even a trace of blood.'\nDespite being in the middle of the Red-breasted Pterosaur's territory, it was eerily quiet, suggesting that all the pterosaurs were dead. While monsters might have fought each other, such battles would leave traces.\n\"It's too clean.\"\n\"Do you think the rift master is a very strong entity that maintains strict control over the monsters, or someone has cleaned everything up?\"\nSome rifts were relatively quiet because the rift master managed the monsters well. But in such cases, the master's presence was immediately felt upon entry. This rift didn't feel like that.\n\"The latter.\"\nSomeone had killed all the monsters without leaving a trace.\nAmong those who were caught in this rift, the only one capable of that would be... Lee Sa-young thought of Cha Eui-jae, who had blocked his attack with a ladle and tore off his gas mask with bloodied hands. Yes, only Cha Eui-jae. Lee Sa-young started walking slowly.\n\"Seo Min-gi.\"\n\"Yes, Guild Leader.\"\n\"Where do you think my hyung would be?\"\nHyung. It was a respectful term that seemed unfitting coming from Lee Sa-young. Seo Min-gi, surprised by the term, quickly composed himself after a cold stare and answered.\n\"Um... wouldn't he be hiding somewhere? He needs to conceal his power. There's no need to kill monsters and reveal his presence.\"\nSeo Min-gi's opinion was plausible. Lee Sa-young's mind agreed with his reasoning. After all, Cha Eui-jae had strongly insisted on wanting to live quietly. Why would someone like that kill all the monsters? But the unnervingly quiet rift kept bothering him.\nSuddenly, Lee Sa-young frowned. Come to think of it, although Cha Eui-jae had denied it, he had sold magic stones on the Tomato Market due to financial need.\n'Could it be that he needed money...'\nHad he killed all the monsters to collect their byproducts? That would explain the rift's suspiciously clean state. Lee Sa-young's delicate features contorted slightly as he clicked his tongue.\n'Damn it, if he needed money, he could have said so.'\nCha Eui-jae was strange and suspicious. It was hard to understand what motivated him.\nHe claimed he wanted to live quietly but caused trouble here and there, and then suddenly accepted deals. Now, he had gotten caught in a rift but instead of staying put, he had wiped out all the monsters. It seemed he was born to attract chaos.\nAs they made their way through the blue reed field, they arrived at a clearing covered in grass. In the center of the clearing stood a dirt-covered life-size cutout of Lee Sa-Young and a broken office chair. Piled up in one corner were the bodies of dead pterodactyls, stacked like a tower. Seeing the cutout, Seo Min-gi was taken aback.\n\"Oh my god.\"\nLee Sa-Young approached the pile of pterodactyl corpses and picked up the one on top. The corpse was peculiarly clean, with no external injuries other than a twisted neck. He hadn't even plucked the feathers. Apparently, he wasn't after monster byproducts.\n\"What did you say earlier? He'd be hiding somewhere?\"\n\"...\"\nCaught between the cardboard Lee Sa-Young and the real one, Seo Min-gi trembled in fear. How was he supposed to predict Cha Eui-Jae's movements when he kept defying expectations? Seo Min-gi, who operated strictly within the bounds of common sense, couldn't keep up with Cha Eui-Jae's actions. Lee Sa-Young tossed the pterodactyl aside and turned back to the cutout.\n\"When was this thing made?\"\n\"Perhaps after the public service announcement aired? We'd need to ask the PR team for specifics.\"\n\"I'm not that curious...\"\nAt Lee Sa-Young's gesture, Seo Min-gi understood and began searching the area. Meanwhile, Lee Sa-Young scrutinized the cutout. Judging by the dirt on its waist, it seemed to have been buried somewhere before someone unearthed it. Seo Min-gi, who had been surveying the surroundings, reported back.\n\"There are no footprints or any signs that someone passed through here.\"\n\"He didn't vanish into thin air or sink into the ground, right?\"\n\"No, sir. It's possible he has skills to conceal his presence or traces.\"\n\"The more I know, the more entertaining it gets.\"\nLee Sa-Young, whose expression didn't look entertained in the least, felt a sudden burning sensation in his palm. He grimly removed his glove to inspect his hand.\nThe golden line, the mark of the contract inscribed with his blood, was charred black. Lee Sa-Young muttered coldly,\n\"What the hell is he up to, damn it.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 40: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\nMeanwhile, Cha Eui-jae had arrived at the location of the rift's master. The arch, draped with long strands of purple wisteria flowers, was tightly sealed with massive tree trunks and vines, protecting itself with no gaps.\nCha Eui-jae punched one of the tree trunks. It made a solid sound, indicating it was densely packed. The master of the rift was inside, but even breaking through the entrance was not easy.\nHe cautiously surveyed the surroundings. Often, the rift's master is associated with the internal environment. Given this rift was a giant forest, the master was likely a plant-type monster.\n'It would be easy to burn it.'\nHowever, as a non-smoker, Cha Eui-jae didn't even have a small lighter. He used to carry a lighter and a torch in his inventory just in case, but not anymore. He scratched his head and sighed deeply.\n\"Well, it's not made of steel...\"\nIn most cases like this, there was one solution.\n\"If you keep hitting it, it will break eventually!\"\nBang! Bang! Bang! His ruthless fist pounded the trunk. The trunk started to dent where his fist landed. Soon, one tree cracked and broke. After breaking several more trees, he noticed a fragrant smell from a split in one of the trunks.\nCha Eui-jae tore apart the broken tree and checked inside.\n[You have entered the master's lair, the 'Garden of Life.']\nAmidst a garden filled with vibrant flowers, a giant deer was curled up, lying down. Cha Eui-jae stepped into the flower field. Sensing his presence, the deer lifted its head. Its blue eyes focused on Cha Eui-jae. Upon spotting the intruder, the deer roared ferociously.\nGooooo...\nThe entire garden began to resonate. Cha Eui-jae firmly grasped his Buddha fan. Monsters with flower heads and root bodies sprang up from the flower bed and surrounded him in dozens. The deer roared once more.\nGooooo...!\nBang! The roots lunged at Cha Eui-jae's limbs. Cha Eui-jae swiftly swung his fan, striking down the approaching roots. However, for every ten he cut down, sixteen more emerged. Likely, all the flowers in this garden were monsters.\nCha Eui-jae took a deep breath, planted his fan into the ground, and infused it with energy.\nUuuuu...\nKwooong!\nA blue shockwave emanated from the fan, shaking the garden. The monsters screeched in incomprehensible agony and twisted. The emerging roots went limp, oozing green sap.\nThe deer shook its massive antlers in fury. Now, instead of small roots, the vines and thick tree trunks that sealed the archway surged from the ground.\nThough he could eventually defeat them if he kept fighting, it would be a waste of time. For the safety of the hangover soup restaurant and its clean broth, he needed to finish quickly. His goal was to return to the shop swiftly, and closing the rift was just a means to that end.\nCha Eui-jae placed the battered Buddha fan into his hoodie pocket.\n'Sorry, Buddha. I have no choice.'\nHe always fought relying on his own body. It was the most efficient way. Without the need for complex tactics, most problems could be solved with a sturdy and agile body.\nBut now, under the weakening curse, his body wasn't functioning properly. And when the body fails to perform?\n'...I have to use other means.'\nCha Eui-jae pulled out a pitch-black sword from his inventory. The sword, black from blade to hilt, seemed to fit perfectly in his hand as if waiting for his touch.\n'If the body doesn't work, use tools.'\n[Basilisk's Fang (S)]\n[A sword forged from the Basilisk's Fang by a recluse artisan living in . Only those deemed worthy are permitted to wield it.]\n[Creator: ]\n[Compatibility assessment in progress...]\nHissss, contrary to his expectation, as he held the sword, an ominous sound emerged from his hand along with a white system alert.\n[Warning! Incompatible. Your body is being invaded by poison.]\nHis hand holding the sword turned black. Despite the urgent situation with the rift's master roaring ahead, Cha Eui-jae quickly shook his hand, holding the sword.\n\"Hey, are you crazy? Don't you remember me?\"\n[Issue detected! Would you like to hear the 'Basilisk's Fang' thoughts?]\nFor once, the system was being helpful. Cha Eui-jae evaded another root and responded quickly.\n\"Sure. Let's hear it!\"\n[Reading 'Basilisk's Fang' thoughts...]\n[Fang's thoughts: I don't take orders from those weaker than me.]\nThis crazy sword was protesting, saying it was unfit for someone of his level to wield it. It was absurd since he was an A-grade, even with this level of equipment.\nCha Eui-jae leaped over a vine trying to wrap around his leg. The system continued its helpful guidance.\n[Calculating remaining time for your body...]\n[Error! Variable detected!]\n[Trait: Basilisk's Venom (S+) activated.]\n[Time remaining: 999:59:59]\n['Basilisk's Fang' thoughts updated!]\n[Updating...]\n[Fang's thoughts: Why is the Venom Boss here?]\nPerched on a tree trunk, Cha Eui-jae checked his arm. Almost up to his elbow, the arm that had turned black was returning to its original color, thanks to the 'Basilisk's Venom.' This crazy sword had failed to recognize its owner and was now treating the trait as its superior. Cha Eui-jae scrutinized the sword with a look of exasperation.\n'Who does this insane sword's attitude resemble?'\nAt the West Sea rift, the 'Basilisk's Fang' had appeared out of nowhere in front of J after he lost his usual spear. In the middle of a stark white ruin, the weapon suddenly stood there, naturally arousing suspicion.\nBut there was no time for such thoughts there. To survive, one had to completely rely on instincts, wielding weapons and fists without any hesitation. Sharpened senses and a killer instinct were what kept him alive.\nJ grabbed the sword without hesitation. The handle felt warm.\n[Compatibility assessment in progress...]\n[Challenger of ,]\n[I will lend you the power entrusted by .]\nThe sword tried to communicate something, but J didn't hear it. He merely needed power and grabbed the sword. The sword's energy enveloped his arm. J slaughtered the white monsters charging at him with the 'Basilisk's Fang.'\nAnd yet now, Cha Eui-jae, wielding an S-grade weapon, was helplessly dodging tree roots.\nWherever he stepped, vines sprouted, and the deer relentlessly attacked the ground, giving him no time to rest. The fragrance of the flowers was so strong it made his head spin.\nCha Eui-jae frowned as he cut another vine aiming for his ankle.\n'If I do this right, I could end it in one blow...'\nHowever, sharp leaves were whirling near the deer. Approaching it seemed impossible, given the fierce defense. With his current physical state, getting close could result in his entire body being slashed.\nNot that getting injured was an issue, but. The problem was he had no potions. Even if he relied on natural healing, there was no way all his wounds would heal before the shop opened.\n'I can't cook hangover soup while bleeding...'\nMoreover, hunters are extremely sensitive to the smell of blood. They would undoubtedly sniff around until they found the source. Balancing on a flying root, Cha Eui-jae looked down at the sword in his hand.\n'Maybe I...'\n['Basilisk's Fang' wants to speak!]\n[Fang's thoughts: Don't even think about throwing me.]\nIt was incredibly perceptive. Cha Eui-jae ground his teeth and glared at the hilt. Even his one weapon wasn't cooperating today. He missed his broken spear more than ever.\nKugugung, the ground rumbled as a massive root shot up like a mountain. It cast a shadow over half the garden. The root swayed as if searching for its prey.\n'I have no choice.'\nA slight sacrifice was inevitable. When the root attacks, he would ride it straight to the deer... and pierce it in one blow. Cha Eui-jae shouted.\n\"Hey! Dumbass!\"\nThe swaying root paused for a moment, and the deer roared, shaking the entire garden. The root lunged at Cha Eui-jae with ferocious speed.\nAt that moment.\nA gloved hand appeared behind Cha Eui-jae, covering his mouth and nose, yet he made no effort to remove it. There was a sense of urgency. Simultaneously, a black hand touched the tree root aiming to pierce Cha Eui-jae.\nThe tree root froze. It began to rot black from the point of contact.",

      "content": "Chapter 41: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\nThe scent of fresh flowers that had filled the area was now overwhelmed by the sweet fragrance emanating from Lee Sa-young. The sound of his heart pounding as if it were about to explode gradually subsided.\nWhen Lee Sa-young touched the root he was holding, the last remaining stem withered and became poisonous. Even though he had only used his ability once, the garden of life had turned into a pitch-black poisonous swamp. Only after confirming that there was nothing left alive did Lee Sa-young murmur.\n\"What were you thinking, challenging the master of the rift? ...You said he was under a weakening curse.\"\nThe latter part didn't seem to be directed at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"That's exactly my point, Guild Leader.\"\nSeo Min-gi, who was standing behind for a while, quickly chimed in. He was wearing something that looked like an oxygen mask. Cha Eui-jae lightly slapped away Lee Sa-young's hand, which was covering his nose and mouth.\n'Are you going to let go?'\nWith that intention, he glared at Lee Sa-young, who spoke without even turning around.\n\"Hey, give me that.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"You have a spare, right? Give it to me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I know you stockpiled.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nA human-sized shadow appeared out of nowhere, carrying a small oxygen mask over its head, and wobbled over. Lee Sa-young nodded his head.\n\"Make it bigger.\"\nThe shadow quickly grew to the size of an adult man. It handed the oxygen mask to Cha Eui-jae before melting away.\n[Artisan's Mass-Produced Oxygen Mask (A)]\n[Wearing it in a poisoned area detoxifies a certain level of poison and helps with breathing. Better than nothing.]\n[Creator: Hong Ye-seong]\nLee Sa-young whispered.\n\"Put it on as soon as I let go.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Blink to answer.\"\nThis guy is full of commands. When Cha Eui-jae glared fiercely at him again, Lee Sa-young, annoyed, replied.\n\"If you don't want to cough up blood again, listen.\"\nNo, I have basilisk venom. Not mentioning one trait has come back as a huge burden on Cha Eui-jae.\nHaving no choice, Cha Eui-jae blinked. Lee Sa-young released his hand. Anyway, since he was given the item, it was only natural to use it, so Cha Eui-jae put the mask on his face. Thanks to the hard work of the basilisk venom, there wasn't much change whether he used it or not.\nThe surroundings became very quiet. Just when his heart seemed to calm down a bit, it started pounding loudly again. It was so loud that Lee Sa-young, standing right behind him, could hear it. A strange anxiety rose from his toes. Cha Eui-jae deliberately took a slightly deeper breath. Without even that sound, it felt like the recently disappeared anxiety would consume him.\nThen a strong arm wrapped around Cha Eui-jae's shoulder and pulled him closer. With his head lowered, Lee Sa-young whispered in his ear.\n\"Take a deep breath.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You're in shock right now, Hyung.\"\nNo, this isn't a shock. How many monsters have I seen? Cha Eui-jae was just...\nAnxious.\nTap, tap, a small hand patted his shoulder in a steady rhythm. The faint noise penetrated the silence and his breathing. He felt his fiercely beating heart gradually calming down. Cha Eui-jae exhaled a long breath. As his mind started to clear a bit, Cha Eui-jae became curious.\n'Why is Lee Sa-young here?'\nWhy would he come to a grade 5 rift? Even if he got a call, he could easily ignore it. No, he's the kind of guy who would ignore it, he's Lee Sa-young.\nAs the arm around his shoulder fell away, Cha Eui-jae turned to look at Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young was putting his gloves back on. He glanced at Cha Eui-jae's face and smirked as if he understood his thoughts.\n\"You look like you've seen a ghost.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You didn't think I'd come?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"There's no reason for you to.\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slightly.\n\"Hyung, you really...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Have no faith in people.\"\nAlthough his tone was as low as usual, it somehow felt mocking. Is this something to talk about trust? It was a rational conclusion. Feeling awkward, Cha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck.\n\"So why did you come?\"\n\"I came to get you out.\"\nLee Sa-young answered and nodded towards the pitch-black poisonous swamp.\n\"But to think you were fighting the master of the rift.\"\nDamn it. I should've killed it and escaped first, regardless of torn clothes. Just as Cha Eui-jae's face crumpled, Seo Min-gi shouted from afar.\n\"Guild Leader! It's good to take care of your customers, but there's something you need to consider!\"\nLee Sa-young glanced back.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Since you melted the master of the rift instantly, there's a possibility that the rift stone it held also melted!\"\nAs if waiting for that moment, the entire rift began to shake. The ground, the sky, even the air twisted. Seo Min-gi shrugged.\n\"It's already starting. Could I borrow your shadow?\"\nThe rift stone is a type of magic stone cherished by the rift's master. Breaking it causes the rift to disappear. It's different from an exit appearing when the master dies. When a rift disappears, everyone inside is flung out to where the entrance was. Corpses and survivors alike.\nWhich means that survivors would see the corpses of other victims caught with them right in front of them. Bodies torn by monsters are horrifying, so rescue teams usually evacuate survivors before destroying the rift to minimize psychological trauma.\nFortunately, there shouldn't be any casualties this time... But Cha Eui-jae had another problem.\n'If this continues, I'll run into the rescue team!'\nCha Eui-jae looked around in shock and made eye contact with Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young also shrugged.\n\"Unexpected situation. What do we do now?\"\n\"What do you mean, what do we do?\"\nCha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young by the collar. He looked straight into his violet eyes through the lenses and spoke word by word.\n\"You don't want them to catch you for destroying the rift stone, do you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Memorize what I say next in one go. We need to get our stories straight.\"\nLee Sa-young's lips gradually curled into a smile as he listened to Cha Eui-jae's words.\n***\nYang Hye-jin, who had been spat out of the rift as if ejected, kept blinking her blurry eyes, trying to focus. Her stomach churned as if she had ridden a roller coaster fifty times in a row, and her entire body ached as if she'd been beaten repeatedly with a bat. Amid the dizziness, she had only one thought.\n'Lee Sa-young, that crazy bastard...'\nWhy on earth did he destroy the rift before the rescue operation was complete? With her face scrunched up, Yang Hye-jin barely managed to lift her upper body off the ground, using her hands for support. The forced ejection from the rift still felt awful. She could hear the busy footsteps of people around her.\n\"All hunters who entered the rift have returned!\"\n\"The... The rift's disappearance has been confirmed!\"\n\"Checking the survivors.\"\n\"How did they defeat the rift's master so quickly? They were in there for less than 30 minutes.\"\nAs she looked around amidst the commotion, Yang Hye-jin saw that the rift management office hunters who had entered with her were groaning and unconscious, unable to withstand the sudden ejection. Being an A-grade, Yang Hye-jin was the first to regain her senses.\nAs she leaned over, still feeling nauseous from the dizziness, a pair of black shoes stopped near her face. She frowned and looked up.\nJung Bin stood there with a gentle smile. Was Jung Bin the support staff from the Awakened Management Bureau? If she had known it was him, she would have held onto that rascal Lee Sa-young a bit longer before entering the rift.\n\"Are you alright? Yang Hye-jin-ssi.\"\n\"Yes... I feel like throwing up, but I'll be fine soon.\"\nJung Bin offered his hand to help her up. Yang Hye-jin grabbed his hand and stood up, looking around. Following her gaze, Jung Bin asked.\n\"Are you looking for someone?\"\n\"Guild Leader Lee Sa-young... Where is he now?\"\nThis couldn't be overlooked. It was against the hunter's code of conduct to destroy the rift before the rescue was complete. What if there had been casualties and the survivors were forced to see the dead bodies? Jung Bin, with an awkward smile, pointed behind him.\n\"He's over there. But...\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Well, I did question him once, but... it seems he had a reasonable reason for doing so. I think you'll understand once you see it.\"\nJung Bin stepped aside slightly. Several ambulances were lined up in the district office parking lot. Sitting at the very edge, with legs crossed, was a dark figure— clearly Lee Sa-young.\nHe was surprisingly neat for someone who had entered a rift, with a bright orange emergency blanket draped over his shoulder as a sign of the last bit of decency. Beside Lee Sa-young sat someone else.\nThe face looked oddly familiar.\n'...Huh?'\nThe young man with a cool and neat appearance was huddled under an orange blanket, leaning on Lee Sa-young. His slightly sweaty bangs were disheveled and stuck to his forehead, and his face was particularly pale. Yang Hye-jin recognized the face well.\nThat's right... She had just eaten hangover soup made by that young man the night before! Yang Hye-jin cautiously asked,\n\"The one next to Lee Sa-young, isn't he the part-timer from the alley hangover soup restaurant?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nJung Bin nodded.\n\"The part-timer awakened recently and came to get an inspection... and got caught up in this incident.\"\n\"Oh, my...\"\nYang Hye-jin sincerely felt sorry as she checked her wristwatch. It was time for the hangover soup restaurant's ingredient preparation. Despite being busy, he had managed to make time to come for registration, only to end up in such a situation. Yang Hye-jin sighed deeply at the heartbreaking news of the kind and diligent young man. Jung Bin continued,\n\"According to Lee Sa-young, the rift's master this time had a power that attracted awakeners. Originally, we were supposed to stay near the master to buy time until the rescue was over, but when Lee Sa-young arrived, the part-timer, who had already been captivated, was right in front of the master...\"\n\"Does that mean he killed it?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nAn incident that happened while trying to save someone... Yang Hye-jin frowned and groaned, then let out another deep sigh.\n\"...Normally, this wouldn't just pass, but since it was done to save someone, there's not much to say.\"\n\"Haha, right? But rules are rules, so there will still be a fine.\"\nJung Bin said brightly, looking at the ambulance with warm eyes. Yang Hye-jin furrowed her brows after a moment of silence.\n\"But... is it okay to leave the part-timer next to Lee Sa-young like that? He must have used his ability to deal with the master. Couldn't it negatively affect the patient...\"\n\"I don't know about that.\"\n\"Can you say that so casually?\"\n\"I did bring it up, but Lee Sa-young glared at me as if he would kill me, so I ran away. Hahaha...\"\nJung Bin shrugged and laughed. Yang Hye-jin stared at him with a sideways glance, then spotted a newbie retching and quickly ran over.\nA little distance away, in the ambulance, Cha Eui-jae, leaning on Lee Sa-young's shoulder, was performing the trick of speaking without moving his lips.\n\"Did they buy it?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 42: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\n\"Did they buy it?\"\nThe voice was almost a whisper, so quiet it was nearly ASMR. Even considering it was ventriloquism, it was very faint. Only someone like the S-grade guy right next to him could hear it. Lee Sa-young, who was sitting cross-legged next to Cha Eui-jae, answered just as quietly.\n\"Yes, well. I heard it happened while trying to save someone, so what can I say?\"\n\"That's good.\"\n\"Well, there might be a fine to pay.\"\n\"...There's even a fine?\"\n\"Hunters only listen when there's a punishment.\"\nWell, Lee Sa-young was right. The only way to control powerful and capable hunters was through strong restraints and the law. On the surface, Lee Sa-young was at the center of this commotion, so he would be the one to be disciplined. Cha Eui-jae deliberately let out a groan.\n\"Hiding the fact that I'm registered is out the window now.\"\nThe best plan was to get through this without anyone discovering he was registered. But getting caught up in the sudden appearance of the rift had turned everything to dust. Cha Eui-jae muttered to himself.\n\"Is Seo Min-gi really capable of changing my grade?\"\n\"If he couldn't do that... he wouldn't be worth the money.\"\nLee Sa-young's answer brought back the last image of Seo Min-gi in Eui-jae's mind.\nBefore the rift vanished, Seo Min-gi had been pacing nervously before jumping right into Cha Eui-jae's shadow. Before Cha Eui-jae could even ask what he was doing, Seo Min-gi's head popped out of the shadow to explain.\n\"I'm supposed to be in the Jongno 3-ga dungeon with the Vice-Guild Leader right now. If people see me, it'll be a disaster. I'll be mobbed. Getting cursed out might extend my lifespan by twenty years, don't you think?\"\n\"Hey, I'm not supposed to be here either.\"\n\"It's okay, sir. You just awakened and came here for a bit. It'll be fine. By the way, what rank did you get?\"\n\"It's a failure.\"\n\"I figured. The computer probably got caught up in this too. That makes things easier.\"\n\"Are you going to use that 'last resort' or whatever?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nSeo Min-gi's head bobbed up and down.\n\"The computer being broken doesn't mean everything's okay. The records will still be online. They get transferred to the Awakened Management Bureau's data center as soon as they're measured. Since the rift happened at just the right time, no one would have thought to look at them. If we alter them quickly, it's solved.\"\n\"Is that alteration really a minor thing?\"\n\"Don't worry too much. I'll make sure you're registered as a D-grade Awakened. Now, I must go!\"\nHe boldly gave a thumbs up and slowly sank back into the shadow like a scene from a movie... Cha Eui-jae laughed at the memory.\n'Is everyone in the Pado Guild a lunatic...'\nConsidering the Guild Leader Lee Sa-young was weird himself, it made sense. Cha Eui-jae couldn't tell how long he'd have to lie there. He planned to get up when the presence of Jung Bin and Yang Hye-jin disappeared, but more people kept arriving, indicating the situation had escalated. More ambulances arrived, their sirens blaring louder.\nSeveral people approached, but seeing who was with him, they didn't come any closer. Cha Eui-jae realized even the presence of Lee Sa-young was effective.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\nInstead of answering, Lee Sa-young randomly said his name. Was he asking to be called by name? Cha Eui-jae glanced at him, but the gas mask obscured his expression.\n\"...Alright, Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Sa-young responded absently, the sound of him tapping on his phone reaching Cha Eui-jae's ears. Cha Eui-jae, still with his eyes closed, muttered.\n\"Does it look like Jung Bin plans to leave yet?\"\nLee Sa-young drew out his answer.\n\"He'll probably be here until dawn... It's a bigger deal than expected.\"\nThe worst news. Damn it. As Cha Eui-jae muttered a curse under his breath, something cold touched the back of his neck. He flinched more than he expected, blaming his heightened senses from the fight.\n\"Does it hurt?\"\n\"What?\"\nGloved fingers felt around his neck, then threaded through his hair. The unfamiliar sensation sent chills down his spine. Shaking it off would instantly draw attention from Jung Bin and Yang Hye-jin. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and muttered.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"You're sweating.\"\n\"Leave it. It'll be fine soon.\"\n\"...\"\nSomething touched Cha Eui-jae's head. Lee Sa-young must have leaned his head against his. The fingers in his hair continued to move gently. Was he stroking it? Cha Eui-jae was bewildered. Why was this guy suddenly doing this?\nHe couldn't figure out Lee Sa-young's behavior. He acted shrewd and cunning one moment, then childishly the next, messing with people and then suddenly backing off...\n\"You really are a crazy bastard, you know that.\"\nForget it. There's no need to overthink it. This guy is just a jerk. Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes a sliver. He didn't want to hear such disgraceful words from the craziest of the crazy.\n\"Are you picking a fight?\"\n\"You're a damn good liar too.\"\n\"In the service industry, you make a living by lying.\"\n\"What a lame excuse.\"\n\"Don't dig too deep. Knowing too much will hurt you.\"\nLee Sa-young chuckled lowly. The fingers in Cha Eui-jae's hair moved more gently. Maybe it was because he was so tense, but for the first time in a long while, he felt the onset of sleep.\n\"You're really suspicious.\"\n\"So what if I am... You've already made a contract with me.\"\n\"Yeah. Why did I sign a contract with someone as suspicious as you...\"\nThe fingers tapped the back of his neck. Smelling Lee Sa-young's sweet scent, Cha Eui-jae almost closed his eyes when...\n'Damn it.'\nHe thought of the hangover soup restaurant.\nHis hazy mind snapped to attention. Cha Eui-jae's body stiffened as he straightened up. Lee Sa-young, noticing the change, stopped moving his hand in Cha Eui-jae's hair. Cha Eui-jae muttered seriously.\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Hmm? What is it?\"\nThey were in the back seat of an ambulance. The paramedics were busy attending to other survivors, and no one approached the ambulance because of Lee Sa-young.\n\"Do you know how to drive?\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"I've been too busy to get a license. Do you have one?\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae gestured to the steering wheel, Lee Sa-young blinked before letting out a laugh.\n\"See, you're definitely crazy.\"\n***\nWhat followed happened quickly. Well, not without some incidents, but they made it to the hangover soup restaurant on time, which was a success by Cha Eui-jae's standards.\nUnfortunately, Lee Sa-young didn't have a license either, and it was too far to run from Gwangjin-gu center to the restaurant. Grabbing a taxi was out of the question since the roads were all blocked. Cha Eui-jae seriously considered hijacking the ambulance.\nLee Sa-young, who had been lying down until just before, was watching Cha Eui-jae's frantic planning with interest.\n\"Do we really have to go?\"\n\"Yes, absolutely.\"\n\"That's an obsession.\"\n\"Shut up and think of a way.\"\n\"...Well, there is a way.\"\nPropping his chin up, Lee Sa-young pulled something out of his inventory and handed it to Cha Eui-jae. It was a crumpled A4 paper.\n\"...Trash?\"\n\"It's not trash. It's Hong Ye-seong's masterpiece. Read the description first.\"\n[Artisan's Emergency Escape Button Prototype (S-)]\n[Tear this to move to your desired location. However, it cannot be used in rifts or dungeons, and it's single-use.]\n[Creator: Hong Ye-seong]\n...What the hell. Why is something called a button shaped like an A4 sheet? When Cha Eui-jae asked, Lee Sa-young shrugged.\n\"He made it look like trash so Jung Bin wouldn't confiscate it.\"\nWhy would you make an item look like this for that reason? Cha Eui-jae's head filled with more questions, but the existence of this item was amazing news. Cha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young's arm with his right hand and held the escape button with his left. Then he bit into the paper and tore it in half.\nThe noisy surroundings faded as they were whisked away.\nA moment later, before he even opened his eyes, Cha Eui-jae smelled a familiar scent and his eyes shot open. Hong Ye-seong's masterpiece was no joke.\n\"Who knew something like this existed.\"\n\"I told you it wasn't trash.\"\n\"Oh, the broth!\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly set aside his gratitude for the paper button that had brought him to the restaurant in seconds and rushed to the kitchen.",

      "content": "Chapter 43: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\nReassured that the store was intact, Cha Eui-jae headed to the kitchen to check on the broth. Though it had reduced a bit... it was still manageable. Lee Sa-young, who had followed behind him, peeked over Cha Eui-jae's shoulder.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Be quiet.\"\nAlthough Cha Eui-jae didn't particularly follow any religion, today he decided to thank Buddha. He remembered the warm smile painted on Seo Min-gi's fan. And he also recalled the terrible things he had done to Buddha. After silently expressing his gratitude and apologies multiple times, he slowly opened his eyes.\n\"You don't look like a religious person, yet here you are.\"\n\"Shut up, it's just for today.\"\n\"So a fake believer.\"\nCha Eui-jae silently prayed for forgiveness for Lee Sa-young's disrespect, not for Lee Sa-young's sake but to avoid any misfortune that might befall him standing nearby.\nStepping out of the kitchen, Cha Eui-jae grabbed an apron and began preparing for the business. He called out to Lee Sa-young.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\nDarn it... Cha Eui-jae glanced briefly at the gas mask but complied with Lee Sa-young's request, remembering the favor of being quickly brought here.\n\"Lee Sa-young, don't touch anything in the kitchen.\"\n\"Can't I even look around?\"\n\"Do you want to be responsible for a mass poisoning at a hangover soup restaurant?\"\n\"I'm wearing a gas mask and gloves.\"\nLee Sa-young wiggled his fingers, showing off the black leather gloves, but obediently left the kitchen. Cha Eui-jae glanced at his back and began pulling out the necessary ingredients.\n\"Lee Sa-young—\"\n\"Yes, what?\"\n\"What time is it now?\"\n\"4:40.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hyung?\"\n20 minutes until opening?\nCha Eui-jae slowly surveyed the kitchen. The evening shift was much busier than the morning. Recently, they had been hosting debates about J at the hangover soup restaurant, which increased the customer traffic significantly. After a brief moment of composure, he looked at Lee Sa-young standing in the hall.\nHe had an awful thought: 'Would it be okay since he's wearing a gas mask and gloves?' Cha Eui-jae shook his head vigorously. The potential disaster and the fact that Lee Sa-young might be disastrous in the kitchen couldn't be ignored. Lee Sa-young likely understood this and had willingly stepped out of the way.\nJust as Cha Eui-jae was lamenting the potential downfall of his diligent operation principles at the hangover soup restaurant, someone exclaimed.\n\"Hey— I'm back.\"\n\"...\"\n\"This is the hangover soup restaurant that the Vice-Guild Leader frequents! Congratulations on escaping safely from the field, customer!\"\nA round figure popped out from Cha Eui-jae's shadow. Seo Min-gi's lively appearance, with a hand shading his eyes as he looked around, captivated Cha Eui-jae. He urgently grabbed Seo Min-gi's wrist.\n\"Seo Min-gi-ssi.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Can you handle a knife?\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"No, it's fine if you can't. As an A-grade, you should be decent enough.\"\n\"Customer, that might be a generalization error.\"\nSeo Min-gi timidly protested but was ignored by the monstrous hangover soup restaurant employee, Cha Eui-jae. He slammed down a wooden cutting board and a knife with a loud thud and gestured to Seo Min-gi.\n\"Chop these cheongyang peppers and put them in this container.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"You can get an apron from over there.\"\n\"Excuse me? Okay.\"\n\"If you start tearing up, I'll lend you some goggles, but for now, just chop. We don't have time.\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae's eyes blazed while giving detailed instructions, Seo Min-gi, still confused, realized there was no escape and nodded hesitantly.\n\"Could you put down the knife while you speak?\"\n\"Are you afraid I'll stab you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's more efficient to prepare for business than to wipe your blood, so let's move quickly.\"\nApparently, this customer had a knack for saying scary things casually. But Seo Min-gi, a man of perseverance, had one more duty to fulfill.\n\"Customer, could you lift the curse of weakening before we start?\"\n\"It won't affect the business. We'll do it tonight.\"\nHearing that made Seo Min-gi almost collapse again. He had no idea why, but the image of his ruthless boss's dark gas mask overlapped with the customer's face who nonchalantly ordered him to work overtime.\nSeo Min-gi pulled out a long, rectangular piece of leather from his pocket, indicating he had a scroll.\n\"If you cut here in the middle with that knife...\"\n\"This is a kitchen knife.\"\n\"...Then use something else, please.\"\nCha Eui-jae bent slightly and retrieved a small pair of scissors from inside. It was part of Park Ha-eun's stationery set and had been conveniently used as a parcel opener. The handle had a cute ribbon pattern, contrasting with the stern face of the busy restaurant worker.\nSnip—\nAs the leather was cut, Cha Eui-jae felt noticeably lighter.\nHe looked at Seo Min-gi to see if it was okay now, and Seo Min-gi nodded vigorously and quickly put on an apron from a basket in the corner of the kitchen. Cha Eui-jae also washed his hands thoroughly and put on a sanitary hat, apron, and gloves.\nIt was fortunate that he had set the rice cooker before heading to the center. He opened the rice cooker and began scooping rice into stainless steel bowls.\n[Unique Trait: Hands of a Master (S+) activated.]\n[You have reached the maximum proficiency of the trait.]\nCha Eui-jae frowned. Maximum proficiency or not, he had no time to deal with a white notification window in such a hurry.\n'Don't obstruct my view.'\nIgnoring the system notification, he continued to scoop rice diligently. Suddenly, fireworks burst in front of his eyes.\n[Congratulations! You have unlocked a new trait!]\n[You have acquired the trait: Battle Integrated into Life (S).]\nA person who gains a new trait while scooping rice. That was Cha Eui-jae. He unexpectedly obtained an S-grade trait that every hunter longed for, but his expression was anything but pleased. It was suspicious, and he had no time to check its details with the opening of the store imminent.\n'Don't bother me and disappear.'\nThe system, perhaps knowing this, kindly displayed an explanation.\n[Trait: Battle Integrated into Life (S)]\n[For you, household chores are a battle. A trait for those who cannot give up on either housework or combat. When performing actions classified as housework, your attack power, attack speed, and agility increase.]\nIt was too good to ignore. Cha Eui-jae paused his rapid rice scooping.\n'Actions classified as housework?'\nHousework would include cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. So... Cha Eui-jae looked at the rice scoop in his hand. Cooking is housework. It was natural that scooping rice into bowls to set the table was included in housework.\n[Trait: Battle Integrated into Life (S) activated.]\nThe notification confirmed he was correct. His hand holding the wooden scoop felt lighter. With this trait, opening the store at 5 PM seemed possible! He resumed scooping rice, his hand moving as if dancing.\nMeanwhile, behind him, Seo Min-gi was near tears, agonizing over the question: \"How big should I chop the cheongyang peppers?\" He wished he had an example to follow, but all he had was a cutting board, cheongyang peppers, and a knife. Just as he decided to remove the stems, clad in nitrile gloves, he felt a chill down his spine.\n'There's something...'\nThe intensity and pressure were overwhelming, making it impossible to look back. He was sure only the customer was behind him, but how could the atmosphere change so drastically? Was the customer so furious about potentially missing the opening time? Could it be he was planning to deal with him for not performing well?\nHe needed to confirm, but the overwhelming intensity was terrifying. Seo Min-gi swallowed hard.\n'No! No matter how angry he is, he won't kill me.'\nDidn't Cha Eui-jae himself say it was more efficient to prepare for business than to kill him? Though slightly distorted, the meaning was similar. The intense aura was growing stronger. Trusting in the customer's words, Seo Min-gi cautiously turned his head. And,\nSeo Min-gi's mouth fell open.\n'Oh...'\nCha Eui-jae was still scooping rice from the industrial rice cooker.\nTatatatatatatatatata—\nBut very quickly. So fast his arms seemed to multiply!\n'...Asura1?'\nIt seemed a golden halo was shining behind him. He looked like he was performing a dance with a rice scoop, not a knife. Finishing, Cha Eui-jae sent the rice bowls flying like shurikens. Tatatatatata. Every bowl landed perfectly on the table. If the producer of Master of Living Skills saw this, they would beg him to appear on their show.\n'Is this... the hangover soup pro?'\nIt felt too precious to witness alone! This should be recorded for posterity. Just as Seo Min-gi subtly reached for his phone, he heard a voice.\n\"Seo Min-gi.\"\n\"Yes, cus... Guild Leader?\"\nStartled, Seo Min-gi jumped in place. At the boundary between the kitchen and the hall stood an incongruous figure, Lee Sa-young. Although he had escaped with the customer, Seo Min-gi didn't expect him to be in the restaurant, leaving him stammering.\n\"Why not do the job properly?\"\n\"Still, I don't know how finely to cut these...\"\nSeo Min-gi stammered, and a small sigh came from behind the gas mask. He was genuinely wondering if he needed to master more than 30 skills required to run a hangover soup restaurant.\n\"That rice.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"Move it.\"\nWhen Lee Sa-young pointed to the warming cupboard, Seo Min-gi quickly moved towards the mountain of rice bowls. The hangover soup restaurant part-timer, who had become a crazy master of household chores, focused solely on his tasks without any small complaints. As Seo Min-gi put all the rice bowls in the warming cupboard, he wiped his tears with his sleeve and spoke with a hint of frustration.\n\"But, well... I did get the job done quickly.\"\n\"I matched the grade you requested perfectly. This time, without any mistakes.\"\n\"Mhm, good job.\"\nSeo Min-gi froze in shock, having been prepared to vent about his daily suffering under a tyrannical boss. He looked disbelieving and finally managed to ask again.\n\"Excuse me? I didn't hear you well?\"\nBut the gas mask, which had been facing him just a moment ago, had already turned towards the customer. Seo Min-gi felt a wave of gratitude, realizing that small miracles do happen, even in his guild life.",

      "content": "Chapter 44: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\nA few days after the commotion.\nCha Eui-jae was serving hangover soup to the zombies who had come as soon as he opened the shop, when he noticed a strange man loitering at the door. The man was wearing a cap pulled down low and a thick jacket with \"Delivery\" written on it.\n'What's this?'\nPark Ha-eun, grandmother, and Cha Eui-jae usually bought most of what they needed directly from the mart, and they didn't do delivery sales of hangover soup. There was no reason for a delivery person to visit the hangover soup restaurant. Cha Eui-jae put his hand in the pocket of his apron and opened the door with a clatter.\nThe delivery person, who had been loitering, noticed Cha Eui-jae and exclaimed.\n\"Are you Cha Eui-jae, who works at the hangover soup restaurant?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes narrowed as his name came out of the stranger's mouth without warning.\n\"...What is it?\"\nThe delivery person smiled brightly and pointed to a truck covered with a black tarp.\n\"I've got a flower wreath delivery for Cha Eui-jae.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened at the unexpected statement. The delivery person took out a large flower wreath from the truck and set it down in front of the hangover soup restaurant door. The long pink ribbon had the following message written in Gothic font:\n[Like family— The doors of HB Guild are always open. Han Min-joon, HB Guild HR Manager]\nTeam Leader Han. He was someone who occasionally came to the hangover soup restaurant and had tried to recruit Cha Eui-jae several times. It was said among guild members that he had his eyes on Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae had always turned him down with the excuse that he wasn't an Awakener, but Team Leader Han had persistently asked if he would consider joining through the regular process. Cha Eui-jae frowned.\n'Are they trying to promote the guild at my hangover soup restaurant? ...They're shameless!'\nBefore he could fully grasp his indignation, the delivery person took out a second flower wreath from the truck. How many wreaths were delivered? Cha Eui-jae, with a bewildered expression, checked inside the truck. Fortunately, it seemed this was the last one.\nThis flower wreath was the same size as the first but had fewer flowers. Just as Cha Eui-jae thought it seemed more modest, the delivery person stacked three sacks of rice under it. The second flower wreath read:\n[Congratulations on your Awakening, my fan ♥ From HB Guild's Honeybee, ranked 6th in Korea]\nCha Eui-jae's eyes trembled violently at the unexpected congratulatory message for his Awakening. He pointed cautiously at the sacks of rice.\n\"What... what is all this?\"\n\"Ah, these are rice flower wreaths. They were sent by the HB Guild.\"\nThe delivery person's voice seemed to carry a sense of pride. Rice flower wreaths, really... Cha Eui-jae was at a loss for words, staring blankly at the two wreaths occupying the customer waiting area.\n'...Is this some kind of new business disruption tactic?'\nShould he take a photo and report it this time? He had already met Jung Bin many times, and Jung Bin's signature was posted inside the shop. Given that Jung Bin already knew Cha Eui-jae's name, he had nothing to lose by reporting this Hunter harassment to the Awakened Management Bureau.\nAs he was still in a daze from the wreath assault, a piece of paper and a pen were thrust in front of him. The delivery person kindly clicked the pen and said,\n\"We need a signature from the recipient for confirmation. Please sign here.\"\nSeveral Hunters, who had escaped from being zombies after consuming hangover soup, noticed the commotion and stuck their heads out the door. With their excellent eyesight, they seemed to have read the message on the wreath, and one unshaven Hunter shouted gruffly,\n\"Hey, part-timer! Did you Awaken?\"\nOh no, he was screwed. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth.\nThe hangover soup restaurant, which had been briefly engulfed in silence, quickly became noisy again. Zombies crowded around the door, chattering noisily.\n\"The part-timer Awakened?\"\n\"Why didn't you tell us!\"\n\"Whoa, is that wreath from Honeybee?\"\n\"Team Leader Han has been eyeing him for a while, and now he sent a wreath immediately. That's intense.\"\n\"So he's registered then!\"\n\"Wow, congrats! What grade did you get?\"\n\"Our part-timer was amazing even before Awakening. He must've gotten at least a B-grade.\"\nWhile congratulating him, the Hunters started speculating about his grade, soon moving on to the most important topic.\n\"...Wait a minute, if the part-timer joins a guild, who will run the hangover soup restaurant?\"\n\"Won't his grandmother do it?\"\n\"His grandmother's legs have been hurting, and the part-timer has been working alone for a while.\"\n\"No way, they're not closing the hangover soup restaurant, right?\"\n\"Maybe they'll hire a new part-timer?\"\nBang! The sudden loud noise quieted everyone down.\n\"Hey, don't make so much noise in front of a newly Awakened person! Don't you know the Hunter world's unspoken rule?\"\n\"Yeah, didn't you see the news recently? A newly Awakened person demolished a building. Loud noises can make them anxious, so be careful.\"\nThey were treating him like a bomb. The noisy voices quickly hushed, but Cha Eui-jae heard everything clearly. Amid the hushed atmosphere, one proud voice stood out.\n\"...Isn't the part-timer one of us? We should help him adjust. That's what seniors do.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who was once the idol of everyone, now had to endure being treated like a fledgling by juniors. He scribbled his signature carelessly on the receipt to quickly send the delivery person, the cause of all this chaos, on his way, hoping this would resolve everything.\nHowever, Cha Eui-jae's hardships were far from over, as a series of absurd situations awaited him from the very next day.\nFirst Incident:\nAfter a hectic lunch service, Cha Eui-jae opened the door wide during the ingredient preparation time to ventilate the place. What he saw was horrifying.\n[Congratulations on the Awakening of our proud hangover soup restaurant part-timer]\n[From the regulars of the hangover soup restaurant]\nHe stared blankly at the colorful banner strung between the electric pole and the tree in front of the hangover soup restaurant. Who had put up such a thing? He wanted to find out their names and faces, but they hid behind the anonymity of \"the regulars.\" Cowards. Cha Eui-jae summoned Nexby for the first time in a while.\n\"Hi Nexby, search if it's okay to remove a banner.\"\n—Searching if it's okay to remove a banner.\n—Even if the banner is illegal, removing it without permission can be considered property damage according to the law.\nWhy would he get punished for removing an illegal banner? Cha Eui-jae clutched his head in frustration.\nSecond Incident:\nA day after the banner incident, during the ingredient preparation time again.\n'...How did it come to this?'\nAt 2:10 PM, he should have been preparing for the dinner service with the sign \"If you came before 5, please leave\" (not the actual message). But instead, he was sitting quietly on a cart. Because,\n\"Everyone, line up! Show the orderliness of senior Hunters in front of a newly Awakened!\"\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\nA long line had formed in front of him. A new Hunter from the Rift Management Bureau was shaking a safety bar, organizing the line. Memories from a distant past resurfaced. It reminded him of a popular idol's fan signing event he had once seen on YouTube before the Rift Incident.\n'I'd rather fight a hundred monsters.'\nCha Eui-jae felt as if he were an idol and his stiff mouth twitched in a forced smile.\n\"I heard you Awakened, part-timer. Here's a gift for you.\"\nA Hunter, as big as a Russian bear, shyly handed him a small pink box. Behind him were several more Hunters, peeking like enoki mushrooms. They all had expectant faces. Cha Eui-jae accepted the box with a lifeless smile. The wrapping paper had an emotional message in a fancy font.\n[A gift box for the newly Awakened ♥]\nIt was the top-ranked item in the Hunter category of the messenger's gift shop, which he had browsed out of boredom. It seemed like just a marketing scheme. Cha Eui-jae calmly untied the ribbon and opened the lid. A card with a flower bouquet illustration was neatly placed in the center.\n[For you... Congratulations on your Awakening.]\n'The congratulation is... a bit late.'\nIt was a congratulation on his Awakening after 11 years. Under the message card was a neatly arranged set of basic potion kits. Cha Eui-jae took out a small red potion and checked the information.\n[Basic Health Recovery Potion (C)]\n[Restores 10% of health upon use.]\nWell, more potions were always welcome. If he had had potions during the recent rift incident, he could have fought like he used to. Cha Eui-jae put the potion in his inventory and bowed his head.\n\"Thank you for the congratulations and the gift.\"\n\"Oh, no! Please continue to make delicious hangover soup.\"\nThe Russian bear scratched his head and slowly stepped back. The enoki mushroom hunters patted his back and cheered. Cha Eui-jae placed the box on a table that someone had brought next to him. The pile of gifts had already formed a small mound. The next person in line was Honeybee, with her shiny blonde hair flowing.\n\"Did you receive the flower wreath? I saw it placed nicely in front. Our HB Guild sent it first, right?\"\nShe placed a gift wrapped in golden paper on the counter. Standing next to her was a strict-looking man in a neat suit and glasses, Team Leader Han. He nodded politely, and Honeybee smiled brightly.\n\"Congratulations on your awakening. This is a gift. We're colleagues now.\"\n\"The wreath was more than enough. You really didn't have to bring a gift.\"\nCha Eui-jae responded with a textbook answer, reading it like a Korean language textbook. Honestly, he felt burdened. However, Honeybee waved her hand as if urging him to open the gift.\n\"Oh, it's not expensive, so just open it.\"\nCha Eui-jae carefully unwrapped the sparkling golden wrapping paper. Inside the packaging were...\n[Change Your Color! Kraken Ink Black]\n[Change Your Color! Volcanic Magma Red]\n[Change Your Color! Queen Bee Royal Jelly Yellow]\nThese were the hunter-specific hair dyes that Honeybee advertised. They were high-quality dyes made from dungeon byproducts, strong enough even for the resilient hair of hunters. Especially the black one, which contained 0.0001% Kraken ink and cost a million won each!\nCha Eui-jae's financial situation meant he could never afford such items, yet here they were. It made him realize just how impressive an advertising model Honeybee was.\n\"Well, an employee might also want an image change. Try it out, and if you like it, let me know. I can give you more anytime. If you don't use it, you can sell it on Tomato Market.\"\nWith these, he wouldn't need to use three bottles of regular squid ink hair dye anymore! Honeybee's shining blonde hair seemed to be glowing with a halo.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: The Day You Go Is the Market Day\nCha Eui-jae carefully placed the hair dye on the table and bowed sincerely.\n\"I really like it... Thank you.\"\n\"I knew you would.\"\nHoneybee struck a pose just like the one on the side of the hair dye packaging. This time ,Cha Eui-jae clapped sincerely as well. After enjoying the attention for a while, she suddenly remembered something.\n\"Oh, by the way, the rice wreath is great too. I paid extra to get premium Icheon rice. As soon as I heard the news this morning, Team Leader Han and I...\"\n\"Where did you hear the news?\"\nCha Eui-jae was most curious about that. Where did Honeybee and Team Leader Han, who sent the first wreath, hear the news? And what about the other hunters who came in droves, pretending to bring gifts but actually trying to persuade him not to close the hangover soup restaurant? Honeybee, who had her eyes wide open, soon nodded in understanding.\n\"Team Leader Han, explain.\"\n\"Yes, understood.\"\nTeam Leader Han adjusted his glasses and began to explain.\n\"Guilds plant informants or scouts at the Awakening Centers. It's to scout talent quickly and efficiently. If there's a promising talent, they report immediately and start laying the groundwork for recruitment.\"\n\"I don't think I'm that promising.\"\n\"How could you say that? Cha Eui-jae-ssi, you were the kind of talent we wanted in our guild even before your awakening.\"\nTeam Leader Han spoke firmly. Honeybee added to the explanation.\n\"Normally, scouts only look at government-run centers, right? They barely pay attention to temporary centers like the one in Gwangjin-gu. The quality is much better at government-run centers.\"\nThat made sense. Awakeners who wanted to show off their abilities and get higher grades would get thoroughly examined at government-run centers. Team Leader Han continued.\n\"But then a rift appeared in the Gwangjin-gu temporary center. In the middle of the city, no less, and it appeared without warning at the awakening center, so all eyes were on that place. It was naturally a matter of public concern.\"\nOf course, if an unexpected rift appeared that even the Rift Management Bureau hadn't predicted, it would cause anxiety. This time, it happened to appear in an awakening center, so everyone's attention was inevitably drawn there.\n\"Everyone started gathering information. That's when we found Cha Eui-jae-ssi's name on the survivor list.\"\nSo, if not for the rift, he could have quietly registered and slipped out as planned.\nAs he listened, Cha Eui-jae felt a vein on his forehead bulge, heat rising. According to Team Leader Han, it was all ruined because of that damn rift. The butterfly effect of the rift was so great that it ended up sitting Cha Eui-jae in a hangover soup restaurant fan signing event.\n'Damn rift.'\nThe fan signing event ended in an hour. Cha Eui-jae, unable to even think of clearing the gifts, staggered to the kitchen to prepare for the evening business, feeling drained.\nMoreover, that evening, Jung Bin's busy self made a personal visit, draining Cha Eui-jae's remaining energy.\n\"Hello? Congratulations on your awakening.\"\nWhat Jung Bin handed over was an envelope with the Awakened Management Bureau's logo on it. It looked so official that he didn't even want to touch it. Bae Won-woo, who was sitting in the corner eating hangover soup, grumbled.\n\"What's that envelope that looks like a summons, a warning, or a fine notice?\"\n\"Haha, no way.\"\n'Guess he's received one before.'\nThere was a nuance only someone who had experienced it firsthand would know. Cha Eui-jae accepted the envelope with a slightly uneasy look. The envelope was thicker and heavier than expected, as if it contained something significant. Jung Bin smiled gently.\n\"Would you like to open it? It's filled with things Cha Eui-jae-ssi will need.\"\n'No thanks.'\nBut his hands dutifully opened the envelope. As expected, it was more or less what he had guessed.\n[Basic Guide for New Hunters]\n[Tax Payment Guide for New Hunters]\n[Welfare Policies for Hunters]\n[One-Touch! How to Use the Hunter Market]\n[Special Laws for Awakeners at a Glance]\nVarious pamphlets and thick books that looked like they belonged in a public office spilled out. Small jeers seemed to come from the surrounding hunters. But Jung Bin still wore a soft smile.\n\"Originally, after completing hunter registration, you would hear various explanations from the Bureau's hunters. But since Cha Eui-jae-ssi couldn't due to the unforeseen accident, I've brought only the essentials.\"\nIf this was just the essentials, being a hunter nowadays must be really complicated. Cha Eui-jae's face filled with melancholy.\n'Damn, being a hunter isn't easy these days.'\n\"Read it when you have time. If there's anything you don't understand or find difficult, please feel free to contact us anytime.\"\nJung Bin pulled a crisp business card from his suit pocket and placed it on top of the pamphlets.\n[Awakened Management Bureau Field Response Team 1]\n[Team Leader Jung Bin]\nFor hunters without power or backing, Jung Bin's business card would be the greatest gift. Despite his friendly image from numerous public service ads, he was an S-grade hunter, ranked fourth in Korea, not easily accessible. The hangover soup restaurant, likely to face hunter-related issues, was no exception. Any regular hunter would be deeply moved, but...\n'I'll just keep it sealed.'\nNot Cha Eui-jae.\nAt that moment, Bae Won-woo stood up confidently.\n\"This is why civil servants don't make it. They call it a gift and just pile up study material! Guys, come in!\"\nWith the sound of clapping, the door of the hangover soup restaurant opened, and people equipped with various gear flooded in. The already crowded restaurant seemed about to burst. Cha Eui-jae squinted his eyes at Bae Won-woo, demanding an explanation.\nBae Won-woo ran his hand through his short hair confidently.\n\"I'm Bae Won-woo, the number one regular at this hangover soup restaurant. I prepared something the restaurant needs most as a gift for your awakening.\"\n'What is that?'\n\"Here it is...\"\nHe proudly gave a thumbs-up.\n\"An automatic kimchi and side dish self-serve bar!\"\n\"An automatic kimchi and side dish self-serve bar?\"\n\"...What's that?\"\nThe hunters unknowingly repeated after him, starting to murmur. Automatic kimchi and side dish self-serve bar. The word combination was akin to soy sauce crab macaron dumpling. It seemed comprehensible yet utterly baffling.\nA self-serve bar couldn't be automatic, could it? Cha Eui-jae's confusion was evident on his face, and Bae Won-woo smiled broadly.\n\"Don't worry. It's a masterpiece meticulously calculated and built by Pado Guild engineers. May we use that space?\"\n\"Yes? Sure.\"\nBae Won-woo pointed to the empty space next to the water dispenser. Nodding, the Pado Guild engineers swarmed over and started assembling something.\nSoon, a white machine was completed on the chair. It looked like a coffee machine from a coffee shop or a larger water dispenser. The center of the machine was a hollow circle.\n\"What is that?\"\n\"Isn't it just a coffee machine?\"\n\"Oh, come on! It's a masterpiece with the blood, sweat, and tears of Pado Guild engineers.\"\nStriding to the machine, Bae Won-woo pulled something out of his inventory; a large thumb-sized magic stone!\n\"Wow, look at the size of that magic stone.\"\n\"It's huge.\"\n\"One of those would be enough to buy a house and then some.\"\nWhile the hunters admired the rare, large magic stone, Bae Won-woo carefully inserted it into the machine. At the same time, the machine's button lit up blue. With a whirring sound, the machine began to operate. Bae Won-woo made an exaggerated bow.\n\"The magic stone support was provided by Guild Leader Lee Sa-young of the Pado Guild.\"\n'What kind of extravagance is this?'\nCha Eui-jae, feeling a sense of déjà vu, watched the magic stone installation show. He thought he'd had the exact same thought before. But since getting something for free wasn't bad, his expression softened.\n\"Now, Part-timer-nim. Try putting kimchi, radish cubes, and chili peppers in here. Just press the button, and the side dishes come out in the exact amount needed. You won't have to handle each one yourself!\"\nOh? This might actually be enticing. Cha Eui-jae, as if entranced, brought the kimchi container and chili pepper container and put them in the machine as instructed by the engineer. The eyes of the hangover soup restaurant's hunters were fixed on Cha Eui-jae.\nIf you hold the bowl and press the button... kimchi is served in the exact amount needed!\n\"Wow!\"\n\"Pado Guild is amazing!\"\n\"Hey, it really works.\"\n\"But if it runs on magic stones, isn't it super cost-inefficient? Wouldn't it be better to connect it to an electric outlet...\"\nWhen someone raised a quibble, Bae Won-woo snapped with a stern face.\n\"Shut up! This is about aesthetics.\"\n\"It feels more like an extravagant display of wealth than aesthetics...\"\n\"If anyone disrespects the hangover soup restaurant, just tell them you have an automatic self-serve bar powered by magic stones.\"\nVisually, it looked like an ad that said, \"In our place, even the water dispenser serves kimchi.\" Regular hunters were thrilled at the idea of lightening the part-timer's workload, cheering enthusiastically.\nHowever,\n\"Come to think of it,\"\n\"Yes?\"\nJung Bin, who had been observing the regular hunters, poured cold water on them with a smiling face.\n\"It looks just like an automatic pet feeder, doesn't it?\"\n***\nThe next day at 5 AM, the sliding door of the hangover soup restaurant creaked open. Cha Eui-jae, his face gaunt and sharp, hastily scribbled a warning on an A4 sheet of paper and stuck it on the door.\n[!!! Hangover Soup Restaurant Stays Open !!!]\n[No wreaths, gifts, or banners allowed.]\n[No asking the part-timer about their grade.]\n[No persuading the part-timer to join a guild.]\n[No headhunting allowed.]\n[Violation of any of the above rules will result in a ban from the restaurant.]",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Fragments of the World\nThe fact that the part-time worker at the hangover soup restaurant had awakened quickly spread through the regular customers' network, and among them, talk of J ceased. And it had long been forgotten that the magic stone seller EZ was suspected to be a resident of this neighborhood.\nAll their attention was focused on \"Congratulations on your awakening, part-timer. But is the hangover soup restaurant closing?\"\nAn awakened hunter should join a good guild, receive full insurance benefits, and get a steady salary. Even if the rank is low, working in the guild's office is better than getting a job in a regular company.\nThis was the common perception, and since most regulars belonged to guilds, this perception was even stronger. Besides, the diligent part-time worker at the hangover soup restaurant would succeed in anything he did, so every guild would try to recruit him.\nBut if he joined a guild... who would make the hangover soup?\nThe owner was an old lady with bad legs who couldn't handle the rapid orders of the hunters alone. Moreover, even if they found a new part-timer, it was uncertain if they could work as well as Cha Eui-jae. After all, his hangover soup had the taste of a master who had been making it for 30 years!\nFortunately for Cha Eui-jae, who wanted to live quietly, he was an irreplaceable talent in the hangover soup world. Thus, the regulars, who held high positions in the Korean hunter society, miraculously reached a consensus among themselves.\nThey called it the secret meeting in the hangover soup restaurant's recycling alley.\nSitting precariously on a plastic box in front of the non-burnable trash, Bae Won-woo downed a protein powder stick in one gulp.\n\"Well, developing talent is good. Scouting is good too. But let's respect professional ethics and keep our feet on the ground, Team Leader Han. If he doesn't want to join a guild, do you think he'll change his mind just because we force him? It's his own will. That's what's important. We need to preserve our hangover soup tradition, don't we?\"\nStanding in front of the burnable trash, Team Leader Han also pushed his glasses up with his middle finger.\n\"It doesn't seem like something to hear from Pado Guild, who claims to be elite yet sweeps up all sorts of talents... but I'm glad to hear it, Vice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo. Let's go in and have a bowl of hangover soup.\"\n\"Wow, I like this guy for the first time. Let's go! Let's order two bottles of soju too.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nVice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo of Pado and HR Team Leader Han of HB Guild shook hands after completing some sort of deal at the recycling station near the hangover soup restaurant. After that, no hunter tried to persuade Cha Eui-jae to join a guild. It was a good thing for Cha Eui-jae.\nInstead, there was a surge of secretive gifts.\nCha Eui-jae, wearing rubber gloves, held up a neatly wrapped gift for everyone to see.\n[Special Limited Edition! Seclusion Training DIY Kit]\n\"Who dropped this in front of the kitchen?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Whoever is about to go into seclusion training, please confess.\"\nSilence. The hunters started to avert their eyes. Cha Eui-jae let out a long sigh. This wasn't a martial arts novel, so what seclusion training? Moreover, the habit of slapping 'DIY' on everything was the same before and after the Day of the Rift. Cha Eui-jae issued a final warning.\n\"If no one comes forward within five minutes, I'll just throw it away.\"\nA hunter suddenly raised his head and shouted.\n\"No! It's a limited edition I barely got through pocketing!\"\n\"Are you going into seclusion training?\"\nCha Eui-jae pointed to a new A4 paper placed next to the two bottles of soju for sale.\n[!!! Hangover Soup Restaurant Stays Open !!!]\n[No wreaths, gifts, or banners allowed.]\n[No asking the part-timer about their rank.]\n[No persuading the part-timer to join a guild.]\n[No headhunting allowed.]\n[Violation of any of the above rules will result in a ban from the restaurant.]\nWill you go into seclusion training, or be banned from the hangover soup restaurant? The hunter groaned, gripping the soju bottle, and after a moment of anguish, squeezed out a voice like a last will.\n\"...I'll go!\"\n\"You, you fool...!\"\n\"How strong do you plan to get?!\"\n\"If you live this diligently, you'll only become an S-grade!\"\nThe hunters at the same table cried out, holding back the hunter who ended up having to enter seclusion training over a wrong gift. Cha Eui-jae calmly returned the seclusion training DIY kit and went back to the kitchen.\nSuch things happen countless times a day. In those brief moments when Cha Eui-jae washed dishes, cooked hangover soup, and prepared ingredients, hunters threw gifts in various ways as if trying to improve Cha Eui-jae's reflexes, agility, and reasoning abilities.\nMost of the time, he returned them to their owners, but occasionally, when he found hunter market gift certificates in the money box at the counter, it was really perplexing. Even Cha Eui-jae was curious about how they managed to put them there.\nWith every day like this, space for storing gifts began to run out. The inventory, which only contained empty potion bottles and basilisks' fangs, was filled with new potions received as gifts, and the small room where Cha Eui-jae stayed started to be taken over by accumulated items. Moreover, excessive gift wrapping generated a lot of trash.\nToday too, after closing the store, Cha Eui-jae was sorting out the gift wraps and boxes. At that moment, he sensed a small presence outside the store.\nIt was hard to dismiss it as just a passerby, as the person had been lingering there since he started washing dishes until now when he was taking out the trash.\n'Who is it this time?'\nIt wasn't a hunter hiding their presence, nor was it an ordinary person lingering around for a long time. It was reaching the point where the unofficial rule was that no one who visited the hangover soup restaurant during preparation or closing hours was normal.\n'If they have something to say, they'll come out on their own.'\nCha Eui-jae bravely stepped outside with the trash. And then,\n\"Are you really going in? Really? Am I really going in? This is so extreme...\"\nHe faced a schoolgirl muttering and biting her nails.\nShe was completely unexpected. Cha Eui-jae had anticipated a TV program writer, a reporter filming hunters, or a hunter secretly leaving a gift, but it was startling to see a student in a thick long padded jacket and heavy backpack pacing back and forth like a grub worm in front of the store.\n'What is this?'\n\"What? Look behind me? No way, don't joke like that. I hate that...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ack!\"\nThe girl glanced back and screamed, collapsing on the spot. Naturally, Cha Eui-jae, who was about to offer a hand to help her up, froze. He realized he was wearing rubber gloves and holding trash. Standing awkwardly, Cha Eui-jae stared at the air for a moment before speaking.\n\"Uh, student?\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"What brings you to a hangover soup restaurant at this hour...\"\nA cold winter wind swept between them. The student shivered involuntarily. Seeing her red nose and cheeks from the cold, Cha Eui-jae gestured towards the store.\n\"I'll throw out the trash, so would you like to wait inside?\"\n\"Can I really?\"\n\"Yes, it's fine.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly disposed of the trash and returned to the store. The student was sitting at a table in a corner, vigorously kneading a green hand warmer. Cha Eui-jae took out a heater and placed it near her, then headed to the kitchen. He couldn't serve coffee at this late hour.\nInstead, he handed her a cup of yulmu tea made with a tea bag in hot water. The student received the cup with both hands and bowed her head.\n\"Thank you, and I'm sorry for coming suddenly.\"\n\"No, it's fine.\"\nThe student bowed her head again, and Cha Eui-jae nodded reluctantly. She had her hair tied up in a bun, wore a long padded jacket, and underneath were gym pants and fuzzy socks, with slightly dirty sneakers. She looked like an ordinary high school student.\nShe was curiously looking around the store. Her appearance, behavior, and even her aura made her seem like a genuinely ordinary high school girl, which eased Cha Eui-jae's tension a bit. He sat across from the student.\n\"What brings a student to a hangover soup restaurant at this hour? Shouldn't you be at home...\"\nCha Eui-jae pondered what reason a high school student might have to visit a hangover soup restaurant this late.\nWas she looking for someone? If so, she must have seen that no one was here. Was she seeking help from something chasing her? If that were the case, she didn't seem frightened or unstable. Maybe she was a fan of a hunter who frequented this place, coming to see their faces.\nAs Cha Eui-jae considered various possibilities, the student spoke up.\n\"Well...\"\nAfter biting her lips, she bowed her head deeply. Then, closing her eyes tightly, she spoke.\n\"I know that Cha Eui-jae-nim is J.\"\nFor a moment, Cha Eui-jae's hands froze. However, he made a face of surprise as if he had heard something ridiculous and laughed awkwardly.\n\"J? What are you talking about...\"\n\"No, you don't have to hide it from me.\"\nShe slowly lifted her head and opened her eyes. Behind her round glasses, her eyes shone with a radiant golden light. They were piercing and intense, as if they could see right through him.\n\"Please help me, J.\"\nThe effort he had put into forcing a smile gradually faded. As his eyebrows and mouth settled back into their natural positions, a cold light appeared.\nA moment later, a perfect expressionless look took over Cha Eui-jae's face.",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Fragments of the World\n\"That person is... as you know, still a minor, and probably doesn't have time for this kind of thing. She's not a combat hunter either.\"\n\"Oh, she's a high school senior, right.\"\n\"Yes. She's preparing for the college entrance exam. She'd probably rather study an extra passage in the exam prep book than enter a rift.\"\nCha Eui-jae recalled the conversation he overheard on the first day Jung Bin barged into the hangover soup restaurant. A high school senior, a minor at a very sensitive time, who hasn't fully started her hunter activities despite being an S-grade hunter. That seemed to be Yoon Ga-eul.\nYoon Ga-eul clenched and unclenched her hands, which were red from the cold. A small shard of glass appeared in her empty palm, shimmering like a kaleidoscope with countless lights.\n\"It's a bit late, but let me introduce myself. My name is Yoon Ga-eul, a senior at Saebom Girls' High School, and I recently awakened as an S-grade mental-type awakener. My ability is...\"\nCha Eui-jae looked at the fragment glowing above Yoon Ga-eul's palm. It seemed like a black light flickered and then disappeared.\n\"...to see fragments of the world.\"\nFor a moment, the atmosphere became so heavy and dense that it was hard to breathe. The strange energy crawled up his legs, back, and nape, suffocating him. Yoon Ga-eul's youthful face turned slightly pale. But after taking a deep breath, she continued speaking resolutely.\n\"Would you believe me if I told you that there are other worlds besides this one?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae did not respond. Yoon Ga-eul smiled somewhat bitterly.\n\"I... see fragments from another world every time I fall asleep. Unintentionally. That world is similar to ours but different. There are many cases where they have the same names and faces but are different people. Watching it is dizzying and confusing, like this shard.\"\nYoon Ga-eul poked the shard with her finger. Even though it existed there, her finger passed through it, instead getting stained with countless sparkling lights. Cha Eui-jae quietly observed the scene. Her golden eyes turned towards him.\n\"J.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The end of the world is coming to this world soon.\"\nThe end. Cha Eui-jae remembered hearing that word recently. The group that Lee Sa-young was chasing. Those secretive people who spread drugs for awakeners and artificially created awakeners. They said they were doing it to prevent the apocalypse.\nYoon Ga-eul squeezed her eyes shut and then opened them, continuing to speak.\n\"Everything I've seen in my dreams... is fragments from worlds where the apocalypse has already happened. The world itself was shattered because they couldn't stop the apocalypse.\"\n\"It's not an easy story to believe.\"\nCha Eui-jae said in a low voice. Yoon Ga-eul nodded as if agreeing.\n\"Yes, it won't be easy to believe. You might think I'm crazy. I think there's a reason why you're hiding your identity like this, J. I didn't want to come and find you either. But... I have no choice but to speak.\"\nA determined expression appeared on Yoon Ga-eul's youthful face.\n\"I'll be direct. I... want to stop the apocalypse, J.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I don't want to lose the things I hold dear by doing nothing, even though I know the end is coming.\"\nYoon Ga-eul extended her hand, shimmering like a kaleidoscope.\n\"Please look at the fragment I've seen.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Please.\"\n...And Cha Eui-jae could never refuse such a hand.\nHe let out a long sigh and took her cold hand. For a moment, his vision blurred, and he felt like he was being swept away somewhere.\n***\nCha Eui-jae opened his eyes. Snow was falling. No, it was white ash. The white, crumbling ash piled up and covered the whole world.\nThe place was eerily silent and ominous. And familiar. Had he returned to the West Sea rift?\n'No.'\nHe had been at the hangover soup restaurant until just a moment ago and had taken Yoon Ga-eul's hand. This must be inside the fragment Yoon Ga-eul had seen. Cha Eui-jae ignored the metallic taste of blood from his bitten tongue and looked up. Instead of a black hole, a white vortex was swirling in the white sky. A fragment of a world that had perished after the apocalypse. A familiar place.\nAn endless white night.\nIn the apocalypse, night never comes.\nThump. Thump. An indescribable sense of anxiety filled his heart. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath and looked around. The intermittent flickering karaoke sign, the darkened hair salon, and the café's signboard. Everything was covered in white ash, making it all look blurry. He started walking.\nAfter a few steps, he saw someone in a white ash-covered padded jacket scavenging through the ruins. Cha Eui-jae approached quietly. The person rummaging through the ruins suddenly turned around. It was Yoon Ga-eul, who seemed to be in her early twenties. Her chapped face had dried tear marks that she hadn't yet wiped away.\nDid she see me? No, can she see me? Cha Eui-jae tensed up. But Yoon Ga-eul's gaze passed right through him and looked further into the distance. There, a pale monster with thin limbs and no eyes was flapping its wings, wandering the streets.\nBang! With a loud explosion, white dust rose up. When the dust settled, a giant spear had pierced the monster's heart, leaving it in agony.\nScreeeech—\nA low voice suppressed the unpleasant scream.\n\"Yoon Ga-eul.\"\nThe voice was strangely modulated, making it hard to determine the age. But at the same time, it was familiar. Of course, it was the voice he always heard while living as J.\nCha Eui-jae turned his head along with Yoon Ga-eul. Cutting through the silence and unease, a young man in black combat gear and a black mask appeared. In a world covered in white ash, he was the only black existence. J swung his spear and slammed the monster to the ground. The monster flailed its limbs before it stopped moving.\nHe walked forward without hesitation but quietly.\nCha Eui-jae swallowed nervously as J got closer. But J passed through him without noticing.\nJ reached out his hand to Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"What are you doing here? The base camp is over there.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Honeybee was worried.\"\nYoon Ga-eul grabbed the debris of the building and avoided J's gaze.\n\"...I'm sorry, I was just going to look around a bit more... but I ended up coming here.\"\nJ crouched in front of Yoon Ga-eul, resting his chin on his hand.\n\"Was this near your school?\"\n\"Yes... that's right.\"\nThere was no trace of the school left. All that remained was the ruins, covered in white ash. The apocalypse was silent.\n\"...\"\nJ and Yoon Ga-eul would both know that there were no survivors around. Both were S-grade, so their keen senses wouldn't have missed it. But instead of saying it was a pointless task, J nodded.\n\"Let's take a quick look around then.\"\n\"...Can we?\"\n\"Yeah. If a monster appears, I'll take care of it, and there might be survivors we haven't found yet.\"\nJ easily slung the giant spear over his shoulder and stood up. He turned and looked back at Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"Oh. Don't tell Sa-young about this.\"\n\"Sorry?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened slightly as he watched the unfamiliar scene of J talking to Yoon Ga-eul and himself. J put a finger to the mouth of his mask.\n\"If he finds out, he'll complain again. Keep it a secret.\"\nYoon Ga-eul finally smiled brightly.\n\"Yes! Thank you!\"\nHer cheerful voice was drowned out by the clear sound of glass shards clinking. The scene before him wavered, and J and Yoon Ga-eul's figures blurred. Something was redrawing the scene in real time. The collapsed street turned dark gray and soon painted another space.\nThis time, they arrived at a huge library. However, half of the bookshelves were broken or tilted, and books were scattered all over the floor, seemingly forgotten.\nSince this was a fragment seen by Yoon Ga-eul, Cha Eui-jae found himself standing near her again.\nUnlike the street with no signs of life, this place was bustling with people. Many were injured too. People were busy treating the wounded and clearing debris. It seemed they had arrived at the base camp that J had mentioned earlier.\nYoon Ga-eul was also moving around the library, picking up books and tidying up. Cha Eui-jae followed her, looking around, when he suddenly saw a black figure standing still, seemingly separated from the busy interior.\nDisheveled black hair, cool purple eyes, thick lips with a mole beside them. A black leather coat reaching the knees and black gloves. The only difference from the memory was the long sword hanging at the waist.\n\"...\"\nIt was Lee Sa-young.\nHe looked a bit more mature than the face he remembered, but it was unmistakably Lee Sa-young. There was only one person with that face and aura. Moreover, the long sword at his waist looked similar to the Basilisk's Fang Cha Eui-jae had picked up in the West Sea rift.\nCha Eui-jae observed Lee Sa-young as if he were entranced. But his purple eyes were solely...\n\"...We're definitely short on medical supplies.\"\n\"We might have to check the hospitals in Gyeonggi-do, J. Can you do that?\"\n\"Hmm... well, we have to.\"\n...focused on J, who was conversing on one side of the camp.",

      "content": "Chapter 48: Fragments of the World\nLee Sa-young, who had been standing still and watching, moved at a moderate pace and stood right behind J as the other hunter started talking in earnest about the upcoming schedule. The hunter, who had been going on and on about the importance of medical supplies, took a step back in surprise.\n\"L-Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Ah, Lee Sa-young. You came quickly. How was Dongdaemun?\"\nJ also turned around and acknowledged Lee Sa-young, but Lee Sa-young coldly replied only to the hunter standing in front of him.\n\"Send someone else.\"\n\"What? But...\"\n\"I said send someone else.\"\nThe hunter, who was about to say more, couldn't withstand Lee Sa-young's fierce aura and bowed his head, stepping back. Lee Sa-young slightly bent down and whispered in J's ear.\n\"Just listening to this nonsense...\"\n\"Don't be too harsh. Efficiency-wise, it's better for me to go.\"\n\"Please, don't you start with the nonsense too.\"\n\"I told you to speak nicely.\"\nLee Sa-young mumbled something angrily, as if pouting, but J couldn't hear it. Lee Sa-young's soft black hair nestled between J's shoulder and neck. Even while looking at the documents, J patted Lee Sa-young's head with the other hand. It seemed like a very familiar action.\nCha Eui-jae, who was watching the unfamiliar scene, crossed his arms with a sour expression.\n'...Is this a delusion?'\nAs Yoon Ga-eul said, the fragments of the ruined world were confusing and chaotic. The J and Lee Sa-young appearing in these fragments were both the same and different from the ones Cha Eui-jae knew. It was like looking at distorted reflections in a warped mirror.\nThese absurd stories made him question whether he should keep watching, but there was a reason he couldn't dismiss them as mere nonsense. The space appearing in Yoon Ga-eul's fragments... was too familiar.\nThe white ash falling like snow, the familiar collapsed buildings covered in ash, the completely destroyed space. Monsters he'd never seen before pouring out from gates opened everywhere.\nWasn't it strikingly similar to the inside of the West Sea Rift that he'd been navigating for eight years?\n'...'\nCha Eui-jae shifted his gaze and took a deep breath. The sound of glass shattering and countless fragments passed by Cha Eui-jae rapidly, as if in a blur.\nIn one scene, Yoon Ga-eul was saving people with hunters from Channel 1. The later the fragments appeared, the more disheveled the hunters looked. They were fighting monsters with all kinds of wounds, scars, bandages, and even missing limbs.\nThe surviving hunters did their best to save people, kill monsters, and close the rifts, but the situation showed no signs of improving. The endless war of attrition continued. Even the steadfast hunters started to fall one by one. Despair began to settle on people's faces.\nSuddenly, time and space shifted. At this moment, Yoon Ga-eul was crouched between collapsed buildings. White monsters filled the streets, and even more were pouring out from gates that appeared in the air.\nJ, sitting next to her, bandaged his arm and held a spear.\n\"I'll hold them off here, so run first.\"\n\"Wait! No matter how strong you are, J, this is too much...\"\n\"If I run, these things will all head to the base camp. Can you handle that?\"\nYoon Ga-eul was at a loss for words and pressed her lips together. A scarred hand patted Yoon Ga-eul's head.\n\"It's okay.\"\n\"J!\"\n\"I said it's okay.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll finish this quickly and come back. Trust me.\"\nEyes twinkled round through a half-broken mask. The sound of monsters roaring and footsteps grew louder beyond the buildings. The young man erased his smile. He stood up, holding his blood-stained spear.\n\"When I give the signal, don't look back and run.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh, right. One more thing.\"\nJ put his index finger to his lips, just like in the first fragment.\n\"Keep this a secret from Lee Sa-young. Got it?\"\nThe fragment ended there. But even without seeing beyond that, Cha Eui-jae could tell. J probably didn't make it back.\nCha Eui-jae found himself in an unfamiliar room. Judging by the textbooks and tablet scattered on the desk and the school uniform hanging on the wall, it seemed to be Yoon Ga-eul's room. Yoon Ga-eul, who had been lying on the bed blankly, burst into tears the moment she opened her eyes.\nWas it over? Cha Eui-jae lifted his head. Then, he heard a slightly different sound from before. A creepy sound like broken glass being trampled.\nCreak. The ominous sound continued, and a piece of glass similar to the one Yoon Ga-eul had shown appeared before his eyes. The fragment, which sparkled in countless colors, soon... turned pitch black. At the same time, Cha Eui-jae was engulfed in darkness.\nIn the pitch-black darkness where not even an inch ahead was visible, only irregular, beast-like rough breathing could be heard. It almost sounded like low sobbing.\nThen, bang, something broke. A small beam of light pierced through the darkness. Bang again. With a crunch, a tree snapped.\n\"You bastard, how long are you going to stay holed up in there!\"\nBursting through the door with a rough shout was Honeybee, covered in wounds from head to toe. Her once-proud golden hair was messily cut at the nape. Pointing into the darkness with her bandaged hand, she shouted.\n\"Do you know how much power we lose with just you gone? Do you think the ones fighting for their lives are idiots? Get a grip! At least the living have to keep living!\"\n\"...\"\n\"Are you the only one who's sad? Are you the only one, damn it, are you the only one...! Stop acting like you're the only one who lost the world!\"\n\"Honeybee, calm down. Your wounds are opening.\"\nBae Won-woo, who had followed her in, grabbed Honeybee's shoulder. But she roughly brushed off his hand and shouted.\n\"Do you know Jung Bin is dead? Mok Tae-oh died today. Damn it, Mok Tae-oh... that idiot is dead!\"\nHoneybee started to cry, tears streaming down her face. Bae Won-woo, watching her with a troubled expression, turned to the darkness. He was wearing a brown coat, with his left sleeve empty.\n\"...Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I understand how you feel. But...\"\nBae Won-woo's face, full of scars, was visibly exhausted. He seemed to want to say something but eventually kept his mouth shut.\n\"...Never mind. Let's go, Honeybee.\"\nBae Won-woo almost carried Honeybee out of the room. The sound of her crying grew distant. The room fell silent again.\n\"...J.\"\nA hollow voice came from the darkness. It was a familiar voice. Cha Eui-jae stepped into the darkness as if bewitched. At that moment,\n\"Hyung.\"\nA purple light flashed in the darkness.\nWhoosh! Something fiercely flew out from the darkness. At the same time, a giant hand with a kaleidoscope-like sparkle grabbed Cha Eui-jae. Yoon Ga-eul's urgent voice hit his ears.\n\"J! Get a grip!\"\n\"Gasp, uh...\"\nCha Eui-jae gasped for breath and blinked his eyes. It was the familiar interior of a hangover soup restaurant. Across from him, Yoon Ga-eul was dripping with cold sweat. She sighed in relief, closing her eyes tightly, when she saw Cha Eui-jae wake up.\n\"Thank goodness...\"\n\"What was that just now...\"\nCha Eui-jae asked, still dazed. Yoon Ga-eul clasped her trembling hands together. Her right hand, which had been sparkling in many colors, was now completely black. She muttered anxiously, holding her right hand with her left.\n\"I don't know either. I've never seen that fragment before.\"\n\"...\"\n\"What was it? It felt like it was connected to that world, but...\"\n\"Wait, calm down.\"\nCha Eui-jae had to comfort Yoon Ga-eul, who was more agitated. She bit her lip and lowered her head.\n\"I'm sorry! This is the first time I've shown this to someone else, so I didn't know this would happen. I'm really sorry. I never thought you'd get dragged to another place...\"\n\"Just take a breath first. What do you mean by being dragged to another place?\"\n\"Well...\"\nCha Eui-jae gestured for her to breathe deeply. Following his lead, Yoon Ga-eul slowly calmed her breathing. After regaining some composure, she spoke in a hoarse voice.\n\"The fragments J just saw are paths I created and led. I made a path so that once you saw all the memories, you could return here. But suddenly, that path was cut off... and we were taken to an unknown place.\"\n\"Did someone else intervene?\"\n\"I don't know. This is the first time something like this has happened...\"\n\"What about your hand?\"\n\"My hand? Ah...\"\nYoon Ga-eul's right hand was constantly covered in black energy. She hid it inside her long coat sleeve and muttered.\n\"It should be okay, I think. If I tell the Awakened Management Bureau, they'll treat it.\"\n\"Was it because of the last fragment?\"\n\"Seems like it.\"\n\"...\"\nA short silence fell. In that last fragment, was Lee Sa-young the one buried in the darkness? Why did Cha Eui-jae get drawn into that space? What led him there? Why was Lee Sa-young...\n\"J.\"\nCha Eui-jae looked up. Yoon Ga-eul muttered.\n\"I haven't told anyone that Cha Eui-jae is J. There must be a reason you're hiding your identity. I will continue to keep it a secret.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ah! Of course, the Awakened Management Bureau asked me if the J who appeared recently is the same J who entered the West Sea Rift... and, well, I said yes. I mean, I really wanted to keep it a secret, but when I had a one-on-one with the director, I just got so nervous...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...I'm sorry.\"\nYoon Ga-eul bowed her head deeply again. Cha Eui-jae waved his hand dismissively.\n\"No, no, it's fine. I should be thanking you for not saying more...\"\nCome to think of it, the gap between the J he saw in his dreams and the part-time worker in the soup restaurant was quite large. Yet Yoon Ga-eul was confident enough to identify the two as the same person and came looking for him. Despite being nervous in front of the director, she seemed to have a surprisingly strong will.\n\"I just... thought you should know. This world is also heading towards its end.\"\n\"Didn't you tell the Awakener Management Bureau about this?\"\n\"Of course, I did.\"\n\"Then won't they be taking measures?\"\n\"...Yes, and that's the problem.\"\nYoon Ga-eul's response puzzled Cha Eui-jae. What was the problem with them taking measures? Isn't that what Yoon Ga-eul wanted?\nSwallowing hard, Yoon Ga-eul continued.\n\"The Awakened Management Bureau is considering various methods to prevent the end... and with J appearing in the rankings, they're desperately trying to find him. A search team is probably already on the move.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Registering as a hunter was a really good decision. The search team is focusing on unregistered individuals and civilians, considering the possibility that J might have lost his memory due to shock.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been quietly listening to Yoon Ga-eul, suddenly raised his head.\n\"How did you know I registered as a hunter?\"\nIt would've been better if he had lost his memory. He felt a bitter taste in his mouth. Anyway, if he had been a little later, he might have been included in the search net. His contract with Lee Sa-young proved to be quite useful.",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Unexpected Kindness\nAfter finishing their conversation, Yoon Ga-eul stood up, saying she had to go to school tomorrow. Despite Cha Eui-jae repeatedly suggesting she go to the emergency room because the black aura was still swirling around her hands, she politely declined and put her hands back in her pockets.\n\"I won't come by unless it's really important from now on. I know it makes you anxious.\"\n\"You don't have to do that.\"\n\"No, sometimes the hunters from the Bureau follow me around... It's better if I don't come.\"\nAs Yoon Ga-eul headed to the sliding door, Cha Eui-jae quickly walked ahead to open it for her. He planned to see her off, but a sudden thought made him speak urgently.\n\"Wait, I have a question.\"\n\"Yes, go ahead.\"\nAccording to Yoon Ga-eul, it seemed she was cooperating with the Bureau. Though there was no guarantee she knew about the people Lee Sa-young was chasing, Cha Eui-jae asked with a hint of hope.\n\"Do you know anything about those who artificially create Awakeners?\"\n\"What? Oh... Yes, I do.\"\nHer unexpected answer left Cha Eui-jae slightly stunned.\n\"...You do?\"\n\"Yes! I overheard Jung Bin-nim talking about it. I think they move with the purpose of preventing the apocalypse too...\"\nYoon Ga-eul muttered with a slightly disgusted expression.\n\"They kidnap people for experiments. Even if our goals align, I want to avoid them as much as possible.\"\nKidnapping, drugs, and the apocalypse just served as an excuse. They were nothing but a criminal group.\n\"Is there anything else you've heard?\"\n\"Uh... Ah.\"\nYoon Ga-eul, after rolling her eyes, replied.\n\"I think they have something around Incheon Port... I overheard Jung Bin-nim's phone call, but I didn't get the details.\"\nWhen she apologized for not knowing more, Cha Eui-jae said it was fine and thanked her. With her hands deeply tucked into her pockets, he watched Yoon Ga-eul's retreating figure until she disappeared completely down the alley.\nAlone in the store, Cha Eui-jae stayed up all night preparing for business, mulling over the fragments of information he had inadvertently gathered.\nHad he not directly experienced the fragments of the other world or if the background of the West Sea Rift and the fragments of the other world were not the same, he might have found Yoon Ga-eul's story hard to believe. He would have thought she was trying to hypnotize him with a mental skill.\n'Another world.'\nCould another world similar to this one truly exist? A world where J, Jung Bin, Mok Tae-oh 'Matthew' were all dead, and Bae Won-woo had lost an arm. Many events must have transpired to lead to that. The moments Cha Eui-jae and Yoon Ga-eul saw were brief and small snippets of the past.\nIt's uncertain when or how the apocalypse will arrive. Preparing for an uncertain future is like walking forward blindly. That's probably why the Bureau is so desperate to find J, to put an experienced guide at the forefront.\n'...'\nSince then, Cha Eui-jae often pondered over the destroyed world. When and how would the apocalypse come? Would there be any signs? Why did the world facing the apocalypse look like the West Sea Rift? His thoughts inevitably led to the dark room where he was taken without knowing why.\nHis thoughts continued to spiral and lengthen. As his words became fewer and minor mistakes began to occur while working at the shop, he received a text message from Lee Sa-young.\nSa-young: I have a job for you.\nLee Sa-young asked him to track down those bringing drugs near Incheon Port and confirm the routes. It was originally Seo Min-gi's job, but he was on a business trip abroad. Could the person Yoon Ga-eul overheard on the phone have been Lee Sa-young?\nEui-jae: Ok\nSa-young: Can you give a longer response?\nEui-jae: Okokokokokokokok\nSa-young: ㅗ\n'This kid.'\nCha Eui-jae chuckled as he put down his phone. He welcomed Lee Sa-young's request.\nAfter meeting Yoon Ga-eul, Cha Eui-jae had been overthinking. And the best way to clear one's mind is to stay active. This task would keep him from pointless worrying about how to respond when the apocalypse arrives.\nSo, starting that afternoon, Cha Eui-jae took the Pado Guild corporate card from the counter and headed to Incheon Port every early morning.\nSince he had no car or license, he took taxis, even though the late-night surcharge was outrageous. But Cha Eui-jae didn't care. The Pado Guild leader always splurged anyway.\n***\nIn the quiet early hours of a weekday, a black van slipped between the containers at Incheon Port. Soon, several burly figures with heavy backpacks got out, scanning the surroundings before heading into a hidden container.\nFrom the rooftop of a container opposite, a young man named Cha Eui-jae watched through binoculars. Lowering them, he blinked hard.\nThe figures moving underground appeared as if he could see through the floor. Cha Eui-jae turned on the eavesdropping device in his ear. He heard footsteps, a heavy metal door opening, and voices greeting each other. A raspy voice asked,\n\"How much stuff did we get today?\"\n\"Three packages.\"\n\"We've been getting less lately...\"\nA clanking sound, like a crowbar or metal pipe hitting the floor, was heard.\n\"...You're not skimming off the top, are you?\"\n\"What do you mean by that... We're risking our lives to move this stuff. Those Sseurigo and Padak bastards keep hunting us down like rats.\"\nCha Eui-jae groped for a roughly tossed leather notebook. On the label stuck on the cover, neat handwriting read:\n[A Beginner's Guide to Stealth and Infiltration by Seo Min-gi]\nFlipping to the 'slang' bookmark with his fingertips, Cha Eui-jae found the relevant page. 'Sseurigo' referred to the Bureau, and 'Padak' to the Pado Guild. Good, they even noted slang terms.\nSeo Min-gi gave him this notebook before his business trip, apologizing for the previous task not going smoothly. Apparently, he predicted Lee Sa-young would give this kind of task. The day he spontaneously put rice bowls in the hot food storage and gave this as a freebie showed his commitment to customer satisfaction.\nCha Eui-jae focused back on the voices.\n\"Yeah. Busan's dried up completely. Only Incheon has some supply.\"\n\"Fuck, how do those bastards always sniff us out?\"\n\"I heard the higher-ups are talking about it. This place won't last long either, so they said to move out immediately, before we get caught.\"\n\"Dammit, another big move, huh.\"\n\"Shall we start packing?\"\n\"Start packing up the big stuff now. We need to get out before the Sseurigo shows up. Deliver the drugs to each place.\"\n\"Understood. They asked to increase the supply a bit for the Songpa-gu area since there's someone about to enter the mutation stage.\"\n'Each place'... Cha Eui-jae quickly skimmed the contents. They intended to deliver the goods to suppliers across different locations.\nA mutation is expected to occur in Songpa-gu soon. Jotting it down in his notebook, Cha Eui-jae lay down and propped his chin, lost in thought.\nHow long had it been since he took on Lee Sa-young's request? About a week now? With the Tracker's Eye, finding these suspicious guys was a piece of cake. Every dawn, munching on convenience store kimbap, he observed them. This criminal group had a predictable pattern, making them oddly entertaining to watch.\nBut now, the guys he had finally tracked down were about to pack up and disappear as a group...\nCha Eui-jae put the empty kimbap wrapper into the black convenience store bag, then held his phone and tapped his fingers on it as if hesitating for a moment. The hem of the apron he hadn't managed to take off fluttered in the early morning breeze.\n'I'll report to Lee Sa-young...'\nIf he contacted him, he would send support. They had that thin level of trust now. But these guys were packing up to leave soon. Cha Eui-jae unlocked and relocked his phone repeatedly, watching the container below.\n'Will the support arrive in time?'\nNow he had two choices. First, to track them as they fled. Second, to throw himself into the fray and stop them from moving.\nThe first option was good overall, but there was one major problem. Since he had Tracker's Eye, he could certainly track them, but no matter how much of an S-grade Cha Eui-jae was, and even with his skill to conceal his presence, it was impossible to chase after those escaping by car or boat on foot.\n'I don't have a flight skill...'\nNever had he envied those with flight skills so much. Pursing his lips, he considered the second choice.\nThat's right, the method of hurling himself to block their movement. If he chose this, Cha Eui-jae would be diving right into the midst of them. The advantage was that he could definitely immobilize them in exchange for sacrificing himself.\nThough he had never been kidnapped before, he was confident he could keep them tied down. If things went wrong, he could just use a multi-strike to take them out.\n'Oh?'\nHe rubbed his chin.\n'This might actually be good.'\nIndeed, having a strong body saves mental effort. Cha Eui-jae texted Lee Sa-young.\nEui-jae: (map link)\nEui-jae: They're packing up to flee tonight.\nEui-jae: I'll hold them off.\nMessage sent. Cha Eui-jae put his phone in his pocket and bravely dove into the container.\n***\nHeavy footsteps approached. A voice clicked its tongue nearby.\n\"Is this the guy? The one who jumped in like a madman?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nThough he planned to faint after being hit with a club, it broke instead, but he managed to get tied to an old metal chair inside the container.\nThe criminals, thinking he must be an Awakener to dive in so bravely, tied each of his limbs with about ten cable ties.\n\"Connected to the Bureau?\"\n\"Doesn't seem like it.\"\n\"Why are you uncertain? Didn't you check properly?\"\n\"No government ID, just a hunter license in his apron pocket. A common D-grade.\"\n\"How does a guy who's only a D-grade have the guts? ... He looks too clean to be a drug addict who sniffed something and crawled here.\"\n\"He doesn't show any signs of mutating either.\"\n\"Well, we'll find out by asking him.\"\nThe man who had been muttering to himself lit a cigarette.\n\"Hey, wake him up. We don't have time.\"\n\"Yes, boss!\"\nThere was a flurry of movement. Someone grabbed Cha Eui-jae's hair roughly and pulled him up into a sitting position. Amidst the faint sound of waves, there was also the sound of something splashing in a container. Cha Eui-jae twitched his closed eyes. Surely they wouldn't do something as barbaric as pouring water on him...\nSplash! Cold water hit him forcefully.\n'Fuck, they really did it.'\nJudging by the saltiness, it seemed they had scooped seawater directly. His head and upper body were completely soaked. Damn it, I'm not even asleep. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth discreetly.\n'Maybe I should have just beaten them all up from the start...'",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Unexpected Kindness\nSomeone approached Cha Eui-jae, who was soaking wet from seawater, both in body and mind. A man cracked his knuckles, making bone-cracking sounds, and barked at him.\n\"Hey, you bastard, I can see you rolling your eyes under your eyelids. If you're awake, get up quickly...\"\nSomething flew toward his face this time. Judging by the speed and the flow of the air, it seemed to be a fist. Cha Eui-jae remained seated, eyes closed, only wiggling his toes.\n\"Open your eyes!\"\nThwack! A feather-light punch landed on his cheek. One second, two seconds, three seconds.\n\"Ahhh!\"\nThe scream erupted from somewhere other than Cha Eui-jae's mouth. Cha Eui-jae finally opened his eyes slightly. The skinhead who had thrown the punch was hopping in place, clutching his reddened, swollen fist. The dim lighting reflected off his closely shaved head, flickering like a chaotic strobe light.\n\"My, my hand!\"\nAs he hopped around as if his feet were on fire, the other thugs surrounding him jeered.\n\"Hey, stop whining, you bastard!\"\n\"What's with the fuss after hitting his face with your fist?\"\n\"It's not fussing, I'm telling you!\"\nThe skinhead, clutching his fist, tearfully explained, while one of the men in the group laughed loudly.\n\"If it's fussing, you're dead. Let's see.\"\n\"I'm serious! Ah...\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nThe face of the man checking the fist, who had been grinning slyly, stiffened a bit. He scratched his head in disbelief as he turned the hand back and forth.\n\"This guy's hand really seems broken.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"No, did he coat his face in steel? Why is his fist shattered after hitting his face?\"\n\"Now that you mention it, I did hit that guy's head with a wooden plank earlier, and the plank broke.\"\n\"What the hell? Is he a stone head? Is stone head a skill?\"\nThe thugs around him gathered and murmured in confusion. This situation was troubling. Some weakling hitting him for the first time...\nAt that moment, a man with a mustache grabbed Cha Eui-jae's wet hair and tilted his head back. Although wet, his face was unbelievably clean for someone who had been punched. After scrutinizing his face carefully, the mustache guy smirked evilly.\n\"Hah, this bastard. He came in here so confidently. Must be relying on something, huh?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hey, hey. It's nothing to mess up your pretty face. Even if we're busy, we can still throw you into a drum and cement you up real quick, you bastard.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Still keeping your mouth shut... Hah, you're a terrible actor.\"\nIf nothing else, being called a bad actor touched Cha Eui-jae's pride. As J, or EZ, at the center of attention in the Korean Hunter world, he had overcome numerous adversities and hardships using his acting skills. Though the poker face trait helped.\nCalling me a bad actor? In indignation, his fingers tied behind him twitched slightly. The mustached man flicked his hand.\n\"Fine, let's make you want to talk. Hey, bring the tools. This guy seems to have some strange skill, so beat him with tools.\"\n\"Yes, boss!\"\nBurly men wielding crowbars, baseball bats, and planks approached, cracking their necks and arms. The mustached man, stepping back, smirked.\n\"It's gonna hurt a bit.\"\nThe big guy at the front twisted his lips as he got closer. And then—\nCrack!\nThe sound of bones breaking was clearer and more resonant than expected. The man who had kicked Cha Eui-jae froze, eyes wide open, before collapsing and clutching his shin, rolling around in pain.\n\"Ah! Ahhh!\"\n\"Shit, what the hell?\"\n\"That idiot bastard, why kick with his own leg instead of using the tool?\"\n\"This guy's weird! Use the tools to beat him!\"\n\"That's what I said, you moron!\"\n\"Dammit!\"\nThe big guy squeezed his eyes shut and swung the nailed bat at Cha Eui-jae's small head.\nThwack!! The dull sound was quite loud, but it wasn't the head that broke. The bat hung loosely, broken in the middle! Cha Eui-jae, apart from his slightly tilted head, was unscathed.\n'Is this guy really stone-headed?'\nKicking broke the kicker's toes, punching broke the puncher's knuckles. Crowbars, hammers, baseball bats, and planks— all tools broke. After gathering the injured in one spot, there was enough for a soccer team. The kidnappers finally noticed something was off. They clung to the wall, whispering among themselves in low voices.\n\"Shit, does this make sense? Why does it seem like the attacker is in more pain than the guy getting hit?\"\n\"Yeah, what's this? Potions are damn expensive these days, and we're gonna use them all up.\"\n\"Boss, this really hurts.\"\n\"Dammit, just hold on a bit.\"\n\"Even with a dislocated bone?\"\n\"My bone is broken, boss.\"\n\"Ah, go lie down over there!\"\n\"But wasn't he supposed to be D-grade? Shit, did we mistake an A-grade for a D-grade? Why does the wrist of a B-grade break when hitting a D-grade? Is this according to the laws of physics?\"\n\"This is the collapse of the Hunter society, seriously.\"\nOf course, Cha Eui-jae heard it all. Hearing conversations about the collapse of society while beating people up made him feel restless as well.\n'Why are these guys so weak?'\nThe kidnappers were much weaker than Cha Eui-jae had expected. Trying to extract information by playing along was futile as they kept missing. How did such weaklings have the nerve to smuggle drugs? Was there no point in getting captured and soaked in seawater?\nThe mustached man, standing back, yelled angrily.\n\"Hey, you bastards, finish up quickly and move before dawn! Why the hell can't you handle a single D-grade?\"\nBefore dawn. That word triggered Cha Eui-jae.\nHe had a mission to serve hangover soup to the zombies that showed up early in the morning. Having wasted precious time getting captured, these guys failed at both threatening him and extracting information.\n'What's with these incomplete bastards?'\nGetting annoyed at the lack of valuable information and watching them tap dance around with broken legs was frustrating. Finally, Cha Eui-jae muttered like a sigh.\n\"Guys, this won't do.\"\nIt was clear to everyone that the words spoken by the kidnapping gang leader were now coming from the kidnapped victim. The kidnappers, clinging to the wall, whispered in confusion.\n\"Why is he saying that?\"\n\"I thought the boss said that.\"\n\"I don't know, I'm scared now.\"\n\"I wanted to play along, but you guys are too low-level.\"\nRegardless, Cha Eui-jae stretched his arms, tightly bound with cable ties to the metal chair, upwards. Snap! The multiple layers of cable ties tore apart with a single raise. He then lifted his legs, breaking the ties binding them as well.\nThe kidnappers' faces turned to shock as they watched dozens of cable ties break in an instant. Cha Eui-jae stood up from the metal chair, pushed back his wet hair, and then grabbed the chair, folding it in half.\nHe threw it at the mustached man!\nCrash!\n\"Ugh.\"\nOnce again, Cha Eui-jae thought he should have pursued a career as a baseball player.\nThe mustached man, hit squarely in the face with the metal chair, rolled his eyes and collapsed. Blood streamed from his flaring nostrils.\nPushing his disheveled wet hair back again, Cha Eui-jae strode toward the thugs clinging to the wall. Sharp murderous intent poured toward the kidnappers. His black eyes gleamed menacingly.\n\"Come at me all at once, you pieces of shits.\"\n***\nThe Combat Support Team 1 of the elite guild, Pado, might sound like a department that supports the combat team by name.\nBut in reality, it was different. The Combat Support Team 1 typically handled ordinary guild affairs but prioritized executing Lee Sa-young's orders as a special team when they came.\nAt this point, there were two rankers among the hunters in Pado Guild's Combat Support Team 1.\nFirst, ranking 34th, Seo Min-gi, the master of stealth, infiltration, information gathering, and manipulation, known as 'A Small Miracle'.\nSecond, ranking 50th, Choi Go-yo, a young man nicknamed 'Romantic Opener', famous for his lock-picking skills.\nChoi Go-yo, hunter name Romantic Opener, was performing a very important secret mission while Seo Min-gi was on an overseas trip, which was to monitor and report every move of a hangover soup shop part-timer to Lee Sa-young!\nHis target, the hangover soup shop part-timer, headed to Incheon Port every morning for some secret mission given by Lee Sa-young. Consequently, Choi Go-yo also had to give up his early morning sleep and head to Incheon Port every dawn.\nUsing a phone camera capable of 10,000x zoom, he took pictures from a very long distance and reported to Lee Sa-young. It was a tip given by Seo Min-gi. The part-timer had an annoyingly keen sense, so getting close would get him caught.\nToday, after taking and sending a photo of the ant-sized part-timer, he was watching a YouTube comedy show on his wireless earphones. But then, unexpectedly, he received a message from the Guild Leader!\nGuild Leader: Check the target's status\nHe was just at the fun part. Grumbling, he zoomed in on the container rooftop where the part-timer had been.\n\"Shit, where did he go?\"\nSeeing the empty rooftop, Choi Go-yo's mind went blank. He quickly and quietly made his way toward the container where the target had been. Luckily, it was so early that the harbor was still asleep, and he didn't encounter anyone.\nHe was now clinging to the wall of the container opposite, like a cicada. Pressing his ear to the container, he focused on the sounds coming from inside.\nThud, thud, thud. There were regular sounds of something hitting, the dull thud of flesh striking flesh, something flying through the air, and groans, grunts, and gasps as if someone was choking.\nChoi Go-yo began to tremble with fear. The target must have been caught watching and dragged inside! These garbage thugs were undoubtedly beating up the newly awakened D-grade Hunter.\nTime to go, Go-yo! Time to show the most spectacular last dance of your 20-year life. With the incredible leg strength of an A-grade awakener, Choi Go-yo kicked open the iron door, rolled nimbly through the open gap, and struck a pose as he entered the container.\n\"Hey, you cowards! Stop beating up the weak!\"\nChoi Go-yo had imagined a scene where his target, the part-timer from the soup restaurant, was lying helpless on the floor, surrounded by bad guys beating him up. A typical scene in a kidnapping. He would then take down the thugs with a few swift kicks and dramatically rescue the part-timer.\nThe admirable, stylish Hunter, Choi Go-yo. His gratifying imagination concluded with a pay raise offer from a grateful Lee Sa-young.\nHowever, the scene inside the container was a bit different from what he had imagined. Choi Go-yo found himself locking eyes with a man whose face was so swollen from being hit that it looked like a steamed bun. Time seemed to move in slow motion.\n\"...Huh?\"\nThe scene before him was...\nQuite different from what he had imagined.\nCrash! The steamed bun man flew out of the container, rolling and tumbling until he hit another container and finally stopped. Is he dead? Choi Go-yo, seeing this bizarre sight for the first time, gaped and turned his gaze back inside the container.\nSomeone was indeed...beating someone.\n'...Is this real?'\nThe part-timer from the soup restaurant was demolishing the kidnappers.\nUtterly destroying them.",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Unexpected Kindness\nChoi Go-yo tried to grasp the situation with a bewildered look on his face.\nSo, some bad guys kidnapped someone. When he followed them, he found an abandoned factory. Inside, he could hear the sound of someone being beaten. Naturally, Choi Go-yo thought the kidnappers were beating the poor part-time worker! He had been instructed by Seo Min-gi to keep a close watch on the situation and protect the worker if anything happened.\nOh no, those cowardly awakened ones were beating up an awakened person who was almost like a regular human! The code of conduct for the awakened and the special law were all dead, he thought, as he rushed into the abandoned factory.\nBut an awakened person who was almost like a regular human was beating up another awakened person.\n\"Ugh...\"\nThere were already several guys lying on the floor after being beaten!\nThe door was kicked open roughly, and the cold wind from the seaside blew in.\nA black apron covered in footprints fluttered. The part-time worker let go of the guy he was grabbing by the collar. The guy, whose face was swollen like a steamed bun and bleeding, slumped like a puppet with its strings cut. One more guy was twitching on the floor.\nAnd then, silence.\nTheir eyes met.\nThe part-time worker, without even looking at the hand trying to grab his ankle, stomped on it hard and opened his mouth, using the new scream as background music.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nResponding urgently, Choi Go-yo's voice cracked. He gulped down his saliva.\nThe black apron with a blue toad drawn on it was covered in footprints, his hands were stained with blood, and for some reason, his hair was wet and tangled. Despite his appearance, which anyone would think was of a kidnapped person, his face was surprisingly neat.\nIn fact, what scared Choi Go-yo the most was his expression, which showed little emotion. How could someone who was beating people just moments ago have such a calm face?\nWasn't he just an ordinary part-time worker at a hangover soup restaurant? At most, a D-grade awakened? What was this ominous aura? He was on the verge of collapsing from fear. The part-time worker, who had been silent, asked.\n\"Are you one of them?\"\n\"What? No! Absolutely not!\"\n\"When people ask this kind of thing, they always say no. How cliché.\"\nOf course I'd say no if I'm not! Choi Go-yo felt wronged. He was so aggrieved or scared that he felt like crying. He involuntarily started to back away. However,\n\"Don't even think about running.\"\nAt a single word, he stopped dead in his tracks. The part-time worker wasn't even looking at him. He was just standing still, tidying his wet and tangled hair. Yet, Choi Go-yo's feet wouldn't move. Cold sweat ran down his back. He barely opened his mouth to make an excuse.\n\"No, I really...\"\n\"Don't waste your energy... It won't take long to catch you.\"\nIt was more of a statement of fact than a threat. He felt that if he tried to run, he would be caught and dragged back here in no time. And he would end up like the guys sprawled on the floor. Choi Go-yo firmly shut his mouth and sat down on the dusty floor. The part-time worker murmured satisfactorily.\n\"Good boy.\"\nHe silently approached and squatted in front of Choi Go-yo, who was already sitting. Despite his neat face, his posture was like that of a delinquent. The part-time worker, with an expressionless face, gestured with his hand.\n\"So.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"What were you going to say? Go on.\"\n\"Ah.\"\n\"If you don't talk quickly...\"\nHis cold eyes glanced at the guys lying around. The part-time worker was so generous that he even gave him time to speak and kindly warned him that he would end up like those guys if he didn't speak quickly. Choi Go-yo, at the fastest speed in his life, pulled out his wallet and handed over his business card.\n[Pado Guild Combat Support Team 1]\n[Rank A Romantic Opener]\n\"I'm Romantic Opener from the Pado Guild!\"\nThe part-time worker asked again, almost out of habit, at the familiar and detestable guild name.\n\"Pado?\"\n\"Yes! The Guild Leader sent me to protect you, Cha Eui-jae-ssi.\"\nChoi Go-yo hadn't expected the business card that Bae Won-woo had told him to always carry would be so useful. He reflected on his past days of recklessly claiming he didn't need such things, that his face was his business card. He also decided to repay Bae Won-woo for this favor.\nMaybe hangover soup would be a good idea. Having chosen the menu in his mind, Choi Go-yo looked at the part-time worker in front of him. The part-time worker, who was examining the business card, rubbed his forehead.\n\"...You're from the Pado Guild.\"\nThe atmosphere suddenly changed like a cold snap in the middle of a warm spring day. Cha Eui-jae, who had been reading the business card, asked Choi Go-yo.\n\"Your name is... Romantic Opener?\"\n\"Yes, that's correct. Romantic Opener...\"\n\"Aha.\"\nIn the interview-like atmosphere, Choi Go-yo unintentionally got a bit nervous and answered with a lot of spirit. It was the first time he had been this nervous since the final interview with Lee Sa-young at Pado Guild.\nWhile Choi Go-yo was lost in thought, Cha Eui-jae suddenly extended his blood-stained hand. Choi Go-yo, like a new employee looking for cues from his boss, quickly started thinking. What is this? What does he want? Does he want something to clean his hand? Did I bring a handkerchief?\nIt seemed that Cha Eui-jae wasn't expecting to receive anything, as he naturally continued talking.\n\"Romantic Opener-ssi.\"\n\"Yes? Yes.\"\n\"Are you quick-witted?\"\n\"What?\"\nIf he were truly quick-witted, he wouldn't be responding with a \"What?\" But at least Choi Go-yo's responses were prompt, which was a good quality. Cha Eui-jae chuckled.\n\"Well... It's okay even if you're not.\"\nThen, Cha Eui-jae suddenly bowed his head deeply. It was a decidedly theatrical move.\n\"Look, as you can see, I'm in a very bad mood right now.\"\nSo... he wanted to give an explanation of how things got to this point... But Cha Eui-jae's performance was effective. The blood on his hand added to the tension. Choi Go-yo nodded busily.\n\"Yes. I can see that.\"\n\"I was just about to close up and take a break when these bastards kidnapped me.\"\nThat was a lie. Cha Eui-jae hadn't been kidnapped; he had practically asked to be kidnapped. Even though Choi Go-yo had witnessed his every move until the moment of his so-called abduction, he still played along.\n\"Unbelievable.\"\n\"Not only did they kidnap me, but they also kicked me for responding late. They beat people with crowbars and nailed bats.\"\n\"Those trashy bastards!\"\nChoi Go-yo wasn't known for his empathy. He was the kind of person who, when told by a friend that they were tired and had bought dry shampoo, would respond with, \"Dry shampoo? Is it good?\"\nBut the current Choi Go-yo was different. He was channeling all his latent empathy from his core, trying his best to empathize with Cha Eui-jae. Seeing Choi Go-yo's strong reaction, Cha Eui-jae dramatically lifted his dirt-stained apron.\n\"See these footprints?\"\n\"My god, how much did they beat you?\"\n\"Don't even ask. It was a lot.\"\n\"Those damn bastards. They should be fed to the piranhas!\"\nOf course, Cha Eui-jae looked remarkably fine for someone who claimed to have been severely beaten, but the truth wasn't important to Choi Go-yo at that moment. After all, there's a saying that dead men tell no tales!\nChoi Go-yo nodded fervently, fully expressing his feelings. Thankfully, the young man seemed pleased with his intense reaction and continued his story, resting his cheek on his hand.\n\"So, I disciplined them a bit.\"\n\"...I see.\"\nThe guys on the floor were so swollen from the beatings that they were unrecognizable. If this was just a bit of discipline, what would happen if he disciplined them properly?\nChoi Go-yo felt a chill down his spine for a moment but quickly dismissed it. He wasn't the one who got beaten; it was those guys knocked out on the floor. The blood-stained fingers twitching weakly to catch his attention were ignored by Choi Go-yo, who simply closed his eyes.\nAnd he thought, How merciful it was to spare the lives of those who kidnapped and beat him. Lee Sa-young would have completely erased them without a trace. Thinking this way, the young man in front of him started to seem like a living Buddha.\nChoi Go-yo, nodding mechanically, spoke his thoughts sincerely.\n\"You are truly merciful.\"\n\"Yes. So, Choi Go-yo-ssi.\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Could you please shut up?\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nCha Eui-jae's face had already changed to a chilling smile, colder than a late spring frost, more like a frozen Siberian lake. As Choi Go-yo stared blankly, unable to follow the logic, Cha Eui-jae sighed briefly and began to educate him.\n\"I don't have the ability to erase memories cleanly.\"\n\"...\"\n\"To erase them, I'd have to use physical means...\"\nWith blood-stained hands, he gently formed a fist and smiled softly. But that smile made Choi Go-yo's face turn as pale as it had when he witnessed the brutal scene earlier.",

      "content": "Chapter 52: Unexpected Kindness\nOf all things, it was the word 'physical' that brought to mind a funny post he'd once seen on the internet. Someone had hypnotized a person to believe that an onion tasted like an apple and kept feeding them raw onions until they admitted it tasted like an apple.\nChoi Go-yo thought he might end up being that person in this onion-apple hypnosis experiment. Finally, he fully understood Cha Eui-jae's smile.\n\"I'll keep up the physical therapy until you forget everything.\"\nSo, Choi Go-yo answered confidently, like a quiz show contestant certain of the correct answer.\n\"Where am I?\"\nIn response, Cha Eui-jae nodded approvingly, his face beaming. A perfect answer.\nAfter peacefully reaching an agreement without any bloodshed, Cha Eui-jae began dragging the unconscious kidnappers and lining them up. He separated the one who splattered ink on his face and the mustached one who had passed out with a bloody nose.\nIn any case, Cha Eui-jae planned to wake up the sturdiest one among them to extract information and get some revenge. It was a two-birds-one-stone situation. And if he could force some seawater down their throats, all the better.\nSitting off to the side, Choi Go-yo raised his hand politely, like a student about to give a presentation.\n\"Part-timer-ssi. I don't know where we are or what happened, but can I open a door?\"\n\"A door?\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at Choi Go-yo. Choi Go-yo clasped his hands together and gave a mechanical smile.\n\"My ability is to open doors. I can transport people to the location they want using a door, as long as I have the street address.\"\n'...That would be handy for deliveries.'\nCha Eui-jae's eyes sparkled like a professor discovering a promising student to bring to grad school. His first thought was appropriately practical for someone working part-time at a hangover soup restaurant. But then he erased the business ideas popping into his head. Such a useful ability must come with a significant drawback.\nEspecially since, due to some quirk of the system, space-moving abilities typically had major flaws. Cha Eui-jae grabbed the sturdiest looking kidnapper and lifted him by the collar.\n\"Does your ability have any penalties?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, yes, it does.\"\nFor some reason, Choi Go-yo's eyes trembled slightly. Cha Eui-jae nodded, urging him to continue.\n\"It's okay, just tell me. I need to know the penalties to decide if I should ask you to open a door or not.\"\n\"Uh, um, well...\"\n\"Yes?\"\nJust as Cha Eui-jae was about to punch the sturdy kidnapper awake while simulating the appropriate force in his mind, Choi Go-yo suddenly shouted.\n\"I pass out!\"\n\"What?\"\nAt that moment, Cha Eui-jae was about to land a punch to wake the sturdy one. Choi Go-yo quickly explained his penalty, almost rapping the words out.\n\"If I know the street address or map coordinates, I can open a door to that location, but I use the current location as the axis point, you know? The further the distance between the axis point and the destination, the longer I pass out!\"\n\"Can multiple people pass through the door?\"\n\"Yes? Yes, as long as the door stays open.\"\n\"How long does it stay open?\"\n\"Until I pass out.\"\nCha Eui-jae pondered deeply. An ability that could transport multiple people at once was very rare. Moreover, the penalty, while severe, wasn't too bad.\n'Let's check it out.'\nHe took out his phone to check their current address. But... the precious screen was shattered!\n'Damn.'\nCha Eui-jae hurriedly unlocked his phone to check its status. But the screen, shattered to pieces, only showed a kaleidoscopic mess instead of the usual display. His body might be S-grade, but his precious phone couldn't withstand the beating and had failed.\nIn a grim voice, Cha Eui-jae called out to Nexby.\n\"Hi, Nexby. What's the current street address?\"\n—Using GPS data to search for the current street address.\nLuckily, the phone wasn't completely broken, as Nexby responded properly. Nexby diligently recited the address. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes, staring at the shattered screen.\n'Damn. Still got a long time left on the contract...'\nHe muttered gloomily.\n\"Assuming I open a door to Seoul from here, Incheon, how long do you think you'll pass out?\"\nChoi Go-yo quickly replied.\n\"A day and a half? Maybe two days if it's long.\"\nDespite Incheon port to Seoul not being that far, the passing out duration seemed significant. Cha Eui-jae, purely out of curiosity, asked another question.\n\"So, if you opened a door to Washington, D.C....\"\nChoi Go-yo's eyes filled with tears. His reaction was intense. Clearly, he had experienced something similar before. Choi Go-yo wiped his tears with his sleeve and spoke politely.\n\"Not Washington, but I did open a door to Toronto, Canada, for the Guild Leader's urgent business trip...\"\n\"And?\"\n\"When I woke up, the seasons had changed.\"\n\"...\"\nSuch a good ability came with a hefty penalty. Cha Eui-jae pulled out his phone to check the time but failed again and asked Nexby instead. It was 2:20 AM. From Incheon port to the hangover soup restaurant would take about two hours by taxi. Including the time to call for a cab, it would be tight to prepare for the restaurant's opening. Cha Eui-jae scratched his temple with a frown, then turned to Choi Go-yo.\n\"Sorry to ask, but... could you open the door for us?\"\n\"Oh, yes, of course!\"\n\"If you pass out, I'll take you to the hospital, so don't worry.\"\n\"Oh, that's not a concern.\"\nThe romantic opener placed his index and middle fingers on his temples and closed his eyes tightly. He seemed to be concentrating. Eventually, he extended both arms forward and shouted powerfully.\n\"Open, Anywhere Door!\"\nIt was a name that sounded like it could infringe on two copyrights simultaneously. It was also incredibly childish. But the effect was anything but childish. In the middle of the container filled with moaning, groaning kidnappers, a large wooden door appeared.\n\"Oh.\"\nCha Eui-jae, genuinely impressed, began tying up the unconscious kidnappers' wrists with cable ties, stringing them together like a bunch of fish. He planned to drag them all out at once rather than carry them individually. Once all the kidnappers were bundled together, he opened the bags they had carried in.\nThe bags were packed with thickly wrapped white powder. Cha Eui-jae stuffed all of it into his inventory and slung one bag over his shoulder.\n'That should be everything.'\nNodding at Choi Go-yo to open the door, Cha Eui-jae signaled readiness.\nRomantic opener Choi Go-yo, who had been as pale as a zombie since the door opened, approached it with trembling legs and opened it.\nWhat appeared on the other side was...\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nIt was Lee Sa-young.\n'...Why?'\nWhy are you here? Lee Sa-young was sitting at a large desk in a spacious office, fiddling with his phone. For some reason, he was wearing glasses instead of his gas mask. The lacquered nameplate on the desk gleamed brightly.\n'Pado Guild Leader Lee Sa-young.'\nFrom the looks of it, this seemed to be the Guild Leader's office. Cha Eui-jae felt the urge to shut the door and hail a taxi with the Pado Guild's corporate card, and maybe even double the fare.\n'He opened the Guild Leader's office door instead of where I wanted...'\nA chilling gaze met his.\n'Fuck.'\nLee Sa-young slowly took off his glasses. Cha Eui-jae turned sharply towards Choi Go-yo, needing an explanation for this absurd situation. But Choi Go-yo, his hands trembling like a phone on vibrate mode, gave a thumbs up with a serene smile, as if he had done everything right.\n'This bastard, when he said the hospital wouldn't be a problem...'\nIt turned out Choi Go-yo had never intended to open the door to Cha Eui-jae's desired location. His only goal was to deliver Cha Eui-jae to Lee Sa-young, like a courier service to outer space!\nCha Eui-jae was furious with betrayal. No wonder Choi Go-yo hadn't asked for a destination!\nMeanwhile, Lee Sa-young had risen from his seat and was now standing right in front of him. The two stood facing each other, separated by the door. His dull purple eyes scanned Cha Eui-jae from head to toe. He crossed his arms and smirked.\n\"I wondered what insane stunt you were pulling when they said you'd been grounded.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You've ended up looking like a beggar, haven't you, Hyung?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 53: Unexpected Kindness\n\"You've ended up looking like a beggar, haven't you, Hyung?\"\n\"Yeah. It's a bit much for a beggar to come into the Guild Leader's office, isn't it? Just take the stuff and go.\"\nCha Eui-jae pointed to the long string of bound men behind him. Lee Sa-young's lips tightened. He returned to his desk, fixed his gaze on Cha Eui-jae, and pressed the microphone button connecting to the secretary's office.\n\"...Tell the research team to bring in new samples and send a transport vehicle to the Pado Guild's front gate.\"\n—Uh, excuse me? A transport vehicle?\n\"One that can carry about twenty Awakened at once. No, just tell them to bring the biggest one, and they'll understand.\"\n—...Yes, I'll relay that right away.\nLee Sa-young took his hand off the mic button and leaned over the desk, letting out a deep sigh between his lips.\n\"...The message.\"\n\"What?\"\nCha Eui-jae blinked. He looked a mess, as if he had been dunked in water and then rolled in the dirt. Lee Sa-young tapped his fingers on the desk.\n\"Why didn't you check the message?\"\n\"...Did you send one?\"\nLee Sa-young glanced up at Cha Eui-jae with just his eyes. He had replied to that crazy message as soon as it arrived, and he hadn't seen it? Lee Sa-young's lips twisted. Playing dumb, are we?\n\"Aha... Pretending not to know?\"\n\"No, hey, I'm not pretending. I really didn't see it. My phone screen is busted.\"\nCha Eui-jae pulled his phone out of his pocket and showed it. Just like he said, the screen was completely shattered as if it had been hit with a hammer.\nLee Sa-young glanced around the open door into the container. Around the bound men were scattered various tools and weapons. Though they weren't blood-stained, most were broken or bent.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young turned his eyes back to Cha Eui-jae. His face was as fair as usual, but his hair and hoodie were soaked, his usually neat hair was a tangled mess, and his apron was covered in footprints and stick marks. It was a complete wreck.\nAlthough Lee Sa-young couldn't tell Cha Eui-jae's true strength, it was unlikely that an Awakened capable of blocking his attacks would get beaten up to this extent unless he had let it happen on purpose.\n\"...\"\nIn the meantime, Cha Eui-jae was taking out several heavy black backpacks from his inventory and piling them up in the Guild Leader's office, then placing the one he had on his back as the final one. Yet, he never stepped beyond the doorway.\nDid he think he was actually a beggar because he was called one? Lee Sa-young didn't hide his irritation.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Wait a sec... Everything in these backpacks is drugs. They were talking about three units or something, but I don't know what the units are. But you'll figure that out.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hey, Romantic Opener-ssi. When do you think you'll pass out?\"\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"...Looks like you'll pass out soon.\"\nChoi Go-yo was already lying on the container floor. He was barely able to move his mouth and was in a half-dead state. His eyes were unfocused and about to close. Cha Eui-jae clicked his tongue and gestured to Lee Sa-young.\n\"Come in and take this person out.\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slightly with a sullen face.\n\"I can't go in there.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"That door is one-way.\"\n\"...One-way?\"\n\"I guess Go-yo didn't explain? That door only works for going out, not coming in.\"\nCha Eui-jae looked at Romantic Opener, then at the door, and then at Lee Sa-young.\nBy now, Lee Sa-young could easily see what kind of crazy thoughts were going through Cha Eui-jae's handsome head. He didn't even bother to hide his disdain and spoke with a scowl.\n\"What? Planning to hold out there until Go-yo passes out?\"\nHis neat face turned sullen. He usually made that expression when someone hit the nail on the head.\n\"No, I just thought I didn't really need to go out there...\"\n\"Ha.\"\n\"If I just hand over the stuff and these guys to you, it's over, isn't it?\"\n\"How do you expect to get to the hangover soup restaurant from Incheon? What, you want me to call a taxi with the company card again?\"\n\"With the late-night surcharge, it would take two hours... It would be quite expensive.\"\nCha Eui-jae seemed to be seriously contemplating it.\nCha Eui-jae was a mess, Lee Sa-young thought. Not just his current appearance, but judging by his actions, his mind was probably a mess too. He was unbelievably reckless, self-centered, incredibly old-fashioned, and acted as if he had spare lives to risk.\n\"Still...\"\nCha Eui-jae brushed his wet hair back and smiled.\n\"This wasn't bad at all, right?\"\nSomehow...\nWatching him smile with his teeth showing, Lee Sa-young turned away abruptly.\n\"Come in before the door closes.\"\n\"If I just throw these guys your way...\"\n\"Just listen the first time I say it.\"\nOnly by sharpening his tone did Cha Eui-jae finally push Choi Go-yo into the Guild Leader's office, dragging the men tied like fish and stepping into the office himself.\nThe moment the last man crossed the threshold, Choi Go-yo, who had been holding on stubbornly, let out a final gasp.\n\"Gack.\"\nAt the same time, the door that had been slightly open vanished, and the securely closed door of the Guild Leader's office returned to its place. Lee Sa-young laid Choi Go-yo and the others outside before returning to find Cha Eui-jae still awkwardly standing and looking around.\n\"Let's hear it first...\"\nLee Sa-young asked, folding his arms.\n\"Why did you jump in there on purpose?\"\n\"Hm? I thought I might catch something if I stirred things up.\"\nCha Eui-jae spoke casually and shrugged.\n\"But I didn't find anything useful.\"\n\"There was no need for you to go that far. What I assigned you was simple surveillance. We have other specialized personnel for suppression.\"\n\"But I was able to respond faster than them today.\"\nCha Eui-jae's actions were indeed a big help. Though the investigation department and the Pado Guild members chased after the drug dealers, they only went as far as chasing them. This was the first time they had completely wiped out the dealers and seized all the drugs. With this amount of drugs, the Seowon Guild and the Pado Guild's research team would be able to extract valuable data.\nLee Sa-young gestured to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Alright. Let's go.\"\n\"Sure, I'm coming. Hi Nexby, search for the nearest bus terminal.\"\nCha Eui-jae called Nexby on his cracked phone. At this point, Nexby was practically his permanent companion. However, Lee Sa-young, still looking annoyed, tilted his head skeptically and glared at the phone.\nBy now, Cha Eui-jae could tell that Lee Sa-young always tilted his head when he was displeased. Unable to ignore it any longer, Cha Eui-jae asked, unable to hide his sour expression.\n\"What now?\"\n\"I just... wonder if you're doing this on purpose.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Why are you looking for a bus?\"\n\"I have to go home. If I wait any longer, the buses will stop running.\"\n\"Looking like that?\"\nLee Sa-young eyed Cha Eui-jae up and down, as if mocking him. Only then did Cha Eui-jae look at himself. Wet hair and hoodie, apron covered in footprints.\nCha Eui-jae was fine, but his appearance was a mess. Anyone who saw him would think he had been through something serious. Someone kind-hearted would definitely approach and ask what had happened!\nRealizing this, Cha Eui-jae quietly put his phone back in his pocket. He sighed deeply and brushed his wet hair back.\n'If I hadn't gotten drenched, I'd just go.'\nActually, he thought he could use silent footsteps to sneak out without being noticed. Just as Cha Eui-jae was about to stealthily head towards the door, Lee Sa-young pulled out a crumpled A4 sheet from his inventory. It was Hong Ye-seong's emergency escape button he had seen before.\nWithout giving Cha Eui-jae a chance to refuse, Lee Sa-young grabbed his arm and tore the paper. Moments later, they were standing in front of the hangover soup restaurant.\n\"...Isn't that a precious item?\"\n\"It's fine. It's a set of ten.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae reluctantly opened the door to the hangover soup restaurant and headed to the small room.\nThe small room attached to the back of the shop was packed with gift boxes recently received, with a neatly folded blanket and pillow on one side. Unless he moved all the boxes, Cha Eui-jae couldn't lie down properly.\nBut for Cha Eui-jae, even this kind of room was enough. He was actually grateful. Compared to sleeping on monster corpses and using their blood as a blanket in the rifts, this was much better. A room with walls and a ceiling, a place to lie down, a blanket, and a pillow. It was an ideal space.\nOf course, that was only Cha Eui-jae's opinion. Lee Sa-young looked around, thinking if a person could really live in such a place.\n\"You sleep here?\"\n\"Didn't you do all the background checks? You saw me coming out from here before.\"\nIt was about the day when he appeared in the middle of the night and sat in the hall. At Cha Eui-jae's retort, Lee Sa-young replied bluntly.\n\"I didn't know the inside of the room looked like this.\"\nTypical of the number one rank, he must have grown up pampered. But Cha Eui-jae had once been like that too, so he didn't bother to criticize and simply replied.\n\"If there's a blanket, a pillow, a floor, and a ceiling, what more do you need?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Why?\"\nLee Sa-young was staring at Cha Eui-jae. His delicate face was beginning to show a look of disapproval.\n\"Do you have a hobby of self-punishment or something?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 54: Unexpected Kindness\nWhat kind of question is this? Is he asking if I'm a masochist? Cha Eui-jae scrunched up his face and shot back as if it was nonsense.\n\"Why would I?\"\nLee Sa-young, not backing down, furrowed his brows.\n\"What's different between this and the container earlier?\"\n\"Hey, how can you compare it to that? This is much cleaner. There's even a blanket and a pillow.\"\n\"Clean the container and put a blanket and pillow there. It's the same.\"\n\"Are you wishing for me to move to Incheon Port or something?\"\nLee Sa-young was genuinely dumbfounded. He had taken him to a hangover soup restaurant thinking he might be tired, but instead, a tiny room appeared where he wondered if he could even stretch his legs properly. And Cha Eui-jae was naturally taking off his old sneakers and crawling into that tiny room.\nIf it had been the usual scene, it wouldn't have bothered him this much. But Lee Sa-young didn't intend to be harsh to someone who had come all the way to Incheon to help him. And thinking about Cha Eui-jae staying still despite his temper while he was getting beaten up...\n\"...\"\n\"Hey... your expression looks weird.\"\n\"What?\"\nBy now, the transport vehicle might have arrived. I should handle it myself instead of handing it over to the management. No, I must handle it myself.\nLee Sa-young finally decided to completely revise his original plan. The original plan was to take Cha Eui-jae home and then return immediately, but seeing the condition of Cha Eui-jae's \"home,\" he couldn't leave him there. After checking if he was wearing gloves, Lee Sa-young grabbed Cha Eui-jae's arm.\n\"Get out.\"\nCha Eui-jae opened his eyes wide, seemingly surprised by the unexpected response.\n\"Huh?\"\nLee Sa-young stubbornly pulled his arm.\n\"There's somewhere we need to go.\"\nA brief silent confrontation ensued. In fact, Cha Eui-jae wasn't one to back down easily. However, seeing Lee Sa-young's face glaring with his mouth tightly shut, the thought, \"What's the point of standing up to a kid?\" began to cross his mind. Cha Eui-jae shrugged his shoulders and bent to put on his sneakers.\n\"Fine, fine. Where to? Do you need another favor?\"\nLee Sa-young silently tore off the emergency escape button again.\nA little later, they arrived at the entrance of a house. It was as big as attaching dozens of hangover soup restaurants together, but it felt more empty and chilly rather than just large.\nCha Eui-jae felt strange. Although it was a place where people lived, there was no warmth in the house.\n\"...Where is this?\"\n\"My home.\"\nLee Sa-young, who answered briefly, headed inside as if it was nothing unusual and opened the refrigerator. Inside, neatly packed instant meals and bottled water were visible. Lee Sa-young took out a bottle of water, drank it, and pointed to a door. It seemed to be the bathroom.\n\"Wash up. I'll leave clothes in front.\"\nThe bathroom in this house was also very spacious. Feeling sticky all over, Cha Eui-jae quickly finished his shower and peeked out the door to check for clothes. Neatly placed were brand-new, unopened underwear and a navy silk pajama set.\n'Does he... sleep in pajamas?'\nCha Eui-jae unconsciously imagined Lee Sa-young in pajamas, then quickly erased the thought. Despite not having much of a size difference, the clothes were slightly loose. After rolling up the sleeves, Cha Eui-jae followed the sound of Lee Sa-young's movements. Lee Sa-young was sitting in a recliner chair that looked like it belonged in a bedroom. Glancing at Cha Eui-jae, Lee Sa-young pointed to the bed.\n\"Sleep there.\"\nAt his fingertips was a king-sized bed, big enough for two people. But not wanting to lie next to Lee Sa-young, nor wanting to occupy the bed alone while the owner stayed elsewhere, he replied indifferently.\n\"I'm not that shameless. Just give me a pillow. I'll sleep on the floor.\"\n\"Sleep on the bed.\"\n\"No. If you have a sleeping bag, give me that.\"\nHa, came a sound of exasperation. Lee Sa-young sneered. He twisted his lips.\n\"Who carries a sleeping bag these days?\"\n\"In my time, a sleeping bag was essential for dungeon trips, you punk.\"\n\"You know you sound like a damn old geezer even though there's only a four-year difference, right, Hyung? Anyone would think you've been a hunter for ten years...\"\nIt was an eerily accurate statement. But saying it out loud would be a death sentence. Cha Eui-jae shamelessly replied.\n\"Sleeping in a sleeping bag feels like camping, how nice is that. Besides, you've had it too easy as a hunter...\"\n\"Yes, yes, I've had it easy as a hunter, so I'll live uncomfortably starting today. Lie down.\"\n\"Don't make me the shameless guy who comes to someone else's house and takes their bed.\"\n\"Making the guest sleep on the floor is worse, so lie down.\"\n\"You're a jerk anyway, why do you care about that?\"\n\"If you just listen for once—\"\n\"Equal contract relationship, you punk. Am I your subordinate? This is an equal—\"\nAs they bickered, their tempers flared, and the furniture in the room began to rattle slightly. But they didn't care and raised their voices. The spacious house echoed with the shouts of the two men.\nSnap!\nA menacing sound came from the room, and the two men, who had been arguing over trivial matters, fell silent as if on cue.\nThe middle of the large mattress and the soft blanket had been blown out.\nStanding side by side in front of the broken bed, Lee Sa-young and Cha Eui-jae sighed simultaneously. If it had just been the bed frame that broke, they could have found a way to manage, but with the mattress perfectly split and sagging, there was no way to fix it. They couldn't exactly quick-deliver this enormous mattress.\nStaring at the mattress, which now had a gaping hole like the black hole in the sky, Cha Eui-jae muttered.\n\"...I'll pay for it.\"\nLee Sa-young scoffed.\n\"With what money?\"\n\"...I can sell magic stones.\"\n\"Ah, fuck... Don't even mention magic stones.\"\nLee Sa-young growled. His following words were in a somewhat whining tone.\n\"Because of that, there were articles about me and Jung Bin being close.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae bowed his head solemnly. Was this how hunters felt when rumors about them dating spread just because they had a brief conversation? Lee Sa-young and Jung Bin had only exchanged information and ate hangover soup. Cha Eui-jae vowed not to indulge in gossip about celebrities and hunters. Next to the solemn Cha Eui-jae, Lee Sa-young, arms crossed, muttered.\n\"...Wait.\"\nHe took out a gas mask from his inventory, put it on, and disappeared. Left alone, Cha Eui-jae lifted the mattress slightly. He saw the perfectly split and deeply sunk bed frame.\nHow many bowls of hangover soup would he need to sell to compensate for this? It surely wouldn't be a modest price considering Lee Sa-young's fastidious nature. Cha Eui-jae sighed heavily.\n***\nAt 3:40 AM, when most guild members had gone home and only a few were on duty, a post appeared. It was on the anonymous board of the Pado Guild.\nTitle: [Anonymous]\nThe sleeping room's blankets and pillows were all stolen...\n240 took all the blankets and pillows from the sleeping room.\nComments (3)\n—Is this a dream you had?\n—Not funny.\n—Good night.\nPado Guild members naturally ignored it. It wasn't even a joke worth considering. There's a limit to trolling...\nBut another post quickly followed. This time, there was a photo of the sleeping room.\nTitle: [Anonymous] Seriously, everything was taken??? (Proof)\n(Photo.JPEG)\nI'm serious.\nI saw it clearly.\nComments (8)\n—Huh?\n—Where did all the blankets and pillows go???\n—Did the cleaning staff take them for washing?\n⤷No, they clean during the day when no one's around;; they don't take stuff with people there.\n—Did 240 really take them?\n—Please share more.\n—Bro, hurry up and share more, a beautiful hunter is waiting.\n—Wow, I can't sleep now.\nThe Pado Guild's shower and sleeping rooms were a kind of welfare facility. They provided a space for hunters to rest comfortably after dungeon raids, which made their senses extremely sensitive.\nFor this reason, the quality of the Pado Guild's sleeping room was exceptionally high. Each person was assigned an individual room, equipped with beds and bedding to help them sleep, and even dungeon-specific fragrances to help relax. This sleeping room was one of the many boasts of the Pado Guild.\nBut now, all the precious bedding in that sleeping room has been stolen. The beds were left empty. And the one who took it was Lee Sa-young! It was an unbelievable story, but... there was photographic evidence. No one would dare fake a photo and mention Lee Sa-young. The conclusion was clear.\nThis post was real.\nIt was a wake-up call. Those who checked the Blind Post before bed were now cursed with the desperation of waiting for the next post. They helplessly refreshed Blind Post, waiting for the storyteller savior.\nJust before the Pado Guild members were about to die of thirst, the original poster returned with more details.\nTitle: [Anonymous] E40 Jean Valjean Story (Deleting in 10 minutes)\nStayed late to finish a report.\nAfter finishing work, I was too lazy to go home.\nSo, I decided to just sleep in the rest area and go to work from there.\nBut then someone slammed open the door of the next rest room, and it was almost 4 AM.\nI thought, \"What kind of rude ** is this?\" and opened the door to check.\nIt was 240.\nFrom that moment on, I couldn't think... it was like watching a movie.\n240 started gathering up all the blankets and pillows from the rest rooms.\nNot just one, but from every single room.\nIt looked like he was about to take the beds too, but he just took the blankets.\nI was in the very last room.\nAs 240 got closer, my senses kicked in.\nI was going crazy, worrying he'd take mine too.\nOur eyes met as I hugged my blanket tightly.\nThankfully, he didn't take mine.\nHe even kindly closed the door before leaving.\nThe end.\nComments (13)\n—Can I fact-check something? What was 240 wearing?\n⤷White short-sleeve shirt, black sweatpants, gas mask, and striped indoor slippers.\n⤷This story is real.\n⤷How do you know?\n⤷I rode the elevator with 240 dressed exactly like that earlier. Almost fainted.\n⤷Ah...\n—240 shows consideration, doesn't take the blanket from the person working late.\n⤷Even kindly closes the door.\n⤷God40\n—This anonymous poster is something else too. More afraid of losing their blanket than 240 ㅋㅋㅋ.\n—But technically, 240 paid for all that stuff, so can't really complain if he takes it.\n⤷LOL so true ㅋㅋ.\n—So why did 240 take the blankets and pillows???\n***\nHow long has it been since Cha Eui-jae started waiting for Lee Sa-young to return? He heard the door lock beep as it unlocked. Stretching to pass the time, Cha Eui-jae peeked his head out.\nWhat came through the door was... a white pile of cloth. At first, it looked like a ghost, but then he noticed long black legs sticking out from underneath. Those legs walked briskly down the hallway, despite not being able to see, and entered the spacious living room. Then the figure dropped all the cloth onto the floor like a waterfall. It was all blankets and pillows.\nWhat the hell is this? Cha Eui-jae looked back and forth between the pile of bedding and Lee Sa-young, trying to understand. It was a silent demand for an explanation, but Lee Sa-young said nothing. Finally, Cha Eui-jae asked seriously.\n\"...Did you rob a bedding store?\"\nLee Sa-young put away the gas mask into his inventory and looked at Cha Eui-jae. His face was cold.\n\"Do you think I'm some kind of thief?\"\nCha Eui-jae thought that the broken bed must have really shocked Lee Sa-young, who still seemed tense. Lee Sa-young placed his hands on his hips and gestured to the leather sofa with his chin.\n\"Lie down.\"\n\"...You're the homeowner, can't you sleep on the sofa?\"\n\"Say one more word.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And I'll understand it as a desire to break the sofa and sleep on the floor together.\"\nCha Eui-jae obediently lay down.",

      "content": "Chapter 55: Unexpected Kindness\nThe sofa at Lee Sa-young's house was incredibly soft. These days, even blankets are made from dungeon by-products, so maybe this sofa was too? Cha Eui-jae desperately tried to change his thoughts and accept the situation.\nIt was uncomfortable to take a seat more comfortable than the host, but he couldn't continue arguing here. If he did, they might end up breaking the sofa and both have to sleep on the floor.\nNot that he intended to, but he did contribute to breaking the bed. He couldn't afford to break another piece of furniture. And he certainly didn't have the money to pay for it.\n'Well, the older one should yield...'\nCha Eui-jae, rationalizing with his inherent old-fashioned mindset, was enjoying the sofa's softness when Lee Sa-young threw two pillows and two blankets at him. Cha Eui-jae instinctively caught them and mumbled.\n\"I don't need two.\"\n\"Just take what I give you.\"\nBehind Lee Sa-young, blankets and pillows were piled up like a hill. Where did he get all of those? Cha Eui-jae thought, unaware of the high-class sleeping room of the Pado Guild. Well, at least Lee Sa-young wouldn't be short on blankets even if Cha Eui-jae had two each.\nAfter confirming that Cha Eui-jae had laid down with a pillow and covered himself with a blanket, Lee Sa-young started laying his own bedding on the floor.\nAfter layering several blankets to make a soft mattress, Lee Sa-young lay down with a pillow. He clapped once, and all the lights in the house went out. Staring blankly at the dark ceiling, Cha Eui-jae muttered.\n\"...Sleep well.\"\nNo answer came back. It wasn't an expected reply anyway. The sofa was soft, the blanket was smooth, and the pillow supported his neck with just the right amount of firmness and height. It was a nice bed he hadn't experienced in a long time.\nBut did that mean he could sleep comfortably... no.\nReluctantly, Cha Eui-jae bit his lip and spoke.\n\"Lee Sa-young, are you asleep?\"\n\"What about you?\"\nIt wasn't a sleepy voice. It was the clear voice he heard just moments ago. Why did he have to answer so promptly? Hearing another person's voice made the tangled thoughts a bit clearer and brought his mind back to reality. Blinking, Cha Eui-jae spoke again.\n\"I can't sleep either.\"\n\"You should be tired.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"After all the chaos you caused...\"\nLee Sa-young chuckled as if it were ridiculous, but there was no malice.\n\"It wasn't a big deal.\"\nCha Eui-jae replied casually. There was another short silence between them. It was much more bearable than before. Cha Eui-jae stared at the ceiling and spoke again.\n\"What about Choi Go-yo? Will he be okay?\"\n\"Well... from Incheon to Seoul.\"\nLee Sa-young paused as if choosing his words carefully before continuing.\n\"He should be fine by tomorrow evening.\"\n\"The penalty is stronger than I thought.\"\n\"The skill is too good to use infinitely.\"\n\"Right...\"\nTheir conversation continued sporadically. Conversations between people couldn't go on infinitely without pauses, so silence inevitably followed. But Cha Eui-jae was no longer afraid of it. He felt he could fend off anything trying to creep in during the gaps.\nThis time, Lee Sa-young spoke first.\n\"Hyung.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Do you know I still have the letter?\"\n\"Letter? What letter?\"\n\"You gave it to me, but you don't remember?\"\nCha Eui-jae tried to recall but nothing came to mind. He didn't remember giving Lee Sa-young anything that could be called a letter. Lee Sa-young's rustling sounded like he was turning over. Cha Eui-jae also turned his body towards the sofa.\nLee Sa-young was lying on his side, propping his chin with his hand, looking at Cha Eui-jae. There was an amused expression on his pretty face.\n\"Touch them and you're dead.\"\n\"...Oh.\"\nCould it be the threat he wrote on the business card? It seemed he found the right person to give it to. As Cha Eui-jae looked with a sour face, Lee Sa-young chuckled and lowered his head.\nSuddenly, a blue light crossed his vision diagonally. One side of the living room had floor-to-ceiling windows, and the faint light of dawn was coming in. Has time passed so quickly? Cha Eui-jae rubbed his face dry and asked.\n\"What time is it?\"\n\"Well... around 4:30?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why, are you going to open the store?\"\n\"Hey, the store needs to open.\"\n\"Make Bae Won-woo do it.\"\n\"Can he?\"\n\"After all he's eaten, he should at least be able to make hangover soup...\"\nMuttering bluntly, Lee Sa-young also got up. Cha Eui-jae stretched his body after getting up. Time was tight, but with his new abilities, he could quickly prepare for business.\nThe clothes he wore yesterday had been taken for washing by Lee Sa-young, so he had to borrow Lee Sa-young's clothes again today. After putting on a black turtleneck and black slacks that Lee Sa-young chose for him, they both got into the elevator together.\nYes, together. Cha Eui-jae stood at an angle from Lee Sa-young, sticking to the spacious corner of the elevator. Lee Sa-young scoffed.\n\"Why don't you come closer?\"\n\"I'm comfortable here.\"\n\"After breaking my bed and borrowing my clothes.\"\n\"Don't say things that might be misunderstood.\"\n\"Why are you acting like this when we've already done everything...\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nCha Eui-jae had no intention of being seen off by Lee Sa-young, but the elevator in the Pado Guild building where Lee Sa-young's quarters were located required a guild member's ID to operate, like a hotel. Even the stairwell required a guild member's ID to open the door.\nSo, Cha Eui-jae had no choice but to take Lee Sa-young, a huge access tool, with him. Moreover, what Lee Sa-young said made Cha Eui-jae even more cautious.\n\"You're famous, you know.\"\n\"Me? Why?\"\n\"Do you think anyone in this guild hasn't tried your hangover soup?\"\n\"...\"\n\"If guild members ask why the part-timer is here?\"\nMy face being known in the Pado Guild was because you pre-paid five million won for hangover soup... Cha Eui-jae thought it was absurd but now wasn't the time to argue about it.\nWhat if they met someone? Even though it was 4 AM, what if they did?\nHe had no excuses. He couldn't say he was delivering hangover soup either. He had always made it clear that the hangover soup restaurant didn't deliver, and if he said that, he might have to hold a press conference about favoritism for the Pado Guild Leader.\nAs Cha Eui-jae pondered, he noticed the elevator's glass reflecting. The front glass made it feel like a door. Should he just break it... and jump out? He wouldn't get seriously hurt. The problem was...\n\"Hyung?\"\n\"Never mind...\"\nThe cost of the glass. With the debt from breaking the bed, Cha Eui-jae folded away his thoughts and focused straight ahead. He considered using his noiseless footsteps skill but it only concealed his presence, not his appearance, which was useless in this confined space.\nAs soon as the elevator arrived on the first floor with a chime, an ominous voice was heard.\n\"Damn, coming out of the dungeon and it's already dawn... Oh, Guild Leader?\"\n\"Get some sleep before going to work... Oh? Good morning! Up early, aren't you... uh?\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nAll eyes turned to the two of them. Specifically, they were startled seeing Lee Sa-young first and then, as they raised their heads, they noticed Cha Eui-jae stuck in the corner. Hunters returning from a dungeon raid were there, as well as Bae Won-woo, wiping sweat after a dawn run.\n\"Huh? Aren't you the part-timer? What brings you here?\"\nBae Won-woo approached the elevator door with a delighted greeting, but seeing Lee Sa-young standing in the center, he looked confused. Cha Eui-jae, with a face like his soul had left him, mumbled the names of flowers.\n\"Ah... yes... well... yes...\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Haha... it's just how it turned out.\"\nWhat turned out how? Cha Eui-jae didn't know either. Only Lee Sa-young stood nonchalantly in the center, glaring at Bae Won-woo. Of course, Bae Won-woo, as clueless as ever, continued speaking.\n\"But what brings you here, part-timer?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why are you here?\"\nLee Sa-young said nothing. Bae Won-woo, expecting no response from Lee Sa-young, turned to Cha Eui-jae. The part-timer would explain, surely. But Cha Eui-jae was the same.\nAs the silence stretched, the hunters' curiosity grew. Bae Won-woo's keen observation skills noticed the part-timer's unusual outfit. The black turtleneck and slacks looked like something Lee Sa-young would wear.\n'What?'\nThat turtleneck, wasn't it something Lee Sa-young wore recently? The forbidden realization struck Bae Won-woo's mind. The part-timer was... wearing Lee Sa-young's clothes? And the guy who hated lending clothes or having visitors? Coming down together with the part-timer?\nBae Won-woo's eyes widened in shock. Pointing a trembling finger at Lee Sa-young, he stammered.\n\"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what's this? Hey. Huh? Hey, what's this.\"\n\"Bae Won-woo.\"\n\"Hey, man! What's going on? Explain!\"\n\"How about running two more laps around the Han River.\"\nOn the surface, it was a polite suggestion, but Lee Sa-young's underlying message was 'get lost.' Even someone as oblivious as Bae Won-woo could understand that much.\nHowever, Bae Won-woo clung persistently to the two, refusing to leave. His tenacity was formidable, befitting a tank.\n'...At this rate, I won't get to the shop until after 5.'\nFinally, Cha Eui-jae took action. He stepped out from the corner and casually draped an arm around Lee Sa-young's shoulders. The Pado Guild members standing in front of them silently gasped. Lee Sa-young widened his eyes at Cha Eui-jae, but Cha Eui-jae ignored it.\nCha Eui-jae patted Lee Sa-young's shoulder, flashing a friendly smile.\n\"There was a bit of trouble last night, but Guild Leader Lee Sa-young kindly helped me out, haha.\"\n\"Trouble? What kind of trouble? Did someone break another table?\"\nThe shoulder under Cha Eui-jae's hand flinched slightly. Cha Eui-jae shook his head with a serious expression.\n\"I can't go into detail right now, but the Guild Leader was a great help.\"\n\"Sa-young did that?\"\nBae Won-woo's face was filled with confusion. He wanted to believe the hangover soup restaurant part-timer, but couldn't fathom why Lee Sa-young would help him. Cha Eui-jae delivered the final blow.\n\"Well, since I'm the part-timer at the hangover soup restaurant that Bae Won-woo likes so much, I think he looked out for me.\"\n\"What? ...Really?\"\nUnfortunately, Bae Won-woo was easily swayed by Cha Eui-jae's smooth talk. Lee Sa-young coldly ignored the faintly touched look in Bae Won-woo's eyes. Regardless, Cha Eui-jae skillfully slipped out of the elevator like dodging a monster attack, waving his hand.\n\"I have to open the restaurant soon, so I'll be off. See you at the shop!\"\n\"Oh? Oh, goodbye then, part-timer!\"\nBae Won-woo waved his muscular arm energetically. After Cha Eui-jae left, Bae Won-woo turned back to Lee Sa-young with a bewildered expression.\n\"So, why was the part-timer here? Did you really help him with something?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been silent, clicked his tongue and replied coldly.\n\"You're really not helpful at all.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 56: If the Body Is Strong, the Mind Does Not Suffer.\nDespite various twists and turns, Cha Eui-jae succeeded in registering as an awakened being, creating an alibi, and solving Lee Sa-young's request. However, he recently faced a new problem.\nThe automatic self-bar for kimchi and side dishes, which consumed magic stones instead of electricity, was highly cost-inefficient, but it gave Cha Eui-jae a bit of free time.\nBy simply stacking empty bowls next to the self-bar, hunters would order hangover soup and set their own kimchi, radish kimchi, and cheongyang peppers. Cha Eui-jae only had to cook the hangover soup and take out the rice from the warmer. This ultimate automatic self-bar was said to have ground down the engineers of the Pado Guild like whole peppercorns, and it wasn't just a rumor.\nSo, what did Cha Eui-jae do with the little bit of free time he gained?\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae sat at the counter, scratching his temple with a ballpoint pen. It was a common sight when he was managing the prepaid ledger, but unusually, a look of irritation was evident on his normally expressionless and tidy face. Instead of a ledger, thick books were piled like a hill in front of him.\nHunters eating hangover soup whispered among themselves.\n\"Does anyone know why the part-timer looks like he's about to kill someone?\"\n\"Yeah, I want another bowl, but he looks so pissed off I can't even ask.\"\n\"Uh, can we cook it ourselves?\"\n\"Mmph, mmrph.\"\n\"What are you saying? Gross. Finish your food before talking.\"\n\"The part-timer is studying for the basic hunter education and qualification exam.\"\nUpon hearing this from a recently awakened hunter, the faces of the surrounding hunters turned pale. A middle-aged hunter with a scruffy beard muttered incredulously.\n\"Wow... They still haven't gotten rid of that shitty basic education?\"\nA hunter in his mid-twenties grimaced and added.\n\"He must be really busy. That's gotta be such a pain... How many hours of mandatory education is it these days?\"\n\"I think it's 60 hours. 30 hours offline and 30 hours online. If you're too busy, you can submit a reason to the Awakened Management Bureau and switch to online. But even after completing the education, you still have to pass the test. If you don't score over 70, you have to retake the exam until you pass.\"\n\"Yuck. They should just get rid of it, but instead, they increased the hours.\"\n\"I'll confess something. I took the hunter exam four times.\"\n\"Four times? That's actually pretty good. Only crazy people pass it on the first try. It's fine.\"\n\"Guys, let's be quiet. Let's create a study-friendly environment for our part-timer.\"\nThe hunter who had taken the exam four times gagged. Cha Eui-jae, who had been listening to their conversation, also felt like throwing up a little. The white paper and black text looked like worms drawn by Park Ha-eun.\nOver the past few days, Cha Eui-jae had fully understood why Park Ha-eun drew worms on her worksheets.\nEvery awakened being in South Korea must go through a registration process at the registration center according to the Special Law for Awakened Beings. After registration, an Awakened Registration Card with their name and grade is issued.\nCha Eui-jae was also pleased to receive his stiff D-grade registration card. Despite being four grades lower than his true grade, it was precious to him because he had endured all kinds of hardships and adversities to get it. Uncharacteristically, he even subtly bragged about it to regular customers.\nHowever,\n\"Wow, congratulations on getting your registration card, part-timer.\"\n\"Now you have to prepare for the exam... Good luck. I have some past exam questions if you need them...\"\nWhat came back were somehow pitying looks.\nIt wasn't a look of disdain for being a D-grade. The regulars at the hangover soup restaurant weren't the kind of hunters who discriminated based on grade. So, what was the meaning of those lukewarm looks? Cha Eui-jae was puzzled, but he didn't have time to investigate further as he had to head out to Incheon Port for an investigation every dawn.\nHowever, after the Incheon Port incident was resolved, a rumor seemed to have spread in that short period. On his way back from finishing his meal, Bae Won-woo handed Cha Eui-jae an old problem book with a rather solemn expression. Cha Eui-jae looked at the book with a puzzled face.\n\"...What's this?\"\n\"This is not a gift. It's your precious human right.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"You'll understand soon enough. Today's hangover soup was delicious. I'm off!\"\nThe next morning, Honeybee also came early and plopped a thick, spiral-bound textbook on the counter.\n\"I heard the news, Cha Eui-jae. You're preparing for 'that', right?\"\n\"What is 'that'?\"\n\"Well, it's understandable you'd want to escape reality. I get it. Anyway, I got the past questions used for HB Guild's new recruits from Team Leader Han. Use it well. Got it?\"\n\"Honeybee, the reporters are all gathered at the dungeon entrance!\"\n\"Those bastards are quick. Well, I have to go tackle a dungeon now.\"\nAfter several such incidents, Cha Eui-jae was at his wit's end.\nBased on the hunters' conversations, it seemed that nowadays, to become a proper hunter after completing the awakened being registration, one had to pass some kind of test. Registering had been tough enough, but now a test? What kind of test? When Cha Eui-jae was active as J, there were no such rigorous registration systems and tests!\nThat night, after closing the shop, Cha Eui-jae dove into an internet search.\n\"Hi, Nexby. Search for hunter qualification exam.\"\n—Searching for information on the hunter qualification exam.\n—Hunter qualification exam sucks\n—When is the next hunter qualification exam?\n—I can't become a hunter because I keep failing the hunter qualification exam despite being awakened\n—Who made question 30 on the January exam? That bastard\n⤷It's Nam Woo-jin, who else?\n⤷Nam Woo-jin, let's fight fair and square without titles\n—I've taken the hunter qualification exam eight times, ask me anything\n⤷Isn't it better to quit trying to be a hunter at that point?\n—Hunter qualification exam, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die\nThe search results were shocking. As a hunter from 11 years ago, Cha Eui-jae stared into space, unable to believe the reality.\n'Ah, I'm... not a hunter yet?'\nThat was it. Cha Eui-jae had only received the awakened being registration card, but he wasn't a hunter yet!\nThe registration card issued after completing the registration process at the center was merely to certify that he was an awakened being. That was it. Ordinary people who knew nothing, like Cha Eui-jae, thought they could start working as hunters as soon as they got the card. However, the law had changed, and one couldn't be certified as a hunter with just that. In other words, it was just an empty card.\n'I went through all that trouble for an empty card?'\nCha Eui-jae looked at the shiny D-grade registration card with a hollow gaze. But that was not the end of it. The following information was even more shocking.\nTo escape from the empty card and be recognized as a formal hunter, one had to complete the 'Basic Hunter Education Program' and pass the 'Hunter Qualification Exam'. Passing the exam would grant a formal hunter license, allowing access to hunter markets and other benefits. It was all so excessive.\nEspecially notorious was the 'Hunter Qualification Exam,' a written test known for its hellish difficulty! It was called the hunter's college entrance exam, the hunter's bar exam, and other names associated with tough tests. Just searching for the hunter qualification exam would automatically bring up 'hunter qualification exam difficulty' in the suggestions.\nCha Eui-jae pulled at his hair.\n'Why is it so hard to become a hunter?'\nThe Basic Hunter Education Program was introduced five years ago. Initially, it wasn't this rigorous.\nAt first, it was designed to impart essential survival knowledge to newly awakened hunters, focusing on core information and covering basic topics like the ecology of 10th and 9th grade monsters and dungeon ecosystems.\nHowever, as time passed, the number of awakened beings increased.\n[Rising crime rates among awakened beings... Is public safety at risk?]\n[Hunters' unjust abuse of power, where does it end?]\nThe number of hunters who oppressed the weak and ordinary people by abusing their power increased. Even though the Awakened Management Bureau rigorously cracked down on them, cases of awakened beings flaunting their power and recklessly abusing it continued to arise.\nEventually, the government abolished the system where one automatically became a hunter upon awakening and implemented a policy where one had to complete basic hunter education and pass a qualification exam to be granted hunter status.\nAfter completing his search, Cha Eui-jae clasped his hands and cursed.\n'If you awaken, you should be fighting monsters, not harassing ordinary people...'\nMoreover, further research revealed that hunters scouted by guilds could skip the qualification exam by submitting a Guild Leader's certification document. It was a kind of endorsement. What a dirty network society. Among Cha Eui-jae's limited connections, there was only one Guild Leader he knew.\nLee Sa-young.\nBut Cha Eui-jae didn't want to ask Lee Sa-young for the certification document. It was a matter of pride. If the number one hunter in South Korea couldn't even pass such a qualification exam on his own, it would be embarrassing...\n'Let's study and give it a shot.'\nSo, Cha Eui-jae began studying for an exam he had never expected to take.",

      "content": "Chapter 57: If the Body Is Strong, the Mind Does Not Suffer.\nSince Cha Eui-jae started preparing for the Hunter qualification exam, the hunters took care of him in return for the hangover soup.\nThey often dropped by to give him chocolates and caffeinated drinks to help him with his studies. Cha Eui-jae didn't refuse these small gifts. The regulars at the hangover soup restaurant, who usually acted like they were gluttons for the soup, turned out to be quite helpful at times like this.\nMoreover, the 30-hour offline hunter basic training could now be taken online by submitting paperwork to the administration office. Another civil servant hunter, Yang Hye-jin, who was affiliated with the Rift Management Bureau, diligently helped with the paperwork.\nAs soon as she heard about the situation, Yang Hye-jin took out a laptop with the Rift Management Bureau's logo sticker on the lid from her inventory. Then, she started typing up Cha Eui-jae's paperwork with the skill of a professional who writes official documents every day. She muttered to herself while tapping away at the keyboard at an incredible speed, with a toothpick in her mouth.\n\"We all know the part-timer works at the hangover soup restaurant all day. How can someone like that find time to attend 30-hour classes in person?\"\n\"Right, right.\"\n\"Honestly, the training hours need to be reduced.\"\n\"These days, hunters are well-trained and disciplined from what they see and hear. There's no need for such rigorous training hours... but they never listen when we suggest reducing them.\"\nThe concern for Cha Eui-jae gradually turned into complaints about the higher-ups. It seemed Yang Hye-jin, who held a high position at the Rift Management Bureau, had her share of frustrations too. After all, powerful people have their own burdens. Soon, she forcefully hit the enter key and stepped back from the laptop.\n\"Done! By the way, do you have a laptop?\"\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\"Then I'll send it to the relevant department's email right away. This one document will allow you to take all 60 hours of classes online. Just turn it on and mute it, and you're good to go. Good luck!\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nAfter displaying the prowess of a professional civil servant, Yang Hye-jin left the hangover soup restaurant in style. Was this the bond that grows from a sense of camaraderie? It felt warm inside.\nOnce the training issue was resolved, Bae Won-woo showed up and plopped down boxes containing a new laptop and smartphone on the counter. Although the trend of giving awakening celebration gifts had already swept through the hangover soup restaurant once, the rule prohibiting gifts was still in effect.\nCha Eui-jae's gaze landed on the A4 paper with the gift prohibition notice.\n\"This isn't a gift from me, part-timer.\"\n\"Then who is it from?\"\n\"It's a gift from our Guild Leader, who is very close to you.\"\nCha Eui-jae's expression soured. Ever since the unexpected encounter in the elevator, Bae Won-woo mistakenly believed that Lee Sa-young and Cha Eui-jae were in a very close relationship. There were too many things to clarify, and he felt exhausted even before he could start explaining.\nBae Won-woo solemnly pressed on.\n\"I got it at an employee discount, so it's cheap. Just take it.\"\nA broken phone screen from Incheon Port was one thing, but what was the laptop for? Cha Eui-jae looked at Bae Won-woo with an incredulous expression, but Bae Won-woo was unfazed. As a heavy hangover soup fan, he couldn't afford to lose his second job and emphasized his innocence.\n\"By the way, I'm just a delivery man. Space shuttle delivery. Something like that.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, if you're going to ban someone, it should be Lee Sa-young, not me.\"\nHe was basically asking to be left out of the ban. Honeybee and the other hunters, who were watching, jeered and booed.\n\"How pathetic, Shield Guy.\"\n\"Don't call me by my hunter name!\"\nWhile watching Honeybee and Bae Won-woo bicker, Cha Eui-jae pushed the boxes away.\n\"I'm sorry, but the price is too high. I can't accept it. I'll just take your sentiment.\"\n\"Then use it while preparing for the exam and sell it on Tomato Market later as a nearly new secondhand item.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae's shoulder twitched at the mention of Tomato Market, which held terrible memories. Bae Won-woo smugly wiped his nose.\n\"Sa-young recommended that. That guy is really smart.\"\nWasn't he just adding that to get on Cha Eui-jae's nerves? Clueless Bae Won-woo likely filtered out the sarcasm. Honeybee, twirling her hair, suddenly asked.\n\"By the way, what is Sa-young up to these days? Haven't seen him around.\"\nCha Eui-jae was starting to get curious too. Ever since that day in the elevator, shoulder to shoulder, Lee Sa-young hadn't visited the hangover soup shop. Cha Eui-jae figured he must be busy dealing with the drugs and the drug dealers he brought him.\nHe did kind of miss his face, just a little. Unconsciously, Cha Eui-jae listened intently to Bae Won-woo's next words.\n\"I don't know, he's really busy these days. Caught a lot of weird guys. I haven't seen him either.\"\n\"Isn't catching weirdos the Administration's job? Why is Sa-young doing it?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\n\"That guy...\"\nIn the end, Cha Eui-jae accepted the laptop and phone on the condition that he would return them later. While running the shop, he muted the basic lectures and studied previous exam questions.\n***\nWith the full support of the regulars, Cha Eui-jae memorized three volumes of previous exam questions. Trying to study for an exam so diligently made time feel both slow and fast.\nFinally, the day of the Hunter qualification exam arrived.\nCha Eui-jae entered the middle school designated as his exam venue and took his seat. The classroom was much better equipped than the ones he vaguely remembered from his school days.\nSince the test-takers were awakened individuals, there were fewer people per classroom. The exam supervisor was a hunter from the Awakened Management Bureau. When the exam papers were distributed, Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath.\nRing— The bell signaling the start of the exam rang. The supervisor checked his watch and muttered.\n\"Yes, you may begin the exam.\"\nThe moment Cha Eui-jae turned over the cover of the exam paper, his eyes shook violently. He could hear the soundless cries of the awakened individuals around him, making desperate noises. It was understandable.\n'The questions are completely different from the practice tests!'\nThe practice test questions were mostly about memorizing provisions of the Awakened Special Law. It felt almost like brainwashing to ensure they followed the law strictly. It was as if the test writer was a ghost obsessed with the Special Law.\nBut now, the exam had entirely different types of questions from the very first one! Judging by the desperate sounds around him, Cha Eui-jae wasn't the only one shocked.\nThe test committee must have flipped the exam format like a pancake this month. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth.\n'Damn, I memorized the Special Law cases too.'\nCha Eui-jae's hard work was in vain. But since he was there to take the exam, he had to solve the questions. Cha Eui-jae half-heartedly started reading the questions.\nAnd then...\n'Why... is this easy?'\nHe was taken aback by how easily the questions flowed.\nOther test-takers were struggling, randomly marking the multiple-choice questions, while Cha Eui-jae's hand was flying over the exam paper.\nThis exam's questions were mostly about the characteristics and behavioral patterns of various monsters. In other words, it was Cha Eui-jae's area of expertise as a former field expert! Former J, now Cha Eui-jae, was a master of field knowledge that those who studied only theory and memorization couldn't match. Smiling, he finished and reviewed his answers before marking the OMR card.\n'The person who made these questions is quite a character...'\nWhen he checked the clock, there were still 30 minutes left until the exam ended. Cha Eui-jae decided to relax and enjoy some rare free time by lying down.\n***\nNot long after, the usually crowded hangover soup restaurant was even busier. After all, it was the day the results of the part-timer's qualification exam were released. The regulars glanced at the part-timer, who was rapidly chopping garlic, and whispered.\n\"I heard this Hunter exam was the toughest ever. Did he pass?\"\n\"Hey, our guild's new recruit came back crying. Not a single question from the practice tests was on the exam. It was full of questions about unfamiliar monsters.\"\n\"What the heck? How can someone who's never been in a dungeon know about monsters?\"\n\"Exactly. Our guy was well-versed in the Special Law, could even handle trials... poor thing.\"\nSomeone mimicked wiping their eyes with their sleeve, and another asked quietly.\n\"Who was the question maker this time?\"\n\"Rank 5. Gyu-gyu.\"\n\"Wow. That weirdo. When did he make the questions when he doesn't even stay in Korea?\"\n\"I don't know. Anyway, we should prepare to console the part-timer.\"\nThe regulars were more sullen than Cha Eui-jae, who took the exam.\nAt that moment, Cha Eui-jae's phone vibrated. The sharp-eared hunters instantly pinpointed the source of the vibration. It was in Cha Eui-jae's apron pocket. It seemed the exam results had arrived! Cha Eui-jae, who was deep in concentration chopping garlic, put down the knife and took out his phone.\nGulp. The hunters pretended not to notice but watched him closely.\n\"...\"\nA soft, gentle smile subtly appeared on Cha Eui-jae's neat face. Could it be that he passed the hellish, unprecedentedly difficult Hunter exam in one go? The hunters exchanged glances. The impatient Honeybee urgently asked.\n\"Well, Cha Eui-jae. Did you pass?\"\nCha Eui-jae scratched his cheek and nodded.\n\"Yes, I passed.\"\n\"You passed? In one try?\"\nThe murmuring grew louder.\n\"Wow... our part-timer is truly a talent who shouldn't just be working at a hangover soup restaurant.\"\n\"Congratulations!\"\n\"Congratulations! Our proud hangover soup restaurant part-timer!\"\nAt someone's shout, Cha Eui-jae's gentle smile cracked slightly.\n'That bastard decided the banner wording.'\nThe hunters gathered around to congratulate him on his passing. He passed the exam and also identified the one who took charge of the banner. Cha Eui-jae smiled contentedly and politely nodded at each congratulatory remark.\nThen, his phone buzzed again. Cha Eui-jae checked the message.\nSa-young: Congratulations\nIt was the first contact in a long time.",

After becoming a formal Hunter, the things Cha Eui-jae needed to know doubled, and the things he needed to be careful about tripled.\nThe first thing Cha Eui-jae opened was [One-Touch! How to Use the Hunter Market], which Jung Bin had given him before. He had an ambition, albeit not quite a dream, to someday sell the magic stone he possessed and hit the jackpot. To avoid repeating the nightmare of EZ, he had to read each section carefully.\nAs he was seriously skimming through the contents of the book, his phone vibrated briefly. Seeing the name on the screen, Cha Eui-jae reached out to check the message. It had been a while since he last heard from Lee Sa-young, who had congratulated him right after he passed the Hunter exam.\nSa-young: When are you available?\nSa-young: Nam Woo-jin\nNam Woo-jin. Just the name alone. As soon as Cha Eui-jae saw the message, he called Lee Sa-young. After just two rings, Lee Sa-young answered. With a slightly excited voice, Cha Eui-jae asked directly.\n\"Is it possible to treat my grandmother's leg?\"\n\"Yes. Thanks to you, I managed to get something...\"\nThe sound of paper shuffling quietly came from the other side of the phone. After a brief silence, Lee Sa-young asked.\n\"Would two days later work?\"\n\"Well, I'll have to ask my grandmother first...\"\nSince her knee pain had made it difficult for her to move, she had mostly stayed at home, so she probably didn't have any other plans. Thanks to his newly acquired skill, Cha Eui-jae had become quite efficient in preparing materials, so there shouldn't be any problem. Cha Eui-jae nodded.\n\"It should be fine.\"\n\"Then, let's meet at Seowon Guild at that time.\"\nAlthough the conversation seemed to be over, Lee Sa-young didn't hang up the phone. Intermittently, the sound of quiet breathing could be heard from the other end. As Cha Eui-jae read through the [Hunter Market Usage Rules] with the phone between his shoulder and ear, he pulled the phone away and checked if the call was still ongoing. With a puzzled voice, Cha Eui-jae asked.\n\"...Do you have something else to say?\"\n\"...No. See you then.\"\nLee Sa-young was the first to hang up. Cha Eui-jae stared blankly at the ended call screen for a moment, then immediately called grandmother and Park Ha-eun's house. The phone didn't ring long before a lively voice answered.\n\"Hello. Who is this?\"\nCha Eui-jae's face unknowingly lit up with a warm expression. Responding to Park Ha-eun's cheerful voice, his voice naturally went up half a tone.\n\"Hey, Ha-eun. It's Uncle. Is Grandma home?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Can you put Grandma on the phone?\"\nPark Ha-eun's voice calling for her grandmother faded away. By the time Cha Eui-jae finished reading the usage rules and started reading the precautions and fraud cases of the Hunter Market, there was a faint sound of coughing and the presence of someone approaching on the other end of the line.\n\"Yes. What's going on?\"\n\"Ah, Grandma. Are you free around 2 PM the day after tomorrow?\"\n\"There's nothing going on.\"\nAlthough it was as he had expected, Cha Eui-jae felt a bit happier. He quickly got to the point.\n\"Then, how about going to the hospital then?\"\n\"Hospital? Why the hospital?\"\n\"Your knee is not doing well. I heard from the regulars that there's a good hospital for leg pain. The consultation fee is cheap, too.\"\nInstead of explaining that the seventh-ranked in South Korea and the only A-grade healer would personally treat her, Cha Eui-jae simplified it as \"a hospital that's good with legs.\" Well, he was once an orthopedic specialist, so it wasn't a lie. There was a doctor, and he was good at treating legs. That was enough, wasn't it? Cha Eui-jae justified himself and waited for his grandmother's answer.\n\"No need.\"\n\"Why, Grandma?\"\n\"What's the point of seeing a doctor? I can walk well enough as it is.\"\nWhen grandmother sighed and answered, Cha Eui-jae adjusted his posture slightly and spoke gently.\n\"But Grandma, you need to get healthy quickly so you can come to the hangover soup restaurant. The regulars miss you a lot.\"\nGrandmother had been making hangover soup at the restaurant for 30 years. She had done so even before the Day of the Rift and continued without change afterward. The warm bowl of hangover soup she had offered a stranger led Cha Eui-jae to stay here.\nWithout her, he would have wandered the unfamiliar city and died an unknown death. Cha Eui-jae was certain of that. He wanted to repay the favor that saved his life. He tapped his fingers on the table and spoke in a slightly gloomy tone.\n\"Can you trust me and go just once?\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you take the medicine, you'll feel better...\"\n\"...Alright.\"\n\"Really?\"\nGrandmother responded gently, seemingly giving in to Cha Eui-jae. The worry in his heart lightened considerably.\n\"Yes. The day after tomorrow at 2 PM, right?\"\n\"Yes, around 2 or 2:30. I'll come to pick you up.\"\n\"Okay. If you get tired working at the restaurant, just close up and rest. Health is the most important thing.\"\n\"Yes, Grandma.\"\nCha Eui-jae hung up the phone and stretched. He felt good for some reason.\n***\nTwo days later, the preparation time arrived. As Cha Eui-jae was about to hang up the sign, the figure of someone already standing by the door nodded. It had been a while since he'd seen the black-masked face, and he felt somewhat glad.\n\"Hello, Hyung.\"\n\"You're here?\"\n\"Where's Granny?\"\n\"At home. Her legs are bothering her.\"\n\"It's fine. We're going to use the escape button anyway.\"\nCha Eui-jae almost commented on how many escape buttons he had used so far, considering each set had ten, but he held back. While it was a transaction condition, today he was the one in need. He decided to get through the day as smoothly as possible.\n\"Can I bring Ha-eun too?\"\n\"Ha-eun? ...Oh.\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head and then recognized the name with a small exclamation.\n\"Your niece?\"\n\"Yeah. I can't leave her alone.\"\n\"Alright, I'll let them know.\"\nLee Sa-young nodded. Cha Eui-jae spread his hands as if to show he was ready and placed his hand on Sa-Young's shoulder. Lee Sa-young smiled as the sound of air escaping came from his mouth. As Lee Sa-young took out one of Hong Ye-Seong's masterpieces from his inventory and tore the button, they were instantly transported to grandmother and Park Ha-eun's house.\nFacing Lee Sa-young, Cha Eui-jae quickly turned and headed to the front door. Park Ha-eun, who had been eagerly waiting for them, jumped up and grabbed his hand, slightly hiding behind him as children often do when meeting strangers.\nA rough hand gently ruffled her hair as he explained the way to the hospital that specialized in treating legs— Seowon Guild, actually. Lee Sa-young stood still a few steps away the whole time.\n'...Hm?'\nInside the gas mask, his gaze lowered to waist height. Park Ha-eun was half-hiding behind Cha Eui-jae, her eyes sparkling as she stared at him. Lee Sa-young met her gaze with indifferent eyes, then turned his attention to Cha Eui-jae's call.\n\"Lee Sa-young, let's go.\"\nLee Sa-young slowly approached, taking out another escape button. He had already used two today, but he didn't hesitate.\n***\nThe Seowon Guild building was a tall skyscraper in the heart of the city. At the entrance, Lee Sa-young gestured to the security guard, who briefly listened to instructions through an earpiece before bowing.\n\"Welcome, Guild Leader Lee Sa-young of the Pado Guild. Guild Leader Nam Woo-jin is expecting you.\"\n\"Where is he?\"\n\"He's in the central library.\"\nAfter receiving their identification badges, they were allowed to enter. Park Ha-eun, who had been excited since their departure, clung to the badge around her neck and fiddled with it. Once inside, the modern and sleek lobby gave way to an entirely different scene.\n[Verifying entry permission...]\n[Identity verification complete for Lee Sa-young and party of three.]\n[Welcome to the Seowon Guild.]\nCha Eui-jae had expected a hospital-like setting since Nam Woo-jin, a former doctor, would be treating his grandmother. But what unfolded before him was a grand library.\nPark Ha-eun gaped, looking around in awe. The towering shelves were packed with countless books, and Seowon Guild hunters, wearing yellow librarian armbands, busily pushed book carts through the aisles.\nCha Eui-jae also glanced around as they moved. The floor tiles, the shape of the bookshelves— they were familiar. If he remembered correctly, this was the same place he had seen in fragments of Yoon Ga-eul's memories. It appeared that the Seowon Guild library had served as a base camp for survivors even after the apocalypse. Though it was almost destroyed in the other world...\nLee Sa-young, walking briskly, spoke up.\n\"Nam Woo-jin should be at the central bookshelf.\"\n\"The central bookshelf?\"\nNavigating through the maze of shelves, they entered a cozy hall-like space surrounded by large bookshelves. In the center was a staircase leading from the first to the second floor, and on that staircase stood a man in a white coat, his back turned.\nWith long white hair tied back and wearing a white coat, the man sensed their presence and turned his head. Lee Sa-young nodded, and the man slowly descended.\n\"You arrived sooner than I expected.\"\nThe man tucked the book he was holding under his arm and spoke in a greeting. The low voice from beside Cha Eui-jae called out to the white-haired man.\n\"Nam Woo-jin.\"\nThe man before them was Nam Woo-jin, ranked 7th in South Korea and an A-grade healer.",

      "content": "Chapter 59: If the Body Is Strong, the Mind Does Not Suffer.\nNam Woo-jin's hair and even his pupils were pure white. After greeting Lee Sa-young with a nod, he turned his attention to Cha Eui-jae, Grandmother, and Park Ha-eun standing behind them. His white eyes, behind silver-rimmed glasses, scanned the three people as if observing them, then he bowed.\n\"Nice to meet you. You are the patient Choi Pil-sun and her guardian Cha Eui-jae, correct?\"\n\"Ah, yes. That's correct.\"\nCha Eui-jae also bowed politely in response. He had been tense, thinking Nam Woo-jin might be quite close to Lee Sa-young, but Nam Woo-jin seemed to be a sensible person, which was reassuring. The white-haired man straightened up and checked the watch on his wrist.\n\"Well then... shall we start the consultation? Time is precious, after all. I'll guide you to the consultation room.\"\n\"Can we bring Ha-eun along?\"\n\"Yes, that's fine.\"\nCha Eui-jae had worriedly asked for permission, but the person in question seemed to have no interest in the adults' conversation at all.\nPark Ha-eun was busy looking around, turning her little head in every direction. It seemed like her eyes were spinning, seeing such a library with so many books for the first time in her life. Even for Cha Eui-jae, the scenery here was somewhat surprising.\nPark Ha-eun was engrossed in the sight of a librarian hastily pushing a book cart somewhere.\n'She looks like she wants to ride that thing...'\nAs Cha Eui-jae was thinking about which direction and when he should catch her if she tried to run and jump on the book cart, his eyes met Nam Woo-jin's. Nam Woo-jin gave a faint smile.\n\"Ha-eun seems to prefer exploring the library to coming into the consultation room. Don't you think so?\"\n\"...I suppose so.\"\n\"Then why don't we let Ha-eun continue exploring the library while I take just the guardian and the patient? One of our guild members will assist the patient.\"\n\"Oh no, I'm fine...\"\nThe elderly woman lightly waved her hand, but Nam Woo-jin responded skillfully yet firmly.\n\"You may be able to walk well, but the consultation room is a bit of a distance away. It would be better for your legs to accept the assistance. Now then...\"\nPerhaps his experience dealing with elderly patients at a regular hospital was showing. While Cha Eui-jae was inwardly impressed, Nam Woo-jin turned around, signaling them to follow with a short laugh. A librarian with a yellow armband carefully assisted the grandmother.\nCha Eui-jae's gaze fell on Lee Sa-young, who was standing a step back.\n\"Lee Sa-young, what about you?\"\n\"No need for me to follow, is there?\"\n\"That's true, but...\"\nBefore stepping into the corridor to follow his grandmother, Cha Eui-jae glanced at Park Ha-eun, who was now looking eager to run between the bookshelves. That girl...\nCha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young's arm and pulled him slightly closer.\n\"Hey, Sa-young.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, wearing his gas mask, looked at Cha Eui-jae quietly. His gaze felt somewhat peculiar, but Cha Eui-jae brushed it off and whispered softly into Lee Sa-young's ear.\n\"Can you watch Ha-eun for me?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young's violet eyes behind the mask lenses momentarily reflected an exasperated look.\n\"You're using me as a babysitter now?\"\n\"No, I don't want to ask you for this either, but look at her.\"\nCha Eui-jae pointed at Park Ha-eun. Her interests were changing by the second. In 20 seconds, her head had turned from the bookshelf to the librarian, to the book cart, back to the librarian, to the books, and so on, without staying fixed on anything. Cha Eui-jae muttered to himself.\n\"I think Ha-eun might get lost while Grandma is having her consultation.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just stay near her so she doesn't get lost. That's all I'm asking.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young looked down at Cha Eui-jae silently. Cha Eui-jae didn't avoid his gaze and met his eyes behind the mask. After a moment, Lee Sa-young gave a small nod, and Cha Eui-jae smiled broadly, patting Lee Sa-young on the back.\n\"Thanks. I'll be back soon!\"\nAnd then he ran off.\n'...Does getting patted on the back always hurt this much?'\nIt was a sharp pain he hadn't felt in a long time. Lee Sa-young rubbed his back where Cha Eui-jae had patted, then slowly followed Park Ha-eun, who had already disappeared between the bookshelves.\nPark Ha-eun was squatting in front of the bottom shelf, pulling out a thick hardcover book as big as her forearm. Lee Sa-young checked the title of the book.\n\"T-0783 Physical Experiment Report\"\nIt definitely didn't seem like appropriate reading material for a nine-year-old. How did she manage to pull out such a book? Was it because she was Cha Eui-jae's niece? She wasn't ordinary either. Lee Sa-young quickly approached and spoke to her.\n\"Hey, kid.\"\n\"...\"\nNo response. Her hearing should be fine. Lee Sa-young frowned slightly and corrected the way he addressed her.\n\"...Park Ha-eun?\"\n\"What?\"\nOnly then did Park Ha-eun look up at Lee Sa-young with wide eyes. Ah, she didn't like being called \"kid.\" She ignored it completely. Lee Sa-young pointed at the hardcover book she was holding.\n\"Your uncle wouldn't like you reading that.\"\n\"What's it about?\"\n\"Something your uncle wouldn't like.\"\nApparently, this child didn't like being treated as a kid. So instead of saying it was something she shouldn't read, Lee Sa-young said it was something her uncle wouldn't like. Telling someone not to do something only makes them want to do it more.\nA look of contemplation crossed Park Ha-eun's round face. Lee Sa-young gestured to a passing librarian.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Yes? Ah, Guild Leader Lee Sa-young. What can I help you with?\"\n\"Is there a book suitable for this child?\"\nLee Sa-young nodded toward the much smaller girl. The librarian kindly guided them.\n\"Ah, there's a corner with picture books for children over there. We also have a section with educational comics.\"\nAlthough Lee Sa-young had visited this library multiple times, he hadn't known there were picture books and educational comics here. All the books in this library must be ones Nam Woo-jin had read. Today, he had to appreciate Nam Woo-jin's thirst for knowledge.\nLooking down at the round head, Lee Sa-young said,\n\"I think your uncle would like it if you read an educational comic.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\n\"That book doesn't have any pictures.\"\n\"...\"\nWell, except for dissected photos of experimented humans or monsters. Lee Sa-young swallowed the last part. After some contemplation, Park Ha-eun finally put the hardcover book back in its place with a grunt and muttered gloomily,\n\"Where's the educational comic section?\"\nGood. Lee Sa-young smiled slightly with satisfaction and followed the librarian. The place the librarian led them to was a children's section with relatively low bookshelves filled with colorful books. Soft, plush mats covered the floor, and there were large stuffed toys scattered around.\n'She should be fine here.'\nPark Ha-eun, her previous gloominess gone, was now eagerly browsing through the books. Lee Sa-young asked the librarian for a chair, then sat down in a spot where he could see the children's section clearly, closed his eyes, and crossed his arms.\nJust when he thought things had quieted down with Park Ha-eun engrossed in books, a small, familiar presence slowly approached him. It was Park Ha-eun. Lee Sa-young slightly opened his eyes to look down at her.\n\"...\"\n\"Um, you know...\"\nHer innocent eyes were sparkling like they had when she first saw the library. Meeting her gaze, Lee Sa-young felt an inexplicable sense of foreboding.\nPark Ha-eun spread her fingers wide and made a V sign over them with her other hand, mimicking a gesture Lee Sa-young had made in a public service advertisement.\n\"You're the person who did this on TV, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Can you do it for me once?\"\nPark Ha-eun's eyes sparkled with anticipation. He thought if he did it once, she'd lose interest and go back to reading. It wasn't a big deal... though he didn't particularly want to do it, Lee Sa-young decided to oblige rather than drag it out. He made the gesture from the public service ad for Park Ha-eun. However, Park Ha-eun was very strict, like a meticulous pottery master.\n\"That's not it!\"\nHer bright, round eyes looked like a small whirlwind in her enthusiasm. Lee Sa-young made a dismissive gesture with his hand.\n\"I did it. Go back to your book.\"\n\"Nooo, just once more. Please?\"\nLee Sa-young sighed briefly. Then he made the gesture from the ad again, hoping this time it would satisfy her. But his hopes were dashed as Park Ha-eun firmly declared,\n\"Again!\"\n\"Read your book.\"\n\"Just once more.\"\n'You said all I had to do was keep an eye on her so she wouldn't get lost, damn it...'\nAt that moment, Lee Sa-young missed Cha Eui-jae terribly.",

      "content": "Chapter 60: If the Body Is Strong, the Mind Does Not Suffer.\nLee Sa-young forgot the rule of the world that \"the first time is hard, but the second time is easy,\" and fell into the trap of infinite finger play.\nWhenever Lee Sa-young made a hand gesture, Park Ha-eun would shout, \"Again!\" So Lee Sa-young would show it once more, only for Park Ha-eun to shout, \"Again!\" Seeing someone from TV performing in front of her was quite thrilling. Even after doing it about twenty times, Park Ha-eun showed no signs of getting bored.\nAs Lee Sa-young spread his fingers once more, he thought,\n'Aren't you afraid of poison?'\nMost people avoided coming near him. Even though he always wore a gas mask, special anti-poison gloves custom-made by Hong Ye-seong, and carried an antidote, people kept their distance.\nLee Sa-young didn't mind this. In fact, he thought it was very natural. If he relaxed his guard even for a moment while breathing, the person next to him could die. It was easier for him if people kept their distance.\nBut Park Ha-eun and Cha Eui-jae were different.\n\"Again!\"\nWhen Lee Sa-young heard \"again,\" he moved like a machine and fell into thought.\nPark Ha-eun was young and might not understand why Lee Sa-young wore a gas mask and never took off his gloves. Or maybe she understood but couldn't fully grasp the danger. Kids could be brave to the point of recklessness.\nBut Cha Eui-jae was different. He had almost died from Lee Sa-young's poison, yet he would casually grab Lee Sa-young's arm without any fear. He wasn't a child and knew how dangerous the world could be.\nLee Sa-young couldn't easily understand Cha Eui-jae. But did that inexplicability make him uncomfortable...?\n\"You almost died.\"\nNo. It wasn't so bad. Of course, there were frustrating and tense moments. The image of Cha Eui-jae coughing up bright red blood was still vivid in Lee Sa-young's mind.\nFor the first time since his awakening, he felt a sense of urgency. He couldn't understand why the antidote wasn't working. Logical questions didn't even occur to him.\nCha Eui-jae must not die. He couldn't let him die.\nThat was the only thought in his mind. The red alert was blaring in his head. Lee Sa-young used the divine dew obtained from a first-class dungeon on Cha Eui-jae without hesitation. Its price and value didn't matter at all at that moment. What mattered was only...\n\"Again, again!\"\nPark Ha-eun demanded once more. While Lee Sa-young showed the hand gesture again, a boy in a white gown approached them. The boy, who looked as if he was made of smooth, delicate white porcelain, wasn't actually a boy but...\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\nIt was a marionette given to Nam Woo-jin by an Italian puppeteer in gratitude for saving his life. The puppet looked up at Lee Sa-young with an expressionless face.\n\"Park Ha-eun, go read your book now.\"\n\"Aww...\"\nPark Ha-eun pouted and alternated her gaze between the boy marionette and Lee Sa-young before reluctantly heading to the children's book section. Her attitude was in stark contrast to her persistent demands for more hand gestures.\n'Being perceptive when it matters...'\nLee Sa-young thought of Cha Eui-jae but quickly shook his head to block out the ensuing thoughts. Only after confirming that Park Ha-eun had settled down with a book did Lee Sa-young nod his head.\n\"Speak.\"\nThe marionette began briefing in a mechanical voice.\n\"The patient you requested a consultation for has finished his appointment. The master is choosing the treatment method, so I'm here to deliver the situation instead.\"\nLee Sa-young asked succinctly,\n\"Status?\"\n\"The master diagnosed it as rheumatoid arthritis1. Symptoms appeared in the hands first, and due to delayed treatment, it spread to the knees.\"\n\"Cure.\"\n\"If medication and consistent management are combined, there will be significant improvement. The master also suggested focusing on reducing pain and managing the condition to avoid interfering with daily life rather than aiming for a complete cure.\"\n\"No use of ability.\"\n\"Yes. Since the disease was caused by natural factors according to real-world laws, the master's ability could not heal it.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young nodded in understanding. The marionette, after a slight bow, brought up a second issue.\n\"Recently, we have made good use of the large quantity of PRO-009 you sent. The master asked me to convey his thanks.\"\nPRO-009 was the temporary code name for the drugs that Cha Eui-jae had risked his life to retrieve.\nThe drugs they had analyzed so far had been evolving and strengthening little by little. Each time they found new variations, they updated the number. The latest discovery differed enough from previous drugs to be designated as '9.' Given the nine stages of evolution, it was the most potent and dangerous drug they had encountered.\nThe marionette suggested,\n\"The master recommended that you visit the lab to review the analysis results. The librarians will take care of the child.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young looked down at the puppet standing before him with a chilly gaze.\nIt was a logically sound suggestion, but not strictly necessary. He could receive a detailed report on the analysis later. Why was Nam Woo-jin so insistent on sending him to the lab?\n\"...Alright.\"\nWhatever his ulterior motives, Nam Woo-jin could not harm him or Cha Eui-jae. Judging based on rationality rather than trust, Lee Sa-young slowly made his way to the lab.\n***\n\"...It's not an incurable disease, but it requires ongoing management. Think of it like diabetes; you'll need to be cautious for the rest of your life.\"\nNam Woo-jin's consultation room was deep within the maze-like library. After passing through dimly lit corridors filled with books, a metal door opened to reveal a typical doctor's office.\nThe elderly woman, supported by a guild member, headed to the physical therapy room, leaving only Nam Woo-jin and Cha Eui-jae in the consultation room. Nam Woo-jin clicked his pen and continued,\n\"My ability can only heal injuries that occur under the system's laws... I'm sorry I couldn't provide a complete cure.\"\n\"No, I'm grateful just for the consultation.\"\nCha Eui-jae cautiously asked,\n\"Which hospital should she go to in the future? She can't always come here.\"\n\"Right. My schedule is quite unpredictable, so I can't see her every time. But...\"\nNam Woo-jin typed something on the keyboard and wrote down the name of a hospital on a yellow sticky note. It was a university hospital in the heart of Seoul.\n\"I'll contact the hospital, so she can go there from now on.\"\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\"No need to pay for consultations or medications either. Seowon Guild will cover all costs.\"\n\"Huh? Why?\"\nCha Eui-jae asked in surprise. This was his first time meeting Nam Woo-jin, so why would he pay for a stranger's hospital bills? Rheumatoid arthritis wasn't even a rare disease. Nam Woo-jin, instead of answering directly, gazed at Cha Eui-jae with his transparent white eyes.\n\"Now that my work as a doctor is done, let me introduce myself as a fellow hunter.\"\nHe slowly blinked his white eyes and continued,\n\"I'm Nam Woo-jin, ranked 7th in South Korea. I'm the Guild Leader of Seowon Guild and the owner of this library. Are you Cha Eui-jae?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You are Lee Sa-young's 'associate.'\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes sharpened slightly. Nam Woo-jin maintained the polite smile he had shown the elderly woman and continued,\n\"You don't have to answer. Your presence here is already an answer.\"\nHe was making a definitive statement. Cha Eui-jae pondered his words.\n\"Why does my presence here count as an answer?\"\n\"...Lee Sa-young has never brought anyone here before. You are the first person to set foot here through Lee Sa-young's introduction.\"\nNam Woo-jin stood up and looked down at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Would you like to take a walk?\"\nCha Eui-jae stood up without a word. As Nam Woo-jin took a step, the white consultation room disappeared, and a blue garden appeared. The scent of grass and the gentle breeze felt just like a real garden. Was this Nam Woo-jin's skill? As Nam Woo-jin walked ahead, he spoke,\n\"Since the Day of the Rift, I have been deeply interested in this changed world. What is the system? What is the rift? Where do the monsters come from?\"\nThese were questions everyone was curious about. But no one in South Korea or the world, including Cha Eui-jae, could provide clear answers. Nam Woo-jin didn't seem to expect an answer and continued,\n\"I have been gathering as much knowledge as possible to find answers to these questions. I maintain a good collaborative relationship with Lee Sa-young as well.\"\n\"I see.\"\nAs the dew-soaked grass softly squished underfoot, Nam Woo-jin stopped.\n\"Seems you find it quite interesting.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Then... how about this story?\"\nHis eyes, burned white, reflected Cha Eui-jae's face fully. Nam Woo-jin watched for any small change in expression and spoke a single word,\n\"Lee Sa-young was an experimental subject of Prometheus2.\"\n◄\n☰\n►\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that mostly affects joints. It occurs when the immune system, which normally helps protect the body from infection and disease, attacks its own tissues.\n↩︎Prometheus, in Greek religion, is one of the Titans, the supreme trickster, and a god of fire.

Cha Eui-jae looked at Nam Woo-jin with a stern face, but he turned away and started walking slowly again.\n\"From now on, the things I am about to tell you are stories that are not known to the outside world.\"\nHe pointed at the sky with his finger.\n\"It was not long after the death of J was announced... The whole country was in turmoil. It was also a time when the government was failing to fulfill its role.\"\nA time of confusion when the nation lost its power. Naturally, those at the top would have covered up many incidents to quell the unrest. Cha Eui-jae thought about the things buried in those 8 years that he didn't know about.\nThey had already passed through the garden and were now deep in a quiet forest. Amidst the dense green, Nam Woo-jin's white hair shone brightly.\n\"Lee Sa-young was found in a laboratory.\"\n\"...\"\n\"No, it would be more accurate to say it was a place that used to be a laboratory. Everything had melted away due to the poison. In the midst of the black ruins, he was sitting alone, wearing loose patient clothes.\"\nThe image he saw at the rift naturally came to mind. Just by Lee Sa-young's touch, the radiant garden instantly turned black, becoming a toxic swamp where nothing could live. Cha Eui-jae had witnessed the massive forest, which was as green as this place, decaying from Lee Sa-young's fingertips right before his eyes.\nA deadly poison that even A-grade Hunter Seo Min-gi couldn't approach. Without his basilisk venom, Cha Eui-jae might not have been able to stay intact near Lee Sa-young.\n\"The surroundings were completely devastated. Approaching recklessly would have meant certain death.\"\nNam Woo-jin continued speaking slowly.\n\"Only Jung Bin, equipped with protective gear, could barely get close to him. But eventually, even he got poisoned and had to take an antidote.\"\nLee Sa-young, who was found after melting down Prometheus's laboratory, and who is now chasing them. Prometheus, who aims to artificially create awakened individuals. The clues that shouldn't have fit together were falling into place one by one. Cha Eui-jae felt a slight discomfort and frowned.\n\"Are you saying that Lee Sa-young is the first successful experiment?\"\n\"Well, that, I cannot say for sure.\"\nSomewhere, a bird's chirping could be heard.\n\"Whether he awakened because of their experiment, or the system answered Lee Sa-young's desperate prayers.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, I believe it's the latter.\"\nDespite telling quite shocking stories, Nam Woo-jin was smiling casually.\n\"At that time, their research hadn't progressed much, so they used people with some peculiarities as test subjects.\"\n\"Peculiarities?\"\n\"Yes. Those who had been involved in a rift, or had wounds from a monster attack. In any case, something special related to the rift. They might have kidnapped people for experiments in that chaotic state.\"\nSomething special related to the rift, he said. For a moment, a faint whisper like a hallucination lingered in Cha Eui-jae's ears.\n\"Please... save me.\"\nA boy who was dying, embraced by two people who had melted from the poison in the rift, which had been covered in deadly poison. J, who had wandered desperately, chasing the faint sign of a survivor, found him only after tearing down the collapsed outer wall of a building.\nThe boy, covered in poison, looked at J with great effort, despite his whole body melting. His weak lips moved. His voice was cracked and broken, perhaps due to the poison damaging his vocal cords.\n\"Please save me.\"\nThat sight reminded Cha Eui-jae of his 17-year-old self, who had desperately sought someone's help... He couldn't help but hold the boy's hand.\nEven if, when he woke up again, he found himself in a tragedy where he had lost all his family and couldn't be sure of the antidote. Even if he had to live a life more painful than death. Even if all the resentment fell upon him.\nHe couldn't turn away from that desperation.\nCha Eui-jae looked at the white-haired man. Maybe that boy also became a target of Prometheus because he saved him back then. Nam Woo-jin, with his hands in the pockets of his white coat, was observing Cha Eui-jae.\nSuddenly, Cha Eui-jae realized the discomfort he had been feeling all along. He didn't avoid Nam Woo-jin's burnt eyes and asked.\n\"Why are you telling me this?\"\n\"...\"\nThere must have been a reason why Lee Sa-young didn't tell his background. Just like he had his own secrets, Lee Sa-young must have his.\nTheir deal was possible because they didn't pry into each other's deep secrets. Of course, Lee Sa-young had investigated him, but he didn't pry into why Cha Eui-jae wanted to live quietly.\nSo he didn't want to hear Lee Sa-young's intimate story behind his back. Unless he told it himself.\n\"I don't think I deserve to hear this just because I'm Lee Sa-young's associate.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae showed his discomfort, Nam Woo-jin looked rather pleased.\n\"That's the expected reaction. It would have been more troubling if you didn't react like this.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"Well, think of it as a kind of shackle.\"\n\"What does that mean...\"\nBefore he could question further, he felt a small presence behind him. Turning his eyes in that direction, he saw a boy standing at the edge of the garden. He could tell instantly.\nThat was... not a human. The boy's clear, glass-like eyes reflected Cha Eui-jae. The boy bowed his head in greeting.\n\"The patient's treatment is complete. I came to inform you, master, and guest.\"\n\"Then shall we end the walk? Let me guide you to your companion.\"\nBefore he knew it, the garden was gone, and the surroundings had returned to the library filled with books. Nam Woo-jin gestured for him to follow and walked ahead.\nOne day, when the end comes, the library he had carefully arranged would also collapse and decay. Did he know that?\nThen, cutting through Cha Eui-jae's thoughts, Nam Woo-jin asked a question.\n\"By the way, do you know Hong Ye-seong?\"\n\"Yes, I do.\"\nNot just know; he had sworn to smack that damn guy's head. Cha Eui-jae had never forgotten his grudge against him, the Inheart magic stone parrot. When they reached the central hall, Nam Woo-jin turned around, took out two stiff tickets from his coat pocket, and handed them over. The black tickets, like exhibition admission tickets, had white brushstrokes written in both Hangul and Chinese characters.\n[Yìxīng Artisan Exhibition]\n\"...Artisan Exhibition?\"\n\"They call the auction for Hong Ye-seong's equipment the Artisan Exhibition. It will be held in a few days in Songdo, and only those with tickets can enter.\"\nNam Woo-jin kindly explained to Cha Eui-jae, who had received the tickets absentmindedly.\nIf it was an auction for Hong Ye-seong's equipment, there would be plenty of S-grade equipment. Hunters who were greedy for equipment would desperately want to participate. The tickets must be extremely expensive.\nOf course, Cha Eui-jae only had a craving for kitchen utensils, so it felt like he was handed a rock.\n\"Why are you giving this to me...?\"\n\"A reward for risking your life to save PRO-009.\"\nNam Woo-jin smiled brightly. Cha Eui-jae's head was filled with chaotic thoughts.\n'I can't handle this. This piece of paper is bound to be the root of all evil in the future.'\nWhat should he say about where he got this? Saying it was from Nam Woo-jin would be suspicious, and saying he found it on the street would be even more so. Posting it on Tomato Market would definitely cause a bigger aftermath than the magic stone incident. Fortunately, Cha Eui-jae was starting to anticipate the upcoming events.\n\"No, I'm a D-grade, so I don't need this. And I don't have money, so how can I...\"\n\"Then sell it to other hunters. They must be going crazy trying to get this.\"\nNo, I don't want to throw bait to those crazy hunters. If it was found out that he was the seller of this ticket, the hangover soup restaurant might explode that day.\nBut in the end, the Artisan Exhibition ticket ended up in Cha Eui-jae's hand. Cha Eui-jae felt like crying a little.\nOn the way back, the Seowon Guild had prepared a vehicle. Grandmother and Park Ha-eun sat side by side, and Cha Eui-jae and Lee Sa-young sat together behind them. Park Ha-eun, still energetic, started chatting.\n\"Uncle, it was really fun there. There were so many books, and the people passing by were kind. There were tons of comic books. Some boy even did coloring with me.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah! And...\"\nPark Ha-eun squirmed and turned around, spreading her hand and making a V with the other hand over her palm.\nHe was familiar with that gesture. It was something that the gas mask guy did at the end of the weekend entertainment programs and dramas that Cha Eui-jae watched! Whether she knew his expression had turned sour, Park Ha-eun continued excitedly.\n\"The brother next to you did this for me.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"He did it for me more than twenty times!\"\nCha Eui-jae stares wide-eyed at Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young, who had been looking out the window with his arms crossed, turned his head to Cha Eui-jae. Their eyes met.\n\"You...\"\nDid you really... do that in real-time? And more than twenty times? Cha Eui-jae was at a loss for words. Lee Sa-young, who had been watching him, let out a short laugh. It was clearly a mocking laugh.\n\"Why? Are you so grateful you're losing your mind?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I didn't know I had a talent for taking care of kids. Thanks to someone, I found out.\"\n\"...\"\nBastard... You really did that ridiculous thing for her?\nPark Ha-eun must have been seeing things. Cha Eui-jae poked Lee Sa-young's side with his finger hard. The solid body next to him flinched.\n***\n\"Huff... puff...\"\nAt the base of Jirisan, a young man dressed in colorful hiking gear, a hiking hat, and sunglasses staggered down. He was panting so much that people climbing the mountain glanced at him. Moreover, the men in suits chasing after him made it even more noticeable.\nJung Young-sook, the secretary of the Hanmaum Mountaineering Club, clicked her tongue as she watched the young man being chased down the mountain.\n\"Oh my... shouldn't we report that young man?\"\n\"Seriously. What are those agent-looking guys doing on the mountain?\"\n\"Let's leave it. Maybe they're shooting a movie.\"\n\"Oh my, am I going to be in a movie?\"\nAs the gossip of the mountaineering club members faded away, the young man's feet finally touched flat ground. He collapsed with a loud thud and raised his arms in victory.\n\"Damn it! Finally! Finally, I'm free!\"\nA gust of wind blew off his hat, revealing the young man's face. Tears filled his clear eyes. The man in a suit behind him took out a walkie-talkie and reported.\n\"Yes, Team Leader. Hong Ye-seong-ssi has just finished descending. We'll move to Songdo immediately.\"\n\"Uwaaah!\"\n\"No, it's not the sound of a deer. It's Hong Ye-seong-ssi's cry of joy. Yes, yes. Understood.\"\nThe young man, overjoyed to be standing on flat ground, was Hong Ye-seong. The only existing S-grade artisan. He had just finished a long period of confinement at Banya Peak in Jirisan and returned to civilization.\n\"Yahooo!\"\nTo participate in the auction to be held in Songdo!\nAnd now— it was one week until the Artisan Exhibition.",

      "content": "Chapter 62: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nThe day Hong Ye-seong roared back into the secular world, an anonymous post appeared on the HunterNet's anonymous board. It was a sighting of Hong Ye-seong.\nTitle: [Anonymous] What is this? Has Hong Ye-seong come down the mountain?\nWhy is he here?\nComments (99+)\n—What, already?\n—Did he come down the mountain? No news articles yet.\n—Finally made an escape button...\n—Ah~ Artisan Exhibition is a week away, so it's about time for him to come down, yeah.\n⤷Last time he came down the day before... Hong Ye-seong must have put in a lot of effort...\n⤷For real, lol ㅋㅋㅋ\n—Where are you right now, Anonymous?\n⤷Chicken place.\n⤷?? Lololol ㅋㅋ\n⤷The first place he went after coming down is a chicken place?\n⤷Ah ㅋㅋ, even the 8th ranked can't resist chicken ㅋㅋ\n⤷Please share the story pls\nHong Ye-seong's sudden appearance turned HunterNet upside down in a good way. After all, with the Artisan Exhibition a week away, the hot topic in the hunter community was Hong Ye-seong and the equipment he created. As everyone waited for more detailed accounts, the hunter who had opened the floodgates of sightings thankfully appeared again soon.\nTitle: [Anonymous] The one who posted about Hong Ye-seong coming down\nAfter work, I went to the chicken place, and it was super busy.\nSo, I checked if there was a soccer match today, but there wasn't.\nWhen I asked, they said there's someone doing unlimited chicken refills, lol.\nSo, I sneak a peek to see who it is, and it's Hong Ye-seong, sobbing while holding a chicken wing in each hand and eating them one bite at a time...\nHe's even wearing colorful hiking clothes like children's Lego blocks...\nI left quietly, feeling solemn.\nNot easy.\nJust paid 10,000 won for delivery.\nComments (99+)\n—Lolololol ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n—Crying while < lolololol ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n—Why is a rich guy holding wings instead of drumsticks in both hands?\n—Maybe he wants to fly... holding wings in both hands.\n⤷Is he going to make artificial wings next? To fly.\n⤷Wow, please make them.\n⤷From today, let's only feed Hong Ye-seong wings?\n⤷Ah ㅋㅋ, sending him a thousand wings, wait for it, Hong Ye-seong.\n—Shouldn't Hong Ye-seong give this guy 10,000 won for delivery?\n⤷Ye-seong, you have a lot of money, deposit 10,000 won, please. Nonghyup 30247...\nThe number of hunters increases every year, and equipment becomes increasingly scarce. It was a natural consequence given the rising demand. Even if you risk your life to clear a level 1 rift or dungeon, S-grade equipment was still extremely rare.\nIn this situation, Hong Ye-seong's value, who could steadily supply S-grade equipment even if slowly, had no choice but to skyrocket. Thus, during the Artisan Exhibition season, high-ranking hunters from all over the world flocked to Korea.\n[Artisan Exhibition]\nIn short, it is a biennial auction event held in Songdo for equipment created by master Hong Ye-seong.\nIt's also why the government especially cherishes Hong Ye-seong. His mere existence boosts national power, and every two years, they even host a festival for him! Promoting tourism! Gaining foreign currency!\nOf course, during this period, public hunter officials of the Awakened Management Bureau were exhausted maintaining city security and guarding Hong Ye-seong. With so many Awakened gathered in one place, security was paramount. Therefore, Jung Bin was also biting the edge of a paper cup while receiving reports.\n—Team leader, I've sent the personnel deployment near the convention center by email.\n\"Thank you for your hard work. I'll check and reply. Where is Hong Ye-seong now?\"\n—After eating 11 chickens at the chicken place, he's on his way to a Korean beef specialty restaurant.\n\"...Did a ghost who starved from not eating meat possess him?\"\nAs Jung Bin muttered, a small sigh was heard over the earpiece.\nHong Ye-seong became a meat massacring maniac as soon as he returned to the secular world. Did the various agencies feed Hong Ye-seong only temple food while confining him on Jirisan? No. Did they not feed him meat while confining him? Also no.\nThey provided perfectly balanced meals every time. Yet, holding his throbbing head, Jung Bin kindly replied.\n\"Well... Since the sighting story is up on HunterNet, please pay a little more attention to security.\"\n—Understood.\nDuring the period leading up to the Artisan Exhibition, Songdo was busier than ever. Surrounding hotels were fully booked a month in advance, and broadcasters, journalists, and fans of hunters flocked. Extra attention was needed for the safety of the meat-eating hippo genius.\nJung Bin sighed shortly again while opening emails on his tablet. Every day until the Artisan Exhibition day felt like it would be very long.\n***\nThe ripple effect of the Artisan Exhibition reached even the peaceful hangover soup restaurant. Having easily finished two bowls of hangover soup, Bae Won-woo turned on the TV with the remote while holding a spoon in his mouth. Another hunter asked from behind, seeing him busy changing channels.\n\"What's on TV today?\"\n\"The quiz show. They're re-airing the episode with Hong Ye-seong. I missed the original broadcast.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who was chopping green onions perfectly in the kitchen, hesitated. Another hunter admired.\n\"Wow, did he come down from the mountain?\"\n\"You haven't checked HunterNet? There are already sightings from a chicken place and a Korean beef place.\"\n\"He must've gone crazy eating only wild greens on the mountain. He's going around only eating meat.\"\n\"But if I did a temple stay and came to Seoul, I'd probably eat chicken first too.\"\n\"Right, that makes sense.\"\nEven Cha Eui-jae knew that Hong Ye-seong was on Jirisan. It was hard not to know when snooping on his InHeart. The man was addicted to InHeart, and sometimes on sleepless nights, he would post sunrise pictures from Jirisan, timed perfectly with sunrise. The pictures seemed like they would bring good luck, so Cha Eui-jae, who had considerable resentment towards Hong Ye-seong, quietly saved those pictures.\n'That bastard... he came down the mountain.'\nCha Eui-jae had an obligation to hit that damn guy on the head. He quietly put down the knife and stepped out of the kitchen. Just then, Bae Won-woo, who was diligently changing channels, stopped. The program seemed to have already started, as the national MC was clapping and welcoming someone.\n—Wow~ This time, he came down from Jirisan, and came to see us right away. The only S-grade creator! The pride of Korea, Master Hunter Hong Ye-seong!\n—Haha, hello, hello.\nA clean-looking Hong Ye-seong had a face shining with oil, with plump cheeks. Someone muttered.\n\"He must have eaten really well after coming down.\"\n'Right.'\nAs the MC exchanged greetings and cautiously asked,\n—You are famous for always creating excellent equipment. Have you made any equipment this time?\n—If I say it here, it might lower the excitement... I'll show it on auction day.\n—Ah, can't you give us a small spoiler?\n—Haha, no.\nHong Ye-seong smiled kindly. A hunter who was about to slam the table ended up hitting his own knee instead.\n\"Ha... I really want to go.\"\n\"Even if you want to go... You need a black ticket to enter, right?\"\n\"How much is the ticket now?\"\n\"I don't know, but they say it trades for tens of billions, and there are no listings.\"\n\"When will I ever get to attend the auction?\"\nThe hunters' dejected conversation pricked his ears. Cha Eui-jae subtly looked around the store. It was nearing the end of lunchtime business, so it didn't seem like any more customers would come.\nCha Eui-jae used a skill to hide his presence and quietly went to his small room. Fortunately, everyone's attention was glued to the TV, so he managed to get there without being noticed.\nHe lifted the neatly folded blanket. The black ticket, coveted by all hunters, lay safely asleep between the pink flower-patterned blankets. Not just one, but two. Cha Eui-jae glared at the tickets that retained their stiffness and shine even inside the blanket.\nNam Woo-jin... gave me a disaster.\nNot just any disaster, but a colossal one.\n'I got caught up in that guy's smooth talk and ended up receiving them without realizing...'\nCha Eui-jae covered his forehead and let out a long sigh. As soon as they were alone, Nam Woo-jin had started spouting stories about Lee Sa-young's past and other incomprehensible things, and he got unwittingly swept up in it.\nIn a moment of anger, Cha Eui-jae silently pounded the flower-patterned blanket with his fist. Why did that guy suddenly bring up Lee Sa-young's past to Cha Eui-jae? Making people worried.\nCha Eui-jae looked at the tickets worth tens of billions. They could fetch even higher prices with a premium attached. However, he learned a lot from the magic stone incident.\n'I shouldn't act up.'\nOf course, he might have done a lot here and there, but no more. He promised to live quietly and had already caused too much trouble. It was not too late now; he should really live quietly.\n'Let's earn money honestly by working.'\nWhen you think about it, hunters make a living by selling off materials from dungeons. But Cha Eui-jae decided to live as an ordinary person, not a hunter! Sure, he got a hunter's license, but... he had no intention of using it. So the license was just like an unused driver's license.\nEven if you get a driver's license, if you don't drive, it's just another piece of identification with 12 extra numbers. It's only useful for identification purposes, nothing else.\nHow could an ordinary person, living a quiet and peaceful life, sell dungeon-related items? The recent Tomato Market EZ incident was just a stupid mistake driven by a temporary lapse in judgment over money.\n'Yeah, a caterpillar should just eat pine needles1.'\nAlthough, in terms of size, he was more like a dinosaur, Cha Eui-jae started brainwashing himself into thinking he was a caterpillar. A precious black ticket didn't suit a caterpillar like him. So he had to consider the proper way to handle it. He had three options.\nFirst, go to Songdo and participate in the auction.\nSecond, dispose of the ticket.\nThird, pretend it doesn't exist.\nFirst option: go to Songdo and participate in the auction.\nAs soon as he sets foot near Songdo, he can kiss his quiet life goodbye. From what he's heard from other hunters, Songdo during the Artisan Exhibition is packed with top-tier hunters, including Hong Ye-seong and Jung Bin. They are all hunters who could easily afford to buy black tickets.\n'Am I crazy?'\nOf course, the people gathering at the hangover soup restaurant weren't ordinary either, but this was his home turf, where he had countless ways to handle things. But Songdo was uncharted territory. Cha Eui-jae decided he wouldn't even glance in the direction of Songdo. The first option was out.\nSecond option: dispose of the ticket. This had its own problems. There was no proper way to dispose of it!\nSelling or transferring it was obviously impossible. Unless he wanted to join the hall of fame alongside EZ from Tomato Market and Mr. So-and-so2 from Thunder Market, it was a non-starter. Then he had to destroy it...\nHe had already tried holding the ticket to the burner where he cooked hangover soup, but this cursed ticket, whatever it was made of, wouldn't burn with ordinary fire.\n'Should I just tear it up?'\nWith his strength, he could certainly tear it up. But unless he shredded it into tiny bits and turned it to dust, it was dangerous. Even when discarded, this ticket would likely have to go into non-combustible household waste, and there was no way it would turn to dust.\nUltimately, the last option was the only one left. To convince himself the ticket didn't exist. He could just stash these two pieces of paper somewhere and forget about them. Cha Eui-jae pushed the ticket deeper into the blanket, desperately trying to ignore it.\n'Stay there until the Artisan Exhibition is over.'\nHe was making a futile prayer.\nAs always, Cha Eui-jae's prayers didn't tend to be very effective.\n\"...\"\n\"Have you ever been to Songdo?\"\nWhen a black gas mask appeared late at night, brandishing the black ticket, it was clear.",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nLee Sa-young knocked on the door just as Cha Eui-jae finished washing dishes and cleaning up, and even got ready for tomorrow's business. It was such perfect timing that he wondered if Lee Sa-young had been watching him.\nCha Eui-jae peeked out from the kitchen to check the door and widened his eyes when he saw the black gas mask floating on the glass.\n\"What's going on? All of a sudden.\"\n\"I have something to say.\"\nA whisper-like reply came back. Was he going to ask for a favor again? Cha Eui-jae untied his tightly knotted apron strings and headed toward the door. Lee Sa-young stood quietly in front of the door, waiting to be let in.\nAs soon as Cha Eui-jae slid open the door, the dark figure took a step inside. Without sitting down, Lee Sa-young said,\n\"Have you ever been to Songdo?\"\nThat was it.\nWith a reluctant face, Cha Eui-jae alternated his gaze between the glossy black ticket and the black glove holding it, and the black gas mask. Every time he thought he could welcome this guy with a bit of affection from their accumulated acquaintance, Lee Sa-young would pull out a bomb from his pocket. Besides,\n'Why are these black tickets so common?'\nWeren't these supposed to be rare and extremely coveted tickets worth tens of billions? Regulars at the soup restaurant would go to great lengths to get just one of these pieces of paper, but somehow, three of them had fallen into his lap for no reason.\nCha Eui-jae averted his eyes from the burdensome ticket and changed the subject.\n\"Why did you come so late today?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slightly and answered earnestly.\n\"You'd glare at me if I came during business hours and ruined the business.\"\n'Damn it, why does he put it like that?'\nCha Eui-jae, who was trying to change the subject, glanced at the ceiling.\nActually, Lee Sa-young was right. If this guy had come during dinner hours, there would have been a \"Lee Sa-young ZONE,\" the dinner service would have been a bust, and Cha Eui-jae would have looked at him reluctantly. Just like now.\nLee Sa-young muttered as if he wanted Cha Eui-jae to hear.\n\"They avoid me because they're scared, what can I do?\"\nSomehow, the gas mask holding the black ticket looked dejected. Even though gas masks have no expression!\nNam Woo-jin's words floated like mist in Cha Eui-jae's mind. And the thoughts continued to lead to more thoughts.\nLee Sa-young that kicked people in the alleyway, Lee Sa-young showing his black tongue, Lee Sa-young brazenly showing his face in public service ads, Lee Sa-young as Prometheus's experimental subject, Lee Sa-young carrying blankets and pillows, Lee Sa-young sitting alone in the ruins melted by poison, Lee Sa-young who melted the master of the rift and asked if he was okay, Lee Sa-young murmuring with his face buried in J's shoulder in the fragment shard, and...\nJ saved him, but he was no longer J; the child who could no longer be found was hopelessly tangled amidst the chaos.\nFrom the first meeting until recently, Cha Eui-jae had seen Lee Sa-young as a rude, annoying, weird, and crazy person who disrupted his small and quiet life just by existing. Their first meeting was the worst, and the hangover soup restaurant, which was relatively quiet except for being crowded with customers, started to get chaotic thanks to Lee Sa-young.\nBut as they say, you see more as you know more. Unintentionally getting entangled with Lee Sa-young, Cha Eui-jae learned more than he expected.\n\"Think of it as a kind of shackle.\"\nWas this what he meant by shackle? A shackle of conscience? Did he have nothing else to shackle me with, so he used Lee Sa-young as the means? Cha Eui-jae was deeply realizing the truth of the saying that those with power are even worse lately.\n'I need to re-educate these rankers... They're too greedy...'\nWhether or not Lee Sa-young knew Cha Eui-jae's troubled thoughts, he muttered again, this time louder.\n\"Do you even know how considerate I am to you?\"\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\nCha Eui-jae answered soullessly and quietly stepped back. But Lee Sa-young noticed even that small movement like a ghost. His eyes sparkled behind the gas mask.\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"Huh? To the kitchen.\"\n\"Aren't you going to answer my question?\"\n\"You have plenty of time. Let's talk over a cup of coffee. Do you drink coffee?\"\nDespite his vague words, the sharp atmosphere instantly softened. Lee Sa-young rolled his eyes, as if recalling a very old memory, his gaze lingering in the top left for a long time. After a considerable silence, he murmured.\n\"...I don't know?\"\nWhat kind of ambiguous answer was that? Cha Eui-jae, also becoming serious, folded his arms and gestured.\n\"...Sit down and wait for a moment.\"\nSurprisingly, Lee Sa-young sat down without a word. After confirming that he had taken off his gas mask, Cha Eui-jae stood in the kitchen, lost in thought.\n'Is it okay to give him coffee at this late hour?'\nOf course, caffeine wouldn't affect an S-grade Awakener's body, especially not Lee Sa-young's, but... there's a matter of feelings. Just look at the regular hunter customers who drink soju even though they don't get drunk, insisting on having more than two bottles every time.\nMoreover, recalling what happened at Lee Sa-young's house, it seemed he wasn't a good sleeper. Like most sensitive S-grade Awakeners.\nThere was no choice. He had to show his ultimate recipe that even captured the picky palate of a nine-year-old elementary schooler. Cha Eui-jae took out a black package and acacia honey from the fridge. Holding a spoon resolutely, his back shone with golden light.\n[Trait: Battle Integrated into Life (S) activated.]\nAfter a while, Cha Eui-jae confidently placed a paper cup in front of Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young, who had been leaning his chin on one hand and tapping his phone with the other, hesitated and asked.\n\"What's this?\"\n\"Misugaru1.\"\nNot just any misugaru, but a special misugaru made with honey and fresh white milk he had bought as a snack for Park Ha-eun. And since it was served in a disposable paper cup, there was no worry about dishwashing. Taking care of Lee Sa-young and saving money. Two birds with one stone.\nBut Lee Sa-young, looking at the cup before him, had a suspicious expression.\n\"What about coffee?\"\n\"You don't sleep well, do you?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young stared at Cha Eui-jae with a strange look. Cha Eui-jae clicked his tongue.\n\"How can you drink coffee when you don't even sleep well, drink misugaru instead.\"\nPutting down his phone and holding the paper cup, Lee Sa-young murmured.\n\"Seems like you don't sleep well either.\"\n\"That's why I drink water.\"\n\"...\"\nWithout another word, Lee Sa-young obediently took off his gas mask and placed it on the table. Then, after inspecting the liquid in the cup again, he began to sip the misugaru.\nCha Eui-jae sat across from him, sipping water while observing his face. Lee Sa-young licked his lips with his black tongue and blinked. His long eyelashes fluttered with the movement.\n\"Anyway. Have you been to Songdo?\"\nRecalling the ticket he had stashed away in his blanket, Cha Eui-jae shook his head.\n\"No.\"\nHe had traveled all over the country as J, but surprisingly had never been to Songdo. And he had no intention of going in the future. After putting down the empty paper cup, Lee Sa-young propped his chin on his hand.\n\"That's perfect. You should go this time.\"\n\"Songdo? Why?\"\n\"It's going to be noisy everywhere these days.\"\nHe gestured towards the wall plastered with autographed pictures and posters. It would be strange to say he hadn't heard about it. Intentionally indifferent, Cha Eui-jae replied.\n\"The Artisan Exhibition or whatever?\"\n\"Yeah, that.\"\n\"Why would I go there?\"\n\"For a date.\"\n\"Is the misugaru spoiled or something, you piece of shit...\"\nRegardless of Cha Eui-jae's crumpled expression, Lee Sa-young continued shamelessly.\n\"It's a date proposal worth tens of billions.\"\nHe gestured towards the ticket neatly placed on the table. But for Cha Eui-jae, who had about a hundred billion won worth of tickets stashed away in his blanket, it didn't feel like a grand date proposal.\nThere was no reason to go, and plenty of reasons not to. Cha Eui-jae sighed deeply and brought out the biggest and sturdiest shield.\n\"I don't have time to go to Songdo. I have to run the business.\"\n\"Just say you're taking your granny to the hospital and close for a day. You only need to go to the Artisan Exhibition anyway.\"\nLee Sa-young had an immediate answer without any hesitation, as if he had expected this conversation and prepared questions and answers in advance! Lee Sa-young smiled leisurely.\n\"Just say the granny is sick, what are they going to do about it?\"\n\"Using grandma as an excuse...\"\n\"If you're really worried, I'll have Choi Go-yo take her to the hospital. What's next?\"\nFortunately, Choi Go-yo seemed to have woken up well. Given that a lot of time had passed since the Incheon Port incident, it was understandable. Cha Eui-jae brought out the second shield.\n\"How can a D-grade hunter go to the Artisan Exhibition? What if they ask where I got the ticket?\"\n\"That's also fine.\"\nLee Sa-young rifled through his inventory and then placed a new-looking gas mask next to the ticket. On the old, shabby green table, there were now two gas masks and several billion won worth of tickets lined up neatly.\n'Is this what cognitive dissonance2 feels like?'\nCha Eui-jae was confused, just as he had been on the day he first saw Lee Sa-young's public service advertisement on TV. The very person causing all this turmoil, Lee Sa-young, casually continued.\n\"You can wear this and introduce yourself as a secretary team member from Pado Guild.\"\n\"...You want me to wear this?\"\n\"It's mandatory for the secretaries to go out on fieldwork with me, so it's not that unusual. People will just think it's normal.\"\nBut wouldn't two gas masks walking around together be extremely noticeable? Even Cha Eui-jae would turn to look if he saw two people in gas masks walking down the street.\nBy this point, Cha Eui-jae was debating whether to kick Lee Sa-young out with a curse or to reject him more tactfully. As he pondered, Lee Sa-young, who had been resting his chin in his hands and staring at him, spoke up.\n\"Hey, Hyung.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Can I ask you one thing?\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"When you went to the Seowon Guild.\"\nLee Sa-young asked with a soft smile.\n\"What did that bastard Nam Woo-jin say?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why are you being so nice to me today?\"\n◄\n☰\n►\nMisu is a beverage made from the traditional Korean grain powder misu-garu, which is a combination of 7–10 different grains.

      "content": "Chapter 64: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\n\"Why are you being so nice to me today?\"\nCha Eui-jae lifted his head and met those violet eyes. Despite the slight curve of his lips, there was a cool aura about him.\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\n'Crazy guy. He's incredibly perceptive.'\nFortunately, the Poker Face trait had automatically activated. Cha Eui-jae, under his expressionless face, recalled his suspicions about Nam Woo-jin. Did he know everything and bring this up intentionally? Did Nam Woo-jin hint something to Lee Sa-young? After all, they were in a cooperative relationship.\nHowever, he soon dismissed his suspicion. Back then, Nam Woo-jin was... purely observing Cha Eui-jae as he listened to Lee Sa-young's past.\nThe sudden appearance of Lee Sa-young's associate should be suspicious, yet there are no questions about his identity or doubts about him— no curiosity about this mysterious figure who appeared out of nowhere with such skill. The white gaze that seemed to penetrate through Cha Eui-jae's very existence was like...\n'As if he was confirming my value...'\nCha Eui-jae swallowed silently. Though it was supposed to be a reward for the drug incident, giving away two black tickets might have been proof that he had passed Nam Woo-jin's test or criteria.\nNam Woo-jin seemed like someone thirsty for new knowledge and truth. So, he would have analyzed the newly emerged Cha Eui-jae. But with just a brief observation, the information he gathered would not be perfect enough to be called 'knowledge.'\nBeing inherently a scholar, he wouldn't place an unfinished book in his library. If this assumption were correct, Nam Woo-jin wouldn't have mentioned their private conversation to Lee Sa-young.\nTherefore, Lee Sa-young just had an uncanny knack for noticing things.\nSo in the end, it was just a reaction to seeing his changed attitude, but he wondered if it was something to be so cautious about, just because he had acted a bit soft due to some nagging feeling. Before he knew it, the slightly narrowed eyes seemed to be asking, 'Since when did you start giving things like this to me?'\nIsn't it too ironic for someone who claims not to trust people to be so untrusting themselves? Cha Eui-jae was dumbfounded but decided to play innocent for now.\n\"What's with 'being nice'? What did I even do?\"\n\"This.\"\nLee Sa-young nudged a paper cup with his gloved hand.\n'This?'\nCha Eui-jae alternated between looking at the paper cup and Lee Sa-young, frowning. If giving him a simple misugaru meant he was being nice, then how low was Lee Sa-young's threshold for kindness? Cha Eui-jae was about to retort but then noticed Lee Sa-young's face. Suspicion was smeared all over his delicate features.\nIsn't this guy just... a kid? Though less moody than Park Ha-eun.\n\"In such a short time, the only thing that could've changed your attitude...\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slightly, muttering.\n\"...is meeting Nam Woo-jin.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That guy does talk a lot...\"\nThat was true. Even though they'd only exchanged a few words, the way Nam Woo-jin didn't give the other person a chance to speak and just barreled through with his own words was quite something. Lee Sa-young continued, rubbing the top of the paper cup.\n\"You're not someone who listens well to others... so it's even more suspicious.\"\n'Why is he attacking me with words all of a sudden?'\n\"And what business does that guy have meddling in our relationship?\"\nWhat relationship do we have? Isn't it a contractual one? Cha Eui-jae was about to retort but shut his mouth. Lee Sa-young's demeanor while saying that was fiercer than he expected.\nIn the meantime, Lee Sa-young closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them.\n\"Well... I think I've laid out my theory.\"\nThe way Lee Sa-young nodded his head slightly, as if urging for an answer, made Cha Eui-jae quickly think.\nIt would be better to keep what Nam Woo-jin said about Lee Sa-young's past a secret for now. Though it was like talking behind Lee Sa-young's back, it would also be strange to discuss Nam Woo-jin in his absence.\nCha Eui-jae thought about making an excuse but gave up. He ruffled his hair and responded honestly.\n\"Is it such a problem even when I'm being nice? It's funny you think making misugaru for you is being nice.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Alright. I'm doing it because I'm grateful. Why?\"\nLee Sa-young's face showed a look of disbelief.\n\"Grateful? For what?\"\n\"You took my grandma to the hospital.\"\n\"That was part of the contract conditions and something I proposed first.\"\n\"And... you looked after Ha-eun.\"\n\"...\"\nThough he still couldn't believe that Lee Sa-young had done that public service gesture, he had indeed stayed with Park Ha-eun to ensure she didn't get lost in the library. Cha Eui-jae mumbled on.\n\"And when I was swept up in that rift... you came to help me, even though that was part of the contract too.\"\nThinking about it, when J was active, no one had ever come to help him. He was the one who went to help others. Because he was J. He had to face everything with his own strength. That was natural.\n\"...\"\nA brief silence fell, but Cha Eui-jae was too preoccupied to notice it. Saying it out loud made him realize there were quite a few incidents involving Lee Sa-young, and he'd received a fair amount of help from him. Once he started talking, Lee Sa-young's good deeds poured out like a broken dam.\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his lips, glancing around to avoid Lee Sa-young's eyes. He happened to catch sight of the self-serve kimchi and side dish bar, with the magic stone shining brightly in the middle.\n\"The magic stone support was provided by Guild Leader Lee Sa-young of the Pado Guild.\"\nDamn it, that was also Lee Sa-young? Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and quickly added.\n\"Well... if it weren't for you... the store would have caught fire, or I might have ended up on the wanted list for ambulance theft... who knows.\"\n\"Were you really planning to steal the ambulance?\"\n\"...\"\nA short laugh burst out. Lee Sa-young was covering his mouth, laughing.\n\"I wondered why you asked about the license.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You're truly a madman.\"\nShut up, you don't know anything. The store almost burned down.\nCha Eui-jae's face twisted into a frown at being recognized as a madman by another madman, but Lee Sa-young's face showed a gradual release of suspicion. In fact, he seemed quite pleased. He coaxed gently.\n\"And?\"\n\"And what? That's all.\"\n\"Is there nothing more you're grateful for?\"\n\"What more could there be? I've said everything now.\"\nMaybe he should've just repeated what Nam Woo-jin said. Trying to protect his loyalty to someone with nothing to offer, he ended up revealing deep, private matters. The sharp atmosphere from Lee Sa-young's interrogation had melted away, replaced by a warmer mood. His intense demeanor had softened noticeably.\nCha Eui-jae covered his eyes with one hand, overcome with embarrassment.\n\"Well... you don't trust people, but your guard is quite low.\"\nThough his tone was sarcastic, there was no mockery. Lee Sa-young tapped the table with his fingertips.\n\"If you're that grateful, accept my date proposal.\"\nFuck, we're back to square one. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and replied.\n\"No.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"I just really don't want to go.\"\nThough he had fallen from the top spot, he was still the second-ranked in the country. Lee Sa-young was bound to attract everyone's attention. The secretary accompanying him would also draw glances, especially with the gas mask on.\n\"You told me to live quietly. Let me just sell hangover soup here.\"\n\"You can go quietly, I promise.\"\nCha Eui-jae had no intention of stepping out of his cozy and slightly noisy hangover soup restaurant to wade into the battlefield. He had already caused too many problems and planned to lay low. But Lee Sa-young seemed determined not to let him off the hook.\n\"Why do you want to take me in the first place?\"\n\"For a date.\"\n\"Cut the crap about dates. Tell me straight.\"\n\"Hmm, because I'd be lonely going alone?\"\nLee Sa-young sometimes threw out the most nonsensical things with a straight face. Still gritting his teeth, Cha Eui-jae answered.\n\"Isn't Bae Won-woo going? Your Vice-Guild Leader?\"\n\"Well... yes, he is.\"\n\"Then you can go with him.\"\n\"You rarely say my name but easily call him by his full name.\"\n\"Hah... Lee Sa-young, you're really difficult.\"\n\"I hear that a lot.\"\nSatisfied after hearing his name, Lee Sa-young hummed and continued.\n\"Bae Won-woo will be with other guild members...\"\n\"Join them.\"\n\"I can't do that. It's uncomfortable for them to be with their boss.\"\nLee Sa-young spoke in a lecturing tone. Since when did you care so much about your subordinates? Cha Eui-jae sighed deeply. Lee Sa-young, who had propped his chin on his hands again, blinked slowly.\n\"If I tell you this, you'll have one more thing to be grateful for.\"\nHis voice, mixed with a hint of laughter, seemed to enjoy making Cha Eui-jae uneasy.\n\"Remember the thugs you rounded up?\"\nThugs... he must be talking about the ones he captured at Incheon Port. Still covering his eyes, Cha Eui-jae gave a small nod.\n\"You were quite reckless back then, diving in first and ignoring my texts.\"\nHis grudge over one unread text was incredibly long.\n\"Before putting them in the transport vehicle, I messed with them a bit... and they remember you in quite a lot of detail.\"\n'Shit.'\nDamn it, he hadn't considered that! Cha Eui-jae pressed his palm against his forehead and squeezed his eyes shut. He had used memory-erasing techniques on the Romantic Opener, but he had only inflicted physical damage on the thugs, forgetting to threaten them with memory erasure.\nUntil recently, Cha Eui-jae had been wearing a mask every day, relying on it to conceal his identity while recklessly diving into situations. He couldn't seem to break this habit of believing that his face was covered. His hand pressed harder against his eyes. Lee Sa-young spoke leisurely.\n\"I contacted the Awakened Management Bureau and even arranged for the transport vehicle... if I had sent them off as they were, it would've been a disaster.\"\nThe Awakened Management Bureau. Cha Eui-jae started to reflect on all the things he had overlooked in his frenzy.\nJung Bin thinks Cha Eui-jae is a D-grade Awakened. But a D-grade Awakened took on a gang of 20 thugs by himself and pulverized them? Even a B-grade Awakened? Once that fact is known, he'll surely be hauled into the Bureau for a one-on-one session with Jung Bin. Cold sweat trickled down his back.\n\"Luckily, they're still in our guild's basement. I don't know when they'll be handed over to the Bureau, though.\"\n\"...If they talk about me, won't you also be in trouble?\"\n\"Well, maybe. But it's not as big a hit as it would be for you. I have ways to slip out.\"\nLee Sa-young was taking an awfully long-winded route to say one thing.\nDo you want to die with me, or go to Songdo?\n\"I wasn't going to force you to come if you said no...\"\n\"...\"\n\"But seeing you so grateful for the little things...\"\nA cold leather touch reached his palm, gently prying his hand away from his eyes. Their gazes met up close. The chilly demeanor from before had vanished, replaced by a soft smile on his pretty face.\n\"It makes me want to do more for you, in many ways.\"\n'No need, you bastard...'\nCha Eui-jae learned a new lesson at the age of 28; being honest isn't always good.\n***\nThe next day, 5:30 AM. Before opening the restaurant, Cha Eui-jae stepped outside with a broom to clear the spots where barnacles might cling. Not long after, a stranger in a thick coat approached, lugging a large box and a smaller one.\nGoosebumps...\n'Just like the floral wreath was delivered.'\nCha Eui-jae's ominous premonition was, once again, spot on. The delivery man, after glancing around, spotted the hangover soup sign on the sliding door and let out an \"Ah.\"\n\"Do you work here?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You've got a delivery.\"\nA package this early in the morning? Cha Eui-jae's expression stiffened, remembering his unpleasant experiences with packages and registered mail. Unfazed, the delivery man handed him the boxes and quickly walked away.\nCha Eui-jae set the broom down and squatted by the door to check the delivery label. It was a high-end brand's men's suit and shoes.\nThe sender was... Lee Sa-young.\nCha Eui-jae realized he had crossed a point of no return.\n\"Shit...\"\nA delicate curse dissipated into the dawn air.\nCha Eui-jae, path to becoming a gentleman confirmed.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nAfter the trip to Songdo was decided due to Cha Eui-jae's karma and Lee Sa-young's threat, time flew by mercilessly, and it was dawn on the day of the craftsman's exhibition.\nCha Eui-jae stood in front of the hangover soup restaurant, wearing the navy suit and shoes sent by Lee Sa-young. An A4 paper stuck to the door fluttered forlornly in the dawn wind.\n[Closed on the day of the Artisan exhibition.]\n[Reason: Taking my grandmother to the hospital.]\n⤷Hope your grandmother gets well!!\nThe suit sent by Lee Sa-young fit perfectly, neither too loose nor too tight. How on earth did the replacement clothes get the size so right? Cha Eui-jae fiddled with his jacket sleeves for no reason.\nA dark figure soon appeared from beyond the alley. It was Lee Sa-young, as usual. Lee Sa-young, who walked slowly to the hangover soup restaurant, crossed her arms and scanned Cha Eui-jae up and down. He seemed dissatisfied with something, so Cha Eui-jae glared back.\n\"What?\"\n\"Your tie...\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"You tied it well?\"\nThough the comment was out of the blue, Eui-jae felt secretly proud and shrugged his shoulders. Watching and following along on YouTube paid off. However, Lee Sa-young reached out and disrupted his tie with his fingers.\n\"I thought you wouldn't know how to tie it.\"\n\"Are you picking a fight?\"\n\"If you couldn't tie it, I was going to do it for you.\"\n\"What nonsense are you spewing at dawn?\"\nCha Eui-jae clicked his tongue. Lee Sa-young, without responding, fiddled with the tie for a long while before pulling out an employee ID card and a gas mask from his inventory. The ID card had a photo of an ordinary-looking man and a name written on it.\n'Pado Guild Secretary Team Kim Seung-bin.'\nAs Cha Eui-jae hung the ID card around his neck, he asked.\n\"Is this a real person?\"\n\"Yes. Put this on for now.\"\nAfter putting on the gas mask, black gloves approached to straighten his appearance. To others, it would look bizarre— a gas mask helping another gas mask in front of an old hangover soup restaurant. Thankfully, it was early in the morning, and there were no passersby.\nLee Sa-young mumbled.\n\"Just in case... When you speak, keep your voice as low as possible. Only let me hear it.\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded in response. Black fingers tapped the filter part of the gas mask.\n\"And you know hunters have good ears.\"\n\"... \"\n\"You're part of the Pado Guild Secretary Team now.\"\nThere was a slight hint of laughter in the low voice. Cha Eui-jae, guessing what the next words would be, made a reluctant expression. Lee Sa-young, noticing even through the gas mask, smiled and asked.\n\"You can speak formally, right?\"\nCha Eui-jae closed his eyes tightly. This guy... Did he ask to come along on purpose? Of course, Lee Sa-young's opinion was valid. If the secretary team member casually talked down to the boss, it would obviously stand out.\nCha Eui-jae decided to let it go. Thinking it was an opportunity to showcase his acting skills made him feel a bit more at ease.\n\"... How should I address you? Guild leader?\"\n\"Guild Leader Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"That's too long.\"\n\"There will be many guild leaders attending... What if others get confused?\"\n\"Fine. I'll just call you Guild Leader.\"\nIgnoring the unreasonable complaint, Lee Sa-young shrugged and took out the emergency escape paper from his inventory.\n\"Whatever. Hold my arm.\"\n\"Do you have a lot of those? You seem to use them every time.\"\n\"Driving to Songdo is too troublesome.\"\nWhat kind of bourgeois statement is this? Just as Cha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young's arm and was about to launch into a lecture about the reckless spending habits of rankers, Lee Sa-young tore the emergency escape paper without hesitation.\nOpening his eyes again, they were in front of a huge building he had never seen before. It was probably the Songdo Convention Center where the Artisan Exhibition would be held.\nStreetlamps lined up neatly along the well-maintained road, each adorned with banners of the same design as the ticket, and a huge banner with Hong Ye-seong giving a thumbs up was hung on the exterior wall of the center.\n[The Artisan returns after 2 years!]\n[Master Hong Ye-seong's Artisan Exhibition]\nSince it was early morning, there weren't many people around. Near the entrance, a few broadcasters and fans, wrapped in thick padding and blankets, were crouched down, but the hunters seemed to have not arrived yet. It was a relief for Cha Eui-jae.\nAt the wide entrance of the center, four hunters with tired faces stood. They looked surprised to see two people in gas masks striding towards the entrance.\n\"Huh? No, at this early hour...\"\n\"Two.\"\nWithout hesitation, Lee Sa-young handed over two black tickets. The flustered hunter scanned the tickets with a small device. Blue light rose on the black surface, forming letters.\n[Yìxīng]\n\"Yes, your tickets are confirmed. Guild Leader Lee Sa-young and the person next to you is...\"\n\"Secretary.\"\nThe hunter's gaze fell on the ID card around Cha Eui-jae's neck. The hunter seemed to want to check the face inside the gas mask but quickly bowed his head under Lee Sa-young's cold stare.\n\"Yes, you two may enter.\"\nThe Lee Sa-young free pass was powerful. Entering the center without having to remove the gas mask for verification— this was the taste of power. Cha Eui-jae looked around the inside of the center and nudged Lee Sa-young's back when he spotted a bathroom sign in the corner.\n\"Guild Leader, I need to go to the bathroom for a moment.\"\nLee Sa-young, who was walking ahead, turned abruptly to look at Cha Eui-jae. Dissatisfaction was written all over his face.\n\"... You're going to leave me alone as soon as we arrive?\"\n\"I need some mental preparation to speak formally all day.\"\n\"Ah-ha...\"\nLee Sa-young, arms crossed, began to mock.\n\"Kim Seung-bin doesn't seem like the type to be thorough in preparation.\"\n\"If I don't mentally prepare, I might end up cursing midway. Is that okay with you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nSilence sparked between the two gas masks. Well, what could he do if he said he needed to go to the bathroom?\nEventually, Lee Sa-young reluctantly flicked his hand, indicating permission. Cha Eui-jae backed away from Lee Sa-young's side and quickly walked towards the bathroom he had seen earlier. The watching eyes followed, but it was tolerable. At least he wasn't being followed!\nFortunately, the bathroom was also devoid of people. Cha Eui-jae entered the innermost stall, locked the door, and sat on the toilet lid, sighing silently.\nFrom the day he received the suit until today, cramming famous hunters' information with the help of Nexby and staying hyper-focused had already drained him. Additionally, the limited vision from the gas mask made him more sensitive.\n'How does Lee Sa-young live with this thing on all the time?'\nThe mask he used as J was a precious item that even altered his voice. Wearing this suffocating gas mask made him miss his mask. He couldn't use it anymore as it was broken just before being ejected from the West Sea rift.\nCha Eui-jae discreetly checked his inventory. He had potions given as gifts by regulars at the hangover soup restaurant, the Basilisk's Fang taking up a generous spot, the root of all evil— the magic stone, and two black tickets.\nBesides the potions, the items in his inventory could turn the convention center upside down just by their presence. He felt like a homeroom teacher assigned to a class of problem children. Cha Eui-jae could partially understand the feelings of a teacher, despite never having been one.\nThe most problematic items were the magic stone and the black tickets. The magic stone was one thing, but he wanted to hide the tickets under his pillow out of sheer anxiety.\n'This is so nerve-wracking...'\nHe couldn't just leave tickets worth a hundred billion combined under his pillow while out. He could manage while working at the hangover soup restaurant since the area was always within his sight. But being far from the shop in Songdo, he wouldn't know if a thief broke in.\n'It's safer to keep them in my hands.'\nAfter the incident where the shop almost caught fire and the reckless fights with other awakened ones, Cha Eui-jae realized he couldn't just rely on his strength alone. Life never went as planned.\nNow that he was away from Lee Sa-young, he had to finish his task quickly. Cha Eui-jae turned on the Hunter Channel he hadn't looked at since being forcefully admitted. In a minefield like Songdo, information was crucial.\nHunter Channel 1 would provide the best information. Who came to the exhibition, what they were after, and where they currently were. Though Lee Sa-young was with him, Cha Eui-jae had to avoid dangers proactively.\nCha Eui-jae began scrolling up to read the chat messages from around midnight today. As expected, the chat started with the person who was addicted to InHeart and chatting.\n[8] I Am An Artisan: The day of the Artisan Exhibition has dawned ^^\n[8] I Am An Artisan: Is everyone in Channel 1 coming?\n[6] Honeybee: Ye-seong\n[6] Honeybee: Did you make the rapier?\n[8] I Am An Artisan: I'm a native Korean, so I don't deal with Western weapons.\n[6] Honeybee: You ****\n[6] Honeybee: Wait for me in Songdo with your neck ready\n[11] Shield Guy: Oh lol ㅋㅋㅋ Honeybee, did you get the ticket?\n[6] Honeybee: Yep\n[6] Honeybee: Matthew got it for me\n[8] I Am An Artisan: If it weren't for Matthew\n[8] I Am An Artisan: You'd probably be stealing tickets in Songdo\n[6] Honeybee: You're really dead meat\n[11] Shield Guy: The child just doesn't have any sense\n[11] Shield Guy: Please just forgive him this one time;;\n[6] Honeybee: ——\n[6] Honeybee: In HB Guild, Matthew and I are going\n[6] Honeybee: Shield Guy, are you coming too?\n[11] Shield Guy: Yep\n[6] Honeybee: Is Lee Sa-young coming?\n[11] Shield Guy: He said he was, but...\n[11] Shield Guy: He's moving separately, so I don't know;;\n[6] Honeybee: How many of you are there that you move separately?\n[11] Shield Guy: I don't know, but at least I got the company card –v\n[4] Jung Bin: Good morning, Channel 1 folks ^^ It's been two years since the last Artisan Exhibition! ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: Let me just remind you of what you must keep in mind when attending the exhibition! ^^\n[8] I Am An Artisan: Here we go...\n[4] Jung Bin: Please don't cause any trouble ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: Don't easily fall for provocations ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: I strongly recommend you avoid talking to others altogether ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: Always maintain a safe distance to avoid bumping into other hunters ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: Be mindful not to cause a situation where the building gets damaged from a simple shoulder bump ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: If you can't avoid a fight, handle it discreetly where reporters can't see, then contact the relevant authorities on site ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: Do not threaten the reporters ^^\n[4] Jung Bin: With that, I hope for your full cooperation for a successful Artisan Exhibition and wish you all a great day without having to meet me 1:1 ^^\n[50] Romantic Opener: That's more than just a few words...\n[34] A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi: But if you read it, it's basically just one sentence.\n[50] Romantic Opener: Not that I care...\nReading Jung Bin's lengthy message made him feel quite solemn. With so many proud, short-tempered, and sensitive hunters gathering in one place, accidents were bound to happen...\nAs Cha Eui-jae sighed deeply, he suddenly heard light footsteps rapidly approaching the restroom. He closed the chat he hadn't finished reading and quickly hid his presence.\nFollowing the first footsteps, more people seemed to be rushing in, but luckily, they stopped just outside the restroom.\nCreak, bang! The uninvited guest settled in the stall right next to mine. From the rustling sounds, it seemed like they weren't here to do their business but to do something else alone.\n\"Damn it, why isn't this working?\"\nThe grumbling voice was familiar. It was a voice he couldn't pretend not to recognize. With a stunned feeling, Cha Eui-jae stared at the wall separating them.\nBecause the voice coming from the next stall was...\n'No way.'\nThe same voice that repeatedly aired on the re-runs of \"We Quiz\"...\n'It's Hong Ye-seong.'\nIt was Hong Ye-seong's voice.",

      "content": "Chapter 66: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nCollecting information in the bathroom turned into a situation where Hong Ye-seong himself entered the stall next to Cha Eui-jae and started rustling around. The numerous footsteps and people waiting outside the bathroom must be his security detail.\nCha Eui-jae sighed silently. Despite his enemy being right next to him, he couldn't make a move.\n'I just want to punch him once.'\nAlthough it was nice that Hong Ye-seong had come to him, the entourage he brought along was not. Even if Cha Eui-jae ignored Hong Ye-seong and left as if nothing had happened, there was only one exit from the bathroom, so he would inevitably run into the security guards outside. Worse, they might even check tickets and IDs.\nUltimately, he had to wait until Hong Ye-seong left on his own. Feeling troubled, Cha Eui-jae automatically assumed the pose of Rodin's Thinker.\n'If you come to the bathroom, just do your business quickly and leave...'\nThough he was also doing other things instead of using the bathroom, he glared at the stall wall towards Hong Ye-seong. If this dragged on, he'd be worried about Lee Sa-young... No, he shook his head.\n'Worried? No way.'\nCha Eui-jae corrected his thoughts. Anyway, if he was late, he'd cause a scene. In the worst case, he might come to the bathroom himself. Considering his previous behavior, it was a plausible scenario.\nLee Sa-young had a tendency to do strange and incomprehensible things sometimes. He had urged him to live quietly, yet he had dragged him to Songdo. This wasn't a date; he just wanted him to act as his lackey...\n\"Argh! Damn it!\"\n\"Hong Ye-seong-ssi, are you okay?\"\n\"Argh!\"\n\"...He seems to be having trouble with his work. Keep waiting.\"\nCha Eui-jae's thoughts about Lee Sa-young were interrupted by Hong Ye-seong's desperate scream. Cha Eui-jae stared at the wall as if trying to bore a hole through it.\n'Damn, do people make sounds like that?'\nHong Ye-seong alternated between rustling around and occasionally crying out like a deer. Fortunately, the guards seemed used to this and didn't storm in. Listening to his cries, Cha Eui-jae resumed his thoughts.\nHong Ye-seong and his equipment are the stars of this Artisan Exhibition. But why is the star cooped up in a bathroom like someone with nowhere to go? Surely, he has a dedicated waiting room.\n\"Argh!\"\nHe should have known from the moment Hong Ye-seong posted the egg photo on InHeart while searching for the magic stone. Hong Ye-seong is not sane. Feeling anxious, Cha Eui-jae decided.\n'If I can't avoid it, I might as well gather some information.'\nHe would love to knock out Hong Ye-seong and escape, but there was no clear escape route, and he would surely be caught quickly.\nCha Eui-jae chose the next best option. He leaned toward the next stall, straining to hear. Hong Ye-seong continued to rustle around and occasionally cry out. Strangely, it was easier to hear the hunters outside the bathroom.\n\"...But why did he go into the bathroom? He could test in the waiting room.\"\n\"He said the waiting room doesn't feel confined enough. He needs a smaller space.\"\n\"If that's the case, why not make a portable chest...\"\n\"You're misusing the chest. It's for storing grain, not people.\"\n\"And he said something might explode if mishandled.\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. What? Still hearing the rustling sound of buttons being pressed in the next stall, he realized those noises were of someone handling explosives. As he pondered this, one of the hunters outside spoke in a low voice.\n\"Shouldn't we be more cautious? If something explodes here, it's serious.\"\nYes, hurry up and stop him. Drag him out. Are you going to let the building explode? Cha Eui-jae silently agreed, but the response was cold.\n\"As long as he's not attempting to evade the security detail or doing anything that endangers his own safety, we've been instructed to let him do as he pleases.\"\n\"Isn't what he's doing a threat to safety?\"\n\"He's an S-grade, so he'd survive even if something exploded...\"\n\"Besides, he wouldn't listen even if we tried to stop him.\"\n\"Even if the bathroom explodes?\"\n\"He's a rich creator. He can easily fix a bathroom.\"\nApparently, this wasn't the first time something like this had happened. The hunters outside remained nonchalant. The problem with hunters is that they trust only their power and have no sense of safety. They need a major accident to wake up.\nCha Eui-jae focused on the sounds from the next stall. After fiddling with something for a while, Hong Ye-seong exclaimed in satisfaction. A clear click was heard.\n\"It's done!\"\nAnd at that moment,\nBeep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep—\nA shrill alarm rang out, piercing his ears!\nNot only did the alarm blare, but a red light started flashing through the stall wall. The hunters waiting outside the bathroom quickly moved in.\n'Is it really going to explode?'\nCha Eui-jae moved to the other side of his stall, wondering if he should escape immediately. While he wouldn't be harmed, his expensive suit might get ruined, and he couldn't afford to replace it.\nBut the creator of this chaos, Hong Ye-seong, seemed unfazed.\n\"Oh, it's so loud. What's going on? Is it a malfunction?\"\n\"Hong Ye-seong-ssi, are you okay?\"\nThe once quiet bathroom was now filled with alarms and the movement of hunters. The red light continued to flash, and Hong Ye-seong called out loudly.\n\"Oh, it's fine! I must've touched something wrong. It's no big deal.\"\n\"For safety verification, please step outside.\"\n\"Just a moment.\"\nHong Ye-seong unlocked and opened his stall door, presumably taking the device with him, making the entire bathroom flash red. Cha Eui-jae sighed silently, watching the flashing lights. Hong Ye-seong continued.\n\"Oh, really, it's nothing! It's a detector for unregistered tickets to prevent theft, but it suddenly went off.\"\n\"Can't it be turned off?\"\n\"No. It won't stop... Maybe if I remove the magic stone?\"\nOnce Hong Ye-seong's safety was confirmed, the tense hunters seemed to relax a bit. One of them joked.\n\"Maybe someone here has an unregistered ticket?\"\n\"Oh, come on, everyone should have a ticket with blue text by now.\"\n'...Wait.'\nCha Eui-jae suddenly realized. Blue text? He remembered the scene at the convention center entrance.\nA small device scanning the tickets, with blue light forming letters on the black surface\n[Yìxīng]\nIf that device did more than confirm authentic tickets, if it also registered them, then... Cha Eui-jae's neck felt cold. He opened his inventory in a hurry.\nHong Ye-seong's devices were probably created using his Awakening Skill, following the system's rules. The inventory also followed the system's rules. The unpleasant premonition was spot on.\nThe tickets they used to enter were both held by Lee Sa-young, meaning his ticket was still in its original state, unregistered. Therefore,\n'Is the sensor really that sensitive?'\nThe device must be detecting the unregistered black tickets in his inventory, causing all this commotion. This mad level of craftsmanship was something Cha Eui-jae didn't need confirmation of.\n'He should make more equipment instead of this stuff.'\nAs Cha Eui-jae stared daggers at Hong Ye-seong, he overheard a low voice from outside.\n\"...Wait.\"\nOne hunter spoke in a hushed tone.\n\"...I think there's someone in the stall next to Hong Ye-seong's. The door's closed.\"\n\"Huh? I don't sense anyone.\"\n\"Could it be a cleaning supply closet?\"\n\"Do people lock cleaning supply closets from the inside?\"\nCha Eui-jae faced a dilemma. Should he trust his 'Soundless Steps' skill and stay put, or pretend to be an innocent bystander? Hearing a hunter approach the door, he decided to act confused and nervous, like a goat.\n\"Ah, there's someone in here...\"\nThe hunter's demeanor sharpened. He spoke firmly.\n\"...Please step outside.\"\nCha Eui-jae recalled the zombies he saw at the hangover soup restaurant. Their disheveled appearance from facing the world's hardships. He loosened his tie, unbuttoned his shirt slightly, and unfastened his jacket to look disheveled. Making sure his ID badge was visible, he unlocked the door and staggered out, like a man desperately clinging to a hangover.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nAmidst the blaring alarm and flashing red lights, a disheveled man in a suit emerged from the far stall, his legs and arms trembling. The hunters' expressions turned puzzled at the sight of this mismatched human.\nCha Eui-jae clutched the bathroom door handle and whispered shakily.\n\"I'm sorry. I was just so nervous.\"\n\"Which organization are you from...?\"\n\"Pa-Pado Guild... Secretary Team...\"\n\"Pado Guild?\"\n\"Yes, I came to assist Guild Leader Lee Sa-young... but I got too nervous.\"\nCha Eui-jae feigned dry heaving into his gas mask's filter.\nLee Sa-young of the Pado Guild. If he was here alone to assist his... It made sense to be nervous. The hunters' gazes softened with pity. The Pado Guild ID hanging around his neck looked pitiful.\nAt that moment, a familiar, menacing presence approached silently. The next moment, a low, mocking voice broke the silence.\n\"Looks like the bodyguards have a close bond...\"\nThe hunters' gazes shifted from Cha Eui-jae to the speaker. Lee Sa-young, hands in his pockets, walked straight toward Cha Eui-jae without looking at anyone else.\n\"Even going to the bathroom together.\"\nThud. The black boots stopped in front of Cha Eui-jae. Under the flickering red light and the ear-piercing alarm blaring in the background, an imposing shadow loomed over Cha Eui-jae. He slightly tilted his head.\n\"Have you finished preparing yourself, Secretary?\"\nIt was the first time he was glad to hear that sarcastic tone.",

      "content": "Chapter 67: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\n\"Have you finished preparing yourself, Secretary?\"\n\"...\"\nThe blaring alarm seemed to herald Lee Sa-young's entrance, such was his overwhelming presence. His self-proclaimed secretary, crawling out of the bathroom wearing a gas mask, was instantly overshadowed!\nCha Eui-jae, who had his head bowed, quietly sighed in relief when he saw the shiny tip of Lee Sa-young's boots.\n'There's no way he wouldn't come with this much noise.'\nIt was a gamble, expecting Lee Sa-young to come to the bathroom. He now had that much faith. If something happened on his side, Lee Sa-young would at least make an appearance. Of course, even if he hadn't come, Cha Eui-jae would have managed with his acting skills.\nPositioning himself so that his body was hidden by Lee Sa-young, Cha Eui-jae spoke with a still trembling voice.\n\"I-I'm sorry, Guild Leader.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young blinked. He still seemed a bit puzzled, as if he hadn't grasped the full situation yet. Cha Eui-jae, discreetly poked Sa-young's stomach with his finger, signaling that Lee Sa-young should play along.\nHowever, the sensation at his fingertips was more of a thud than a poke.\n'Why is it so firm? Is it a rock?'\nThe two stared at each other with wide eyes for different reasons. One was questioning why a person's stomach was so hard, and the other was noting that no one but a monster had ever dared poke his stomach.\nJust before Lee Sa-young could shift his stance, Cha Eui-jae, regaining his senses, added quickly with a glance.\n\"I-I took a calming pill. I'm okay now! I was just nervous because it's my first time...\"\n\"...Ha.\"\nLee Sa-young let out a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a sigh. His narrowed eyes scanned Cha Eui-jae from head to toe. They lingered on his loosely tied necktie for a moment before shifting away.\n\"Alright...\"\nDrawing out his words, Lee Sa-young leisurely crossed his arms.\n\"I hope you prove that bringing you on wasn't a mistake.\"\n'Nice.'\nFortunately, Lee Sa-young had a knack for acting. He perfectly embodied the role of a tyrannical boss! Cha Eui-jae bowed his head, taking the cue from Lee Sa-young's assist.\n\"Yes, sir! I will do my best!\"\n\"Doing your best isn't enough; you have to do it well.\"\nIt was an unexpected remark. But Cha Eui-jae responded without missing a beat, though his voice still trembled.\n\"I will do my best and do it well!\"\nThe hunters, seemingly unsure when to interject, remained silent. But the glances peeking out from behind broad shoulders appear fascinated, as if watching a drama. Lee Sa-young, tapping his arm with his fingers, asked leisurely.\n\"Secretary, how long has it been since you joined?\"\n\"One month.\"\n\"Ah, one month.\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"One month and not much has changed... You'd better do well today.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"If you're in the secretary team, you should focus on me. Just because you're not feeling well...\"\nThis bastard... Cha Eui-jae felt a surge of anger and glared. Lee Sa-young was performing an unsolicited, fiery method acting session.\nThanks to him, anyone would think Cha Eui-jae was 'a poor rookie who managed to get into the Pado Guild's secretary team but ended up throwing up in the bathroom out of nerves after coming out alone with the Guild Leader Lee Sa-young'...\nThis guy always had a knack for getting under people's skin. Now, with his deliberate delivery, every word felt like art. Even though Cha Eui-jae wasn't really a secretary, his insides were getting scratched up!\n'Maybe it's not method acting.'\nPerhaps he's just naturally like this? Gritting his teeth, Cha Eui-jae replied.\n\"I'll... do my best. I'm really sorry.\"\n\"Yes. Make sure you're ready in the future. Otherwise, I'll end up waiting for you forever.\"\n'What a grudge-holder.'\nTheir eyes met again. Lee Sa-young squinted, smiling. But soon, like a wave, the smile vanished. He uncrossed his arms and nodded toward the bathroom entrance.\n\"Let's go.\"\n\"Ah, yes. Understood.\"\nWhen Lee Sa-young turned, the faces of the hunters, who had been watching their conversation with interest, grew tense again. Only Hong Ye-seong raised both hands energetically.\n\"Lee Sa-young! Can I say hello now?\"\nIn person, Hong Ye-seong was quite a handsome young man. Except for the unsettling glint in his round eyes, he could be mistaken for a lunatic. Lee Sa-young, seemingly on good terms, nodded in greeting.\n\"So this is what all the noise was about...\"\nHis gaze turned to the device in Hong Ye-seong's hands. The bathroom, still alternately red and white like a butcher shop, was noisy.\n\"It's loud. Can't you turn it off?\"\n\"Dunno. I barely got it working, but it keeps going off, malfunction or something.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"An unregistered ticket detector!\"\nHong Ye-seong proudly pushed his belly out.\n\"This top-tier item detects even unregistered tickets hidden in inventories. My masterpiece.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nLee Sa-young, staring at the device, murmured.\n\"If it's beeping like that... doesn't that mean someone has an unregistered ticket?\"\n\"It's supposed to, but...\"\nHong Ye-seong quickly grew dejected.\n\"I made it in three hours, so I'm not sure if it's detecting a real unregistered ticket or just malfunctioning. Everyone here registered their tickets, right? You and your secretary included.\"\n\"We did.\"\nA bodyguard listening to their conversation cautiously asked.\n\"Could you show us your tickets, please?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm sorry, but just once more...\"\nWithout a word, Lee Sa-young took out two tickets from his inventory and showed them. Blue letters glowed on the ticket surface. The hunters, confirming the letters, nodded.\n\"Thank you for your cooperation.\"\n\"Damn, maybe I set it up wrong. It must be reacting to registered tickets too...\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been quietly observing, bit his lip. If Lee Sa-young hadn't shown up just in time, this could have gotten really troublesome. They might have had to perform physical memory erasure on all the hunters here...\nThankfully, it wasn't necessary. Lee Sa-young's zone was winning everywhere except for the hangover soup restaurant. Lee Sa-young, putting the tickets back into his inventory, muttered.\n\"If you apply the technology used there... you could scan someone's entire inventory.\"\nIt was a villainous idea, ignoring others' privacy. Hong Ye-seong also muttered, covering his mouth.\n\"What a villainous thought...\"\n\"I'll take it as a compliment.\"\n\"Well... it's an interesting idea, but impossible. The mechanism of this machine... how should I explain it? Ah, it tracks the chip embedded in items I made.\"\n\"You can only use it on items you made?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nHong Ye-seong, nodding, separated a red magic stone from the detector with a curved knife. The blaring alarm and flashing red light finally ceased. Sighing briefly, Hong Ye-seong put the tool in his pocket and scratched his fluffy head.\n\"I'll have to fix it and test it properly if I want to use it on everyone entering the hall.\"\n'What?'\nOne problem after another. Hong Ye-seong, fiddling with the magic stone, waved his hand with clear eyes.\n\"I'll fix this and see you inside. Don't be too hard on your subordinate!\"\n\"Hard on him?\"\nLee Sa-young replied with a laughing tone.\n\"I'm just taking care of him...\"\n***\nThe hunters, seeing the big gas mask followed by the small one, didn't suspect anything but rather looked sympathetic. Some even made small fighting gestures to cheer Cha Eui-jae up. It seemed that Cha Eui-jae's acting and Lee Sa-young's slightly genuine method acting worked well.\nAs they walked away from the bathroom, leaving the crowd behind, Lee Sa-young muttered in discontent.\n\"Why do so many people flock around...\"\nCha Eui-jae wholeheartedly agreed. He cleared his throat unnecessarily and poked Lee Sa-young's back.\n\"...Lee Sa-young, Guild Leader?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Can we talk for a moment?\"\nOf course, he didn't wait for Lee Sa-young's answer. Time was of the essence. Quickly scanning around to ensure no one was nearby, Cha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young's arm and started dragging him somewhere.\nLee Sa-young followed obediently as Cha Eui-jae pulled him along. They arrived at a quiet place, devoid of people, filled only with piled-up luggage.\n\"Phew...\"\nTaking a long breath, Cha Eui-jae removed his gas mask, revealing slightly flushed cheeks and messy hair. He didn't bother fixing his disheveled appearance and pushed Lee Sa-young against the wall, placing his hands on the sides of his gas mask.\n\"Lee Sa-young, Guild Leader.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"We need to be honest with each other, right? Because, well, we're in a contract relationship.\"\n\"You're being long-winded.\"\nDespite being pinned, Lee Sa-young remained relaxed. He looked at Cha Eui-jae quietly, then reached out. His careful touch played with the ends of Cha Eui-jae's messy hair. Lee Sa-young murmured as he fiddled with it.\n\"I don't remember us ever being that straightforward and unreserved...\"\n\"Well, starting now.\"\n\"Ah, starting now?\"\n\"Yes. Before things get out of hand, I'll be honest.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head, indicating he should go on. Taking a short deep breath, Cha Eui-jae met Lee Sa-young's eyes and spoke.\n\"I have... an unregistered black ticket.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Two of them.\"\nThe heavy silence filled the narrow space between them. Cha Eui-jae didn't avoid Lee Sa-young's sly purple eyes. After a long pause, Lee Sa-young finally spoke.\n\"I see. I'm starting to get it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you're calling my name first without me asking for it...\"\nThe black leather glove that had been playing with Cha Eui-jae's hair touched the back of his neck. The hand moved down, exploring the straight neck as if trying to sneak inside his shirt collar. It then wrapped around the loosely tied necktie like a snake and gently pulled it. Cha Eui-jae could have resisted or pushed the hand away, but...\n'Tch.'\nI'll let it slide. Cha Eui-jae, complying with the pull, subtly lifted his gaze. Lee Sa-young's nape still carried a sweet scent.\n\"It means something's gone wrong.\"\nThe glove slowly pulled the necktie loose. Holding the fully untied necktie, Lee Sa-young lowered his head slightly. The filter part of the gas mask touched Cha Eui-jae's forehead. Lee Sa-young growled softly.\n\"And who... gave you that ticket?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\n\"And who... gave you that ticket?\"\n'The reaction is stronger than I thought.'\nCha Eui-jae was a bit taken aback. Although the whispered voice sounded gentle, the aura he felt through his skin was anything but ordinary.\nCha Eui-jae subtly checked around to see if anyone else had noticed this intense aura. However, instead of detecting any human presence, he was met with affectionate words that carried a different message.\n\"Stop moving your eyes elsewhere.\"\n\"Hey, you're being rude again.\"\nInstinctively acting like a traditionalist, Cha Eui-jae realized his mistake and glanced at Lee Sa-young. The moment he met those eyes devoid of light, he thought,\n'Is this guy crazy?'\nA chill ran down his spine. The purple eyes were staring at Cha Eui-jae without a single blink.\n[Trait: Poker Face (B) activated.]\n'Damn it.'\nWhat was it that had annoyed this guy so much? Lee Sa-young had so many triggers that it was hard to guess. Of course, Cha Eui-jae hadn't expected things to go smoothly after confessing to a not-so-minor accident, but at most he had anticipated a sarcastic comment like...\n'Sure, you're really good at this.'\n\"Isn't it important for you to live quietly?\"\nLee Sa-young's glove tightened its grip on the necktie, pulling it a bit more. Lee Sa-young softly prodded him.\n\"Hm? Who gave you the ticket?\"\nThough he couldn't tell why Lee Sa-young was upset, Cha Eui-jae decided to respond calmly for a peaceful resolution.\n\"Isn't the future more important? If they find out I'm here because of that machine, it'll be troublesome.\"\n\"It's your trouble, not mine.\"\n\"What are you talking about? We're in this together.\"\n\"In this together?\"\nLee Sa-young scoffed.\n\"You won't even tell me who gave you the ticket. As if...\"\n'He's really twisted.'\nMaybe the sweet scent coming from Lee Sa-young was actually the sugar on a twisted pastry. Cha Eui-jae ground his teeth discreetly, grateful for the Poker Face trait. Would it be better to just say Nam Woo-jin gave him the tickets?\n'...No.'\nInstinctively, he knew better. The sharp instincts that had kept him alive warned him that mentioning Nam Woo-jin now would be disastrous. Lee Sa-young looked down at Cha Eui-jae with a tilted head.\n\"Not going to tell me?\"\n\"Um, Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Hmm... Then I'll have to guess. Look up properly.\"\n\"You're not ignoring me, are you?\"\n\"Listen to what I have to say first. The secretary needs to know too.\"\nLee Sa-young's gloved hand lightly tilted Cha Eui-jae's chin up. Their eyes met directly as Lee Sa-young buttoned Cha Eui-jae's loose shirt and tidied his collar.\n\"Artisan Exhibition tickets are sold in limited quantities on the Hunter channel. Leftovers from Channel 1 go to Channel 2, and if there are none left, they don't sell them... except for overseas quotas.\"\nSo that's how it worked. If he'd mentioned selling them on Tomato Market or to regular hunters, it could've been a disaster. It was fortunate he learned from the incident with the magic stone.\n\"Thanks to this system, it's impossible to hide which Hunter bought how many tickets.\"\nThe black glove wrapped the necktie under the shirt collar. After a few movements, the tie was neatly knotted.\n\"This time, I bought four tickets. One for Bae Won-woo, one for a guild member, one for myself...\"\nThen, the completed knot was tightened. Just as Cha Eui-jae thought he was being strangled, it stopped. Lee Sa-young adjusted Cha Eui-jae's collar and whispered.\n\"And one for you.\"\nThe black glove fixed his disheveled jacket before finally letting go. Cha Eui-jae was back to looking perfect, as if he hadn't been a mess just moments before.\n\"The others bought as many as they needed. But...\"\nAt that moment, Cha Eui-jae realized two things he'd overlooked.\n\"Nam Woo-jin bought two tickets.\"\nFirst, Lee Sa-young was quick-witted.\n\"I wondered why someone who never leaves the library would come to the Artisan Exhibition.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Do you like bets?\"\nSecond, Lee Sa-young was...\n\"How about a bet? Will Nam Woo-jin come here or not?\"\n...very persistent. Cha Eui-jae withdrew the arm he'd been resting beside Lee Sa-young's face. He sighed briefly and ran a hand through his hair.\n\"You already know the answer, so why ask?\"\n\"Oh...\"\nLee Sa-young's voice lowered, growing more sinister.\n\"You must have talked to Nam Woo-jin about something.\"\n\"No, hey. That's different.\"\n\"What's different?\"\nShould he tell Lee Sa-young of the conversation about his past with Nam Woo-jin? No. Bringing that up now would only backfire. Cha Eui-jae decided to reveal just a sliver of the truth.\n\"You told Nam Woo-jin I was the one who got him the drugs, right? That's why he gave them to me as a thank you. He said it was a big help for his research.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I didn't have any use for them, so I was going to throw them away. But they wouldn't burn, and I couldn't dispose of them anywhere, so I just brought them along. If I'd known Hong Ye-seong's item would react like that, I'd have left them at the soup restaurant.\"\nEven after Cha Eui-jae's explanation, Lee Sa-young still tilted his head. Though the sharp aura had lessened somewhat, he was still looking at Cha Eui-jae with a skewed gaze.\n'Damn, this guy is still looking at me sideways like he's the Leaning Tower of Pisa.' Cha Eui-jae suddenly reached out to grab Lee Sa-young's gas mask. But Lee Sa-young quickly held onto it with both hands.\nThe previously tense atmosphere vanished as they began wrestling over the gas mask. As Lee Sa-young peeled Cha Eui-jae's fingers off one by one, he muttered in a low voice.\n\"You're doing this because you have nothing more to say.\"\n\"Aren't you the one with nothing more to say? Hold still.\"\n\"Let go. I'm leaving.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young, take it off.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Take it off, quickly.\"\n\"I said no.\"\nLee Sa-young responded irritably.\n\"Why didn't you come with Nam Woo-jin then?\"\n\"No, I didn't plan to come here at all. You blackmailed me into coming.\"\n\"Blackmail? Hah.\"\nLee Sa-young scoffed again.\n\"Only you would see a date proposal worth billions as blackmail.\"\n\"You said we'd die together if I didn't go to Songdo. And I was going to sell the ticket Nam Woo-jin gave me on Tomato Market.\"\n\"Did you not delete that app yet?\"\n\"I deleted it, you jerk! I quit and deleted it right after getting a hundred messages!\"\nCha Eui-jae stopped himself abruptly.\nThis was Songdo. If what Lee Sa-young said about the ticket sales was true, there would be more Hunter Channel folks at the exhibition than Cha Eui-jae anticipated. He reminded himself that he was here as a secretary to the Pado Guild.\nAnd naturally, he wouldn't be able to handle unexpected situations in this state. A regular secretary couldn't use memory-erasing magic on a Hunter!\nAlthough Lee Sa-young had played along earlier, in his current displeased state, he'd likely ignore Cha Eui-jae even if he tried to report in character. Worse, he might pretend not to know him at all. With his infamous grudge-holding, Lee Sa-young could be very unpredictable.\nIn this hostile and hazardous environment, Lee Sa-young's cooperation was essential. To achieve that, he needed to untwist Lee Sa-young, who was as twisted as a pretzel.\n'First, I need to calm him down.'\nBut how? Cha Eui-jae had never been good at soothing or appeasing anyone. In the past, he might have resolved fights with friends more easily, but those were from so long ago, before the Day of the Rift, that he couldn't remember clearly.\nDuring his time as J, he didn't have the luxury to appease anyone as most conflicts were resolved with fists, and opponents usually took a submissive stance. The only ones he'd ever tried to calm were that boy or Park Ha-eun...\n'Ha-eun?'\nA light bulb went off in his head. Yes, he could soothe Lee Sa-young like he soothed Park Ha-eun! Lee Sa-young was less fickle than Park Ha-eun after all. With this realization, hope seemed within reach.\nCha Eui-jae steadied his voice and released his grip on the gas mask. Though Lee Sa-young looked at him suspiciously, Cha Eui-jae's Poker Face made him almost invincible. He gently held Lee Sa-young's arm.\n\"Sa-young-ah.\"\n\"What?\"\nLee Sa-young responded coldly, adding in a grumpy voice,\n\"Is there something else you haven't told me?\"\n'Why is he so sharp at times like this...'\nThankfully, Lee Sa-young didn't push his hand away. Cha Eui-jae patted his firm arm and resolutely made his request.\n\"Take off the gas mask.\"\nStep one, talk face-to-face. He wanted to use the skills he'd learned from soothing Park Ha-eun. But Lee Sa-young remained adamant.\n\"No.\"\n\"I want to see your face while we talk. Please, take it off.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Can I be honest?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm pretty pissed off too, and I think we need to talk face-to-face.\"\n\"...Oh.\"\nLee Sa-young squinted his eyes. His short exclamation was full of spite, any willingness to take off the mask had evaporated. Cha Eui-jae shut his eyes tight.\n'Stage one has failed miserably.'\nForgetting that honesty isn't always the best policy had landed him back at square one. There was no choice. It wasn't possible to succeed at the first try. Now, it was time to use his last resort with Lee Sa-young, something he didn't want to do.\nCha Eui-jae moved swiftly, pulling Lee Sa-young into his arms.\n\"...!\"\nHis solid body fit snugly within the embrace, stiffening as if frozen. Cha Eui-jae rested his chin on Lee Sa-young's shoulder, biting his twisting lips to endure. The sweet scent tickled his nose. Thankfully, Lee Sa-young didn't struggle. Cha Eui-jae was barely able to keep his own body from convulsing.\nHe clenched and unclenched his trembling hand before slowly patting Lee Sa-young's broad back.\n\"...Okay, I'm sorry.\"\nThe last resort was to apologize unconditionally.",

      "content": "Chapter 69: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nIt was good up to the point where he boldly embraced him. It wasn't bad that Lee Sa-young, who Cha Eui-jae thought would push him away immediately, didn't. But the problem was that not only Lee Sa-young, but Cha Eui-jae's body also stiffened, making it feel like two solid logs were standing pressed together.\nLee Sa-young's body was colder than the normal body temperature. Almost like a dead person. Suddenly, the nape of Cha Eui-jae's neck felt chilly. He bit his lip. His mouth went dry from nervousness.\n'...No, Lee Sa-young is alive.'\nCha Eui-jae unconsciously tightened his embrace and focused on the pulse beating at the nape of his neck. Thump, thump, thump... He closed his eyes, feeling the somehow fast-beating pulse.\nEvery time he patted and stroked Lee Sa-young's back, he could feel the tense movements of well-toned muscles and hear the occasional low breaths. The sweet scent. The spots where Cha Eui-jae's body touched the pale skin were warming up slightly. A sign of life.\nCha Eui-jae tilted his head slightly to listen to the heartbeat a little more.\nWham!\nA strong force shoved his right shoulder. Cha Eui-jae, who was pushed back as he was shoved, opened his eyes wide. Lee Sa-young froze in the same position with his hand extended. His black fingertips slightly curled.\nTheir gazes met and clashed at the distance created between them. Lee Sa-young's purple eyes were slightly widened. Cha Eui-jae, who was also surprised to see the one who pushed him looking more flustered, rolled his eyes.\n'Was I hugging him for too long?'\nHis shoulder, pushed by Lee Sa-young's hand, ached slightly. It had been a while since he felt this kind of pain, as his body rarely got injured by any attack. Cha Eui-jae rubbed his shoulder with his palm. Lee Sa-young's gaze followed every move he made intently.\nIf it had been anyone other than Cha Eui-jae who was pushed, they would have been thrown into the pile of boxes. Their shoulder bones might have been shattered. Should he advise Lee Sa-young to be careful with his strength when pushing people? Or should he pretend to be more hurt? But the unsettling look on Lee Sa-young's face made it hard to say anything.\nHe seemed... anxious.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, who had pushed Cha Eui-jae, just stood there blankly staring at him. It was unclear whether his last resort had worked.\nHowever, now it was more important to appease Lee Sa-young than to teach or defeat him. Well, at least he didn't end up in the pile of boxes. Having reached this positive conclusion, Cha Eui-jae nonchalantly brushed off his shoulder.\n\"Feeling better now?\"\nLee Sa-young's shoulder flinched. After a moment, he clenched his fist and sarcastically retorted with a grim face.\n\"Do you have no learning ability?\"\nHe was trying to get over it nicely, so why was this guy suddenly attacking his intelligence? Cha Eui-jae, who had been smiling leisurely, immediately frowned.\n\"Hey, why are you bringing up learning ability now?\"\n\"Did you think it was years ago that you coughed up blood?\"\n\"Blood?\"\nCha Eui-jae, who was frowning and recalling the words, let out a short exclamation. Lee Sa-young seemed to be referring to the time he had vomited blood during the contract.\nThanks to the 'Basilisk's Venom' trait, he had developed an immunity, so Lee Sa-young's poison was no longer a concern for Cha Eui-jae. What he was actually concerned about...\nLee Sa-young continued to mock without closing the distance.\n\"If you cough up blood here, how are you going to handle the aftermath?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why, are you going to leave the cleanup to me too?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Even though the antidote doesn't work...\"\n\"Hey, Sa-young.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had called Lee Sa-young without thinking, shut his mouth tightly. No matter how much Lee Sa-young knew about Cha Eui-jae hiding his strength, he couldn't reveal the existence of the antidote trait to him.\n'It's so suspicious.'\nAn S-grade trait that can immediately detoxify and build immunity. Even if he was a hunter hiding his power, wouldn't it be suspicious just to hear about it?\n\"...\"\nA short silence fell. Lee Sa-young stopped snapping and stared at Cha Eui-jae with his mouth tightly shut.\nWell, it was understandable that he was surprised since the person he had given the antidote to almost died in front of him from not being able to withstand the poison. He probably regretted wasting the nectar... he would keep thinking about it. Cha Eui-jae shrugged his shoulders.\n\"No... really, it's fine. Your poison isn't that dangerous anymore.\"\nCha Eui-jae spoke the truth, but Lee Sa-young seemed even more displeased. Lee Sa-young, who had his hands in his pockets, muttered in a low voice.\n\"Oh... and yet someone like that vomits blood like that?\"\n\"I said it's not like that now. I'm fine.\"\n\"I don't plan on dealing with a corpse here.\"\nCha Eui-jae tried to rebut, but Lee Sa-young seemed uninterested in listening. Instead, he silently took out the tickets registered to both of them.\nWhen Lee Sa-young tore the edges of both tickets at once, the surroundings blurred and sank to the floor, replaced by a new scenery. Where the boxes had been stacked untidily, there was now a long sofa and a table. Where the dark alley walls covered in dust had been, there were clean walls and bright lights.\nIn a short moment, they found themselves in a spacious waiting room-like area. Black letters appear one by one on the neatly wallpapered white wall.\n\"\nWaiting Room\nfor Artisan Exhibition Participants\"\n[Created personally by Hong Ye-seong.]\n[Each waiting room is accessible only with a certified ticket.]\n[Please wait in each waiting room until the tournament starts.]\n[Leaving the waiting room and causing trouble may result in punishment under the Awakened Special Law.]\n[If a disturbance seems likely, evacuate to a personal waiting room and contact the Awakened Management Bureau ^^]\nWhy put a line through \"waiting room\"? While Cha Eui-jae was suspiciously eyeing the words on the wall and the newly appeared waiting room, Lee Sa-young, who was more familiar with the place, pointed to the sofa.\n\"Sit down.\"\n\"What's this place for?\"\n\"It's written there. A waiting room.\"\nCha Eui-jae still looked puzzled, so Lee Sa-young added an explanation.\n\"The last exhibition almost had the building collapse.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because there was a brat without manners.\"\nThe abundant chat logs that had filled his mind came to mind automatically. Were the precautions listed there all learned through experience? What kind of battlefield was the last exhibition?\nAnd what kind of person would bring him to such a place under the guise of a date with threats? As Cha Eui-jae remained confused, Lee Sa-young muttered nonchalantly.\n\"They said they'd isolate us this time... and made a separate space like this. It's like a hamster cage.\"\nAccording to him, the last time they put several super-hunter hamsters in one cage, the building almost collapsed, and the exhibition nearly failed. So this time, they decided on a one-hamster, one-cage policy.\nNot running into others was good, but being alone with twisted Lee Sa-young in this place wasn't all that welcome. Cha Eui-jae, still looking suspicious, sat on the sofa.\nLee Sa-young, folding his arms and staring at Cha Eui-jae, spoke.\n\"Your shirt.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Take it off.\"\nSeeing him gesture toward his shoulder, it seemed he wanted to check the shoulder he had pushed earlier. Though it ached intermittently, it would naturally heal over time. Cha Eui-jae didn't want to undress. He exaggeratedly swung his arm to show he was fine.\n\"It wasn't even that hard of a hit.\"\nLee Sa-young muttered darkly.\n\"You better take it off before I do it myself.\"\nCha Eui-jae unconsciously clutched his jacket tightly.\n\"Hey, you didn't take off your gas mask earlier.\"\n\"Is that the same?\"\n\"What's the difference? Why don't you believe me when I say I'm fine?\"\n\"Oh, sure I'll believe that.\"\nThough Lee Sa-young was mocking, his gaze was still fixed around Cha Eui-jae's shoulder. Cha Eui-jae blurted out without thinking.\n\"Are you worried about me?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young took a step forward, clicking his tongue. His black hand gripped the sofa backrest. He looked down at Cha Eui-jae, who was sitting on the sofa, and after some time, answered.\n\"...No way.\"\n\"...\"\nAfter a moment, Lee Sa-young took his hand off the backrest, pulled out his phone, and seemed to respond to a message from someone before turning his body and heading towards the door.\n\"...Get some rest here. Don't think about going out and getting noticed by others.\"\nSqueak, bang! The door closed firmly. Cha Eui-jae stared at the door for a few minutes but saw no sign of it reopening.\nCha Eui-jae finally exhaled a long breath and sprawled out on the sofa. He must have been quite tense without realizing it, as his entire body felt lethargic. Left alone in this space, Cha Eui-jae quietly stared at the ceiling.\nThough silence prevailed, it wasn't unsettling. Perhaps because he knew the space was safe, a feeling he hadn't felt in a long time washed over him. Stability.\nAnd suddenly, a question he hadn't considered before surfaced.\n'Why is Lee Sa-young not curious about me?'\nPeople often pestered him about his abilities under the guise of better utilizing him. They wanted to know what his powers could do, where his limits were, and explored everything.\nBut Lee Sa-young neither asked questions nor tried to utilize him properly. By now, he would have figured out that Cha Eui-jae was a capable person at a similar level. Cha Eui-jae turned over and lay on his side.\n'Isn't it basic to assess the other party before making a contract?'\nIt was fundamental to ask about skills and characteristics, but Lee Sa-young showed no interest in such things. It was as if Lee Sa-young needed Cha Eui-jae's existence itself.\nCha Eui-jae opened his right hand and stared at his palm. A faint golden chain shimmered faintly. He clenched and unclenched his fist, but the golden chain still glinted there. The thought that had started continued to grow.\n'Could he know that I am J?'\nNo, that couldn't be. If he did, he would have already demanded something in exchange for keeping the secret. But Lee Sa-young didn't ask anything and simply set the condition not to betray him.\n'Then why?'\nAfter escaping from the rift, Cha Eui-jae aimed to live a perfect, ordinary life— quiet and peaceful. A life where he lived each day earnestly without involving monsters or rifts. But such a modest life turned out to be harder to achieve, leaving him no room to think about anything else for several months.\nBut at some point, Lee Sa-young had squeezed into the well-ordered gaps of his daily life. As if he, too, was part of that quiet life, he occupied a corner, and it was only now that Cha Eui-jae noticed it.\nCha Eui-jae's life was now filled with Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae mulled over this realization for a long time.\n***\nThe dark figure stood silently between the stacks of boxes in the secluded alley, the same spot before the ticket was torn. There had been two, but now there was only one. His eyes, chasing the dust floating in the air, turned toward the wall.\n\"...Okay, I'm sorry.\"\nThe strong arms that had embraced him, the warmth that had enveloped him, the hand that had repeatedly stroked his back, the quietly beating heart, the soft hair brushing against his nape.\nGritting his teeth, Lee Sa-young muttered softly, his voice echoing in the alley.\n\"Guild Leader.\"\nFrom Lee Sa-young's shadow, a round head poked out slowly. It was A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi who was supposed to be on an overseas business trip. Of course, he had merely touched the threshold of the airplane before sneaking back into the Awakened Management Bureau.\nDressed in a neat suit, he crawled out of the shadow and stood on two feet, clasping his hands behind his back.\n\"I apologize for being a bit late. I had to wrap up some tasks.\"\n\"Report.\"\n\"Yes, first, please take this.\"\nLee Sa-young took the tablet that Seo Min-gi handed him. When he turned on the screen, large red Gothic letters greeted him.\n[J Tracking Report]\nAs Lee Sa-young stared at the screen, Seo Min-gi cleared his throat.\n\"Then, I will begin the report.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 70: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\n\"Then, I will begin the report.\"\nSeo Min-gi began speaking fluently without looking at his notes.\n\"First, the research team re-examined all the data from the rift measurement devices along the coast where the West Sea rift occurred. Most of the readings were consistent with no significant changes. There was no spike in the graph when the rift opened.\"\n\"...\"\n\"However, about six months ago, there was one day when the readings were unusually low.\"\n\"Low?\"\nWhen the screen changed, a graph showing the recorded readings appeared. Among the uniform bars, there was one noticeably lower point.\n\"Yes. As you know, high readings indicate a higher probability of a rift forming. But this is the first time we've seen a low reading... We even consulted the device's developer, but couldn't get a useful answer.\"\n\"So this has never happened before?\"\n\"Yes, that's correct.\"\nThe next screen showed a photo of J wearing a black mask. It was the only official photo left, not a low-quality image from video media. As Lee Sa-young rubbed his finger over the mask, he quickly flipped through Seo Min-gi's report.\nWest Sea Rift, not reopened. No progress in the research team's efforts to reopen closed rifts. No sighting of the awakened individual suspected to be J.\nSummarizing the long sentences, everything was negative. Just as the hand flipping through the screen became a bit rougher,\n[Confirmation of the formation of a J searching team at the Awakened Management Bureau.]\nLee Sa-young muttered.\n\"A searching team from the Management Bureau. There's a rumor that Gyu-Gyu is in charge.\"\n\"Ah, yes. That's correct.\"\nSeo Min-gi nodded briefly.\n\"I looked into it and confirmed that Director Ham Seok-jeong requested a job from Gyu-Gyu. A week after the ranking update, we obtained information that he secretly entered Korea.\"\nRanked 5th in Korea, Gyu-Gyu. Real name Ban Gyu-min. Despite being an S-grade awakened, he did not belong to any organization, choosing to work as a freelance hunter traveling around the world. Naturally, the government wanted to keep an S-grade awakened person in the country by all means, but Ban Gyu-min slipped away like an eel.\nThere were only two reasons why he would enter Korea. Either the client or the target of the request was in Korea, or it was the Lunar New Year holiday. Ban Gyu-min entered the country every year to eat tteokguk1, almost as if proving he was Korean. Seo Min-gi quickly continued.\n\"After making the Hunter Exam questions, Gyu-Gyu did not leave the country and is still staying in Korea.\"\nLee Sa-young, tapping the tablet screen, asked.\n\"Hunter Exam top scorers.\"\n\"Well... as you know.\"\nSeo Min-gi hesitated slightly. When he turned the screen again, two ID photos appeared side by side.\nThe Hunter Exam was a tough test, hard to pass with perfect scores, but usually, five people managed to get top marks each session. However, this time there were only two. D-grade awakened Cha Eui-jae and C-grade awakened Ryu Han-baek.\nStaring at the stubborn-looking face of Cha Eui-jae in the photo, Lee Sa-young tilted his head.\n\"Cha Eui-jae's records?\"\n\"As you instructed, we fabricated the eight-year gap in his records. Even if they investigate, they won't find anything unusual. We have a good excuse as well, saying we heard bits and pieces from regular hunters at the hangover soup restaurant...\"\n\"...\"\nThis Hunter Exam included many questions that could only be answered by active hunters who regularly went in and out of dungeons and rifts. While most examinees who had only memorized the special law failed, Cha Eui-jae passed without difficulty...\nLee Sa-young gave a low directive.\n\"Keep spreading false information. So the Management Bureau doesn't find out.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nSeo Min-gi was silent for a moment before cautiously addressing Lee Sa-young again with his hands behind his back.\n\"Guild Leader, may I ask you something?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"...Am I correct in my thoughts?\"\n\"...\"\nMost of Lee Sa-young's orders had clear purposes, whether to suppress someone or for the benefit of the Pado Guild. Hence, Seo Min-gi could carry out his orders without question.\nHowever, after J appeared in the rankings, there were many tasks from Lee Sa-young whose purposes were not immediately clear.\nAfter the ranking update, the first task assigned was to track J's whereabouts. This was not questioned, as it seemed natural to look for J, the national hero. Seo Min-gi carried out the task without complaint.\nBut then, an odd directive came to conceal someone's rank. After that, orders continued for monitoring the target, reporting everything, protecting the target, tracking the target, and altering records... The unusual tasks kept coming.\nLee Sa-young wasn't someone to give such orders without reason. Seo Min-gi, being very perceptive, connected the dots and found the answer to his question.\nThough the subject was omitted, both men knew exactly what the question referred to. Lee Sa-young's violet eyes looked at Seo Min-gi. Seo Min-gi swallowed hard and waited for a response. After a long silence, Lee Sa-young spoke.\n\"Still lacking.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\nLee Sa-young turned off the tablet screen, his reflection in the black screen showing the gas mask.\n\"Conclusive evidence, certainty.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young gazed blankly at the empty wall before speaking suddenly.\n\"There are two black tickets left. I'll hand them over shortly, so handle them accordingly.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nSeo Min-gi, looking around, hesitated before pointing at himself.\n\"Do you mean... me?\"\n\"Who else is here but you?\"\n\"I'm supposed to be in Malaysia right now. If I show up here, it'll be a huge problem.\"\n\"Say you returned early.\"\n\"Just checking the passenger list will reveal the lie.\"\n\"Then throw it away or put it in a commemorative frame, do as you please.\"\n\"Guild Leader! Why not give it to Romantic Opener instead? I'm too weak to handle such a ticket...\"\n\"He's in the hospital.\"\n\"What? Did he open a door again? Wait, Guild Leader!\"\nThough Seo Min-gi called out desperately, but quietly enough not to be heard by others, Lee Sa-young ignored his plea, took out his own ticket, and crumpled it. Seo Min-gi's distorted face disappeared along with the surrounding scenery, and a tidy waiting room appeared.\nIn front of the waiting room's door, Cha Eui-jae was curled up on a sofa. The sofa seemed small for him, as his legs stuck out even when he curled up. Seeing him like this reminded Lee Sa-young of the time Cha Eui-jae crawled into a tiny, tattered room, making him feel irritated. He thought about telling Hong Ye-seong to place a bigger sofa there.\nEven as he approached silently, Cha Eui-jae's even breathing did not change. Despite his usual trouble at sleeping, he seemed to be sleeping soundly for once.\nLee Sa-young crouched down to look at Cha Eui-jae's sleeping face, then opened his hand and held it above Cha Eui-jae's face. The shadow of his black-gloved hand covered Cha Eui-jae's neat face. His head seemed small enough to hold in one hand. Even his curled-up body seemed smaller.\nWas he always this small?\nAmong ordinary people, he might be considered tall, but among hunters, he wasn't particularly big. As Cha Eui-jae stirred slightly, soft black hair fell over his eyes. Lee Sa-young quietly whispered.\n\"Cha Eui-jae.\"\nHe squatted in front of the sofa. His gaze fell on Cha Eui-jae's slightly parted lips. Lee Sa-young slowly closed his eyes. The faint sound of Cha Eui-jae's breathing became clearer when he listened closely. When he opened his eyes again, he focused on Cha Eui-jae's chest rising and falling and his intermittently fluttering eyelashes.\nIt was a precious sight, one that would not be seen when Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes. Lee Sa-young rested his chin in his hand, observing everything that could only be found in this silence.\nAnd now, Lee Sa-young needed...\nA stronger conviction than ever.\n***\nInside the convention center cafe where the Artisan Exhibition was being held, day laborers, who are awakened, were working instead of ordinary part-time workers. This was because it was easier to handle issues if an awakened person was involved rather than an ordinary person, a circumstance that couldn't be publicly disclosed.\nAnd into that cafe walked a woman with long blonde hair. It was Honeybee in a black leather jacket. She slid down her sunglasses and scanned the menu.\n\"One hot Americano and one iced Americano, both large, please.\"\n\"That'll be 20,000 won.\"\n\"Ridiculous... Hangover soup is cheaper. Here you go.\"\nHoneybee muttered as she handed over her card.\n\"I haven't seen you in a while, Hornet, your tastes have become quite homely.\"\nA sleepy voice called out. Hearing the voice, Honeybee quickly turned to find the owner. In a corner of the cafe, a man with a messy mix of white and yellow hair, half-tied, was sitting with his legs crossed. He looked like a leisurely person out for a stroll with his relaxed and casual demeanor, despite his messy appearance.\nThe man had spoken first but then turned his back. Honeybee, who had been smiling for her public image, frowned deeply upon seeing him.\n\"What the hell? Gyu-Gyu, why are you here?\"\nThe man, called Gyu-Gyu, Ban Gyu-min, ranked 5th in Korea, tilted his body back to look at her upside down with a straw in his mouth, smirking.\n\"Why else? I'm here to buy weapons.\"\n\"Hah.\"\nHoneybee scoffed and crossed her arms.\n\"Don't be ridiculous. Who doesn't know you're banned from Artisan Exhibition?\"\n\"Yeah. But if you have friends in high places, even bans can be lifted.\"\n\"Cut the crap. What are you really planning?\"\n\"What crap? I'm really here to buy weapons.\"\n\"Does Jung Bin know you're here?\"\n\"Well~ if he didn't, I'd be in handcuffs instead of sitting here drinking coffee.\"\nBan Gyu-min leisurely swirled the transparent cup with brown liquid. Seeing rice grains floating around, it seemed he was drinking sikhye2. Honeybee shuddered.\n\"Unbelievable... They let the guy who almost destroyed the last Artisan Exhibition in here.\"\nBan Gyu-min, also known as Gyu-Gyu, who nearly wrecked the last exhibition and turned Jung Bin into a nagging school principal, placed the glass down and lazily pretended to clean his ears.\n\"Hey, it's not like I wanted to fight. That guy picked a fight with me, so I obviously fought back... And Honeybee, when a Korean fights a foreigner, shouldn't you support the Korean? Isn't that patriotism? That's the real patriotism.\"\n\"Hah... This guy shows up out of nowhere and calls me a traitor.\"\nGrinding her teeth, Honeybee strode towards Ban Gyu-min and grabbed him by the collar. Ban Gyu-min, feigning surprise, lifted the glass of sikhye into the air. Honeybee muttered with a fierce look.\n\"You think you can do whatever you want now that you're back in Korea.\"\n\"Oh, did I give it away?\"\n\"Shit, that's it.\"\nJust as Honeybee reached into her inventory, a loud siren blared, piercing their ears. Honeybee and Ban Gyu-min simultaneously turned towards the source of the noise. An awakened part-time worker at the counter stood there, teary-eyed, holding a bright red button. Honeybee gritted her teeth and muttered.\n\"What the hell is that?\"\n\"Um, maybe your coffee is ready? Instead of a buzzer, they use a siren to let you know.\"\n\"Do you only spout nonsense?\"\nFortunately, the purpose of the button became clear quickly. Before the siren even finished, a composed and orderly figure entered the café. The badge hanging from his neck swayed slightly.\n\"Well, good morning. What a surprise to see you both together.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But...\"\nHoneybee slowly withdrew her hand from the inventory. Ban Gyu-min's smiling face turned stiff. Like a grim reaper appearing at the sound of the siren, Jung Bin entered with his hands behind his back, smiling warmly.\n\"Why aren't you two using the lounge that Hong Ye-seong-ssi put so much effort into?\"\nIndeed, the button given to the awakened part-timer was...\n\"The same waiting room used by Lee Sa-young?\"\nA call button for summoning Jung Bin!",

      "content": "Chapter 71: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nEven Lee Sa-young uses the waiting room, so why don't you?\nJung Bin, who skillfully attacked both their consciences and Lee Sa-young with a single sentence, waited for an answer with a pleasant smile. Honeybee, who had been watching him nervously, let go of Gyu-Gyu's collar and tried to back away.\n\"Uh, I was in the waiting room, but I just came out for a coffee. I was planning to go back as soon as I got my coffee. But this guy started picking a fight first.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\"You can ask the part-timer here.\"\nIt was an excuse based on the assumption that Jung Bin was lenient towards cooperative people. Jung Bin, who had been squinting slightly at Honeybee, nodded in agreement.\n\"Do we need to ask? I trust you, Honeybee.\"\nHoneybee, having successfully escaped, smiled brightly.\n\"Then can I go now? Matthew is waiting for me.\"\n\"Of course. See you at the auction.\"\n\"...Damn, you're lucky because of Jung Bin.\"\nHoneybee made a threatening gesture of slicing his throat towards Gyu-Gyu before heading to the counter. Gyu-Gyu joked with a smiling face.\n\"Oh, how scary.\"\n\"Ban Gyu-min.\"\n\"Ah... something even more scary.\"\nGyu-Gyu smiled weakly and stirred his sikhye with a limp paper straw. Jung Bin, staring down at the top of Gyu-Gyu's head, slowly began to speak.\n\"Although the Director has lifted the entry ban...\"\n\"You're telling me not to cause trouble?\"\n\"I'm glad you understand.\"\n\"Of course. Most foreign hunters will participate in this Artisan Exhibition by phone. No reason for any trouble.\"\nGyu-Gyu, babbling unnecessary words, dropped his head onto the table. He looked up at Jung Bin. Jung Bin, who had been smiling kindly, was now staring coldly at Gyu-Gyu. Ban Gyu-min raised the corners of his mouth.\n\"I won't hesitate to use any means to catch J.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If any problem arises, you'll understand, right? It's an order from Director Ham Seok-jeong.\"\n\"You laid the groundwork poorly. J won't come to the Artisan Exhibition.\"\nJung Bin replied coldly. But Gyu-Gyu was firm.\n\"He will come.\"\n\"...How are you so sure?\"\nStill in his collapsed position, Gyu-Gyu raised his right hand and pointed to the sky with his index finger.\n\"I prayed really hard.\"\n\"...\"\n\"My prayers are quite effective, you know. My dad's a pastor.\"\nHe grinned.\n***\n11 AM. The hall where the main auction was held was surprisingly simple for a place where wealthy hunters gathered. Except for a large poster of Hong Ye-seong giving a thumbs-up behind the podium, there were no special decorations. It seemed like they didn't decorate it on purpose, anticipating it might be destroyed.\nTo the right of the podium was the phone auction area, and the center and left were all spaces for ticket holders. Apparently, the organizers were so burned by the previous Artisan Exhibition that they divided the waiting rooms and even installed partitions in the main hall so hunters couldn't see each other.\n'They're really treating us like hamsters.'\nThough it was merely a cover-up, it was good news for Cha Eui-jae. If Bae Won-woo had acknowledged Lee Sa-young, it would have been a headache. He was grateful to the super hamster who caused the chaos, whoever it was.\nInside the partition, which only allowed a view of the podium, was a two-person sofa and a table. Though spacious enough for two people to sit comfortably, Cha Eui-jae stood behind the sofa as it wasn't appropriate for an assistant to sit beside their boss. Lee Sa-young, sitting with crossed legs, muttered quietly without turning around.\n\"Why don't you sit next to me?\"\n\"I'm comfortable here.\"\n\"The auction will take a while. A few hours.\"\n\"I'm fine.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nLee Sa-young, resting his chin on his hand, let out a short laugh.\n\"You were sleeping so deeply that I thought you might be exhausted. But I guess that's not the case.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If your legs get tired, let me know. I'll let you lie down.\"\n'Damn.'\nCha Eui-jae grimaced. Lee Sa-young had been nagging him since he took a short nap in the waiting room. He himself had told him not to go anywhere and just sleep. But before he could retort, the auction began.\nThe auctioneer on the podium struck the gavel.\n\"Thank you, hunters, for attending. Now, let's start the Artisan Exhibition! The first item is an S-grade accessory, in the form of earrings. It has flame resistance, ice resistance, and mental strength increase options.\"\nHong Ye-seong, sitting in a plush chair on one side of the podium, had his arms crossed and was dozing off. When the bodyguard behind him whispered something in his ear, he finally came to his senses and took out the item from his inventory. It was a pair of earrings with red gemstones.\nHong Ye-seong opened his sleepy eyes. Golden patterns appeared over his pupils.\nWithout turning around, Lee Sa-young whispered.\n\"Hong Ye-seong is the only S-grade artisan in the world... It's not surprising he has the best stuff, even if it's favored by the system.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Those are the Eyes of Appraisal.\"\nWhen Hong Ye-seong brushed the earrings with his fingers, blue star-like characters appeared on the red gemstone. The same characters seen on the ticket.\n[Yìxīng]\nThe hunter who received the earrings carefully placed them on the table. Hong Ye-seong, losing interest, closed his eyes and started dozing again. The auctioneer raised his voice.\n\"With the artisan's engraving confirmed, let's start the first auction. The starting price is 1 billion!\"\nCha Eui-jae stared at Lee Sa-young's figure, who showed no intention of raising the paddle.\n\"3 billion is bid. It will now increase by 500 million. 3.5 billion!\"\nAs items were gradually auctioned off and some time passed, Lee Sa-young still hadn't raised the paddle once. Whether there were no items he liked or he was waiting for something was unclear.\nThe auctioneer, who had been silent for a while, smiled mysteriously. His previously lively and firm voice lowered subtly.\n\"I'm sure everyone here knows about Hong Ye-seong's traits.\"\nDeadline Finisher. A strange trait where work efficiency and speed increase as the deadline approaches. The people in the back started moving busily.\n\"Until now, the best equipment Hong Ye-seong made was S-grade, but...\"\nWhat he pulled out from his inventory was...\n\"Introducing the first S+ grade weapon made by human hands since the Day of the Rift!\"\nA giant spear.\nOne that is very similar to the one J used.\nCha Eui-jae's fingertips trembled slightly. It seemed Lee Sa-young glanced back briefly, but Cha Eui-jae couldn't take his eyes off the giant spear and Hong Ye-seong, who was hugging it.\nAfter examining the weapon he made, Hong Ye-seong looked up and scanned the floor below with his appraisal eyes. It seemed like their eyes met for a moment because...\n\"Auction canceled!\"\nHe suddenly threw the spear, stood up, snatched the auctioneer's gavel, and shouted. As the precious first S+ grade weapon rolled off the podium, people screamed. Ignoring them, Hong Ye-seong raised his voice.\n\"We'll restart in two hours! Wait in the waiting room! Take this!\"\nThen he took some powder out of his pocket and scattered it. The hall was quickly engulfed in thick black smoke, making it impossible to see ahead. The murmurs of the people also seemed swallowed by the smoke.\n\"...\"\nOnly after being trapped in the silence did Cha Eui-jae come to his senses. He looked around but saw nothing but darkness. Anxiety crept up his neck. Where was Lee Sa-young? He needed to join him since he had the ticket to the waiting room...\nAt that moment.\n\"Bawk.\"\nA strange sound came from the floor. Amid the black smoke where nothing could be seen, there stood something white and smooth... like a dumb-looking bird.\n'What is this?'\nAs if answering Cha Eui-jae's thoughts, the bird spread its porcelain wings and crowed loudly.\n\"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\"\n'Crazy, it's a chicken?'\nBefore he knew it, he and the chicken had escaped the black smoke and were standing in front of a high stone wall gate. Beyond the wall, a tiled roof towered. It wasn't Jeonju Hanok Village or a folk village, so what was with the tiled house? As he looked around in a daze, Cha Eui-jae nudged the silly bird.\n\"Hey, what are you? Where is this?\"\n\"Bawk.\"\nThe chicken, as if answering, pecked at the gate with its blunt beak. The gate opened wide, revealing a wide yard with grass and a grand tiled house. In one corner of the yard was a large kiln.\nAnd on the main veranda of the tiled house visible straight through the gate, Hong Ye-seong was lying on his side, propping his head up with his arm, sucking on something flat and thin. Upon closer inspection, it was a ginseng stick. Their eyes met. Hong Ye-seong quickly sat up and tapped the spot beside him.\n\"You're here! Come here. Good job, Kkokko.\"\nDespite having just caused a commotion by swinging the auction gavel like a madman, scattering powder to create smoke, and kidnapping someone with a dumb-looking porcelain chicken, the atmosphere was light.\nThis guy... is no ordinary lunatic.\n'He's not just a little crazy.'\nAs Cha Eui-jae cautiously walked up and stood in front of him, Hong Ye-seong tapped the spot beside him again.\n\"Here, sit next to me.\"\n\"I'm fine. I'll stand.\"\n\"Quick, sit down.\"\nThe ceramic chicken waddled over, dragging a blue cushion. It then jumped off the porch and began pecking at Cha Eui-jae's ankle with its blunt beak. Cha Eui-jae, afraid the chicken's beak might break, sat down on the cushion. The wind chime at the end of the eaves rang with a clear sound.\nHong Ye-seong, sitting with one knee raised, spoke lightly.\n\"Sorry for bringing you here like this. But I'm in a bit of a hurry!\"\n\"Isn't this kidnapping?\"\n\"Hey, I'll send you back soon. Kidnapping sounds so harsh.\"\nHong Ye-seong laughed heartily as he threw the empty red ginseng stick wrapper behind him.\n\"What should I call you? Should I just call you secretary? We've met before, right?\"\n\"We have, briefly in the restroom...\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. You're Lee Sa-young's secretary, right?\"\n\"Yes, that's correct. Just call me Secretary Kim.\"\n\"Okay, Secretary Kim.\"\nHong Ye-seong waved his hand nonchalantly, as if the name wasn't important.\n\"So, here's the thing. No one can enter here without my permission, so you can say anything comfortably. This is my precious house, which I made with care. Just relax. Okay? Relax.\"\n\"...\"\nIt was chilling. Something about this setup seems fishy. Nam Woo-jin also lured him into a secluded forest under the pretense of a walk before dropping a bombshell. As Cha Eui-jae was mentally calculating the distance to the gate for a potential escape, he was startled by Hong Ye-seong suddenly thrusting his face forward.\nCha Eui-jae instinctively recoiled. Intricate golden patterns appeared over Hong Ye-seong's clear, almost crazy eyes. The patterns seemed to grow and shrink, with unreadable characters appearing and disappearing repeatedly.\nThe sensation was like a knife scraping his skin, sending chills down his spine. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and was about to grab Hong Ye-seong by the neck when Hong Ye-seong, without blinking, said,\n\"It's in your inventory, isn't it?\"\n\"...\"\n\"The thing I made.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\n\"It's in your inventory, isn't it?\"\n\"...\"\n\"The thing I made.\"\nCha Eui-jae's breath caught in his throat. He grabbed his trembling right hand with his left. His eyes, glowing with golden patterns, scanned him thoroughly as if crushing him.\nThe terrible feeling of being observed beneath the shell of his body, down to the core of his existence. His stomach churned as if he might vomit any second. Gritting his teeth, Cha Eui-jae answered.\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\nThe only thing in his inventory made by Hong Ye-seong was a ticket, which he had already given to Lee Sa-young before the auction began, so he had nothing right now. And there was nothing else that came to mind, so Cha Eui-jae asked a straightforward question.\n\"...Are you talking about the ticket?\"\n\"Geez, if it was the ticket, I wouldn't have dragged you all the way here.\"\nHong Ye-seong muttered as if it was obvious.\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention this first.\"\nGone was his light-hearted demeanor; he now seemed slightly deranged.\n\"I didn't bring you here to argue with Secretary Kim. I brought you because I was sure. I saw with my own eyes that something I made is in your inventory...\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at the empty air. The only things in his inventory were potions, magic stones, and a Basilisk's Fang.\n'Hong Ye-seong would likely be interested in the magic stones...'\nThe potions were mass-produced items, and if he were after the magic stones, he would have demanded them outright. Hong Ye-seong had been searching for magic stones more desperately than anyone.\nThe remaining item was the Basilisk's Fang, but there was no connection between that and Hong Ye-seong. The fang was something he retrieved from the West Sea Rift, and back when J entered the West Sea Rift, Hong Ye-seong was just an ordinary person who hadn't awakened yet.\nWhile Cha Eui-jae was pondering, Hong Ye-seong spoke quickly.\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't have much time. There's no benefit in dragging this out. Lee Sa-young might come looking for you. Let's just get what we want and go our separate ways.\"\nOnly then did Hong Ye-seong's face come into view.\n\"I'll give you whatever you want, just take it out.\"\nBehind the luminous, rotating golden patterns, his bloodshot eyes appeared.\nWhy had he kept his eyes closed throughout the auction? One would think he'd be curious about the process of his painstakingly crafted weapon finding a new owner. I thought it was simply because he was tired from an all-nighter, but there was another reason.\nThe system is generally generous to those it chooses to awaken. It grants new abilities and skills drawn by their earnest desires but rarely intervenes afterward. However, it mercilessly penalizes abilities that slightly infringe upon the system's rules, even if it grants those abilities.\nLike how the space-moving ability of Romantic Opener is restricted, the ability to see into others' inventories, even if limited, likely infringes upon the system's rules.\nIf he could inspect with his Eyes of Appraisal, the ticket inspection would be over in a moment, but he went through the trouble of using a ticket detector, a subpar substitute, in the restroom...\n'He must have some penalty that prevents him from using the Eyes of Appraisal for long.'\nAs the patterns rotated and the number of emerging letters increased, more blood vessels burst behind the golden light. Nevertheless, Hong Ye-seong did not close his Eyes of Appraisal.\n\"Hurry up and take it out.\"\nHong Ye-seong urged. As the patterns changed, a sensation like being flayed washed over Cha Eui-jae, and he had to bite the inside of his cheek to resist the urge to claw out his opponent's eyes. He tasted blood.\nAs this strange standoff continued,\nBzzz—\nA phone in his pocket buzzed. The only people likely to call him were Park Ha-eun or Lee Sa-young. Either way, it was a call he had to answer. If it was from Lee Sa-young, the situation would be more serious. After all, he would have noticed his sudden disappearance.\n'...He must be looking for me.'\nHis neck tingled. He had gone to great lengths to soothe his mood earlier, and he couldn't afford to upset him again. His \"apologize at all costs\" strategy might not work this time. That tactic should be used only once a day, as a last resort.\nIgnoring the unpleasant sensation, Cha Eui-jae took his phone out of his pocket.\n\"Kkokko!\"\n\"Cluck!\"\nAs Hong Ye-seong closed and then opened his eyes, the golden patterns became even more distinct. The unwelcome sensation made Cha Eui-jae freeze. Seizing this moment, the ceramic rooster shot up like a streak of lightning and snatched the phone from his hand.\nStartled by the quick theft of his phone, Cha Eui-jae stared in disbelief at the ceramic rooster, which just tilted its head quizzically while sitting calmly on top of the phone.\n\"Bawk.\"\n'Damn, what kind of rooster is that agile?'\nIn the meantime, Hong Ye-seong groaned and covered his eyes. A thin stream of blood slowly trickled down from under his hands. As he covered his eyes, the flaying sensation ceased. Finally, Cha Eui-jae could breathe a bit easier.\n\"Oh dear... did you take it, Kkokko?\"\n\"Cluck, cluck.\"\n\"Good job. I'm sorry! It's my first time kidnapping, so I forgot to take the phone first.\"\nBzzz, bzzz... The vibration showed no sign of stopping. The ceramic rooster shivered each time the phone buzzed beneath it.\nA gentle breeze brushed past the pavilion, carrying the scent of blood. The blood flowing from Hong Ye-seong's eyes showed no signs of stopping. Putting aside his urge to argue, Cha Eui-jae first checked Hong Ye-seong's condition.\n\"Are your eyes okay?\"\n\"Oh! It's because I've been using my Eyes of Appraisal for too long. I have something for this.\"\nHong Ye-seong cheerfully took a white bandage-like item from his inventory and wrapped it around his eyes. He quickly looked like a blind master living in seclusion in the mountains, speaking nonchalantly.\n\"Ta-da. It's something Nam Woo-jin made for me, and it helps a bit when I wear it.\"\n\"Then could you briefly return my phone? I need to make a call. You know how Guild Leader Lee Sa-young is.\"\n\"Nope. The phone is a hostage. If you cooperate, I'll help you smooth things over. I'll even make an excuse for you!\"\n\"About that...\"\nCha Eui-jae, rubbing his aching temples, took a deep breath and spoke honestly.\n\"I'm sorry, but I really don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\"...\"\nHong Ye-seong stared at Cha Eui-jae despite being blindfolded. It was a piercing gaze, even through the gas mask. The buzzing resumed. The ceramic rooster yawned with its beak open. After a long pause, Hong Ye-seong muttered.\n\"You're not bluffing.\"\n\"Yes. I'm genuinely asking because I don't know.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nHong Ye-seong tilted his head, pondering, and then asked with a thoughtful expression.\n\"Don't you have a weapon in your inventory? Like a long sword. About this big.\"\nHe spread his arms wide. The description sounded familiar.\n'...Could it be?'\nWas he talking about the Basilisk's Fang? Did Hong Ye-seong make that? Cha Eui-jae's face filled with doubt.\nThe Basilisk's Fang had appeared in the West Sea Rift. The timing didn't match, but... if he showed it to Hong Ye-seong, he might learn something about the rift. It was a strange hunch, but he felt a strong conviction that he had to do it.\nJ had a duty to retrieve those buried there.\nIgnoring the blood on his bitten lip, Cha Eui-jae spoke.\n\"...I do have one.\"\nHong Ye-seong leapt in place.\n\"See, I knew it! Show me.\"\n\"But this is probably not something you made, Hong Ye-seong-ssi.\"\n\"Hey, let me be the judge of that. Just show it to me. Quickly!\"\nCha Eui-jae retrieved the Basilisk's Fang from his inventory. Thankfully, it didn't react violently like last time, complaining about how it was too powerful for him. Carefully, he handed the fang to Hong Ye-seong.\nHong Ye-seong cradled the sword, feeling the sheath and handle repeatedly. After a while, he muttered softly.\n\"...This isn't something I made.\"\nIt was a simple mistake. Cha Eui-jae bit his lip and clenched his fists.\nAt that moment, Hong Ye-seong gripped the handle and unsheathed the blade. He handled it like someone who had done it many times. As the jet-black obsidian-like blade was revealed, a white system window appeared before Cha Eui-jae's eyes.\n[Assessing compatibility...]\nSimultaneously, Hong Ye-seong murmured.\n\"But I did make it.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n[Updating thoughts of 'Basilisk's Fang'!]\n[Would you like to confirm?]\nStartled, Cha Eui-jae nodded slightly.\n[Updating...]\n[Fang's thoughts: Father?]\n'Father?'\nWhat did that mean? Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Hong Ye-seong's fingertips began to glow blue. He ran his fingers along the blade. Tiny blue dots appeared on the black blade like stars. The dots soon formed letters, and the letters became a name.\n[Yìxīng]\n\"Artistic Star.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You know my name, right?\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded silently. Hong Ye-seong caressed the blade gently as if stroking a child. His hand remained unscathed despite the sharp edge.\n\"I engrave my name on everything I make. So that its existence can only be confirmed by my touch. It's like a certification of authenticity...\"\n\"...\"\n\"My intel is really good, you know? Whenever there's good material or a strong monster, whether it's in Korea or overseas, I get DMs on InHeart asking if I can make something out of it. Why?\"\nHong Ye-seong flicked the blade with his finger. A clear sound, like nothing heard before, resonated. It sounded almost like a child's laughter.\n\"Because I'm the only person in the world who can make equipment out of those things.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But even I have never heard about a basilisk appearing. I've never heard of, seen, or touched any basilisk loot, so there's no way I made this sword.\"\nOf course, he hadn't heard of it. The basilisk was the master of the West Sea rift, and J was the only one who had met the rift's master. Only J knew the truth.\n\"But this thing... it says I made it.\"\nWhy is there Hong Ye-seong's signature on a weapon found in the rift?\nHe had never entered the West Sea rift. None of the hunters who had entered the rift had possessed the Basilisk's Fang. These two facts were certain. No one knew the West Sea rift better than J.\nAs countless thoughts tangled messily in his head, his pulse quickened.\n\"Where did you get this?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Ah~ come on, Secretary Kim. I'm just as shocked as you are right now. I had no idea something like this would pop up. I just thought one of my weapons might have ended up on the black market...\"\nHong Ye-seong scratched his head roughly. It was more out of frustration than annoyance.\n\"Damn, even if I ask you, you probably won't tell me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I promise you this. I won't ask who you are, I won't dig into it, and I'll keep this meeting a secret. I'm not curious at all. If you need a weapon, I'll even make one for you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But let's at least be honest about this.\"\nHong Ye-seong carefully placed the fang down and grabbed Cha Eui-jae's arm firmly. Cha Eui-jae hesitated for a moment, then stopped. The loose bandages fell away, revealing bloodshot eyes that gleamed brightly.\n\"Where did you get this?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nA Basilisk's Fang found in the West Sea rift. Although not made by Hong Ye-seong, it was said to be crafted by Hong Ye-seong.\nEven without considering the engraving, Hong Ye-seong's claim had some credibility when thinking about the nature of the Basilisk's Fang. Children resemble their parents; beans grow where beans are sown, and red beans where red beans are sown.\nWhen Cha Eui-jae fell silent, deep in thought, Hong Ye-seong began to whine.\n\"Hmm? Hmm? Oh, please tell me. I'm dying of curiosity.\"\nHe was just like the Basilisk's Fang, making claims of his own accord.\nHowever, the \"father\" of the Basilisk's Fang, Hong Ye-seong, knew nothing about the rift in the West Sea. Simply thinking, it seemed that it was made by another Hong Ye-seong, not the one in front of him. A rift where time and space are twisted wasn't a mere wild fantasy now. Cha Eui-jae had already confirmed its possibility.\n\"There are many cases where they have the same names and faces but are different people.\"\nHong Ye-seong didn't appear in the fragments shown by Yoon Ga-eul. However, the fragments seen back then were part of the destroyed world that Yoon Ga-eul had pieced together, so somewhere, there would exist a fragment where he appeared. Cha Eui-jae gazed absentmindedly at the grass swaying with the wind.\n'I need to meet Yoon Ga-eul again...'\nIf he could find out how the Basilisk's Fang made by the Hong Ye-seong in the fragments appeared in the West Sea rift... it might help rescue the people buried in it. He also needed to ask more about the apocalypse.\nAs Cha Eui-jae remained silent, Hong Ye-seong, waiting for him to speak, started tapping the floor with his foot.\n\"Hey? Secretary? You are listening to me, right? Are you thinking? I'll wait?\"\nCha Eui-jae's gaze moved past Hong Ye-seong to a dozing ceramic chicken. The chicken, possibly disturbed by the continuous vibrations beneath it, had been shaking non-stop since it plopped down on the phone.\nSomeone persistent enough to call repeatedly like this could only be Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae quietly looked away, watching the fluffy clouds drift across the blue sky. It was time to escape reality.\n'Great, I'm fucked.'\n\"Secretary Kim!\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyebrow twitched at the voice that sounded like it was three seconds away from turning into a roe deer. Not only was his thinking being interrupted, but now his escape from reality was being disturbed as well. Cha Eui-jae sighed deeply. He had held back three times already. Suddenly, an irritable thought popped up.\n'...How can this guy be so brazen after kidnapping someone?'\nLee Sa-young's gas mask appeared in his mind, and Lee Sa-young's mocking voice began to play automatically.\n'Didn't I tell you to avoid meeting others as much as possible... If you like socializing so much, why not join a mountaineering club?'\nJust thinking about enduring Lee Sa-young's sarcasm made his fists clench. Overcoming one mountain only to find another taller one ahead, it seemed.\n'Even if I escape, I'll have to listen to Sa-young's crap, huh?'\nCha Eui-jae quietly spoke to Hong Ye-seong, who was stomping his feet.\n\"You were asking where I got this from.\"\n\"Oh! You finally decided to answer. Yes, where did you get it?\"\nCha Eui-jae looked at Hong Ye-seong, who was nodding enthusiastically. His upright posture on the cushion was gradually becoming skewed.\n\"Why are you curious?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nHong Ye-seong blinked, looking puzzled. By now, 'Secretary Kim' was slouching like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, one knee up, arm resting on it, leaning sideways. Cha Eui-jae responded bluntly.\n\"Why should I trust Hong Ye-seong and tell him anything?\"\n\"Me?\"\n\"No, really. Who would just talk based on a verbal promise? You should present a proper contract. Like, if I tell you, you'll do something for me. Shouldn't you first propose such conditions?\"\n\"I said I'd keep it a secret and even make weapons for you!\"\n\"Wouldn't it be suspicious if a hunter suddenly showed up with a weapon made by Hong Ye-seong?\"\nInitially planning to pass it off as a joke, Cha Eui-jae's words started to contain some truth, influenced by the turmoil he experienced from Lee Sa-young earlier.\n\"Moreover, if you demand I talk, do I have to comply? Isn't this an abuse of authority and power?\"\n\"Wow... Huh, this is the first time I've heard something like this since my awakening. It's quite refreshing.\"\nCaught in a sudden controversy over abuse of power, Hong Ye-seong pounded his chest.\n\"I'm Hong Ye-seong. And what's wrong with a parent asking where their lost child was found? Are you really not going to answer?\"\nDespite his emotional appeal, it unfortunately had no effect on Cha Eui-jae.\nRevealing that he found it in the West Sea rift would be tantamount to declaring himself as J. What would be the benefit of divulging this information? None. Moreover, Hong Ye-seong had close ties with the Awakened Management Bureau, so even if he kept his mouth shut, there was a sufficient chance the information could leak.\nWith no more useful information to extract from him, and the certainty of Lee Sa-young's outburst, there was no reason to speak.\n\"You said earlier that you didn't make it, right? That wasn't too long ago. Are you really the parent?\"\nWith no other choice but to mentally exhaust Hong Ye-seong, Cha Eui-jae, emboldened by having no retreat, began to mock him relentlessly, causing Hong Ye-seong to gape.\n'They say he's Lee Sa-young's secretary, did he learn to be sarcastic from being around him?'\nUnfortunately, the man in front of him was also wearing a gas mask, making it seem like Lee Sa-young was sitting right there.\n\"You also said you've never seen a basilisk. I'd like to share, but trust is lacking...\"\nThe secretary shouldn't have seen one either. But Secretary Kim exuded the confidence of someone in the know. Hong Ye-seong, flustered, hit the black blade of the Basilisk's Fang. He waved his hand, showing it wasn't cut or injured.\n\"See? My name is on it, and this sharp thing doesn't harm me. The creator recognizes it.\"\n\"Let me see it.\"\nHong Ye-seong hesitantly handed the Basilisk's Fang over, his eyes filled with suspicion. The Basilisk's Fang, as if it missed its familiar, affectionate father's touch, struggled in the hands of this ruffian, but Cha Eui-jae grasped the handle firmly.\n['Basilisk's Fang' thoughts updated!]\n[Fang's thought: If you strike me, I'll cut your hand off.]\nAlthough the Basilisk's Fang didn't recognize its master and became aggressive, Cha Eui-jae had his own plans.\n[Trait: Basilisk's Venom (S+) activated.]\n'Get a clue.'\n['Basilisk's Fang' thoughts updated!]\n[Fang's thought: Cancel the previous thought.]\nSuppressing the Basilisk's Fang timid rebellion with the authority of basilisk's venom, Cha Eui-jae struck his hand against the blade without hesitation. Despite the direct hit, his hand remained unscathed. Hong Ye-seong's eyes widened. Cha Eui-jae shamelessly said.\n\"Maybe the blade just got dull? This doesn't seem like proof.\"\n\"Wait! I'll sharpen it. Then try again.\"\nSomehow, the roles of the interrogator and the one being interrogated had naturally swapped. Hong Ye-seong, engrossed in proving he was the father of the Basilisk's Fang, suddenly seemed to have forgotten about his suspicions.\n'It's fortunate that Hong Ye-seong is simple.'\nJust as he felt a sigh of relief watching Hong Ye-seong jump up to find a whetstone, Hong Ye-seong murmured.\n\"...Something seems to be happening outside.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"...\"\nWithout replying, Hong Ye-seong fiddled with his phone. Soon, a mechanical TTS voice began to play.\n—Hong Ye-seong-ssi, could you possibly move up the auction restart time? ^^ There's a bit of an issue.\n—Hong Ye-seong-ssi, please disregard the previous message.\n—Do not come outside under any circumstances.\nThe messages sounded like the final words of a survivor in a horror story. Cha Eui-jae's expression turned sour, but Hong Ye-seong looked serious.\n\"If Jung Bin is saying things like this, it means the situation outside is seriously messed up.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Gyu-Gyu will be cautious because of last time, and others will be wary of me. So, the only one who would do something...\"\nTheir gazes met in mid-air. They both seemed to be thinking of the same person. As if confirming their speculation, the chicken's vibrations had also ceased. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes tightly.\n'Damn it, Sa-young. What are you up to now...'\n***\n\"Ugh, ah...\"\nMessy white hair scattered in disarray. A black combat boot pressed down hard on the shoulder of the man lying on the ground. Gasping, struggling breaths escaped. Gyu-Gyu, coughing roughly, scratched at the boot with his hand, a twisted smile on his lips.\n\"Do you think pressing like that will break my shoulder?\"\nA head in a gas mask tilted slightly to the right, still holding a phone to their ear. A faint automated voice could be heard from the phone, announcing that the call couldn't be connected. A mocking voice asked.\n\"Who are you talking to? ...J?\"\nThe moment the name \"J\" was mentioned, the foot pressing on the shoulder increased its force. A clear cracking sound of bones misaligning was heard, but despite this, Gyu-Gyu continued to observe the gas mask with a faint, mocking smile. Lee Sa-young muttered eerily.\n\"What makes you so confident to act this way?\"\n\"\nCough\n, fuck, this hurts...\"\n\"You should pick your fights more wisely...\"\nSuddenly, a loud siren blared from somewhere. Gyu-Gyu glanced slightly, but the foot relentlessly grinding into his shoulder and moving toward his collarbone left him writhing helplessly.\n\"Trying to establish a pecking order here like you did with mercenaries, are you?\"\nLee Sa-young tucked the phone between his ear and shoulder and was about to remove his gloves when it happened.\nSwiish! A black chain shot toward Lee Sa-young. He clicked his tongue and stepped back. Gyu-Gyu clutched his shoulder and started coughing violently. The chain, unable to find its target, recoiled back into its owner's grasp. The sound of metal clanking and a deep sigh followed.\n\"Yes... Gyu-Gyu.\"\nThe siren sound accompanied the arrival of Jung Bin. Wrapping the black chain around his hand, he approached them. His face, usually adorned with a gentle smile, was now stern.\n\"I need an explanation of the situation.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\n\"An explanation...\"\nLee Sa-young took the phone out from between his ear and shoulder, glanced at the screen, and replied indifferently.\n\"Is that necessary? You can see what's happening.\"\n\"Yes, an explanation is necessary.\"\nThe firm response came back. Lee Sa-young frowned irritably at the black chain wrapped around Jung Bin's hand. Gyu-Gyu, who had been coughing and catching his breath while lying on the ground, chuckled.\n\"If you answer wrong, you'll be taken away immediately... you better choose your words carefully, Lee Sa-young.\"\nLee Sa-young looked down at Gyu-Gyu coldly.\n\"Should've ripped your mouth open first...\"\n\"Okay, okay. That's enough.\"\nAs Jung Bin sighed and swung the chain, a black iron cage sprang up between Lee Sa-young and Gyu-Gyu. Lee Sa-young shrugged and put his hands in his pockets. Gyu-Gyu also raised his hands in surrender and pressed his face to the ground.\nMost combat-type Awakeners' abilities are specialized for fighting monsters. The system ranking includes contributions to dungeons and rifts, so those with specialized abilities generally rank high. However, Jung Bin, ranked 4th in Korea and an S-grade Hunter, had a slightly different ability.\nHis specialty was restraint. The target, however, was not monsters but other Awakeners.\nWith the two super hamsters isolated, Jung Bin finally smiled warmly.\n\"Understanding the situation precisely is necessary to decide whether to arrest you on the spot or give you some leeway.\"\nAs Jung Bin tightened his grip, the black chain wriggled like a living thing and wrapped around his arm. The end of the chain stood stiffly, as if threatening. Jung Bin clasped his hands behind his back.\n\"So, who threw the first punch?\"\n***\n\"What do you think Lee Sa-young did? They said not to come out at all, did he use poison? What do you think, Secretary?\"\nWhile Hong Ye-seong prattled on, making various guesses, Cha Eui-jae sat slouched, lost in thought.\n'Jung Bin's ability is... restraint.'\nAwakeners bound by his chain cannot use their abilities for a certain period. During the chaotic times, J had often witnessed Jung Bin dragging criminals around wrapped in chains. No matter how formidable Lee Sa-young was, if Jung Bin decided to restrain him, he wouldn't be able to do anything for a while.\nIf Lee Sa-young was captured by Jung Bin, would he be taken to the Awakened Management Bureau's interrogation room?\n'It will be a hassle to go back to the hangover soup restaurant without him...'\nTo return comfortably to the hangover soup restaurant, he had to rescue the troublemaker who had caused a mess in the short time he looked away. Cha Eui-jae stood up, holding the Basilisk's Fang.\n\"I have to go.\"\n\"Where are you going? You can't just leave without explaining! No way!\"\nHong Ye-seong spread his arms to block him, but it was laughable to Cha Eui-jae. He responded in a voice dripping with mock regret.\n\"I'm really sorry. But Hong Ye-seong-ssi, didn't you just engage in power abuse after kidnapping someone? If you had asked politely, I would have gladly explained, but...\"\nCha Eui-jae clasped his hands together in a respectful gesture.\n\"I can't share the long story behind the Basilisk's Fang with someone who shows no basic manners. Sorry. Goodbye.\"\n\"No, Bunny! No, don't go!\"\nHong Ye-seong reached out toward the Basilisk's Fang, almost in tears. How long had it been since they met, and he already had a nickname? The Basilisk's Fang also struggled in his hand, as if trying to escape.\n[The 'Basilisk's Fang' wants to speak]\n[Fang's thoughts: Father! Save me from this villain!]\n'Damn...'\nPlaying the villain in a pathetic melodrama, Cha Eui-jae clicked his tongue.\nIf he left the overdramatic Hong Ye-seong alone, he'd likely be hunted for magic stones, and there was a high chance that the real Secretary Kim Seung-bin of the Pado Guild would also be added to the wanted list. Knowing Hong Ye-seong's tendencies from scrolling every day at InHeart, he'd do just that. It wasn't enough that he was robbed of his identity; now he was being chased by a madman. What had Kim Seung-bin done to deserve this?\nCha Eui-jae stared at the tearful Hong Ye-seong. He needed to shut him up somehow...\n'I want to punch him just once.'\nBut Hong Ye-seong had to resume the auction in a couple of hours, so a physical altercation would cause chaos. Regrettably, violence was off the table. In that case...\nCha Eui-jae glanced at his inventory. A brilliant golden magic stone sparkled as if calling out to him.\n'Since I can't sell it anywhere now.'\nGoods are most useful when used appropriately. If you hoard them, they'll rot. Cha Eui-jae pulled the magic stone from his inventory without hesitation and called Hong Ye-seong.\n\"Hong Ye-seong-ssi.\"\n\"What, you villain... Huh?\"\nReady to snap back, Hong Ye-seong's tone changed dramatically upon seeing the golden magic stone. His eyes widened as if they were about to pop out, and his mouth fell open. His lips trembled.\n\"Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...\"\n\"Shh.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae placed a finger over the filter of his gas mask, Hong Ye-seong clamped his hands over his mouth and nodded fervently. Cha Eui-jae slowly held the magic stone up to Hong Ye-seong's eyes. His once bloodshot eyes filled with tears, deeply moved.\nCha Eui-jae whispered softly.\n\"I heard you've been looking for this.\"\nNod, nod.\n\"You want it, right?\"\nNod, nod, nod, nod, nod, nod, nod.\nHong Ye-seong nodded so enthusiastically that Cha Eui-jae worried his neck might snap. Cha Eui-jae lowered his voice, sounding regretful.\n\"But... I can't give such a precious thing for free.\"\n\"How much?\"\n\"No, not money.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Do you have a contract certified by the system, with severe penalties for breach?\"\nHong Ye-seong rummaged through the traditional Korean house with Kkokko and found a crisp piece of paper. It was an S-grade contract. Holding the Basilisk's Fang in one hand and the magic stone in the other, Cha Eui-jae spoke.\n\"Write this down.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nHong Ye-seong, now polite, picked up the brush and nodded eagerly. Cha Eui-jae adjusted his grip on the magic stone to catch the sunlight better and began.\n\"First, Awakened Hong Ye-seong will not inquire about or try to uncover anything about Secretary Kim from today onward. No attempts, no delegating to others.\"\n\"Nothing?\"\n\"Hurry up and write. The magic stone is waiting.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nHong Ye-seong grumbled but scribbled with the brush. Cha Eui-jae waited for the dot to be placed before stating the second condition.\n\"Second, Awakened Hong Ye-seong will cooperate fully and sincerely with Secretary Kim's requests.\"\n\"What are you going to ask?\"\n\"Something easy.\"\n\"Like borrowing money?\"\n\"No, let's come up with an alibi for Jung Bin.\"\n\"Damn, that's a tough one.\"\nGrumbling, Hong Ye-seong wrote down the second clause as instructed.\n\"Next?\"\n\"Third, Awakened Hong Ye-seong will not pry into the history of the Basilisk's Fang.\"\n\"What? How could you!\"\nHong Ye-seong protested, lifting his head sharply, but what he faced was...\n'Oh, magic stone.'\nThe radiant golden magic stone glittered in the sunlight. It was what he had been searching for all this time. Tears welled up in Hong Ye-seong's eyes as he stared at it.\n[The 'Basilisk's Fang' thoughts updated!]\n[Fang's thoughts: Father?]\nRegardless of whether the Basilisk's Fang was looking for its father, the brush unhesitatingly wrote down the third item. After a moment of silence, the Basilisk's Fang updated its thoughts again.\n[Fang's thoughts: ...life is lonely.]\nThe handle felt unusually sharp in his hand, and the blade seemed darker. Was it going through puberty? Cha Eui-jae waved the Basilisk's Fang around, feeling a bit off. Hong Ye-seong obediently wrote down the third clause and stamped the contract with his seal.\n\"Give me the magic stone!\"\n\"The magic stone.\"\nPlacing the contract into his inventory, Cha Eui-jae pointed to the traditional Korean house's gate with his thumb.\n\"I'll give it to you after you fulfill the contract. Let's get our story straight first.\"\nMoments later, Cha Eui-jae, holding the smooth ceramic rooster, escaped the house with Hong Ye-seong's arm around his shoulders. The surroundings changed in an instant, as they had when they entered the waiting room. As soon as he left Hong Ye-seong's sweet home, he saw...\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, sitting on the couch with his wrists bound by black chains.\n'Fuck, how long has it been, and you're already caught?'\nAs soon as their eyes met, Lee Sa-young, gritting his teeth, glared at him. The ominous aura around Lee Sa-young flickered. Even through the clear lenses of the gas mask, the violet eyes shone ominously.\nHong Ye-seong, sensing the danger, whispered in Cha Eui-jae's ear.\n\"What's wrong with Lee Sa-young? Feels like I'll die if I get near him.\"\n\"Bawk.\"\nKkokko chirped softly, seemingly agreeing. The aura around Lee Sa-young intensified. Despite being bound by Jung Bin's chain, he radiated an impressive presence.\n\"Hyung...\"\nLee Sa-young lifted his bound hands and removed the gas mask. His piercing gaze bore into Cha Eui-jae. He spat his words out with venom.\n\"I really need to lock you up somewhere.\"",

Kkokko trembled, perhaps due to the menacing atmosphere. Cha Eui-jae stroked its smooth head. Lee Sa-young's purple eyes grew even sharper, his head tilted slightly, and his curly hair flowed gently down.\n\"So...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Do you have any plans to explain why you suddenly disappeared and then showed up with that guy?\"\n\"That guy... Do you mean me?\"\nHong Ye-seong cluelessly pointed to himself and tilted his head. 'Shut up.' Cha Eui-jae barely resisted the urge to gag Hong Ye-seong. Despite everything, Lee Sa-young didn't even glance at Hong Ye-seong and only stared at Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae blinked several times, trying to send a signal.\n\"Um, Guild Leader. I will explain everything.\"\n\"Yes... go on.\"\nLee Sa-young, seemingly annoyed to the limit, pretended not to know even while making eye contact through his lenses. He even blinked in sync with Cha Eui-jae's blinking!\n'Damn it, I can't explain everything here in front of Hong Ye-seong, you idiot.'\n\"Should I just explain? Lee Sa-young! Secretary! Can I explain?\"\n\"You shut up.\"\n\"...\"\nHong Ye-seong sulkily lowered his head.\n\"And let go of that shoulder hug.\"\nThe arm draped over Cha Eui-jae's shoulder slowly came down. Making Hong Ye-seong shut up with a word, Lee Sa-young leaned back on the sofa and nodded toward Cha Eui-jae, seemingly ready to listen to something to appease his mood.\n\"Well, you see...\"\nCha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and opened his mouth.\n\"Um? Hong Ye-seong-ssi. You've left the waiting room?\"\nA familiar voice was heard. With a puzzled expression, Jung Bin, a weary-looking Bae Won-woo, and a grumpy-looking Honeybee walked into the hall. It was a combination that gathered only those who had put up autographs on the wall of a hangover soup restaurant.\nCha Eui-jae quickly adopted the persona he had used in the morning, curling up and acting like a timid new secretary.\nHoneybee, having spotted Hong Ye-seong, brushed her hair back irritably.\n\"You! Ugh... If you were going to postpone the auction, you should have just said so. Why did you have to sprinkle powder and cause trouble? Thanks to you, there was another incident.\"\n\"Incident? What incident?\"\n\"Ask Jung Bin!\"\nJung Bin, who had approached the three who were in a standoff, rubbed his chin.\n\"Um, I left a message asking Ye-seong-ssi not to come out, but it seems he didn't see it?\"\n\"You're telling me not to come out, but everything looks fine? Nothing's broken. I even brought detox items thinking Lee Sa-young might have spread poison.\"\n\"Yes, luckily, we managed to stop him just before he used the poison. Thanks to Honeybee-ssi's quick action in hitting the alert bell, we were able to prevent it.\"\nJung Bin shrugged with a smiling face.\n\"Although Gyu-Gyu's shoulder was broken... Since the building wasn't destroyed, it's within acceptable limits, I suppose?\"\n\"Oh, I'm truly sorry. Our guild leader is... always like this, but still. Please contact the Pado Guild if you need to.\"\nBae Won-woo bowed repeatedly. Lee Sa-young, watching them with an irritated face, spat out.\n\"He started it.\"\n\"Oh, Sa-young. Let's keep it down!\"\n\"Haha, yes. Considering Gyu-Gyu-ssi started it, we only tied up his wrists, didn't we?\"\nJung Bin's kind smile passed from Hong Ye-seong to the other gas mask beside him.\n\"Um, and who is this next to Hong Ye-seong-ssi?\"\n\"Ah? This is the secretary from the Pado Guild.\"\n\"Ah, I see.\"\nJung Bin's soft eyes narrowed slightly.\n\"But why are the two of you together? Even if you were here when you entered, I didn't see you when I checked the hall right after the black powder disappeared.\"\n\"Because I kidnapped the secretary!\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nAt the sudden confession, both Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo widened their eyes. Lee Sa-young's gaze grew even more intense, but Cha Eui-jae ignored it and turned his head slightly, allowing Hong Ye-seong to excitedly continue as they had planned.\n\"No, I originally intended to kidnap Lee Sa-young. But since it was my first time using this powder, I couldn't tell what was what. So I told Kkokko to kidnap the gas mask, but it brought the secretary instead. Well, it's still young.\"\n\"Bawk?\"\nThe longer he heard it, the longer he could understand Kkokko's cries. This time, the cry meant it was unfair. But Hong Ye-seong shamelessly continued.\n\"But I couldn't just kick him out right away. That would be too heartless! And I couldn't kidnap Lee Sa-young again. He'd get scolded by that tyrant boss if he went back out. So I was just offering him some tea. He looked so exhausted.\"\n\"...\"\nJung Bin's gaze landed on Cha Eui-jae.\n\"May I ask your name?\"\nDeliberately making his voice tremble like a goat's, Cha Eui-jae answered in the highest, thinnest voice possible.\n\"Kim Seung-bin.\"\n\"Yes, Secretary Kim Seung-bin. Is everything Hong Ye-seong-ssi said true? Were you threatened or coerced in any way?\"\n\"Yes, yes! The young master apologized for bringing me by mistake and served me green tea. He said I should stay for a while because he couldn't let me out immediately... And he introduced Kkokko to me.\"\nCha Eui-jae pushed Kkokko, whom he was holding, forward. Kkokko tilted its smooth head and let out a soft cry. Seeing the porcelain chicken, Jung Bin's gaze softened a bit. He poked Kkokko's blunt beak with his finger and asked.\n\"I see. May I ask one more thing?\"\n\"Yes? Yes, of course.\"\n\"Where were you taken after being kidnapped?\"\n\"Uh, it was a completely different place from here. It was a traditional house with a courtyard... Oh! There was also a kiln.\"\n\"I see...\"\n\"Cluck! Bawk\"\nJung Bin's eyes, which had been watching Cha Eui-jae, shifted to the chicken, which let out a long crow from his arms. Stroking the smooth chin of the chicken, Jung Bin smiled broadly.\n\"Thank you for your explanation. So, Hong Ye-seong-ssi, why did you intend to kidnap Lee Sa-young?\"\n\"Huh? I had something to talk about with him!\"\n\"Couldn't it have waited until after the Artisan Exhibition?\"\n\"It couldn't, that's why. Anyway, I've explained my side, so explain your side now. What happened? What happened?\"\nAs Hong Ye-seong urged for an explanation, Honeybee crossed her arms and sighed deeply.\n\"Well, you see...\"\n***\nAfter the black powder that had obscured everyone's view disappeared, the hunters participating in the Artisan Exhibition found themselves facing the platform where only Hong Ye-seong's poster remained instead of the S+ grade weapon he had created.\n\"What's going on? Where did he go?\"\n\"Is this a terror attack?\"\n\"Kidnapping?\"\n\"It can't be, Hong Ye-seong spread the powder himself.\"\n\"Are we really restarting in two hours?\"\nThe sound of the hunters' murmuring filled the hall. The super hamsters, curious and sensitive, began to leave their partitions and look around.\nJung Bin, holding his forehead and groaning, directed the nearby Management Bureau hunters.\n\"Half of the staff should check the tickets of the hunters in the hall and guide them to wait in the waiting room. The other half will search the center with me to find Hong Ye-seong-ssi.\"\n\"Could he have gone to the waiting room?\"\n\"That would be fortunate. But we must prepare for the possibility that he hasn't. Securing Hong Ye-seong-ssi's safety is our top priority.\"\nAfter Jung Bin hurried off with the hunters, the remaining Management Bureau hunters started a ticket inspection one by one. However, because they worked in groups, their speed was slow, and unfortunately, they failed to notice the crucial encounter between super hamsters that needed to be avoided at all costs.\nGyu-Gyu strolled up to Lee Sa-young, who was standing and looking around. Leaning on the partition and smiling brightly, he spoke.\n\"Wow, it seems you have no intention of buying anything. Our second place, Lee Sa-young. The hornet has been holding a lot of paddles to get a weapon.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You didn't touch the paddles at all? They're still in their original setup.\"\nLee Sa-young didn't even glance at him, taking out his phone and pressing a button to his ear. Gyu-Gyu, who had been watching him quietly, grabbed and released his half-tied hairband, letting the tousled hair scatter.\n\"You know~ I'm working on something right now? You probably know.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's a bit of a hassle, but it looked interesting, so I took it. It's fun to follow it precariously by a single thread.\"\nThe dial tone continues endlessly in Lee Sa-young's ear.\n\"But then...!\"\nSwish! A hairband turned into a sharp dagger, slicing through the air towards the pale neck under the gas mask. However,\n\"...\"\nTuk! Lee Sa-young caught the knife with his hand without a hint of surprise, glancing sideways to identify its owner.\nGyu-Gyu shook his hand and smirked.\n\"Every time I tried to find something out, I kept getting blocked. It was starting to get really annoying, so I looked into it and found the Pado Guild's hand everywhere.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm curious now. Why would the former number one refuse to cooperate when the country is looking for its national hero, and instead block everything tightly?\"\nLee Sa-young responded coldly.\n\"It must be because you're not skilled enough.\"\n\"Sure, sure. Even with my lacking skills, I thought about it.\"\nThe smirk disappeared from Gyu-Gyu's face, replaced by a perfect poker face as he mouthed the words.\n\"Do you want J to stay dead forever?\"\n\"...\"\nFor a moment, the air around them went still. The hunters who had been listening to their conversation fell silent. Lee Sa-young slowly turned to face Ban Gyu-min. In his ear, the phone continued to emit an emotionless automated message.\n—Unable to take your call, please leave a message...\n\"You want J to never appear again?\"\n\"...\"\nBan Gyu-min took a step closer, looking Lee Sa-young straight in the eye through the lenses, and spoke.\n\"J—\"\n***\n\"...After that, as you'd expect, Sa-young and Gyu-min had a huge fight. It looked like one of them was going to get killed, so I borrowed the call bell from the part-timer and pressed it.\"\n\"Thank you for acting quickly.\"\n\"Hmph, of course.\"\nHoneybee snorted and fiddled with her hair, while Bae Won-woo covered his face with both hands and let out a long sigh.\n\"Oh dear, I'm so sorry... I should have been with him. But this time, Sa-young insisted on moving separately with his secretary.\"\n\"Haha, what can we do about what's already happened? I'm just grateful the building wasn't covered in poison.\"\n\"But I acted quickly.

      "content": "Chapter 76: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\n\"What? Hangover soup? I want to go too!\"\n\"Oh, don't come! Get lost!\"\n\"Oh, that's great! Once you taste it, you won't be able to forget it.\"\n\"Haha, Ye-seong-nim, don't you have to go to Bukhansan this time? Will you have time to go to the hangover soup restaurant?\"\nAs Hong Ye-seong tried to squeeze in between the regulars, the cartel of rankers quickly formed. And behind the firmly established hangover soup cartel, the strange standoff between Cha Eui-jae and Lee Sa-young showed no sign of ending.\nThe problem was that even though Lee Sa-young was smiling, it would have been better if he wasn't. Despite the twisted smile on his lips, his eyes weren't smiling at all, still glaring at Cha Eui-jae with lifeless purple eyes.\nThe ceramic chicken nestled in his arms made a soft peep and buried its head into Cha Eui-jae's chest. It seemed scared of Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae sighed quietly, petting the chicken's head with his fingers. He thought Lee Sa-young's mood might have improved, but...\n'As if that guy would.'\nIf anything, it probably got worse, not better. Cha Eui-jae narrowed his eyes at the smirking, pretty face. Just then, Bae Won-woo's face turned pale as he noticed Lee Sa-young.\n\"Sa, sa, sa, Sa-young.\"\n\"What? ...Oh, damn. Why did you take off your gas mask? Are you trying to kill someone?\"\nHoneybee, who had turned to look as well, shivered. As soon as Lee Sa-young noticed their gazes, he wiped the smile off his face and returned to his usual indifferent expression. He adjusted his posture, crossing his legs and resting his bound wrists on his crossed leg.\n\"What did I do?\"\n\"What do you mean, 'what'? You looked like you were about to kill someone.\"\n\"Are you blind?\"\n\"Oh, look at this rude jerk.\"\n\"Honeybee, let's just tolerate it this once, okay?\"\n\"I missed seeing the fight earlier, so can you fight again?\"\nHoneybee raised her middle finger at Lee Sa-young, but Bae Won-woo quickly jumped in to block her, while Hong Ye-seong egged them on. In the midst of this chaos, Lee Sa-young, who had just taken his eyes off Cha Eui-jae, spoke leisurely.\n\"Jung Bin.\"\n\"Yes, Lee Sa-young-ssi.\"\nLee Sa-young lifted his bound wrists, making a distinct clinking sound.\n\"When are you going to untie this?\"\n\"Well, I was planning to untie you after the auction. You can still use your paddle with your hands bound, and if necessary, Secretary Kim can do it for you.\"\n\"Yeah... really?\"\nLee Sa-young replied in a monotone voice, giving Jung Bin a sidelong glance.\n\"I could destroy this place without my powers too, you know.\"\n\"Haha, are you threatening me?\"\n\"Does it sound like a threat?\"\n\"...\"\nThe lively atmosphere created by the hangover soup cartel suddenly turned cold. Lee Sa-young was indeed a bloodless, tearless killer, capable of killing the mood with just a word. Jung Bin smiled with his hands behind his back.\n\"There should be no exceptions in the law. Even if Gyu-Gyu started the fight, didn't you break his shoulder? And you were about to use poison too.\"\n\"But I didn't use it in the end.\"\nBae Won-woo, who had been observing the situation, quickly intervened between them.\n\"It's okay. Just untie him after it's over! Haha, you're really working hard, thank you.\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\nLee Sa-young asked irritably, but Bae Won-woo glanced at Cha Eui-jae and made a tearing motion. It seemed like he was telling him to tear the ticket and go to the waiting room. As much as Cha Eui-jae appreciated the thought...\n'...But this guy has the ticket.'\nCha Eui-jae had to isolate this guy to avoid further trouble. He put the chicken on the floor and approached Lee Sa-young. The pretty face, now filled with irritation, looked up at him. Cha Eui-jae bent down slightly and whispered very softly.\n\"Let's go to the waiting room.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll tell you everything there. Let's just go.\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been staring at Cha Eui-jae's gas mask, sighed deeply. Then he pulled out a ticket from his inventory and tore off a corner. With one last look at Honeybee's surprised face, Hong Ye-seong's intrigued expression, Jung Bin's unreadable face, and Bae Won-woo's thumbs-up, the scenery changed.\nAfter experiencing so much in just a few hours, this quiet waiting room felt like a relief. Cha Eui-jae sighed as he took off his gas mask.\nLee Sa-young, still with his hands bound, walked briskly to the sofa and sat down. He tapped the floor with his foot and began to speak.\n\"So, I get that you went into Hong Ye-seong's space...\"\nThe hearing began immediately. Cha Eui-jae pursed his lips with a sullen expression.\n\"Why did that guy suddenly drag you in there?\"\n\"...\"\n\"What did you talk about inside...\"\n\"Well, um...\"\n\"I want to hear it from you. In detail.\"\nLee Sa-young's sharp gaze swept over Cha Eui-jae, making him uncomfortable. Cha Eui-jae stood with his hands behind his back, and Lee Sa-young gestured to the seat beside him.\n\"Sit.\"\n\"I'll just talk standing.\"\n\"Sit down.\"\nSitting next to him might mean not having to face him directly. Cha Eui-jae sat a bit away from Lee Sa-young and began to think.\nHe couldn't tell Lee Sa-young everything about his conversation with Hong Ye-seong. Even though Lee Sa-young had seen the Basilisk's Fang in the Gwangjin-gu rift, possessing a weapon made by Hong Ye-seong carried different implications. He seemed to have more and more secrets he couldn't share with Lee Sa-young.\n\"Well... The chicken took me to Hong Ye-seong's space.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Hong Ye-seong was lying there eating red ginseng, then told me to sit, so I did.\"\n\"Mhm.\"\n\"...\"\nThis was bad. Without mentioning the Basilisk's Fang, he had nothing to say. He had to twist the truth again. Staring blankly at the white wall, he continued.\n\"Then... Hong Ye-seong suddenly... activated his Eyes of Appraisal and said he knew everything.\"\n\"What exactly?\"\n\"That I have the magic stone.\"\n\"The magic stone?\"\n\"Yes... the one Hong Ye-seong was looking for.\"\n\"...How did that guy know?\"\nSorry. I told him. Cha Eui-jae looked away from Lee Sa-young. But revealing the Basilisk's Fang would be like admitting he was J. Besides, from Honeybee's testimony earlier, it seemed Lee Sa-young didn't have a good opinion of J.\n\"Do you want J to stay dead forever?\"\n\"You want J to never appear again?\"\nCha Eui-jae bit his lip. Was it because he lost his top rank? No matter how much he thought, he couldn't figure out why Lee Sa-young disliked J, as he had never met someone like Lee Sa-young as J. In the glimpses of Lee Sa-young and J's fragments, they seemed close...\nJust then, Lee Sa-young cursed under his breath.\n\"Ah... fuck.\"\n\"Hey, why are you swearing...\"\n\"I can't think straight...\"\nHe heard a short sigh, then felt soft hair brush against his shoulder and neck. Cha Eui-jae widened his eyes and looked sideways. Lee Sa-young had curled up and leaned against him. Cha Eui-jae froze in place, arms awkwardly raised.\n'Why is he doing this?'\nWas this a new type of attack? If the goal was to make him uncomfortable, it was a huge success. Cha Eui-jae was more flustered than ever.\nBut Lee Sa-young made no further moves, just soft breaths and the sound of chains clinking. And then Lee Sa-young's words made Cha Eui-jae doubt his ears.\n\"I'm tired...\"\nDid Lee Sa-young really just say that? It sounded almost like a complaint... As Cha Eui-jae stood stiffly, only his eyes moving, the muttering continued.\n\"You keep making me pry...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Making me care...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Annoying.\"\nEnding with annoyance, it was definitely still Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae tried to speak but then closed his mouth. The breathing near his neck seemed a bit faster.\n'Ah.'\nWith a small clink of chains, Cha Eui-jae began to gently pat Lee Sa-young's shoulder. The shoulders, which had flinched, gradually relaxed.\nJung Bin's chains worked by suppressing the source of awakeners' powers, effectively binding them. Being used to his powers, suddenly losing them must have been disorienting. Even though only his wrists were bound, it probably felt like his entire body was tightly bound. The burden must have been immense, despite him not showing it.\nPatting the firm shoulder, Cha Eui-jae clicked his tongue softly.\n'It might be easier if he just raged.'\nLee Sa-young muttered again.\n\"So annoying...\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. I get it. Just rest.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Sleep if you can.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, who had clammed up, leaned in a bit more. It felt like comforting a child, making Cha Eui-jae stifle a laugh. He raised a hand to gently stroke Lee Sa-young's hair, feeling the tension drain from the body against his. The hair was softer than he had imagined.\nJust then, a new message appeared on the wall.\n[The Artisan Exhibition auction will resume in 30 minutes.]\n[Hunters in the waiting room, please return to the hall when the timer ends.]\n[Time remaining: 29:59...]\nThe numbers on the timer started to decrease. Cha Eui-jae watched it, wishing time would slow down, just this once.",

      "content": "Chapter 77: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nAs Cha Eui-jae mechanically stroked the black hair leaning on him while staring at the white wall, he suddenly looked down at the head resting against him.\n'...Huh?'\nHe felt a peculiar chill where their skin touched, he sensed something was off. Though he had seen many people chained while working with Jung Bin in the past, he had never seen it affect someone's body to this extent.\nWhen Cha Eui-jae gently pushed Lee Sa-young to check his face, a slow hand grabbed his arm. However, the grip was weak, more like it was placed there than grasping firmly.\nLee Sa-young, lifting his head, slightly moved his lips.\n\"...Where.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Where are you going again?\"\nCha Eui-jae could feel more strength in the fingers touching his arm. Would his fingers break? Despite knowing it wouldn't happen, the rising anxiety was inevitable. Cha Eui-jae quickly patted the hand holding his arm, trying to soothe him.\n\"I'm not going anywhere, idiot. Where would I go?\"\n\"...\"\nFacing eyes that had as much trust in him as a grain of pepper, Cha Eui-jae closed his mouth. Did we have such little trust between us? Why? Cha Eui-jae pursed his lips.\n\"Hey, seriously, I'm not going anywhere. I don't have anywhere to go.\"\n\"Then what is it?\"\n\"Just want to see your face. Stay still.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young pressed his lips together tightly. Cha Eui-jae turned his body towards Lee Sa-young, cupped his face with both hands, and examined it here and there. His already pale complexion had turned even whiter, he was sweating, and his violet eyes were slightly dazed and unfocused.\nSeeing that he couldn't even pretend to be okay, it was clear his condition was bad. Were there any medical teams on standby around the venue? Cha Eui-jae frowned slightly and asked.\n\"Are you sick now?\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you're sick, you should say where it hurts. Enduring it won't make it go away.\"\n\"...\"\nJ had seen countless hunters hide serious injuries and suddenly collapse, both in dungeons and rifts. There were always people who would endure without thinking about the ones who would have to carry their bodies, just to avoid worrying others.\nAs his mouth started to dry and his fingertips trembled, Cha Eui-jae released his hands from Lee Sa-young's face and stepped back.\n'Ah, damn it.'\nHe didn't want Lee Sa-young to notice his shaking hands. Lee Sa-young, slowly lifting his head, looked puzzled.\n\"...Why?\"\n\"Nothing. Just lie down for a bit. It's better to lie down fully.\"\nCha Eui-jae tried to push him away to get up, but his arm was grabbed again. As he stepped back, Lee Sa-young's face came closer again. His dazed eyes had turned fierce.\n\"Damn you, you said you weren't going anywhere.\"\n\"I'm just giving you space, I said.\"\nCha Eui-jae snapped irritably as he removed the hand holding his arm, but the other person had no intention of backing down. He needed time to calm his uneasy stomach, but this guy wouldn't even give him that brief moment.\n\"I'll just sit over there.\"\n\"Another lie...\"\nDoes this guy have no trust in people? Who made Lee Sa-young lose all his trust?\nJust as Cha Eui-jae was about to retort sharply, Lee Sa-young suddenly put his weight on Cha Eui-jae, slamming his head into Cha Eui-jae's shoulder.\nHe didn't know where the sudden strength came from in this sickly guy, but it didn't hurt much, just made him sway a little. Cha Eui-jae looked at the black crown of Lee Sa-young's head resting on his shoulder with an incredulous face.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"...It hurts.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I said, I'm hurt.\"\n\"...\"\nThe words \"so what\" were on the tip of his tongue, but the body temperature he felt was unnecessarily cold, and Lee Sa-young was still sweating. He could hear the irregular heartbeat. Thump, thump, thump...\n'Ah.'\nCha Eui-jae looked at the ceiling, twisting his lips.\n'Damn it...'\nWas this the kind of irritation Les Sa-young felt? Cha Eui-jae stared at the large body leaning against him and then sighed deeply, relaxing his body. Unable to support the weight, he fell back. The soft cushion supported his head and back as Lee Sa-young collapsed on top of him. To be more accurate, he was squashed.\nMumbling under the heavy body, Cha Eui-jae spoke.\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm exhausted too, so let's not cause more trouble, okay?\"\n\"Cha Eui-jae.\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been silent for a while, spat out the familiar three-letter name. Cha Eui-jae patted his broad back, responding indifferently.\n\"Your speech has been rude for a while now.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm letting it slide because you're sick.\"\nCha Eui-jae rolled his eyes slightly. While he was wrestling with this guy, the auction was about to start.\nIf I stay down here for just a little longer... Cha Eui-jae, listening to the nearby breathing, closed his eyes but opened them again at the thought that crossed his mind.\n'How is this guy planning to deal with the aftermath after his wrist is freed?'\nAt that moment, as the rapidly decreasing numbers changed to zero, a loud alarm sounded. It was similar to the siren he heard in the bathroom at dawn. Lee Sa-young, rubbing his forehead against his shoulder, muttered a curse.\n\"Ah... Damn it.\"\nCha Eui-jae patted his back.\n\"Time's up. Get up.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Aren't you going to participate in the auction?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been lying still for a long time, wobbled up and leaned back against the sofa. As the heavy body moved away, Cha Eui-jae finally felt he could breathe. He also got up, straightened his crumpled clothes, and put on his gas mask again. During this time, Lee Sa-young was lying limp against the backrest, eyes closed.\n'He looks like a piece of laundry.'\nBeing ready, Cha Eui-jae pointed to the door.\n\"Let's go.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young let out a long sigh and got up, slowly walking out. As they opened the door, they felt numerous presence. It seemed they were the last to come out. Well, with an S+ grade weapon about to be auctioned, everyone must have been extremely anxious.\nLee Sa-young went to his designated sofa and sat deep into it, propping his arm on the armrest and holding his forehead. Maybe he had a headache, his eyes were tightly shut. Cha Eui-jae quietly took a seat behind him.\nThe auctioneer he had seen earlier climbed back onto the stage. He bowed his head.\n\"Thank you all for waiting. We will resume the auction now!\"\nEvent staff brought up a massive spear onto the table set up on the stage.\n\"This is the first S+ grade equipment made by Hong Ye-seong's, the 'Giant's Spear'! The starting bid is...\"\nLee Sa-young suddenly spoke.\n\"Raise the paddle for me.\"\n\"Huh? The auction hasn't started yet.\"\n\"Just raise it, hurry.\"\nThe moment Cha Eui-jae grabbed the paddle on the table and raised it, everyone's attention turned to them, making the hall silent. Lee Sa-young, opening his eyes slowly, spoke.\n\"No matter what the price is, I'm going to buy it... so back off.\"\nHis low voice swept through the hall clearly. The silence only lasted for a moment before the angry outcries of the super hamsters were heard, but Lee Sa-young had already closed his eyes again.\nAt that moment, with a sound like 'pop,' the walls around them turned into sand and dispersed. Someone seemed to have dismantled the walls. The hall, briefly silent again, became more chaotic.\nStanding with the paddle, Cha Eui-jae looked to his left. Honeybee, sitting next to a man in a grey suit, was glaring at him. When he glanced to his right, Bae Won-woo was staring at him with his mouth open.\nInstinctively, Cha Eui-jae looked towards the stage. Hong Ye-seong, sitting on the stage, had his neck stretched out like a turtle, watching Cha Eui-jae and Lee Sa-young with bright, amused eyes.\nCha Eui-jae realized instinctively. What Lee Sa-young just did was a declaration of war against the super hamsters, and at this moment, Cha Eui-jae was... the flag-bearer.\n'Fuck.'\nIn other words, he was the foremost henchman of Lee Sa-young to be dealt with.\nThe auctioneer spoke in a trembling voice.\n\"W-we will begin the auction!\"\n***\nThe loud cheers felt like they were coming from a distance. Jung Bin slightly lifted his head but then shrugged and stared straight ahead. This place was completely separated, so there was no way he could hear the sounds from outside. He slowly walked and stood in front of a metal desk.\n\"Now then...\"\nJung Bin, placing a file on the metal desk with a thud, pulled out a chair and sat down. The dark room, similar in structure to the interrogation rooms of the Awakened Management Bureau, was his private waiting room. Jung Bin clasped his hands together and looked at the man opposite him. Under the dim light, the yellow hair shone white.\n\"Isn't the auction starting? Don't you need to see it?\"\n\"Well, what could possibly go wrong? This is more important right now.\"\n\"Oh... Are you going to release me?\"\n\"No.\"\nBang Gyu-min, Gyu-Gyu, who was sitting on the chair, had his shoulders wrapped in bandages. He was tied to the chair with black chains but still wore a relaxed smile.\n\"We seem to have a lot to discuss, Gyu-Gyu-ssi.\"\nHearing his name, Gyu-Gyu smiled broadly.\n\"Well, I guess so. Did you release Lee Sa-young?\"\n\"No, we plan to release him right before he goes home after the auction ends.\"\n\"Hey, just hand him over to the Awakened Management Bureau.\"\nGyu-Gyu wriggled his bound body and grumbled.\n\"Isn't that too lenient on him~? You've kept me tied up and locked in here all this time.\"\n\"Yes, yes, because you were the one who started the trouble first. And also...\"\nJung Bin looked at Gyu-Gyu with a cold gaze.\n\"Although you were solely in charge of tracking J... you haven't reported much.\"\n\"Oh... that?\"\n\"Yes. The director said to make sure to get it today.\"\n\"That's boring.\"\n\"I believe I have given you enough time. Now, it's time for your answer.\"\nJung Bin tapped his fingers on the desk and opened his mouth.\n\"Who is J?\"",

Another chain had wrapped around his neck like a noose. Gyu-Gyu shrugged and sighed.\n\"Alright, alright. But! Answer one thing for me. Then I'll tell you right away.\"\n\"I'll decide after hearing it.\"\n\"Oh~ it's nothing much...\"\nGyu-Gyu rotated his stiff neck.\n\"Why are you looking for J?\"\n\"Because it's an order from above.\"\nJung Bin answered briefly and gestured for Gyu-Gyu to speak. Gyu-Gyu grimaced.\n\"Come on, think about it without the orders. Do we really need to find J?\"\nThe light hanging overhead swayed precariously. Jung Bin coldly answered as he stared at Gyu-Gyu, who was still smiling.\n\"What is the point of your question? Just get to the point.\"\n\"It's funny, isn't it?\"\nGyu-Gyu puffed his breath to lift his bangs, his brown eyes glinting under his messy, white-and-yellow hair.\n\"Do we really need to go to such lengths to find J like hunting a rat?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Take Ham Seok-jeong, for example. She couldn't even stop me from leaving the country and got reprimanded by the higher-ups... but she entrusted the task of finding J to someone like me? Does that make sense?\"\nBan Gyu-min. South Korea's fifth S-grade awakened. Unlike the previous S-grades, who all chose to stay in the country, he declared that he would become a freelance hunter traveling the world. Naturally, the country was turned upside down, and Ham Seok-jeong visited him daily to persuade him.\nIn front of the silent Jung Bin, Gyu-Gyu continued talking as if he never expected an answer in the first place.\n\"It's also funny that we are searching for J because of the apocalypse. We are looking for J because of an apocalypse that we don't know when, where, or how it will come? Can't we stop it without J?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why? To throw someone who barely survived the rift back in there?\"\nGyu-Gyu smirked as he asked sarcastically. Jung Bin couldn't say anything. Ban Gyu-min's words were sharp as a serpent's.\n\"Hmm? You two are from the same era. The first S-grade and the second S-grade. Don't you know each other well?\"\n\"...\"\nSo deeply buried that it awakened firmly.\n***\nNine years ago.\nJung Bin stood in front of the mirror, taking a deep breath. His neatly trimmed hair and spotless police academy uniform. As he checked for any wrinkles on his clothes again, the bathroom door suddenly swung open, and a middle-aged man with a sharp tiger-like look stuck his head in.\n\"Jung Bin, are you ready?\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\"Good, you're very disciplined.\"\nThe man laughed heartily. He was Song Jo-heon, a well-known A-grade hunter. As Jung Bin nodded politely, Song Jo-heon opened the door wider, signaling him to follow.\n\"Let's go. He's a busy person, so we shouldn't keep him waiting.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\"Remember what I told you? Don't stare too long, and don't pry too much.\"\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\n\"Good, good. He's not too difficult to deal with.\"\nThere was a hint of awkwardness in his words, but Jung Bin didn't show it and quietly followed him. After walking down a long corridor, they arrived at a door.\n\"We're here.\"\nWhen Song Jo-heon opened the door, it revealed a spacious conference room. In the middle of the oval table, a young man was slouching, flipping through a thick file. His face was entirely covered by a mask, and his black combat suit was splattered with dried blood in places.\nIt was immediately obvious. He was J, the hero who saved the country.\nJ seemed entirely focused on what he was reading, showing no interest in who entered. Jung Bin stood straight and saluted, while Song Jo-heon bowed with a smile.\n\"J-nim! This is Jung Bin, the newly awakened S-grade. Please introduce yourself.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nOnly then did J turn his head toward Jung Bin. It felt like their eyes met through the mask. J put down the file he was reading and asked lightly.\n\"Oh... how old are you?\"\n\"I'm twenty-one.\"\n\"You look younger than I thought.\"\nHis voice was oddly modulated, making it impossible to discern his age or gender. Was he just in a good mood? Jung Bin couldn't help but observe him closely.\nOn TV and radio, J was a reliable hero for the country. But in person, the masked youth...\n'Can you even call him a youth?'\nJung Bin had always been observant. To him, J seemed far from being an adult. At most, he appeared to be a high school student, perhaps barely out of his teens. As he pondered this, J walked over to him.\nWhen their eyes met at a slightly lower angle, J suddenly extended his hand.\n\"Hi, I'm J.\"\n\"Ah, I'm Jung Bin. Nice to meet you.\"\nJung Bin, lost in his observations, quickly shook hands after a nudge from Song Jo-heon. J's bony hand was firm but gentle. After a few shakes, J asked cheerfully.\n\"What's your ability?\"\nJung Bin glanced at Song Jo-heon, who nodded slightly. Then he answered sincerely.\n\"Restraint. I can subdue my opponents.\"\n\"Monsters?\"\n\"Awakened ones.\"\n\"Wow, that's great. There are so many awakened criminals these days, it's a headache.\"\n\"Right. Haha, he awakened at the perfect time.\"\nSong Jo-heon patted Jung Bin on the back and urged him forward. J seemed to be pondering something.\n\"Alright. We should get going. Thank you for your time.\"\nJ waved and turned towards the window, jumping out. A cold wind rushed in through the open window. Song Jo-heon looked at Jung Bin, who was staring at the window, and patted him on the back.\n\"Hey, don't get too interested.\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"Don't get too interested in J.\"\nSeeing Jung Bin's puzzled face, Song Jo-heon shrugged.\n\"We need a hero right now. Knowing too much about J will only make things complicated. So I'm just giving you a heads up. Keep a proper distance. But don't make an enemy of him either.\"\n\"...\"\nJung Bin probably wasn't able to hide his confusion. Clicking his tongue, Song Jo-heon left the conference room, muttering softly.\n\"We have no choice. Until things stabilize, the powerful ones have to sacrifice. The country is in such a state...\"\nJung Bin glanced at the file left on the table. It was left open, revealing its contents.\n[Swamp Toad: It's crucial to prevent it from vomiting. ★★★ Attack the head and mouth first.]\n[Red-Tailed Dragon: It's troublesome if it joins its group! Pierce its throat to prevent it from calling its mates.]\nJ was reading a list of monster names and countermeasures written in firm, pressed handwriting. Suddenly, Jung Bin felt a tightness in his chest. He realized that if he read any more, he might start doubting things he shouldn't. He quietly turned around and followed Song Jo-heon out of the room.\n***\nJung Bin stared at Gyu-Gyu. The light, which had been precariously swinging, was now completely still.\n\"We need to find him, even if it's not an order.\"\n\"Why?\"\nHe remembered the back that used to leap alone into the cracks. The figure always heading into the rifts alone. The young version of himself who turned away from it. The strange discomfort he ignored back then was still vivid in his memory. He couldn't repeat the same mistake again now, after all these years.\n\"To protect him.\"\nJung Bin slammed the metal table and stood up, glaring down at Gyu-Gyu.\n\"So, answer me. Who is J?\"\n\"Well, I don't know.\"\nEven though Jung Bin had delved into his memories to give an answer, all he got in return was a lazy, half-hearted denial. He frowned and raised his index finger. The black chains tightened further around Gyu-Gyu's neck.\n\"You're really impatient. I've got the tail! ...But it's cut off.\"\nGyu-Gyu quickly added.\n\"Look into Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I dug hard and shortlisted a few J candidates... But all information gets cut off at Lee Sa-young and the Pado Guild. That guy, he gives out misleading information and it's really annoying.\"\nUpon hearing this, a memory flashed in Jung Bin's mind. On the day the rankings were updated, Lee Sa-young was staring at J's name on the memorial. He had claimed that anything coming out of the West Sea rift was his. Jung Bin scrutinized the singing Gyu-Gyu with suspicion.\n\"By the way... Why are you suddenly so cooperative?\"\n\"Huh? You seem like a J ally.\"\nThe chain around his neck slowly slithered back onto Jung Bin's wrist. Gyu-Gyu must have awakened after J disappeared. Jung Bin asked curiously.\n\"Do you have a connection with J?\"\n\"Ah, nothing special.\"\nGyu-Gyu smiled.\n\"One time, he killed a monster that was about to destroy our church.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, I do repay favors~\"\nGyu-Gyu closed his eyes and began to hum again. It was a song Jung Bin had never heard before.\nThe moments I walked through were not just ordinary, but grace...\nMeanwhile, without Jung Bin, the hall full of hunters was like an 8-ton truck with a broken steering wheel.\n\"Number 7! Number 10! Number 2! Number 7! Number 11!\"\nMaybe even without brakes. The paddles were rising relentlessly, and the prices were skyrocketing.\n\"Hey, don't bid higher on the weapons I claimed. Aren't you putting your paddle down?\"\n\"Huh~ So what?\"\n\"I've cut the phone lines to prevent foreign guys from bidding.\"\n\"Good job. Kill them!\"\nIn the middle of this battlefield, where super hamsters were charging at each other with weapons, Cha Eui-jae, who had unintentionally thrown a gas can into the fire,\n\"...This is fun.\"\nHe muttered while trembling with his legs, being used as a support for Lee Sa-young, who was sprawled out like a wet rag.\n'Where the hell is that guy, Jung Bin, when we need him...'\nHe missed Jung Bin more than anyone else.",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\nCha Eui-jae was in a relatively peaceful state for someone who had become the center of everyone's attention. That is, except for the heavy weight of Lee Sa-young's body leaning on him indiscriminately without considering his own weight.\nThunk! Thud!\n\"Sa-young, is this right?\"\n\"Ah, Guild Leader! Just hang in there until the auction ends!\"\n\"This is the right way, right?\"\n\"Yeah. Just block, don't counterattack... we need an excuse.\"\nClang! Clang! Because the blades flying towards Lee Sa-young were hitting a huge wall and clattering to the ground, things were relatively peaceful beyond that.\nAs Lee Sa-young answered lazily with his eyes closed, Bae Won-woo let out a breath through his nose and adjusted his stance. He had been standing in front of the sofa blocking the pouring attacks since the moment Lee Sa-young made a small gesture.\n\"Guild Leader! Can I scream?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nKang Ji-soo, a red-haired woman who Cha Eui-jae had seen a few times at the hangover soup restaurant, took a deep breath and then raised a paddle with the number 7 on it and shouted with a lion's roar.\n\"7-BID—!\"\nIt was so loud it seemed like the entire building was shaking. Two hunters, who were throwing punches at each other, grabbed their ears and collapsed. Cha Eui-jae saw even the paddles on the table shaking and slightly opened his mouth to gape. The auctioneer, who had been holding his ears, grabbed the microphone again.\n\"Yes, yes... number 7!\"\nAn auction is supposed to be where the highest bidder wins the item. They even prepared paddles for bidding, so why were these super hamsters using the paddles to beat people? Instead of calling higher bids, the hunters were physically reducing the competition.\nAnd Cha Eui-jae saw it. Beyond the sturdy back of Bae Won-woo, Honeybee jumped like a butterfly and struck a hunter on the head with a paddle. Whack! The paddle made a crisp sound and broke. Honeybee cursed softly and threw the broken paddle pieces away.\n\"Matthew! Do you have a spare?\"\n\"No.\"\nA voice as low as a cave responded. Cha Eui-jae glanced to his left. There was one other calm spot in this war, besides the space where he and Lee Sa-young were. It was the space where Honeybee and a bear-like man were sitting. Even as Honeybee started beating up hunters, the man was quietly staying in his seat.\nThen the man, Matthew, turned his head and looked toward Cha Eui-jae. More precisely, his gaze landed on Lee Sa-young, who was leaning on Cha Eui-jae with his eyes closed. Despite his bear-like size, the man in a gray suit and silver-framed glasses gave off quite an intellectual impression.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi, don't you think you should take control of this situation?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been resting his head on Cha Eui-jae's shoulder with his legs crossed, answered sluggishly.\n\"What did I do that needs controlling?\"\n\"Didn't you provoke the hunters' pride?\"\n\"Isn't it their fault for lacking patience... I can't be blamed for them not receiving proper patience training.\"\nThough his body was in pain, his mouth wasn't, and Lee Sa-young started sarcastically as if he'd been waiting for this moment. Cha Eui-jae, who was caught between the current number 2 and 3 in a power struggle, just wanted to run away to a quiet place. He wished they would have their conversation without involving him.\n\"...\"\nMatthew didn't immediately raise his fist or retaliate but just listened quietly. Clicking his tongue, Lee Sa-young sighed briefly and added.\n\"Just take care of Honeybee... You'll need an excuse when Jung Bin arrives.\"\n\"...I see. Thank you for the advice.\"\nMatthew bowed his head politely. He took it as advice, not provocation?\n'Is he a saint or something...'\nWhile Cha Eui-jae was in shock, Matthew began taking something out of his inventory. Cha Eui-jae watched his actions out of the corner of his eye. Could he be charging in anger after all? But his doubts were unfounded because what Matthew took out was...\n'The nostalgic taste! Corn Snack.'\nIt was a long yellow packet of corn snack.\nDespite the blatant curious stares, Matthew calmly opened the packet and raised his right index finger. A small flame popped up at his fingertip.\nWhat followed was even more astonishing. He began roasting the corn snack with his finger flame. Even the control over the flame was impeccable. Noticing the savory smell, Lee Sa-young muttered.\n\"That bastard is roasting it again...\"\n\"...Does he often roast corn snacks?\"\n\"Well...\"\nLee Sa-young, slack, spoke in a hoarse voice.\n\"When Guild Leaders gather, he roasts buttered squid for them sometimes.\"\nIs he the snack provider? While Cha Eui-jae's expression became a bit perplexed, something warm and golden-brown suddenly popped up from the left. Matthew was offering two corn snacks.\n\"Please, have some. They're roasted nicely.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Take it.\"\nAt Lee Sa-young's words, Cha Eui-jae, reacting with the persona of a secretary, politely received the corn snacks with both hands. He bowed his head slightly in thanks, and Matthew also bowed before starting to roast another corn snack.\nAs the chaotic noise of the hall slightly subsided, Honeybee, brushing her hair back, returned to her seat.\n\"Ah, weaklings keep coming at me... huh? What's this?\"\n\"Eat.\"\n\"What, I thought you didn't bring any! Thanks.\"\nSmiling brightly, Honeybee bit into the corn snack and sat on the sofa, crossing her legs. When the wall provided by Bae Won-woo lowered, the almost-ruined hall came into view. Most of the super hamsters who were wielding weapons had collapsed onto the floor.\n\"Well then... with all the competitors taken care of...\"\nMuttering, Lee Sa-young straightened his drooping body and sat up properly. He gestured towards Kang Ji-soo, who was still holding up her paddle.\n\"Kang Ji-soo.\"\n\"Yes, Guild Leader.\"\n\"Collect all the paddles on the tables and break them...\"\n\"Okay.\"\nKang Ji-soo disappeared like the wind. Lee Sa-young, with his bound hands, picked up the paddle with the number 2 on it from the table and looked at the auctioneer.\n\"Did you say you need paddles to participate?\"\n\"Ah, yes! That's correct.\"\n\"...\"\nHis violet eyes swept around the room. Crack! Crack! In the distance, clear sounds of paddles breaking were heard regularly as Kang Ji-soo did her work. Lee Sa-young raised his paddle to head height and smirked.\n\"Hmm... looks like I'm the only one who can participate.\"\n\"What? Hey! Who said you could!\"\n\"Honeybee, I also roasted marshmallows.\"\n\"Mmm! Mmph!\"\n\"What? You want buttered squid too? Got it.\"\nAs Honeybee tried to butt in with gestures, Matthew continuously stuffed roasted treats into her mouth. The auctioneer, looking flustered, turned to Hong Ye-seong, but he had already mentally checked out. Hong Ye-seong snatched the auctioneer's gavel and shouted.\n\"Then it's settled! Lee Sa-young wins the auction. Let's wrap this up quickly!\"\nBang! Bang! Bang! The cheerful sound of the gavel filled the hall. Letting out a long sigh, Lee Sa-young blinked slowly. Then he leaned his head on Cha Eui-jae's shoulder again and whispered in his ear.\n\"Then... Hyung.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Just tell Jung Bin one thing.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Tell him I'll collect this debt twice over.\"\nMuttering in a whisper-like voice, Lee Sa-young's upper body slumped forward. At the same time, the paddle he was holding fell to the floor. Cha Eui-jae quickly caught his falling body. It was chillingly cold.\nOne word popped into his empty mind. The surrounding murmurs seemed distant.\n'Why?'\nWasn't he just in bad shape? Could the binding of his power cause such a significant toll on his body? Was he in such poor condition that he would collapse like this? Who should I call? Where should we go...\nThoughts tangled messily, and his heart started racing. With a dry mouth, Cha Eui-jae called out to Lee Sa-young.\n\"Sa-young.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hey, Lee Sa-young.\"\nFor some reason, his pulse seemed to be getting slower. Even his breathing became faint.\nNo, this can't be. His hands, holding Lee Sa-young's torso, trembled. As he urgently looked around, a massive figure appeared before him.\nBae Won-woo, clearly panicked, hurriedly created a wall around them. He quickly checked if the area was well covered and then asked.\n\"Secretary, what's wrong with him? What's happening?\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae opened his mouth to answer, he bit his cheek hard on purpose. The sharp pain and metallic taste of blood brought him back to reality. Fortunately, his voice came out calmly.\n\"I don't know. He's been in poor condition since being bound, but he suddenly collapsed.\"\n\"What's going on? He's never been this bad before... I've been bound before, but it wasn't this bad... Ji-soo! Go get Jung Bin!\"\n\"Damn it... where is Jung Bin anyway!? I'm on it!\"\nKang Ji-soo slipped through the gap in the wall. Meanwhile, Bae Won-woo took out all sorts of potions from his inventory, laying them beside him, and held his head in frustration.\nHow much time passed? When Cha Eui-jae's neck was soaked with cold sweat, a rhythmic knocking came from the wall. One side of the wall opened, and Kang Ji-soo, panting, dragged Jung Bin inside.\n\"Kang Ji-soo-ssi, can you explain why the hall is in such a state?\"\n\"Jung Bin!\"\n\"...Lee Sa-young-ssi? What on earth...\"\nJung Bin's expression changed instantly as he knelt down in front of Lee Sa-young. A heavy silence filled the air as he examined his condition. He sighed deeply.\n\"I apologize. I underestimated the situation. I didn't realize so much time had passed.\"\nWith slightly hurried hands, he removed the chains that bound his wrists. His limp arms fell to his sides. Bae Won-woo, who was also kneeling, muttered worriedly.\n\"Sa-young has never been in such a bad state before. What is happening?\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nJung Bin's face showed a hint of hesitation. After a moment of contemplation, his expression turned resolute. He spoke in a low voice.\n\"You are aware that my chains have the ability to restrain the source of an Awakened's power. Yes, that's what is publicly known, but...\"\nHolding Lee Sa-young's cold arm, Cha Eui-jae raised his head at Jung Bin's next words.\n\"To be precise, they revert the Awakened's body to the state it was in just before their trigger for their awakening. It temporarily fixes the body in that state by rewinding its time—\"\nAt that moment, a voice not present in the room, that of Nam Woo-jin, echoed in Cha Eui-jae's memory.\n\"In the midst of the black ruins, he was sitting alone, wearing loose patient clothes.\"\n\"—To the body of a normal person, just before becoming an Awakened.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Where Beans Are Planted, Beans Grow\n\"Ah, so...\"\nBae Won-woo, who was about to say something, saw Kang Ji-soo standing next to Cha Eui-jae and closed his mouth tightly. 'Just before awakening.' Cha Eui-jae looked down at Lee Sa-young in his arms. The irregular breathing gradually stabilized as soon as the chains were removed. The pale face was also slowly regaining color.\nFinally, the stifling feeling, as if his throat was being choked, eased. Cha Eui-jae bowed his head slightly and silently regulated his breathing.\n\"Now that checking on Lee Sa-young-ssi's condition is urgent, I will visit the Pado Guild and Lee Sa-young-ssi later to offer a formal apology.\"\nJung Bin took out a bottle of purple liquid from his inventory and opened the lid. Cha Eui-jae, seeing this, immediately grabbed Lee Sa-young's neck and tilted his head back. Jung Bin, acknowledging with his eyes, poured the liquid into Lee Sa-young's mouth and asked.\n\"I haven't fully assessed the hall situation since I returned from dealing with another matter. Can you explain it to me?\"\n\"The auction just ended, and, well, the hunters fought over a large spear. That's why the place looks like this... What else should I say?\"\nAs Bae Won-woo glanced sideways awkwardly, Kang Ji-soo interrupted.\n\"The spear was won by the Guild Leader!\"\n\"Should we mention that?\"\n\"The Guild Leader is unconscious and might not receive it if we don't say anything.\"\n\"...I see. That should be enough for now. Thank you.\"\nWhether it was due to the release of the restraints or the liquid Jung Bin gave him, Lee Sa-young's condition improved rapidly. At a glance, he seemed to be simply sleeping. Once Lee Sa-young's condition stabilized, Jung Bin quickly assessed the hall and began giving orders.\nOriginally, Hong Ye-seong was supposed to enjoy the world a bit more before getting to work, but for his safety, the respective national officials decided to immediately transport him to the mountains. Hong Ye-seong, trying to avoid the hands reaching for him, jumped off the platform.\n\"Whose decision is this!\"\n\"It's the director's order.\"\n\"Wait, wait, I haven't finished my transaction yet...\"\nHong Ye-seong's desperate eyes scanned the hall until they landed on Cha Eui-jae. Just as he was about to call out to Cha Eui-jae,\n\"Ugh!\"\n\"Please cooperate, Artisan!\"\n\"What the... Let go of me!\"\nThe security personnel rushed in. Since Hong Ye-seong had previously scattered powder and escaped, the guards swiftly and skillfully wrapped him up in a blanket. Wrapped up like a yellow checkered roll, Hong Ye-seong struggled vigorously.\n\"Ah. Wait! Seriously! I can't work without it! Wait a moment!\"\n\"Transport him.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nAfter the tearfully lamenting Hong Ye-seong disappeared, the super hamsters that had fainted from fighting were taken care of by the HB Guild. While Honeybee grumbled, moving the hunters she had knocked out, Jung Bin bowed deeply to Matthew.\n\"Thank you for your help.\"\n\"Don't mention it. You always work hard. Here, have this.\"\nMatthew handed over a warm squid leg and headed towards the fallen hunters with Honeybee. Jung Bin deeply bowed to the awkwardly standing Bae Won-woo.\n\"I'm truly sorry. This incident is entirely my fault. I will take full responsibility.\"\nBae Won-woo scratched his head awkwardly.\n\"Well, it's already happened, so nothing can be done. It wasn't intentional, right? Still, please visit Pado sometime. That will be enough. Are you going to the Seowon Guild now?\"\n\"Yes, that's right. Nam Woo-jin-ssi knows best about Lee Sa-young-ssi's condition.\"\n\"Please take good care of Sa-young.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nAs Jung Bin left with Lee Sa-young, only Bae Won-woo, Kang Ji-soo, and Cha Eui-jae remained in the hall. Kang Ji-soo, who had been silently watching with folded arms, grumbled.\n\"...Is it okay to let it go like this? The Guild Leader collapsed! We almost got our heads chopped off.\"\n\"Enough. It was an accident. Lee Sa-young will handle getting compensation from the respective officials. Let's go.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nAs they headed for the exit, Bae Won-woo suddenly stopped, his eyes wide, and turned around.\n\"Why aren't you coming, secretary?\"\n\"...Pardon? Me?\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been standing still, looked up. Bae Won-woo smiled broadly, pointing at the door with his thumb, a smile familiar from many visits to the hangover soup restaurant.\n\"Let's go together! We drove here. We'll take you to the guild front.\"\n\"No, I'm okay...\"\n\"Hey.\"\nBefore he knew it, Kang Ji-soo, who had come behind him, pushed Cha Eui-jae's back. Finally, his feet moved. Bae Won-woo quickly put an arm around his shoulder, drawing him closer.\n\"Come on, let's go!\"\nA while later, in the car.\nUntil they reached a familiar road after leaving the convention center, the three sat quietly without much conversation. Then, raindrops began to dot the window. Bae Won-woo clicked his tongue.\n\"Ugh, it's raining.\"\nThe secretary, who had been sitting quietly in the back, spoke.\n\"Excuse me, could you let me off here?\"\n\"Vice-Guild Leader, do you have an umbrella? The secretary probably doesn't have one. Lend him yours.\"\n\"No, I'm really fine...\"\n\"Why would you think of getting wet when there's an umbrella? Here, take the umbrella first!\"\nBae Won-woo forcefully handed over a black umbrella. Caught off guard, the secretary took it hesitantly, then bowed his head.\n\"...Thank you.\"\n\"Take care. You worked hard today, being with Sa-young.\"\nWith a pop, the secretary got out, opened the black umbrella, and stepped into the rainy street. After walking a few steps, he briefly looked back. Seeing him through the lowered window, Bae Won-woo and Kang Ji-soo simultaneously waved.\nSwoosh— The rain had grown heavier. Even after the secretary had been out for quite a while, Bae Won-woo didn't seem to have any intention of leaving, instead resting his arms on the steering wheel and playing with his phone. Kang Ji-soo, chewing on a snack, spoke up.\n\"But, Vice-Guild Leader.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Who was that person?\"\n\"...\"\nThe figure in a suit had already disappeared silently, as if melted into the rain. Kang Ji-soo stretched her neck, trying to peer into the dark alley, mumbling.\n\"I didn't say anything because neither the Guild Leader nor you mentioned it. But I've never seen that person in the secretary team or the guild. Shouldn't we bring him back?\"\n\"Ji-soo.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nBae Won-woo solemnly extended his hand. She promptly placed the snack in his hand, and he leisurely brought it to his mouth.\n\"Sa-young always has a reason for what he does.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Probably.\"\nKang Ji-soo looked at him skeptically, but Bae Won-woo finally started the car, the wipers working busily to clear the rain from the windshield.\n\"If he needed to be detained, Sa-young would have told us. But he didn't.\"\n\"Maybe he was too out of it?\"\n\"No. Don't underestimate that guy. He probably even timed his collapse.\"\nIndeed, if it was the Lee Sa-young Kang Ji-soo knew, that made sense. Even when collapsing, he had been giving instructions. It made one doubt whether he was genuinely ill or just pretending. Kang Ji-soo cautiously asked.\n\"But is the Guild Leader really sick?\"\n\"Yeah, that's true.\"\n\"Was he very sick before awakening?\"\n\"Well... I heard so.\"\nBae Won-woo gave a vague answer while steering with one hand.\n\"And I really don't know who that secretary is. Could be a new recruit in the combat support team... or some joint operation with another guild.\"\n\"Okay, okay. You mean don't be too curious. Got it.\"\n\"No, really, I don't know.\"\nKang Ji-soo shrugged indifferently and turned on the radio. A familiar commercial jingle played.\nPassing the National Exam with HunterOne, passing the Hunter exam with HunterOne\n... Listening to the familiar tune, she quietly spoke.\n\"Well, he didn't seem like a bad person.\"\n\"Huh? Why?\"\n\"Didn't you see, Vice-Guild Leader?\"\n\"See what?\"\n\"...Never mind.\"\nKang Ji-soo sighed lightly and rested her head against the window. Bae Won-woo muttered something, but after running around at the Artisan Exhibition, she felt too tired to respond. After all, he hadn't told her everything either, so she had the right not to speak.\nThe secretary's hands, which held onto the collapsing Lee Sa-young, had bulging veins and were trembling white. He hadn't taken his eyes off Lee Sa-young until Jung Bin and Lee Sa-young disappeared. Even with the gas mask on, his face must have been pale. Kang Ji-soo was sure of it. Maybe even paler than Lee Sa-young. She pursed her lips.\n'That person was more worried than I was.'\n\"How about dinner?\"\n\"The hangover soup restaurant is closed today.\"\n\"...Oh, right.\"\n\"By the way, Vice-Guild Leader, stop eating so much hangover soup. You'll start bleeding hangover soup instead of blood.\"\n\"You just don't understand the real taste of hangover soup...\"\nTheir conversation gradually faded into the sound of the rain.\n***\nAt the end of an exceptionally long day, Cha Eui-jae was finally alone. The wind was unusually chilly that day.\nCha Eui-jae entered a deserted alley and took off the stifling gas mask. Clean shoe tips, oddly out of place, stood amidst the dirty ground littered with soggy flyers and business cards. He kicked the ground once, causing water to splash.\nAs he walked through the alleys where he wouldn't run into anyone, a red, glowing sign gradually came into view. A hangover soup restaurant. The place he needed to return to. Cha Eui-jae closed his umbrella and trudged toward the restaurant.\nStanding at the entrance, he looked up and immediately noticed the paper he had left earlier. It was soaked with rain and the writing had smudged, but he could tell a lot had been written. Cha Eui-jae squinted to read the smeared words. The last time he saw it, there was only one reply. Now, the entire blank space was filled with different messages.\n[Closed on the day of the Artisan Exhibition.]\n[Reason: Taking my grandmother to the hospital.]\n⤷Hope your grandmother gets well!!\n⤷Wondered why it was closed. Hope it went well?\n⤷If you need help with hospital bills, let us know...\n⤷Let's keep this place open for a long time! Please\n⤷Make sure the part-timer stays healthy too\n⤷Will you be open tomorrow?\nJust then, his phone buzzed in his pocket. The short vibration indicated it was a text from Park Ha-eun. Cha Eui-jae slowly took out his phone and checked the screen.\nSa-young: I'm okay\nCha Eui-jae took a deep breath. The damp air filled his lungs. Resting his head against the glass and closing his eyes, he could hear the rain softly breaking apart in the distance. The knots of tension, tangled and hardened, also crumbled away.\nAfter a moment, he slowly opened his eyes, which now had a determined gleam.",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Life is Like a Boomerang\n\"Yes, it's okay.\"\nA soft voice whispered. Warm arms wrapped around his body.\n\"It's okay now.\"\nBehind the crumbling vision, white light shattered.\n\"I...\"\n\"...It's time.\"\nLee Sa-young opened his eyes. The moment he saw the white ceiling, he quickly sat up and took off the gloves on his hands.\nBang! Something heavy fell and collided with a hard surface. Lee Sa-young quickly surveyed his surroundings. The wires connecting his body to the machines were yanked, leaving the machines scattered messily on the floor. A voice with a sigh came from beside him.\n\"Are you going to break it to that extent? Why not just smash it all?\"\nIt was Nam Woo-jin. He was sitting at a desk, facing away, doing something. But Lee Sa-young didn't let down his guard. His sharp purple eyes turned to the corner. Standing there, Jung Bin quickly raised both hands and spoke.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi, I am Jung Bjn. This is Nam Woo-jin-ssi's laboratory in the basement of the Seowon Guild. I brought you here after you lost consciousness in the auction hall.\"\n\"...\"\nThe sharp aura that seemed ready to kill calmed down a bit. Only then did Lee Sa-young realize he was lying on a bunk bed in a laboratory. Nam Woo-jin muttered gruffly.\n\"You'd better pay properly for taking over my lab bed.\"\n\"Of course. This place is safe, Lee Sa-young-ssi. Do you remember anything?\"\nThe last memory left amidst the terrible pain...\n\"Sa-young.\"\nA trembling hand could be felt on his back, even through the faint sense.\n\"Hey, Lee Sa-young.\"\nThe voice, usually calm and unhesitant, was broken and hoarse. The unusually warm touch, and all those fragmented sensations were...\n'Cha Eui-jae.'\nLee Sa-young hurriedly searched his pocket and took out his phone. Thankfully, the battery remained. Cha Eui-jae, Cha Eui-jae... Lee Sa-young typed in the number he memorized and sent a short message.\n[I'm okay]\nSent. He waited for a long time, but no reply came. Anxiety crept up his neck.\n\"So then.\"\nClap, a sharp clap and voice cut through his thoughts. Lee Sa-young turned his head toward the voice. Nam Woo-jin had turned his chair around to face him, crossing his legs and resting his chin on his hand.\n\"You've smashed my machines, threatened people, checked your phone, and it looks like you've finished your urgent messages.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Shall we talk? This guy doesn't give proper explanations.\"\nJung Bin, with arms crossed, shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi needs a detailed explanation too.\"\nLee Sa-young roughly pulled off the wires connected to his body. Nam Woo-jin groaned.\n\"Do you know how much that costs? Handle it gently.\"\n\"Send me the bill. And who told you to connect me to this?\"\n\"I hope you consider how surprised I was when Jung Bin barged in here with you. How's your body?\"\n\"Fine.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nNam Woo-jin examined Lee Sa-young, who was sitting on the bunk bed, with his white eyes. After a while, he nodded and started mumbling to himself.\n\"You look fine. If you accept the system's power during awakening, all pre-awakening injuries heal... although your case has a significant difference between pre- and post-awakening states. The recovery strength must be proportional to the awakening grade.\"\n\"...Nam Woo-jin.\"\nLee Sa-young brushed his hair away from his eyes and spoke in a low voice.\n\"Don't cross the line.\"\n\"...My mistake. Got it.\"\nA brief silence followed. Lee Sa-young, rubbing his eyes in annoyance, spoke up.\n\"Jung Bin, explain the situation.\"\n\"Yes. While I was having a one-on-one with Gyu-Gyu, Kang Ji-soo-ssi came to me and I returned alone. When I arrived on site, you were already down. After assessing the situation, I untied the chains and fed you the poison Nam Woo-jin-ssi provided.\"\nNam Woo-jin's eyes gleamed.\n\"Did it help with the rapid recovery?\"\nLee Sa-young nodded slightly.\n\"It helped somewhat.\"\n\"Good. If I get more poison, I'll send it to the Pado Guild.\"\n\"Other hunters were taken care of by HB, so after giving general instructions, I brought you to the Seowon Guild. Everyone has now returned to their respective guilds.\"\n\"Even Bae Won-woo?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young leaned back on the bed with his arms supporting him. His eyes, scanning the air, soon focused on Jung Bin.\n\"Did you hear the story?\"\n\"What story are you referring to?\"\n\"...I suppose you didn't have time to hear it.\"\nLee Sa-young smiled, a chilling smile that Jung Bin met with a gentle one.\n\"I said I would take this debt twice as hard, remember?\"\n\"I hadn't heard that before, but I was prepared. It was my carelessness that caused this.\"\n\"Yes... I like how communicative you are.\"\nLee Sa-young rotated his stiff neck. His languid voice demanded.\n\"Tell me the conversation you had with Gyu-Gyu, from start to finish.\"\n***\nFrom the day after the Artisan Exhibition that felt like a week, Cha Eui-jae quickly returned to his peaceful routine. Waking up at dawn to serve hangover soup to hunters. Taking care of Park Ha-eun while preparing ingredients, running the business in the evening, and closing the shop late at night.\nHowever, after the Artisan Exhibition, Cha Eui-jae found himself staring blankly into space more often. Every time, he thought of Lee Sa-young. The sensation of the cold, hard body he held was still vivid. Was Lee Sa-young okay? Whenever such thoughts occurred, he checked the text message Lee Sa-young sent.\nSa-young: I'm okay\n'Like hell you are.'\nCha Eui-jae didn't trust that message. Even if Lee Sa-young hadn't regained consciousness, he would have hidden that fact from the public. The powerful must always seem unshakeable. So that message could have been sent by someone else to conceal Lee Sa-young's condition.\nThe inexplicable anxiety gnawed at his mind constantly. Cha Eui-jae repeatedly turned his phone off and on, hesitating to reply.\nAnd at the perfect timing, as if aiming for Cha Eui-jae's anxious moment, Choi Go-yo showed up. It was late at night, after the shop had closed.\nWhile Cha Eui-jae sat in the hall, fiddling with his phone without even taking off his apron, Choi Go-yo managed to unlock the locked door from the inside and barged in, waving his arms. He shouted energetically.\n\"Hello, Hyung!\"\nLuckily, the sense he picked up at Incheon Port hadn't completely fled, and Choi Go-yo quickly lowered his tension after noticing Cha Eui-jae's mood.\n\"Ahem, do you remember? On the day of the Artisan Exhibition, I took your grandmother to the hospital. I came to tell you about it. I was going to come right away, but I've been busy.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nDamn it, how could he forget about the hospital with all that's been going on?\n'You're totally insane, Cha Eui-jae.'\nCha Eui-jae's face twisted with anger, and Choi Go-yo's shoulders shrank. He clung to the steel door, trembling as he asked.\n\"C-can I tell you now?\"\n\"Yes, please. How is my grandmother?\"\n\"Yes, I brought copies of the diagnosis and prescription!\"\nChoi Go-yo quickly handed over the documents and started explaining what happened at the hospital like he was rapping. Cha Eui-jae skimmed through the documents quickly while listening to Choi Go-yo's explanation. Fortunately, her knee condition hadn't worsened, and it seemed that steady medication would improve it.\n\"That's all!\"\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"Hehe, you're welcome.\"\nCha Eui-jae's sighing response made Choi Go-yo shyly scratch his head. Watching his face brought back sharp memories of the space door delivery to Cha Eui-jae's mind. And the face of Lee Sa-young, whom he saw as soon as he opened the door.\nDamn it. As Cha Eui-jae's face hardened instantly, Choi Go-yo quickly wiped off his smile and straightened his posture. Regardless, Cha Eui-jae carefully asked.\n\"How is Sa-young...?\"\n\"S-Sa-young?\"\nChoi Go-yo's eyes widened. Damn it. Cha Eui-jae quickly corrected the honorific.\n\"Lee Sa-young. He hasn't contacted me for any work lately.\"\n\"Oh, you mean the Guild Leader. The term was so unfamiliar, I didn't catch it at first. I don't know either!\"\nOf course, Choi Go-yo was of no help. While Cha Eui-jae regretted asking, Choi Go-yo busily rummaged through his pocket.\n\"Hehe, he likes soloing... did he go to work today? Just a moment.\"\n\"...It's not direct contact, is it?\"\n\"No! There's a Pado Guild blind board. Usually, when the guild leader shows up, the secretariat team warns us.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nAfter skimming the screen, Choi Go-yo handed over his phone.\n\"Want to see it? It's fun.\"\n\"Isn't security important?\"\n\"Aye, it's just staff asking what's for lunch at the cafeteria and sometimes bashing the guild leader.\"\nCha Eui-jae took the phone and scrolled down. Beside him, Choi Go-yo started excitedly explaining.\n\"Since I have a relatively high security clearance, I can see most of the posts.\"\nThe first post that caught his eye was as follows;\n\"Pado Guild Blind Post\"\n[※Please use manners while posting!]\n[※Posts that don't follow the rules may be deleted without notice.]\nTitle: [Anonymous] So what happened at the JYJ event?\n240 hasn't shown up for work since the JYJ event\nIt's a closed-off circle, so there's no way to get information\nThe Hangover Soup Ghost says he doesn't know\nAnd Ji-soo also says no comment\nI'm dying of curiosity\nHe still hasn't shown up for work. Is his condition really that bad? Did he even regain consciousness? Cha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck and frowned.\n'Should I go check on him myself?'\nCha Eui-jae scrolled down, wondering if there was any useful information in the comments. One sentence caught his eye.\nComments (10)\n—Seems like HunterNet is under an information blackout too?\n—Yeah, normally there would be tons of bragging posts disguised as testimonials, but there's nothing this time\n—No news articles either ~ did 240 win anything?\n—Was looking forward to it, what a letdown\n—Nope, my cousin went to the JYJ event. He woke up to find it was over, and he was lying in a hall with Hornet checking the attendance with a sword\n—Wow\n—What the? Is it some kind of hell for those who killed hornets?\n—Please, just spill the whole story\n—Please make a separate post for it\n—Protest everything\nHornet... could that mean Honeybee? Honeybee was checking attendance with a sword? This tantalizing phrase made it impossible for Eui-jae to look away. He quickly refreshed the page. Luckily, the commenter had posted a new thread.\nTitle: [Anonymous] Deleting in 10 minutes\nYae-syeong did Yae-syeong stuff\nBut he hit a wall right from the first sentence. What was this bizarre word with all the incorrect spelling supposed to mean? Cha Eui-jae quickly gave up on interpreting it himself and decided to seek help from someone else.\n\"...Hey, what does 'Yae-syeong' mean?\"\n\"Yae-syeong?\"\nLooking over the post, Choi Go-yo chuckled.\n\"Oh, you're reading that one. It's funny. 'Yae-syeong' refers to Hong Ye-seong. It's slang.\"\n\"Slang?\"\n\"Search prevention. So it doesn't show up even if someone searches for it.\"\nYae-syeong means Hong Ye-seong. So the first line...\nHong Ye-seong did Hong Ye-seong stuff.\n'Shit.'\nJust from the first sentence, he could tell. This commenter was the real deal.",

This is unsettling...\n⤷Are you from the secretary team? Is 240 still not at work? I have something to report.\n⤷No ㅜㅜ Instructions come via email, but they haven't come to work.\nCha Eui-jae slowly read the posts, but instead of feeling reassured, his doubts only increased. If Lee Sa-young wasn't coming to work and only sending emails, there was enough possibility that Bae Won-woo was handling business under the name Lee Sa-young.\nJust as Cha Eui-jae, biting his lip, was about to start browsing other posts, Choi Go-yo, who was whistling while drawing on his tablet, suddenly raised his head. His gaze fixed somewhere in the air. Cha Eui-jae glanced up slightly too.\n+82 [CH.1]\"A megaphone has been used.\"\n+82[CH.1]\"Writing megaphone message...\"\nA red megaphone icon appeared on the right side of the view. But Cha Eui-jae consciously kept his head down and his eyes fixed on his phone. The megaphone was from the Hunter channel that he had sealed after the Artisan Exhibition. Cha Eui-jae glanced sideways at Choi Go-yo, who was probably seeing the same thing with his mouth agape.\n'If you look or acknowledge it, you'll be screwed.'\nSoon, big letters with bright red color and neat white borders suddenly popped into view.\n+82 [CH.1]\" Jung Bin has used a megaphone.\"\n[4] Jung Bin: Please maintain channel security. Hong Ye-seong-ssi, we won't hold you accountable, just confirm you're alive. If you're alive, just drop a dot ^^\nSo he uses a precious megaphone just to confirm if Hong Ye-seong is alive? Cha Eui-jae, staring blankly at the text, quickly calculated in his mind.\nSurely, that guy was wrapped up like a kimbap and taken away by the awakened agents. He said he was going back into the mountain, right? Though he was distracted by Lee Sa-young, Hong Ye-seong's desperate cries were so vivid they stuck in his memory. Choi Go-yo murmured.\n\"Crazy... Could he have been kidnapped? Wow... if he really was kidnapped, the country would be in chaos. This is serious.\"\nCha Eui-jae felt the urge to shut Choi Go-yo's mouth. Each of those remarks tended to become unavoidable flags. But before he could stop him, Choi Go-yo planted another flag.\n\"Or did he run off because he wanted meat? Have you checked any chicken shops?\"\nThen three messages arrived on Choi Go-yo's phone in quick succession. Cha Eui-jae casually checked the notifications. Since he was using the phone, the contents were immediately visible.\nSeo Min-gi:Hong Ye-seong escaped during transfer to Bukhansan, whereabouts unknown.\nSeo Min-gi:Most personnel of the Awakened Management Bureau are being deployed for Hong Ye-seong's search and protection.\nSeo Min-gi:Please contact Romantic Opener.\n'Shit.'\n[Trait Poker Face (B) activated.]\nThanks to the ever-reliable Poker Face trait, Cha Eui-jae maintained a calm expression and composed voice as he handed the phone back like he hadn't seen anything.\n\"Thanks for showing me. But you got a message.\"\n\"A message? What is it?\"\nChoi Go-yo's face changed color several times as he checked Seo Min-gi's message. He turned pale, then red, then blue. He jumped up and hastily packed his things.\n\"Sorry! I have to go right away.\"\n\"Already? At least have a bowl of hangover soup before you go.\"\n\"No, no. Something urgent came up.\"\n\"What kind of urgent?\"\n\"I, uh, can't tell you. It's classified.\"\n\"Classified?\"\n\"...Really can't tell you! I'll come back with the Vice-Guild Leader next time!\"\nChoi Go-yo darted out of the hangover soup restaurant like a bullet. Only then did the restaurant regain its calm. Jung Bin's megaphone chat still lingered prominently before his eyes.\n'No way...'\nThere were too many things coming to mind about why Hong Ye-seong might have suddenly escaped. But Cha Eui-jae decided,\n'...Let's just focus on business.'\nto ignore it for now.\n***\nFortunately, the security of channel 1 seemed to be well maintained, as most regular hunters appeared completely unaware of Hong Ye-seong's escape. They were just curious about who had won the weapons auctioned at the Artisan Exhibition. And channel 1 hunters, like Bae Won-woo or Honeybee, didn't show up until the shop was closed.\nAfter finishing all the business and closing the shop, preparing the ingredients needed for tomorrow, it was already dawn. Cha Eui-jae sighed briefly as he finished the dishes and took off his rubber gloves.\nThen,\n\"Cock-a-doodle-doo.\"\nA strangely familiar rooster crow was heard. It was too clear to be dismissed as a hallucination. The sound came from outside.\nOpening the door, Cha Eui-jae looked around and slowly lowered his gaze. Inside a blue Baccas box placed next to the hangover soup shop door, a smooth, white something was curled up. Noticing Cha Eui-jae's gaze, it lifted its head and looked up at him.\nRound but soulless black bean-like eyes. Smooth white porcelain-like body. Overall, it looked like a slightly foolish porcelain chicken.\nIt was Kkokko.\n\"Bawk?\"\nCha Eui-jae quietly stepped back and closed the door.\nClick, clack.\nFrom beyond the door, Kkokko's curious clucks were faintly heard, but Cha Eui-jae ignored them and went to the kitchen to get a ladle. Holding the ladle that fit perfectly in his hand, he stared into space.\n'Let's organize my thoughts.'\nFirst, Hong Ye-seong, who was being transferred to Bukhansan, disappeared. Bukhansan is a mountain in Seoul, so it's physically close to the hangover soup shop. Thus, he could be found nearby. Second, Hong Ye-seong was crazy about magic stones. And that magic stone... Cha Eui-jae glanced at his inventory.\n'It's still in my inventory...'\nHe regretted not giving it away back then! Gritting his teeth, he recalled that just before being taken away, Hong Ye-seong had seen Secretary Kim. He even tried to call for Secretary Kim. Though the memory was a bit blurry, he was sure their eyes had met.\nPorcelain chicken Kkokko, made by Hong Ye-seong and only adheres to his commands. Why was Kkokko placed in a Baccas box by the hangover soup shop door instead of being with its master?\n\"Cluck, bawk, bawk...\"\nThe clucking sounded ominous. It wasn't a greeting or a call to Cha Eui-jae, and it certainly wasn't a curious sound. It was more like clearing its throat before shouting...\n'Fuck!'\nCha Eui-jae quickly opened the door and brought Kkokko inside along with the box. For a moment, Kkokko seemed to show a hint of disappointment. Sighing, Cha Eui-jae tapped its blunt beak with a finger.\n\"Hey, where's your master and why are you alone here?\"\n\"Bawk.\"\n\"...No, don't answer. I feel like it'll be troublesome if I know.\"\n\"Bawk?\"\nKkokko, tilting its head, stretched its neck towards the door. Cha Eui-jae also turned his head.\nIn the middle of a dark street with only a faint streetlight, a bright blue hiking outfit with sunglasses, a hat, a black mask that clung to the face, and a colorful handkerchief around the neck— someone who looked like a prime member of a hiking club stood in front of the door.\n'Suspicious.'\nIt was 2:30 AM now. It was too late to dismiss this person as a regular hiker passing by. Usually, hikers descend before dusk. And this wasn't a regular customer either; it was an unfamiliar face.\nCha Eui-jae glanced at Kkokko, who was quietly nestled in the box. Kkokko that suddenly appeared at the door. A hiker who appeared like a ghost once Kkokko was brought inside. So perhaps this hiker...\n\"Bawk.\"\nKkokko stretched its neck a bit more. The keen intuition that had saved Cha Eui-jae's life several times crawled up his neck. Swiftly, Cha Eui-jae placed Kkokko on the table and locked the door.\nClick. A peculiar standoff unfolded with just a door between them. The hiker pushed up their sunglasses with a hand holding a hiking stick.\n\"Excuse me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Can I ask you something?\"\nGripping the ladle tighter, Cha Eui-jae quickly responded.\n\"I don't believe in it.\"\n\"I'm not a cultist. I'm not here to convert you. I'm non-religious.\"\n\"We don't buy water purifiers, newspapers, or hexagonal water.\"\n\"I'm not a salesperson. I'm not part of a pyramid scheme. I just need to ask you something.\"\n\"Sorry, but we're closed.\"\n\"Please, just listen. I urgently need to find something. If I don't, I'll die.\"\n\"...\"\nA flash of lightning struck. The mention of death made his plea even more persuasive. The hiker's sunglasses gleamed white. Shortly after, a low rumble of thunder followed. Raindrops began to fall, one by one.\nAnd Cha Eui-jae saw it.\n'Oh, fuck.'\n\"Have you seen...\"\nThe hiker, drawing out his words, took an egg from his pocket, peeled it, and pulled down his mask. His exposed lower face looked disturbingly familiar. He took a bite of the boiled egg. Skillfully, he ate only the white, revealing the round, well-cooked yellow yolk.\nLightning struck again. Behind the sunglasses, his eyes with rotating golden patterns flashed brightly.\n\"A round, pretty magic stone, like this yolk.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 83: Life is Like a Boomerang\nCha Eui-jae looked at the rapidly rotating golden patterns and asked himself,\n'How can every hunter I meet be a weirdo?'\nIn the past, there weren't so many hunters with such distinctive personalities. It was natural, as survival was the most important thing back then.\nBut in today's Great Hunter Era, hunters without personality cannot survive! The meaning of 'survival' that hunters pursue has completely changed. And no matter how much he thought about it, the personality that made Hong Ye-seong so famous in this era wasn't about crafting...\n'Anyway, this guy is definitely a nutjob...'\nThe madness was obvious. Flash, lightning struck behind Hong Ye-seong's head once more.\nSuddenly, rain began to pour down. Hong Ye-seong, not caring whether his body got wet, extended only the hand holding a boiled egg under the eaves. It seemed his obsession with magic stones was so intense that he cherished even things that looked similar. Cha Eui-jae gripped the ladle in his hand tightly.\n'Should I report him to Jung Bin?'\nNo. He quickly dismissed the sweet temptation. Calling Jung Bin would be like burning down the entire house to catch a flea. What if Hong Ye-seong, who was in a bad mood, told Jung Bin that Cha Eui-jae had magic stones and suspicious weapons in his inventory?\nBesides, there was no guarantee that physical memory erasure would work properly, and\n'Cleaning up afterwards would be difficult.'\nHe couldn't predict what this peculiar mentality of his might do next. Cha Eui-jae glanced sideways at Hong Ye-seong. He was still holding out the yolk towards him. It seemed he would keep doing that until the door was opened.\n\"Tsk.\"\nConsidering Hong Ye-seong's bizarre obsession, it was obvious he would keep coming back until he got the magic stone. It was better to just hand it over quickly and send him away. That was the original deal anyway. Cha Eui-jae sighed and slowly opened the door.\nLike a secret agent, Hong Ye-seong lowered his body, stuck to the wall, and sensitively scanned his surroundings before quickly scuttling into the shop. Only after checking the safety inside did he take a seat in a corner. Cha Eui-jae wondered how long he would keep up this ridiculous act as he watched him.\n\"Bawk.\"\nKkokko called Cha Eui-jae. When he glanced over, Kkokko pointed at the crouched Hong Ye-seong with his head and clucked again. It seemed he wanted to be taken to his owner. Cha Eui-jae picked up the box with Kkokko inside and approached the uninvited guest.\n\"Excuse me.\"\n\"Oh, Kkokko. You were safe!\"\n\"Bawk.\"\nHong Ye-seong stretched out both hands. Just before his hands touched the box, Cha Eui-jae lifted Kkokko over his head. It was pointless to feign ignorance in front of the Eyes of Appraisal, so he didn't hesitate.\n\"Bawk?\"\nIgnoring the puzzled cluck of Kkokko, Cha Eui-jae spoke coldly.\n\"Before the father-son reunion, let's have a little chat.\"\n\"Kkokko!\"\n\"If you want to see Kkokko again, you'll have to answer my questions properly.\"\n\"Damn, you cruel bastard!\"\nHong Ye-seong started his dramatic performance again. Cha Eui-jae looked down coldly at Hong Ye-seong, who was dutifully playing the role of the troubled father. In this scene, Cha Eui-jae seemed to play the role of the evil employee preventing the father-son reunion. But this time, he wasn't going to let it slide easily.\n\"How did you find this place?\"\nEven if he was going to hand over the item, he needed to confirm this. Judging by the yolk, it seemed he came here looking for the magic stone, but it was a mystery how he found the hangover soup restaurant directly. It was only natural to search for Pado Guild first to find Kim Secretary. Cha Eui-jae squinted his eyes.\n\"Did you put a tracker on me?\"\n\"Huh? No way.\"\nHe could see the eyes blinking under the sunglasses. Hong Ye-seong lowered his mask and replied.\n\"But the idea of a tracker is good. I should make one.\"\n\"Answer.\"\n\"Well... You have it right now.\"\nHave it? Cha Eui-jae quickly lifted his head. Simultaneously, Kkokko, who was wriggling inside the Bacchus box, stuck his head out and looked down. Facing Kkokko's unreadable black eyes, Cha Eui-jae muttered.\n\"...Does this thing have a tracking function?\"\n\"Not exactly, but maybe because it's made from a monster magic stone that absorbs memories? It remembers and finds people really well. We're connected by soul, so we communicate well too. It's impressive that it found you in this vast Seoul. Good job, Kkokko!\"\n\"Bawk!\"\nKkokko crowed loudly. Right, I did carry Kkokko around during the Artisan Exhibition... It was his fault for not imagining this half-grown chicken could find people.\nCha Eui-jae slowly placed the box with Kkokko on the floor. Kkokko immediately sprang out and charged towards Hong Ye-seong. And then,\nSmack! He slapped him with his ceramic wing.\n\"Ow!\"\nHong Ye-seong clutched his cheek and collapsed pathetically. Damn, that felt good. Cha Eui-jae subtly covered his mouth with his hand to hide his rising smile.\n\"Kkokko, why?\"\n\"Bawk!\"\nKkokko wailed, looking at the boiled egg that had fallen to the floor. Ah. Both Hong Ye-seong and Cha Eui-jae sighed at the same time.\nCha Eui-jae quickly picked up Kkokko and covered his small head with his hand. He recalled seeing something similar in an experimental TV program before. Chickens fall asleep if you cover their eyes.\n\"...\"\nIndeed, it worked like magic. Kkokko, who had been crowing like a siren, soon calmed down. Hong Ye-seong exclaimed in admiration.\n\"Oh, it's sleeping.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae glared at him, Hong Ye-seong quickly picked up the boiled egg from the floor and put it in his pocket. Then he looked up at Cha Eui-jae and asked,\n\"But, Secretary, do you have a side job? Why are you at a hangover soup restaurant?\"\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\"Wow, you work hard. You're a model of society! Impressive.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae answered calmly, Hong Ye-seong gave him a thumbs up. Falling for such words, this guy really was an idiot, despite his awakened abilities.\nFacing an idiot made Cha Eui-jae's mind work quickly. Did Hong Ye-seong really escape the Awakened Management Bureau properly? Cha Eui-jae quickly locked the door and turned off all the lights in the shop. Then he asked in a low voice,\n\"...But weren't you captured back then? Assuming you found this place thanks to Kkokko, how did you shake off the Management Bureau?\"\nAnd as he finished speaking, Cha Eui-jae instinctively knew.\n'Ah, I messed up.'\nHong Ye-seong's chest puffed up like a chicken inflating its body.\n\"Ah, you're curious about my escape?\"\nHis voice was full of pride. 'No, I'm not.' Cha Eui-jae quickly shook his head, but Hong Ye-seong sighed deeply, holding his forehead.\n\"A lot happened. Listen up.\"\n***\nOn the day Hong Ye-seong was transported like a yellow checkered kimbap in a car.\nOriginally, he was supposed to be transferred directly to Bukhansan, but since he planned to enjoy the secular world a bit before entering the mountain, the preparations at Jang-in Village were not complete. Thanks to that, Hong Ye-seong was elegantly confined in a hotel suite.\nHowever, despite staying in a nice room, he felt empty inside. A security guard approached the wistful Hong Ye-seong and cautiously asked,\n\"Hong Ye-seong-ssi, do you need anything?\"\n\"Magic stone.\"\nThe guard gave him a look that said \"Not this again\" but maintained a serious tone and tried to comfort him.\n\"We're looking for it diligently.\"\nDiligently. They always said diligently! Hong Ye-seong shouted and struggled. In this harsh society, nothing gets done with just enthusiasm. Because of this, he came to despise the adverb \"diligently.\"\nAnyway, from the first day of confinement, Hong Ye-seong started to suffer mentally, saying the yolk of the fried egg from breakfast looked like a magic stone. Then, he wailed seeing a TV drama actress wearing a yellow floral dress, saying it looked like a magic stone.\nThe guards, who had to stick close and witness all this, were going crazy. It was as if Hong Ye-seong had gained a new mental attack skill.\nThings got so bad that the Management Bureau brought in a hunter-specialized psychiatrist to counsel Hong Ye-seong, but even the doctor shook his head and left. Hong Ye-seong was growing mentally weaker day by day.\nIt was bearable when he had no idea where the magic stone was. But knowing its location and seeing it in person made it unbearable. The actual magic stone he saw was more resplendent, radiant, round, and beautiful than anything he had seen before. Hong Ye-seong hugged Kkokko and cried,\n\"Magic stooone—!\"\n\"We're looking for it diligently.\"\nIt was like a broken record. By the time every jewel in the chandelier on the hotel ceiling looked like a magic stone, Hong Ye-seong decided to escape. After all, the biggest obstacle, Jung Bin, wasn't here!\nHalf-listening to his heroic tale, Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened.\n\"Jung Bin wasn't there?\"\n\"Huh? No.\"\nHong Ye-seong answered casually while munching on a rice cake he had pulled out from somewhere.\n\"Ever since the Artisan Exhibition, I haven't seen him. Ah, I did get a message. He said he had something urgent to deal with along with Sa-young.\"\nGood thing I didn't use the memory-erasing technique. This crazy guy knew all sorts of high-level information that wasn't even circulating in the Pado Guild's blind posts. Now that it had come to this, I had to extract everything from him. Cha Eui-jae asked calmly.\n\"Sa-young... what about him? Is he okay?\"\n\"Huh? You don't know?\"\n\"Ah...\"\nCha Eui-jae recalled the blind post he saw earlier that day. Nice. He shamelessly but with a tone full of concern muttered.\n\"The Guild Leader hasn't come to the office since the Artisan Exhibition. He's been issuing orders via email to the secretary team, so everyone is curious about what he's doing.\"\n\"Oh, I see. Well, that makes sense.\"\nFortunately, Hong Ye-seong seemed to accept this explanation. He replied while rubbing his swollen cheek with a new boiled egg.\n\"It's nothing major. They said they're going into some dungeon. Something related to the apocalypse? ...Yeah, that's what it was. They said they found a clue or something.\"\n\"...\"\nThe apocalypse. It was too big a story to dismiss lightly. Cha Eui-jae widened his eyes and was about to ask more when,\nKnock knock, an unexpected knocking sound interrupted him. Hong Ye-seong clamped his hands over his mouth and crouched in a corner. Cha Eui-jae also stood in front of him, holding a ladle, as if to shield him. The hangover soup restaurant was filled with sharp tension.

      "content": "Chapter 84: Life is Like a Boomerang\n\"Excuse me, is anyone inside?\"\nKnock knock knock. The sound of knocking echoed through the quiet hangover soup restaurant. Along with it came a small but clear mutter.\n\"Are they asleep...\"\nHe could tell just from the voice. It was Yoon Ga-eul, the one who had shown him the world within the fragments. If it weren't for this situation, she would have been a welcome guest... Cha Eui-jae glanced at the corner. Hong Ye-seong was lying on the floor, his head raised and listening intently. He looked like a lizard surveying its surroundings.\n'Of all times, this guy had to be here...'\nCha Eui-jae met Hong Ye-seong's eyes and mouthed silently.\n\"Do you know her?\"\nHong Ye-seong nodded seriously with a grave expression. Cha Eui-jae stifled a sigh and twisted his lips. Damn it, do rankers get together periodically for meals or something?\n'How do they all know each other, damn it.'\nThere was another hesitant knock. Knock knock. Hong Ye-seong, who had extended his neck, asked in a low voice.\n\"No matter how I see it, it doesn't seem like they're looking for me. Do you know that person, Secretary?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Come on, tell me.\"\n\"It's a secret.\"\n\"Oh, how unfair. Just dodging the question.\"\nAs Hong Ye-seong whispered like a protester chanting slogans, Cha Eui-jae pointed his thumb at the door as if to show off.\n\"Can I open the door?\"\nHong Ye-seong pressed himself even closer to the floor, perhaps to hide himself. But his bright blue, rain-soaked hiking clothes made it quite ineffective.\n\"They might have come to find me after getting contacted by the surveillance department. Let me think for a moment.\"\n\"You just said it didn't seem like they were looking for you.\"\n\"You should always keep possibilities open.\"\nCome to think of it, didn't this guy have a secret space with a grand tiled house and a palanquin? Why wasn't he hiding there instead of squirming on the ground? Cha Eui-jae crossed his arms and asked.\n\"Can't you go to the place where you kidnapped me? That tiled house.\"\n\"Not now. It's a very delicate space, so it needs some repair time after each use.\"\nHong Ye-seong pulled out a silver mat and covered himself like a blanket, ignoring Cha Eui-jae's puzzled look. Surprisingly, the part of the floor covered by the mat turned into a surface that looked just like the floor. With only his head sticking out, Hong Ye-seong gestured for Cha Eui-jae to go out quickly. Cha Eui-jae trudged towards the door.\nClick. The door opened, and Yoon Ga-eul, who had been pacing outside, looked up at Cha Eui-jae. She bowed her head.\n\"Hello...\"\n\"Just a moment.\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly cut her off and put his index finger to his lips. Yoon Ga-eul shut her mouth quickly. Meanwhile, with his other hand, Cha Eui-jae typed a message on his phone's memo app.\n[There's someone else here. Please call me Secretary Kim from Pado Guild.]\nYoon Ga-eul's eyes scanned the message quickly. Then she cleared her throat.\n\"Ahem, I. I came at a very late hour. I'm sorry, Secretary Kim.\"\nYoon Ga-eul glanced up at Cha Eui-jae as if to ask if she got it right. Cha Eui-jae nodded slightly and asked.\n\"No problem. What brings you here at this hour?\"\n\"Well...\"\nHesitating, Yoon Ga-eul started typing something on her phone to show him.\n[I came to tell you something important. I only had time today.]\nIf she came at dawn, she must have seen something important... Cha Eui-jae nodded. Yoon Ga-eul began writing another message.\n[Since a few months ago, dungeons have started to appear where the environment suddenly changes. It's not a natural change but a completely different form. But from what I've heard... the changed form is very similar to the world within the fragments. Covered in white ash, and unfamiliar white monsters appear.]\nThe world within the fragments. The apocalyptic world was a familiar space covered in white ash. It was, of course, similar to the West Sea Rift that he had been constantly navigating. Cha Eui-jae clenched his fist.\n[Guild Leader Nam Woo-jin calls it dungeon erosion. He says it's like being invaded by a completely different space. Only a few rankers know about the apocalypse, and since erosion doesn't happen often, the investigation into it is being conducted secretly. I've been tasked with comparing the world within the fragments and the eroded dungeons. As I compared what I've seen with this world...]\nYoon Ga-eul pushed up her glasses.\n[As you know, the world within the fragments and this world are similar yet different. But I realized that there's a point where the two worlds started to diverge significantly.]\nHer fingers moved quickly.\n[The West Sea Rift didn't appear in the world within the fragments.]\n\"...\"\nThe West Sea Rift. Seeing that sudden word, Cha Eui-jae bit his lip. Just as Yoon Ga-eul was about to write another message,\n\"Achoo!\"\nA loud sneeze broke the silence. Yoon Ga-eul widened her eyes. Cha Eui-jae quickly turned to see who made the sound. Hong Ye-seong was scratching his nose and laughing awkwardly. Damn, he had forgotten about that guy's presence. If they kept communicating by writing, even someone as clueless as Hong Ye-seong would find it strange. Yoon Ga-eul seemed to have the same thought.\n[Who's the person inside?]\nYoon Ga-eul knows that Cha Eui-jae is J. There's no need to hide it. Cha Eui-jae quietly signaled with his eyes.\n[Hong Ye-seong.]\nYoon Ga-eul looked surprised. Well, she must have seen Jung Bin's loudspeaker too. Her fingers moved even faster.\n[Why is Ye-seong-nim here??? Jung Bin-nim was looking for him a lot before going into the dungeon...]\nCha Eui-jae mulled over Yoon Ga-eul's story. The dungeon erosion that has been occurring for several months, dungeons transforming into landscapes very similar to the apocalyptic world within the fragments. The West Sea Rift also resembles this apocalyptic world. Suddenly, a heavy thought passed through his mind.\nWhat if dungeon erosion isn't just making them similar... but actually connecting them to the same space?\nA chill ran down his spine. If that were true, then the eroded dungeons and the West Sea Rift could be connected. It might just be speculation, but...\nHe had to confirm it.\nCha Eui-jae steadied his trembling hand and quickly wrote a message.\n[Can I enter one of the eroded dungeons to see for myself? Anywhere is fine.]\nYoon Ga-eul's eyes widened, then she looked serious, crossing her arms and placing a fist against her mouth. After some thought, she nodded and showed her phone.\n[There's a recently appeared eroded dungeon in Jongno 3-ga.]\nJongno 3-ga... luckily, it was within Seoul. If he moved quickly, he could be back before the store opened. Yoon Ga-eul continued writing.\n[But sneaking into an eroded dungeon will be tricky. They are under strict control, and only authorized personnel can enter.]\n'Is that really a problem?'\nIf he knocked everyone out and ensured there were no witnesses, wouldn't that be considered stealth? As long as he had something to cover his face, it seemed doable. However, Yoon Ga-eul seemed to think otherwise. At that moment,\n\"Achoo!\"\nOnce again, Hong Ye-seong sneezed loudly. Yoon Ga-eul's face lit up with an idea.\n[Ye-seong-nim might be helpful. He learned how to handle such situations from Jung Bin-nim.]\nCha Eui-jae glanced back into the store. Hong Ye-seong, with only his head sticking out, was now interacting with Kkokko, making eye contact with the chicken.\nHim?\nNo way.\nNoticing his skepticism, Yoon Ga-eul signaled reassuringly. She then squeezed past Cha Eui-jae, who was blocking the door, and stuck her upper body into the store.\n\"Master Artisan Hong Ye-seong! Please help! It's a dungeon erosion!\"\n\"...Who is it?\"\nBefore Cha Eui-jae could stop her, Hong Ye-seong lifted his head.\n\"Who called for the Master Artisan?\"\n***\nDungeons. The mysterious spaces that began to appear sporadically after the Day of the Rift.\nThe vegetation inside dungeons is unlike anything seen on Earth, and dangerous monsters inhabit them. If the monsters inside aren't periodically culled, their numbers can increase rapidly, causing an overload. Hence, unnecessary dungeons are closed, and those with valuable by-products are managed by either the state or guilds.\nLee Min-hoon, an inspector affiliated with the Rift Management Bureau, was in charge of managing the Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon. In reality, being an inspector just meant letting in those with permission from the Pado Guild— a cushy job. He smacked his lips.\n'I thought I'd be kicked out after the ownership changed.'\nThe Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon had transitioned from state ownership to the guild. Usually, when a guild takes over, their members manage the site, but the Pado Guild claimed they didn't have the manpower, so they left the Rift Management Bureau inspectors in place. They were incredibly generous. Thanks to that, Lee Min-hoon continued to enjoy his boring yet leisurely duty.\nAt 3 a.m., he yawned as he watched his phone running an auto-hunting game. This job was great, except for being incredibly dull. Just as he wiped away a tear from his yawn, he noticed figures approaching the guard post in the distance. Who the hell comes here at 3 a.m.?\nLee Min-hoon rubbed his eyes and adjusted his cap. They kept coming closer, so it wasn't a hallucination. Eventually, the dim light revealed them.\n\"...What is that?\"\nA person in a blue hiking outfit, heavily equipped with sunglasses and a black mask, another in a white baseball cap, beige hoodie, and pajama pants, and a tall young man in a gray hoodie. It was an odd combination with no apparent commonality. They walked towards the guard post without hesitation. Lee Min-hoon hurriedly switched on the microphone.\n\"Stop right there! Identify yourselves.\"",

Instead, their pace quickened. What confidence they had! Lee Min-hoon retrieved his restraint gun from his inventory and, with his hand poised on the call bell, issued another warning.\n\"Come any closer and—\"\nBut his words were abruptly cut off as the hiker raised his hiking stick high.\n\"Attack!\"\n\"Squawk!\"\nStartled by the sharp cry of a rooster, Lee Min-hoon turned around, only to be struck hard in the face by something smooth, round, and blunt.\n\"Ugh!\"\nWith a scream, he collapsed onto his chair. The round object that had knocked Lee Min-hoon out climbed onto his body and announced the mission's completion into the microphone.\n\"Bawk.\"\nThe hiker, Hong Ye-seong, shouted triumphantly.\n\"Good job, Kkokko!\"\nTucking the stick under his arm, Hong Ye-seong pulled out a spherical device and pressed a button. The sphere split open, emitting a blue electric field that swept over the area. Sparks flew from the machinery inside the control room, and all the lights went out.\nHe rubbed his hands together with a sly grin.\n\"This is why I made this equipment. I've always wanted to try this at least once.\"\nHahaha... Hong Ye-seong laughed heartily, bending back. Yoon Ga-eul, who had slinked over to Cha Eui-jae's side, murmured.\n\"...Are we really allowed to do this? Won't the Pado Guild contact us later?\"\nCha Eui-jae responded with a vacant look.\n\"Well... I kind of expected this the moment we brought him here.\"\nHong Ye-seong had committed acts of terrorism with black powder and kidnapped people even in the Artisan Exhibition, which was filled with rankers and his own bodyguards. So, in a place with no one watching? It was obvious he'd be thrilled and running wild. And indeed, he was.\nHong Ye-seong was a troublesome enemy and a competent but still troublesome ally. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes as he watched the hiker bounce around.\nYoon Ga-eul had learned very well from Jung Bin how to handle Hong Ye-seong. The artisan, who had been wary under a mat in the corner, fearing they had come to capture him, melted at Yoon Ga-eul's praises...\n\"You're the best artisan!\"\n\"A genius!\"\n\"Truly the greatest creator!\"\nEach time she cheered, he melted, though he pretended not to. It was obvious he was smiling widely under his mask. Furthermore, the idea of sneaking into the dungeon without the guard's knowledge seemed quite appealing to him.\nHong Ye-seong, who had been listening intently to Yoon Ga-eul's story, mumbled with a sweet, melted face.\n\"My favorite movies are the 007 series and Mission Impossible.\"\nYoon Ga-eul quickly responded.\n\"If you come with us, you can be Tom Cruise, Hong Ye-seong-nim.\"\nYeah, you too can be Tom Cruise. It was the perfect hook. Already tempted by the allure of the illicit, Hong Ye-seong eagerly agreed. Thanks to recruiting the best Doraemon, they didn't need to call a taxi or wait for the first subway; they arrived at Jongno 3-ga with Hong Ye-seong's emergency escape paper.\n\"...Anyway, this is good for me.\"\nIf Cha Eui-jae had come alone, he would have spent quite some time just destroying the surveillance cameras one by one. Is this why protagonists always travel with companions? As he was lost in thought, Kkokko returned leisurely with a card in its beak. It was the guard's ID card.\nThe passage leading to the entrance of the Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon was firmly blocked by a thick, heavy iron door. When Yoon Ga-eul swiped the ID card on the machine installed next to the door, the door slowly creaked open with a heavy noise.\nAt the end of the dark tunnel, the entrance to the dungeon flickered with a blue light. Yoon Ga-eul took a deep breath.\n\"We'll just look around the areas near the entrance where the erosion is progressing and then come right out. Got it?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Let's go! I've always wanted to see an eroded dungeon with my own eyes.\"\nHong Ye-seong was excited, so that was fine, but Yoon Ga-eul looked visibly tense. She kept wiping the sweat off her palms. Cha Eui-jae, who was staring at the swirling entrance, quietly asked.\n\"Is this your first time entering a dungeon?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, no. I went in once during training at the national security academy... But this is my first time going in for real.\"\nYoon Ga-eul rubbed the back of her neck and muttered awkwardly.\n\"Jung Bin-nim and others took great care of me. They told me to study as a student... and that I could enter dungeons after becoming an adult. They also said I should reveal that I'm an S-grade hunter after becoming an adult.\"\nWith Kkokko perched on his head, Hong Ye-seong nodded seriously.\n\"Right, why would a kid enter a dungeon? They should be busy playing.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Kids shouldn't fight.\"\nFor some reason, a feeling of nausea welled up. A world where minors are protected as a matter of course. Yes, things are different now. Cha Eui-jae roughly rubbed his face. Hong Ye-seong continued babbling.\n\"But are there monsters inside?\"\n\"Yes, probably.\"\n\"Oh, should we prepare to run?\"\n\"If possible, yes.\"\nListening to the idle chatter, the nausea disappeared. Good. It seems the fighting will be my responsibility. It might even be better to go in alone.\nAs he alternated between looking at Yoon Ga-eul's determined face and Hong Ye-seong's carefree face, Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath. At that moment, Hong Ye-seong, who had been deep in thought, looked back at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"By the way, Secretary, are you good at fighting?\"\n\"...As much as necessary.\"\n\"Oh, what weapon do you use? A sword?\"\nAlthough his main weapon was a spear... he couldn't say that outright. Besides, he used various weapons. He even used a green onion as a weapon. Cha Eui-jae answered indifferently.\n\"Anything.\"\nHong Ye-seong started to pout, seemingly about to complain. Cha Eui-jae quickly added an explanation, hoping for understanding.\n\"I use whatever I can get my hands on. It really doesn't matter.\"\n\"Hmm, I see... Actually, that's better.\"\nHong Ye-seong rubbed his chin and started pulling out various weapons from his inventory. Thud, thud, precious weapons were thrown haphazardly onto the hard concrete floor. Yoon Ga-eul was appalled.\n\"Is it okay to just throw those on the ground?\"\n\"It's fine, it's fine. I can sharpen them later. Take your pick, Secretary. Do you see anything you like?\"\nJust a glance revealed weapons of such high quality that any hunter would covet them. It was curious why he hadn't displayed these at the Artisan Exhibition. Cha Eui-jae passed over the dazzlingly bright hammers, huge swords, and bows, grabbing a long, slender pole.\n\"This will do.\"\n\"Huh, there are better weapons.\"\n\"This one feels the most comfortable. By the way, Hong Ye-seong-ssi, can you fight?\"\n\"Hmm? I've got Kkokko, don't I?\"\n\"Bawk!\"\nKkokko raised one wing and cried out. Relying on such a small, cute, half-grown chicken for battle? And hiding behind it himself? Hong Ye-seong squinted his eyes, observing Cha Eui-jae's face.\n\"What? Are you looking down on me? I should show you how well Kkokko can fight.\"\n\"...Ah, okay.\"\n\"Show them, Kkokko!\"\nHong Ye-seong, who had been wearing sunglasses on his forehead, put them back on and pointed ahead.\n\"Kkokko, fire!\"\n\"Cluck, cluck, cluck...\"\nKkokko, who had been gaping its beak, let out a loud cry.\n\"Cluck-a-doodle-doo!\"\nWhoosh! A bright blue flame spewed from its open beak. Kkokko puffed out its chest proudly, though it didn't actually inflate.\nNext to them, Yoon Ga-eul muttered.\n\"It's a fire chicken...\"\nCha Eui-jae prepared to enter the dungeon, eyeing Hong Ye-seong with a mix of reluctance and resignation. He now had to protect not only Yoon Ga-eul but also Hong Ye-seong. Noted.\nAt that moment, a white system window appeared before his eyes. Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened.\n[You have met the conditions to unlock a title.]\n[Achievement conditions: Re-entry into ∎∎]\n[The locked title has been unlocked.]\n[Title: ∎∎∎ ∎∎∎]\nRumble, the ground beneath him shook. Cha Eui-jae grabbed the arms of Hong Ye-seong and Yoon Ga-eul, who were about to lose their balance. Broken buildings began to rise from the ash-covered ground. Cracks started forming in the white sky. And—\n[Congratulations on unlocking your title, J!]\n[Your title is Conqueror of Solitude.]\n[The dungeon responds to the title!]\n[The dungeon is being restructured!]\nBoom!\nA massive bolt of lightning struck. Everything turned white before his eyes. As the sensation of the arms he held began to fade, Cha Eui-jae clenched his empty hand.\n***\nSwoooosh...\nWhite ash scattered in the slow breeze. The man rummaging through the debris with a long stick shook his head roughly. When he looked up, a white vortex was swirling in the pale sky. Since the Day of the Rift, the black hole that had become common in the sky inside the dungeon was nowhere to be seen.\nSo what was that thing occupying the sky?\nSteady footsteps approached. Jung Bin brushed off the white ash that had settled on his shoulder as he came closer.\n\"Have you found anything, Lee Sa-young-ssi?\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Sa-young replied indifferently, looking around. Just as Jung Bin nodded and started to speak, Lee Sa-young suddenly turned his head. It was towards the entrance they had come through. Following his gaze, Jung Bin asked with a puzzled look.\n\"Why, what's the matter?\"\n\"...Jung Bin.\"\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\"Did you call for additional support?\"\n\"No. The investigation of this eroded Dungeon is being conducted solely by you and me.\"\nLee Sa-young's sharp, violet eyes stared into the distance. He murmured.\n\"...Someone's here.\"\nJung Bin's expression changed too. And as if to confirm Lee Sa-young's words, a rumble began...\nThe ground started to shake.",

      "content": "Chapter 86: Life is Like a Boomerang\nThe faint tremor that only sensitive people could feel gradually intensified until it began to shake the debris around them. The previously still air was now in turmoil. Jung Bin, frowning, drew out his black suppression rod.\n\"What on earth is happening all of a sudden...\"\nLee Sa-young took off his gas mask.\n\"Jung Bin, has there ever been a sudden change in an erosion dungeon?\"\n\"There haven't been any reported cases. This type of dungeon is still under investigation, so anything could happen, but...\"\n\"...\"\n\"There must be a cause. Sudden changes like this don't happen without someone touching or discovering something.\"\n\"...I agree with that.\"\nLee Sa-young sighed irritably. At that moment, there was a cracking sound, and a black crack appeared in the pale sky. Lee Sa-young and Jung Bin simultaneously looked up at the sky.\nA white system window appeared in front of them.\n[The dungeon reacts to the title!]\n[The dungeon is being restructured!]\n\"...What?\"\nBang! A loud thunderclap rumbled as if the sky was about to collapse. Thud, the ground they stood on began to heave. Even the two S-grades, who had maintained their balance until now, staggered. A powerful unknown force was sweeping them away. Jung Bin reached out to Lee Sa-young...\nBut he couldn't reach him.\nWho knows how much time passed.\nJung Bin slowly opened his eyes. Blink, blink. As he struggled to move his heavy eyelids, his vision finally focused on the white dirt floor.\nThe floor? He moved his arm and sat up. He must have lost consciousness while lying on the floor. Despite being able to endure considerable pain, Jung Bin furrowed his brow at the throbbing pain in his body.\n\"...Ugh.\"\nHe let out a short groan and finally managed to stand up. His last memory was... dungeon restructuring. But what exactly is dungeon restructuring? He had never heard of such a phenomenon. Could an already opened dungeon be restructured?\n'First, I need to regroup with Lee Sa-young...'\nMoving alone in an unknown dungeon is suicidal. As Jung Bin turned his head, he heard a small groan. Could it be Lee Sa-young? Jung Bin quickly turned towards the source of the sound.\nBut instead of Lee Sa-young, there was...\n\"Ugh... I'm dying... Damn it... What the hell is this?\"\nA hiker in bright blue hiking clothes was lying face down on the ground, muttering like a zombie. Next to him, a woman in sleep pants was on the floor, dry-heaving. And a round, dumb-looking chicken was clucking around them. Their appearance seemed familiar, so much so that Jung Bin, unusually, opened his mouth in astonishment.\n\"...Hong Ye-seong? Yoon Ga-eul?\"\n\"...Hey, kid. Am I in hell? Why do I hear Jung Bin's voice?\"\n\"U-ugh...\"\n\"Yeah. Does it feel like hell to you? I think so too...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Cluck-cluck!\"\nThe ceramic chicken crowed loudly as it made eye contact with Jung Bin. Jung Bin could only stare dumbfounded at the unbelievable scene.\n***\nJ took a deep breath with his eyes closed. The familiar air filled his lungs. The air in the Rift was silent, tasteless, and scentless, even though there were corpses and blood everywhere. Thanks to this, the bodies inside the Rift didn't decompose.\nThat's fortunate, J thought. It made it easier to find them among the undecomposed bodies.\nJ began to move his body, starting from his fingertips, checking for any injuries. In the Rift, where monsters could appear at any moment, he could only trust his own body. People die, weapons deteriorate. Blood, fat, and oil dull even the sharpest blades...\nOnly after ensuring everything was fine, J opened his eyes, ready to face hell once again.\nBut...\nWhat came into view wasn't the crimson-blood-stained ruins.\n\"...What?\"\nJ looked around with a puzzled expression. There were no piles of bodies or monsters. Instead, white ash was piled high on the collapsed buildings and debris. Urgently surveying his unfamiliar surroundings, he noticed a slightly dented white baseball cap lying alone.\nHe definitely remembered seeing that item. That...\n'...Wasn't Yoon Ga-eul wearing that?'\nAnd the long, sturdy pole lying next to it.\n'That belonged to Hong Ye-seong.'\nAh. Letting out a short exclamation, Cha Eui-jae abruptly stood up, his stomach churning incessantly. Damn it. Cha Eui-jae clutched his chest, trying to steady his breathing.\nThis wasn't inside the West Sea rift. Cha Eui-jae quickly sorted through his jumbled memories. The system alert had announced their entry into the Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon along with Yoon Ga-eul and Hong Ye-seong. After unlocking a title... the system window turned white, announcing the dungeon's restructuring. He clearly remembered the sensation of the lightning striking down and the grip on his companion's arm vanishing before he could grasp the situation.\nCha Eui-jae picked up the baseball cap and pole. There was no sign of their owners, presumably swept away during the dungeon's restructuring.\n'Where are Yoon Ga-eul and Hong Ye-seong?'\nThere was no sign of any humans around. Biting his lip, Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes tightly and then opened them.\nHis azure-blue eyes quickly scanned the surroundings. Monsters, monsters, monsters, monsters... Amidst the countless monsters, a burning light stood out. Violet flames. Cha Eui-jae knew their owner.\nLee Sa-young.\n'Why is he here?'\nBefore the question could fully form, his feet were already moving. Cha Eui-jae began to run, kicking up the white ash. The scenery of ruins and numerous lights flickered past his glowing blue eyes. Monsters, monsters, monsters. The restructured dungeon was teeming with monsters, the same ones he had grown sick of seeing in the West Sea rift.\nScreech!\nWith a shriek, a monster roaming nearby lunged at him. Without stopping, Cha Eui-jae jumped and impaled the monster's head with the pole. Thud! Instead of blood, white ash spewed from the monster's head.\nQuick and concise actions, conserving energy and maximizing efficiency.\nAlthough not as proficient as Lee Sa-young, there were four significant lights gathered. Two must be Yoon Ga-eul and Hong Ye-seong, and if Lee Sa-young was here, it meant... unfortunately, they had entered the dungeon where Lee Sa-young and Jung Bin had already arrived as the advance party. The other bright light near Yoon Ga-eul should be Jung Bin, presumably. The warm, golden aura was unique to Jung Bin. The other one was unknown. But before further thoughts could form, the sight of Lee Sa-young's flame grabbed his attention.\nWhile he couldn't be certain without seeing it himself, his keen instincts, his feet on the ground, his running body— everything about Cha Eui-jae was telling him.\n'I need to get to Sa-young.'\nHe didn't know why. Cha Eui-jae swung his pole at the approaching monsters, smashing their heads like tofu. The familiar, dull impact and the vibration of the pole kept him breathing. Cha Eui-jae stopped thinking, following his instincts and running.\n***\nAmidst the suddenly tangled dungeon and the unfamiliar ruins rising from the ground, Lee Sa-young, while incinerating monsters and surveying the surroundings, settled in a relatively intact part of the ruins. The space covered in white ash evoked a strange discomfort that he didn't want to see anymore. Lee Sa-young leaned against the wall and took a short breath. He couldn't contain the rising irritation.\n'Jung Bin will find his way here on his own, damn it...'\nNothing was to his liking. Just because of a fainting spell, Jung Bin had taken him to Nam Woo-jin, and since then, Lee Sa-young hadn't been able to handle any other matters and had to tour the erosion dungeons.\n'I didn't want to owe anyone...'\nNam Woo-jin, obsessed with observing the world's origin, would dig up anything once he got a clue. Even Seowon guild members had been deployed for the investigation, but places they couldn't go had to be handled by Jung Bin or Lee Sa-young. That was the contract they had made. He needed to finish quickly and go back.\nJust as Lee Sa-young clenched his fist anxiously, a fiercely sharp and intense energy was rapidly approaching. Carefully, he moved to the opening connecting to the outside.\nLee Sa-young's eyes widened. Amidst the snow-like swirling white ash, something gray was running straight towards him. Could it be? Despite thinking it couldn't be true, his pounding heart was uncontrollable. But why would he be here? This was a dungeon. Questions and confusion swirled.\nYet, Lee Sa-young called his name.\n\"...Cha Eui-jae.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young!\"\nThe voice responding to him pierced his ears like a bolt of lightning. Lee Sa-young could only watch blankly as Cha Eui-jae, scattering white ash, ran towards him.\n\"You...\"\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"Ah.\"\n\"No, it's alright. It's me.\"\nCha Eui-jae, bursting through the ruins, suddenly threw down the pole he was holding. His strong hand grabbed Lee Sa-young's cheek, turning his head this way and that. Lee Sa-young, unable to even think of pushing his hand away, simply stared at Cha Eui-jae's face.\nGasping for breath, a face pale as death, and eyes glowing like the ocean. He couldn't take his eyes off those blue eyes. Countless thoughts crashed like waves.\nWhy are you here?\nHow did you get in here?\nDo you know what kind of place this is?\nWho are you to ask if I'm okay?\nHowever,\n\"You shit... why are you in a dungeon when just recently you passed out? Are you crazy?\"\nThe hand cupping his face was so warm, and the voice asking if he was okay was so... familiar.\nThe warmth of the hand on his face and the familiar voice asking if he was okay sent an inexplicable shiver through Lee Sa-young's body. He couldn't help but tremble. Words he wanted to say kept rising to his throat, only to sink back down. It felt as if he were being tempered in molten lava, his entire body burning. Lee Sa-young's mouth moved soundlessly, wanting to say so much but unable to form the words. From the tangled mess of thoughts that had been buried for so long, one clear emotion emerged.\nJoy.\nHe had found him.\nLee Sa-young opened his mouth to speak. But at that moment, a firm hand covered his lips. Lee Sa-young's eyes widened once again. The person he had been searching for was not looking at him. Those sharp eyes were focused on the ruins outside.\n\"...Stay quiet.\"\nHe...\n\"...\"\n\"It's okay, just stay quiet.\"\nThud, thud, thud.\nEnormous footsteps filled the ruins.",

      "content": "Chapter 87: Life is Like a Boomerang\nPowder fell from the precariously stacked objects that had been displaced. The enormous footsteps that shook everything around them paused briefly nearby before slowly moving away.\nThud... Thud... Thud... Until the sound completely disappeared, Cha Eui-jae stared out at the pale, chilly daylight beyond the ruins. A quietly refined sense of lethality lingered in the air.\nA face he had never seen before.\nLee Sa-young tapped his hand with his fingers. Cha Eui-jae's gaze, which had been focused outside, shifted to him. It was only then that Cha Eui-jae seemed to realize he had been covering Lee Sa-young's mouth. Carefully removing his hand, he mouthed a silent question with a softened expression.\n'What's wrong?'\nLee Sa-young spoke out loud.\n\"Don't go.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Stay here.\"\nCha Eui-jae remained silent. He listened outside the ruins for a moment before springing to his feet. Then, he smiled at Lee Sa-young, the same smile he had shown once in the Guild Leader's office.\n\"It's okay, it won't take long.\"\nHe bent down to grab the pole he had thrown aside. Normally, he would have made an effort to conceal his intentions, saying he was just going to look around or get some fresh air, knowing no one would believe him.\nLee Sa-young quietly observed Cha Eui-jae. At a glance, he appeared unbelievably calm for someone inside a dungeon.\nHowever, the cold sweat running down his temples, his pale complexion, and his overly tight grip on the pole, turning his fingertips white, told a different story. Physiological reactions couldn't be hidden by controlling facial expressions alone.\n\"...\"\nHe was afraid.\nOf what?\nTheir eyes met again. Cha Eui-jae smiled once more.\n\"Really, it's fine. I'll be back soon.\"\nThat smile, Lee Sa-young really disliked it.\nCha Eui-jae's baseless confidence and his tendency to rush headlong into things likely had a reason. People around him must have encouraged him, calling him a hero and saying he had to save everyone because he was strong. And the more recklessly he acted, the more they must have liked it. It made him easier to handle.\nLee Sa-young gently tugged on the hem of Cha Eui-jae's gray robe. Though the force wasn't strong, Cha Eui-jae didn't ignore it and turned to Lee Sa-young. His shadowed face showed a hint of puzzlement.\nCha Eui-jae was that kind of person. He couldn't ignore a hand reaching out for help. He was someone who constantly burned himself out, never backing down even if it cost his life. If that was the case...\n\"Hyung.\"\nSomeone had to be a strong shackle to prevent him from recklessly running off. Lee Sa-young decided to become that shackle.\nA shackle solely for J, who was weak against the weak.\n***\n\"Hyung.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nCha Eui-jae answered in a low voice to Lee Sa-young's quiet call. His attention, however, was entirely on the monster that had appeared moments ago.\nIts footsteps, breathing, and cries were vividly imprinted in his memories. The monster that had just appeared was Sasquatch, the first monster J had ever defeated on the Day of the Rift.\n'Still... it's not a particularly dangerous one.'\nThe Sasquatch was a threatening monster with its massive fists, but its movements were slow due to its heavy build. Moreover, its head was covered in shaggy fur, making it slow to react and barely able to notice anything smaller than itself. If they hid their presence well, they could avoid detection by the Sasquatch with the help of Hong Ye-seong's foil blanket.\n'It might be better to kill it before it gets any closer...'\nThe dungeon had been reconstructed in response to the unlocked title, 'Conqueror of Solitude'. Cha Eui-jae looked around. The dungeon resembled the scenery of the West Sea rift so closely that it was hard to believe it was the same space. Upon regaining his senses, he had momentarily confused it with still being inside the rift.\nWas the appearance of the Sasquatch a coincidence? As his thoughts prolonged, Lee Sa-young sighed loudly and lowered his gaze, uncharacteristically.\n\"I'm in pain.\"\nFor a moment, Cha Eui-jae doubted his ears. Did Lee Sa-young really say that? But the next moment, he examined Lee Sa-young's body, wondering if Jung Bin had bound him with chains again. Fortunately or unfortunately, Lee Sa-young was unharmed.\n\"You're in pain?\"\n\"Yes... I feel dizzy.\"\nLee Sa-young mumbled, blinking his long eyelashes. Somehow, his pale face seemed even paler.\nHas he even rested properly since the Artisan Exhibition? He didn't seem to be sleeping well either. Anxiety coiled within him was slowly raising its head. Cha Eui-jae gripped the pole a little tighter until it made a creaking sound.\n\"...You did send the text saying you were okay yourself, right?\"\nIt was an unexpected question. Lee Sa-young stared at Cha Eui-jae for a moment before answering.\n\"Yes, I did... Why?\"\nIt was a relief. Maybe his worry was unfounded. Cha Eui-jae quickly looked Lee Sa-young up and down.\n\"Didn't you get treatment from the Seowon Guild? Jung Bin took you there.\"\nLee Sa-young nodded slowly.\n\"I did, but maybe it's because the dungeon was restructured...\"\nHe trailed off lazily, leaning his head against the wall.\n\"If I rest a bit, I'll be fine. Let's move together in a while... You need to get out of here too.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And... we need to find Jung Bin.\"\n\"...Jung Bin? He's here too?\"\nCha Eui-jae feigned ignorance. Lee Sa-young nodded slightly. Thank goodness. The light he had seen earlier must have been Jung Bin. That meant they had a bit more time to wait for Lee Sa-young to recover. Jung Bin could be trusted. He could handle the Sasquatch too.\nCha Eui-jae sat down beside Lee Sa-young, clutching his pole, keeping a distance of about a head. He looked beyond the ruins and murmured.\n\"Sorry, but I can't wait too long. If it takes too long, I'll carry you and move.\"\n\"Okay...\"\nLee Sa-young replied softly, leaning his head slightly towards Cha Eui-jae.\n\"But... you know, Hyung.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"It's a bit strange.\"\n\"What is?\"\n\"How did you come here... for what reason?\"\n\"...\"\n\"This dungeon doesn't just open its doors for a hunter's license.\"\n'Damn it.'\nCha Eui-jae grimaced. Lee Sa-young was annoyingly perceptive. It was a common question he should have anticipated, but he had been too focused on rushing here to think of an answer. Even if he had thought about it, he wouldn't have come up with a plausible excuse. What reason would an ordinary awakened have to enter an invasive dungeon?\nMoreover, this dungeon... Cha Eui-jae recalled.\n'Wasn't it under the Pado Guild's control?'\nThis was a complete mess. Cha Eui-jae mentally prepared himself. If you don't know the answer, you have to improvise, but Lee Sa-young's questions were like essay questions, impossible to guess.\nThe tension on his face turned into a disgruntled look. Avoiding Lee Sa-young's gaze, which was examining his face, Cha Eui-jae mumbled.\n\"Well, you know.\"\n\"Even if the dungeon inspector isn't from our guild, they wouldn't have managed it carelessly with their work history...\"\nThat inspector was probably knocked out cold by Kkokko's hit. Sorry, Mr. inspector. Cha Eui-jae turned his head slightly to count the cracks in the fractured wall. As Cha Eui-jae remained silent, Lee Sa-young pressed further.\n\"A busy person running a restaurant coming into a dungeon like this... for what reason... Hyung, do you know?\"\n\"...The restaurant's been slow lately.\"\nCha Eui-jae's brief defense wasn't a good choice. Lee Sa-young, who had closed his eyes, smiled mockingly.\n\"Oh, really? I thought maybe you came to mine magic stones, since you couldn't get your pay being a secretary...\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, now with his eyes open, calmly observed Cha Eui-jae's face. His purple eyes, devoid of light, scrutinized Cha Eui-jae's sullen face.\n\"Hyung is really...\"\nHis eyes were not normal. Soon, he would probably say something like, \"Are you crazy?\" or \"Are you an idiot?\" As Cha Eui-jae braced himself for the inevitable mockery, Lee Sa-young sighed and murmured.\n\"Who did you come here with?\"\n'Oh, come on.'\nLee Sa-young had a knack for asking the most aggravating questions, ones he couldn't answer. Wasn't this his fault? Even if he wanted to answer properly, every question Lee Sa-young asked prodded at his sore spots, making it impossible to respond clearly.\nCha Eui-jae silently stared at the floor marked with numerous white footprints. Soon, a cold, firm body slowly leaned against him. Soft hair tickled his ear.\nAs Cha Eui-jae straightened up, a soft voice whispered.\n\"There's no way Nam Woo-jin would come here himself... that guy's a library ghost.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Did he ask you? To investigate here?\"\nLee Sa-young was completely off the mark. Cha Eui-jae was about to snap back with something like, \"Cut the crap.\"\nWhen suddenly, white screens appeared one after another in front of his eyes.\n[...System check complete...]\n[Dungeon restructuring complete.]\n[A new grade has been assigned to the dungeon.]\n[The new grade for the Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon is S+ grade.]",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Life is Like a Boomerang\n[The new grade for the Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon is S+ grade.]\n\"S+ grade?\"\nThe priority levels for rifts, which require high-priority strategies, are divided from grade 1 to grade 10, whereas dungeons, which are less dangerous than rifts, are classified from S to F grades. This classification was proposed by the United States. Initially, the system also used alphabetic labels for both rifts and dungeons, but the notation was changed in accordance with international law.\nUntil now, there had never been a dungeon rated higher than S-grade. People speculated that there might be an L-grade above S-grade because of the extraordinary Hong Ye-seong. In other words, even Cha Eui-jae, who had explored countless dungeons and rifts, was encountering this new grade for the first time. Cha Eui-jae quickly turned to Lee Sa-young, who would likely have more information.\nBut Lee Sa-young, squinting his eyes and staring into space, seemed equally clueless. He muttered lowly.\n\"This is a first...\"\nThe sudden change in dungeon grade upon Cha Eui-jae's entrance had happened before at the West Sea Rift; Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon was the second instance. It felt as if the dungeon was waiting for him to arrive. The anxiety gnawed at one side of his brain.\n'Because of me.'\n...No, there was no time to indulge in such feelings. Getting lost in emotions would only hinder him. Cha Eui-jae slapped his cheeks with both hands and stood up.\n\"Do you have any data on this dungeon?\"\n\"There is some, but it was taken before the dungeon was restructured. It's probably useless now.\"\nLee Sa-young frowned slightly and stared at Cha Eui-jae's face, seeming somewhat dissatisfied. He continued.\n\"Besides, with the dungeon being restructured, it's basically a completely new dungeon. We'll have to investigate.\"\n\"...\"\nAn unknown dungeon. Cha Eui-jae stared blankly at the white ash swirling outside. It was a familiar sight. Both the eroded and restructured dungeons resembled the West Sea Rift. Only J knew this fact. What was the relationship between the erosion phenomenon and the West Sea Rift? Just as Cha Eui-jae's thoughts began to sink deeper, a low, mocking voice pulled him back to consciousness.\n\"By the way.\"\nLee Sa-young twisted his lips.\n\"Do you have a masochistic hobby or something?\"\n\"What nonsense... Do you enjoy talking nonsense?\"\n\"Well, your actions make it seem that way.\"\nLee Sa-young slowly stood up and reached out, touching Cha Eui-jae's red cheek with his fingertips, then lightly rubbed the skin with his thumb, whispering.\n\"Why don't you try again? I don't usually enjoy hitting, but... I can make an exception.\"\n\"This punk, is your head screwed on straight, damn it.\"\nNo, calm down. Cha Eui-jae pulled away from the hand rubbing his cheek and collected himself. Otherwise, he might punch Lee Sa-young in the stomach. He heard Lee Sa-young whining about his wrist being grabbed but pretended not to hear. One good thing about being with Lee Sa-young is that he never stops talking, so Cha Eui-jae doesn't have time to get lost in his emotions.\n\"You're talking so much; you must be feeling better. Get ready. We need to move. We have to get back quickly.\"\n\"Well, alright.\"\nLee Sa-young responded cheerfully, tilting his head.\n\"But do we need to rush so much?\"\n\"You said you came in with Jung Bin. We need to join up with him.\"\n\"That's true, but we should also move cautiously and understand this dungeon. Jung Bin will do the same. He's not weak.\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't doubt Jung Bin's abilities. Even if it was an S+ grade dungeon, Jung Bin could hold his own for a while. The issue was Hong Ye-seong and Yoon Ga-eul, who were with him. They were innocent bystanders caught up in this, and it was uncertain if they could even protect themselves.\nBut explaining all this would only complicate matters. Cha Eui-jae hoisted his pole onto his shoulder, pretending not to notice. Lee Sa-young leaned in slightly, adding.\n\"You don't need to hide your face now. Pulling up your hood won't hide that face. Are you just going to let Jung Bin see you?\"\n\"...\"\nThe most annoying person is the one who only speaks the truth. Then, maybe they should kill the dungeon boss before meeting up with Jung Bin. Cha Eui-jae was about to share this simple solution when Lee Sa-young murmured as if he realized something.\n\"Ah... I get it now.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"That time, you rushed and got caught by the rift master, didn't you?\"\nLee Sa-young sighed deeply, shaking his head, which annoyed Cha Eui-jae. He jabbed Lee Sa-young in the waist with his pole.\n\"What's with you?\"\n\"Never mind. Let's move. We can put a gas mask on you...\"\nMumbling, Lee Sa-young stepped out of the ruins first. As Cha Eui-jae exited the ruins, Lee Sa-young held up some debris next to the entrance. Once he put it down, the shaky entrance collapsed. And as if responding to the noise, monsters appeared from all directions. Cha Eui-jae knew these monsters well. Their eyes and bodies were scorched white.\nKiyeeeek!\nAs the lead monster screeched, the others rushed forward. Cha Eui-jae swung his pole without hesitation. Boom! The monsters caught by the pole fell to one side. As Cha Eui-jae was about to strike down, something black flew towards them. A sweet scent spread. Covered in black, sticky substance, the monsters melted away without a sound. Cha Eui-jae looked to his side. Lee Sa-young, having removed his gloves, was wiggling his fingers towards them. Their eyes met. Lee Sa-young smiled brightly.\n\"From what I see... we make a pretty good team.\"\nAs Lee Sa-young said, their movements synced as if they had practiced together before. More accurately, Lee Sa-young perfectly anticipated Cha Eui-jae's movements, using his poison exactly where Cha Eui-jae's pole would stop. After several rounds of battle, the hesitation from fighting alongside someone for the first time gradually disappeared.\nA large figure covered in black poison slowly crumbled. Cha Eui-jae flicked his pole. Lee Sa-young, indifferent, observed the monster. Cha Eui-jae suddenly spoke.\n\"Hey, you.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Before awakening... were you really sick?\"\nAs soon as he spoke, he wondered if it was too sudden, but the words were already out. Besides, he felt relieved after saying it. He didn't want to see that pale, bound face again. Lee Sa-young answered without looking at him.\n\"I don't know.\"\nIt was an ambiguous answer. Did he not want to talk about it? Cha Eui-jae frowned slightly. Lee Sa-young smirked.\n\"I can hear your brain working.\"\n\"You have a talent for being rude, don't you...\"\n\"Well, I'm not going to tell you. It's a secret.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You've kept a lot from me, too.\"\nCha Eui-jae, about to retort, shut his mouth. It was true. The things he hadn't told Lee Sa-young had piled up like a snowball, following him everywhere. Lies beget lies. What would be the outcome of the lies that had piled up? Cha Eui-jae, who had lived in lies since awakening, hadn't yet seen the end of those lies.\n\"Well, it's okay. Even if you lie.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae looked up. Lee Sa-young continued calmly, hands behind his back.\n\"And you'll probably figure out my secret eventually. You should.\"\nHis purple eyes met Cha Eui-jae's. Cha Eui-jae was well-acquainted with the trust directed at him. He had received so much of it after awakening. The emotions hidden beneath the guise of trust were the same. Admiration, pity, disdain, envy, jealousy... Cha Eui-jae didn't bother to unmask the trust. He didn't want to face the hidden emotions.\nBut the trust in Lee Sa-young's gaze... held something Cha Eui-jae didn't know. Something so bright he wanted to uncover it.\n\"Geez... they never stop coming.\"\nLee Sa-young grabbed the neck of a monster charging at Cha Eui-jae. Ssss. The monster screeched and writhed before melting into a black puddle. Lee Sa-young murmured lazily.\n\"And I get why you're anxious, but... it's okay, Hyung.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There are so many S-grades in this dungeon.\"\nNo, you don't understand. That's the problem.\nCha Eui-jae looked at the blackened monster with a grim face. Currently, there are eight S-grade hunters in South Korea. And among them...\n'Is it possible for more than half of them to be in this dungeon?'\nLee Sa-young didn't know that Hong Ye-seong and Yoon Ga-eul were in this dungeon. But Cha Eui-jae knew the pain of knowing. Five out of the eight S-grades gathered in one place. Cha Eui-jae had experienced this enough times to know.\nWhen more than two S-grades gather... something big will happen!",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Coming Back\nBoom!\nA fist wrapped in black chains struck the center of a rock. The massive boulder silently crumbled from the point of impact. Jung Bin retracted his fist. Around him, a pile of stones with hollowed centers had amassed into a small hill. He unwrapped the chains and discreetly wiped away his sweat before turning around.\n\"Are you both uninjured?\"\n\"Yes. Are you alright, sir?\"\nYoon Ga-eul, who had been crouching behind the collapsed wall, peeked out her upper body. Next to her, a thumbs-up and a white wing appeared in quick succession. Jung Bin forced a smile as he approached them.\n\"I'm fine. Ga-eul, how's your dizziness?\"\n\"Oh... resting helped a lot. Thank you for your concern.\"\nYoon Ga-eul awkwardly replied, rubbing the back of her neck. Even at a glance, her complexion looked much better than when she was gagging. Jung Bin felt a sense of relief as he checked on them. Only after confirming their safety did he let out a small sigh. The situation was quite dire.\nUnsettling events kept coming one after another. It was almost laughable how chaotic things had become. Jung Bin had braced himself for the mess that was the Artisan Exhibition, and he had prepared for it. The fainting of Lee Sa-young and the urgent dungeon exploration request from Nam Woo-jin were unexpected, but he managed to handle them somehow.\nHowever, even Jung Bin couldn't have foreseen the news of Hong Ye-seong's escape. The urgent call came right after he had given all his instructions in preparation for a long absence, just before entering the underground dungeon at Jongno 3-ga. Holding his loudly ringing phone, he glanced at Lee Sa-young, who raised an eyebrow before leaning against the wall with his arms crossed and closing his eyes. Jung Bin answered the call, and then...\n—I'm sorry, Team Leader. Hong Ye-seong has escaped...\nHe was faced with an unwelcome reality. Ah, such a shock can make your vision spin! Jung Bin learned this new fact for the first time in 30 years. Listening to the sorrowful voice of the hunter in charge of security, he thought for the first time in a long while...\n'I want to run away...'\nSuch thoughts crossed his mind, despite having nowhere to run but deeper into the dungeon.\nHearing the tearful report, Lee Sa-young, who had been waiting with his eyes closed, finally spoke up in irritation.\n\"Do you have fire on your feet? Why are you pacing around so noisily...\"\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi...\"\nSensing something strange in Jung Bin's voice, Lee Sa-young opened one eye slightly. Seeing Jung Bin's lost expression, he opened both eyes wide. It was the first time Jung Bin saw such a surprised look from her. Thanks to Hong Ye-seong, he was having all sorts of new experiences.\nFortunately, Lee Sa-young proved his worth as a capable Guild Leader by delegating the task. If A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi had not gone out to track him down, they would still be searching for Hong Ye-seong, let alone exploring the dungeon. Although finding Hong Ye-seong was important...\n'I need to find the key to the apocalypse.'\nA few months ago, Yoon Ga-eul predicted the coming of the apocalypse. When and how it would come was unknown. It was a hard story to believe, especially as the world was gradually settling into a stable period after past chaos. Upon hearing the story for the first time, the director of the Awakened Management Bureau, Ham Seok-jeong, dismissed it as post-awakening aftereffects and assigned a person to Yoon Ga-eul.\nHowever, eroded dungeons began to appear one by one, backing up Yoon Ga-eul's claims, and the activities of Prometheus, which had been quiet since Lee Sa-young's awakening, suddenly became active.\nThe first erosion occurred in a dungeon owned by a guild in Incheon. A dungeon originally inhabited by blue slimes turned completely white with ash. It was eerily similar to the landscape described in the story.\nAfter confirming the existence of the first eroded dungeon, Ham Seok-jeong immediately changed her mind and revealed the existence of the apocalypse to a very few hunters. Only up to the top 10. It was a decision made to prevent the panic that apocalyptic theories would cause.\nSince that day, combat rankers have been taking turns investigating eroded dungeons. Originally, it should have been Gyu-Gyu or Honeybee's turn, but Nam Woo-jin urgently sent Lee Sa-young and Jung Bin in, and then the dungeon suddenly restructured.\nThe first appearance of an S+ grade dungeon, the sudden appearance of Hong Ye-seong and Yoon Ga-eul. Jung Bin recalled the blazing white eyes.\n'Did he foresee this situation and send us in...'\n\"...Sir?\"\nIt was a small voice that interrupted his long thoughts. Jung Bin snapped back to reality and looked for the owner of the voice. Yoon Ga-eul, rubbing her mouth, asked.\n\"Are you really alright?\"\nJung Bin clasped his hands behind his back and smiled.\n\"Yes, of course. It seems we will have some peace for a while. Have you eaten?\"\n\"Uh, no.\"\nJung Bin retrieved a small backpack from his inventory and handed it to Yoon Ga-eul. It was a makeshift supply kit containing preserved food and water.\n\"I recommend eating now if you feel even a little hungry. We don't know when we'll have another chance.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"Don't eat too much; just enough to stave off the hunger.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nYoon Ga-eul bowed her head as she took the backpack. Seeing her hesitate, Jung Bin deliberately sat on a flat piece of debris, unwrapped an energy bar, and took a bite. Only then did Yoon Ga-eul open her backpack and take out a bag of jerky.\nAfter finishing his energy bar, Jung Bin neatly folded the wrapper and began to speak.\n\"Feel free to eat while listening. Now that we have a moment of peace, let's sort out the situation. Lee Sa-young and I were investigating the erosion dungeon, but just as Lee Sa-young mentioned someone entering the dungeon, it restructured... and then we met you two. I don't know why you two are here.\"\nJung Bin emphasized the words \"you two\" and \"why.\" Yoon Ga-eul, looking like she might choke, just tore at her jerky. Jung Bin, still smiling warmly, glanced at her companion. Only the edge of a navy hiking hat was sticking out.\n\"Now, Hong Ye-seong-ssi?\"\n\"...Ahem.\"\nThe hiking hat began to sink slowly. But there was no way he could suddenly run away. No matter how reckless Hong Ye-seong was, he wouldn't do something as crazy as acting alone in an S+ grade dungeon. Having made this judgment, Jung Bin continued speaking undeterred.\n\"The person who disappeared suddenly, turning the Bureau upside down, is now in an erosion dungeon. I want to hear the whole story from the beginning to the end about why you two are here together.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There's no use invoking the right to remain silent here.\"\nThe chicken perched on the hat tilted its head, and Yoon Ga-eul continued chewing on her thinly torn jerky with a gloomy face. Hong Ye-seong still only showed the top of his head. None of them seemed ready to provide a proper explanation. Jung Bin sighed deeply as he folded the wrapper into a paper crane.\n\"We've investigated several erosion dungeons so far, but this is the first time a dungeon has restructured and its grade has increased. The phenomenon of dungeon restructuring itself is a first...\"\nBoom... The ground rumbled from afar. Such a massive vibration likely came from the dungeon master. To clear the dungeon, they had to kill it.\n\"My abilities are specialized for combat against humans, so they are of little use against monsters. Until now, I've fought using my grade and stats, but there are limits.\"\nJung Bin sighed shortly.\n\"To be honest, I can't be sure I can protect you all while dealing with the dungeon master. That's why a clear explanation of the situation is crucial.\"\n\"I'll explain it!\"\nIt was at that moment, as Yoon Ga-eul raised her hand, having stuffed jerky into Hong Ye-seong's mouth to silence him. A giant shadow loomed over them. All three of them and the chicken looked up simultaneously. A colossal...\n\"...Hand?\"\nA palm.\nIt was so enormous that even a slight upward movement of the palm tore through the still air. Where did such a massive thing suddenly appear from? Jung Bin hurriedly wrapped his chains around his arm and shouted.\n\"Ye-seong, the shield!\"\n\"Got it!\"\nSoon,\nBoom!!\nA massive shockwave shook the surroundings.\n***\nA little earlier.\n'How much time has passed?'\nCha Eui-jae, breaking a golem's arm with his pole, glanced at Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young was smashing the golems with his water power. He likely judged that breaking them was faster than dissolving the stone with his poison.\nBefore they could decide whether to regroup with Jung Bin or take down the dungeon master, monsters rushed at them relentlessly. Cha Eui-jae quickly noticed something strange. As time passed, the forms of the monsters attacking them were changing.\nRight after the restructuring, they saw the white, gaunt monsters familiar from the West Sea rift. After killing all of them, the surrounding debris rolled together and now formed complete stone golems. The golems roamed around slowly. Cha Eui-jae gripped his pole tighter.\n'Is it a mistake that occurred during restructuring? Or...'\nThe dungeon had suddenly reconfigured in response to Cha Eui-jae's title, so the monsters that first appeared were undoubtedly related to him. After dealing with all those monsters, only then did the familiar golems start to appear. Generally, the monsters within a dungeon are related to its master. Given the continuous appearance of small golems, it was highly likely that the dungeon master was also a golem.\nCha Eui-jae speared a rolling golem with his pole, contemplating. There were five super hamsters in the dungeon in total, two of which were bombs. One bomb was beside him, so that was fine, but Hong Ye-seong was the problem. The chaos from the Artisan Exhibition flashed through his mind, and Cha Eui-jae's expression turned grave.\nLee Sa-young could be reasoned with and calmed down, but Hong Ye-seong was impossible once fixated on something. They just had to helplessly accept the calamity that was Hong Ye-seong. The conclusion was clear without further thought.\n\"Instead of randomly fighting here, we should join up with Jung Bin. Let's go.\"\n\"What were you thinking so deeply about?\"\nLee Sa-young scoffed, having caught his whispered decision.\n\"What makes you so brave...? Ignoring my words entirely, I see?\"\n\"I listened to you and made a rational judgment.\"\n\"Oh, rational. I like that.\"\nLee Sa-young covered his mouth and laughed quietly. However, his eyes, unlike his raised lips, showed no trace of humor and remained fierce.\n\"First, how about taking off that hoodie before you talk? You don't seriously think it's fine just because you don't have an apron, do you? That would be too simple-minded...\"\n\"Here we go again.\"\nSince they met again in the ruins, Lee Sa-young had strangely been more amicable. This was no illusion. Pretending to be hurt, feigning pain, and even clapping when Cha Eui-jae delivered a spinning kick to a monster, saying, \"Wow, that's impressive. Did you learn Taekwondo?\" Normally, he'd sarcastically remark about hiding abilities, but that seemed to have an expiration date too.\n'What on earth does he want?'\nCha Eui-jae kicked a golem with a grimace, shattering it into pieces.\n\"What's bothering you now?\"\n\"Nothing... I'm just curious.\"\nLee Sa-young stopped in his tracks. When Cha Eui-jae turned to look at him, Lee Sa-young tilted his head as if he had been waiting for this.\n\"You act as if you have to take responsibility for everything and solve all problems by yourself.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Isn't it about time you realized how useless that kind of thinking is?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Coming Back\nCha Eui-jae frowned, but Lee Sa-young showed no intention of stopping his speech or moving.\n\"Let's finish this conversation before we move on. We have a bit of time, don't we?\"\nWithout bothering to reply, Cha Eui-jae scanned their surroundings. Thanks to the golems he had destroyed, there were no more presences nearby. Cha Eui-jae rested his pole on his shoulder and nodded.\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"What's your current job, Hyung?\"\n\"What?\"\nThe question came out of nowhere, and Cha Eui-jae scrutinized Lee Sa-young's face, expecting some nonsense. However, Lee Sa-young's delicate face showed no emotion as he calmly gazed at Cha Eui-jae. He pressed on.\n\"Answer me. What do you do for a living?\"\n\"Uh... right now... I'm working part-time at a hangover soup restaurant.\"\nCha Eui-jae answered reluctantly. Lee Sa-young's lips twisted as if he'd been waiting for this answer.\n\"And what do you think my job is?\"\n\"...A hunter?\"\n\"Right. So who do you think should take down the dungeon master, a hunter or a part-time worker at a hangover soup restaurant?\"\n\"Are you mocking me?\"\n\"Of course not.\"\nA strange intensity flickered in Lee Sa-young's pale violet eyes.\n\"I didn't want to talk like this... but someone keeps acting like they're alone. I can't help it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"No matter how weak Jung Bin is against monsters, he's strong enough to hold his own. And I can fight too...\"\nLee Sa-young chuckled briefly, then put on his gloves and took a step closer. He reached out and wrapped his gloved hand over Cha Eui-jae's hand, which was gripping the pole. Lee Sa-young leaned in and whispered.\n\"There's no need for a part-timer with trembling hands to save everyone and take down the dungeon master on his own.\"\nHe must have noticed Cha Eui-jae's trembling hands when they first met in the dungeon. The anxiety that had gnawed at Cha Eui-jae's heart had long since vanished, thanks to the man in front of him. But Cha Eui-jae didn't respond. Lee Sa-young's gloved thumb brushed over the back of Cha Eui-jae's hand and then withdrew. Lee Sa-young took a step back, tilting his head as if nothing had happened.\n\"You once told me you wanted to live quietly.\"\n\"I did.\"\n\"I didn't ask why at the time. Maybe I should have... because your actions say otherwise.\"\nLee Sa-young murmured softly, blinking slowly.\n\"Do you really want to live quietly, Hyung?\"\nCha Eui-jae seemed to remember making that promise to someone, to live quietly. Who that person was, however, was blurry as if veiled by mist. But one thing was clear. Cha Eui-jae answered briefly.\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"You don't know?\"\n\"You're mistaken if you think living quietly and saving people are mutually exclusive.\"\nLee Sa-young frowned. Cha Eui-jae didn't avoid the turbulent gaze of the two eyes staring at him.\nLiving quietly was a wish someone had for Cha Eui-jae, and saving people was something Cha Eui-jae could do. There had been times when what he could do became what he had to do. But...\n\"Why would anyone need a reason to save people?\"\nWhy save people? Why should I sacrifice myself? Cha Eui-jae had long since resolved those questions. The wish to live quietly, the trembling hands and churning stomach whenever entering a dungeon or a rift, were irrelevant in the face of saving lives. The most important thing was human life. Losing someone he could save due to hesitation was the most foolish thing. And...\n'This dungeon is my responsibility.'\nSwallowing his words, Cha Eui-jae took a step closer to Lee Sa-young.\n\"And I told you, I made a rational judgment. Jung Bin is too weak against monsters to be of any help. And you, sure, with your poison abilities, you might be able to melt the dungeon master if it's a golem.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But being an S+ ranked dungeon master, it would take a long time. Meanwhile, it would be faster for us to beat it down together, like we did earlier.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And the reason I want to join up with Jung Bin is... there are others inside. We need to save them.\"\n\"...Ha.\"\nLee Sa-young raised his eyebrows as he listened. Cha Eui-jae could now perfectly interpret all of Lee Sa-young's expressions. This one meant, \"Finally, you're telling me.\" Sighing briefly, Lee Sa-young asked.\n\"Who else is in here besides you?\"\n\"Hong Ye-seong. And one more person.\"\n\"...\"\nLong eyelashes fluttered as if chewing over the words. Finally, Lee Sa-young's eyes twisted slightly.\n\"Why is that guy here? And who's the other one?\"\n\"He came looking for a magic stone.\"\n\"Fuck, just give him that shitty thing and cut ties.\"\n\"I tried, but there were unavoidable circumstances... anyway.\"\nClearing his throat, Cha Eui-jae glanced sideways at Lee Sa-young. At the mention of Hong Ye-seong, Lee Sa-young's face twisted. Damn, Hong Ye-seong wasn't going to be any help. It was time to change the mood. Cha Eui-jae poked Lee Sa-young's arm and threw a joke.\n\"If you're worried, say so. Don't be a jerk about it.\"\n\"...\"\nMood change? No, an oncoming crisis. A dreadful silence followed.\n'Fuck, what went wrong?'\nCha Eui-jae froze, looking at Lee Sa-young's delicate face, now shrouded in a dark shadow. This was not the reaction he had expected. In his mind, Lee Sa-young should have immediately retorted with something like:\n'Worried? Who about who?'\n'Are you crazy?'\n'No way.'\n'Are you blind...'\nBut instead, Lee Sa-young's face had gone pale, his plump lips tightly shut. Cha Eui-jae withdrew his finger from Lee Sa-young's arm and asked reluctantly.\n\"...Were you really worried?\"\n\"Why?\"\nThe plump lips parted.\n\"Is that a problem?\"\nThis was an entirely unexpected rebuttal. Lee Sa-young twisted his lips into a smile.\n\"Why are you so surprised?\"\n\"...\"\n\"What if I said I've been waiting for you?\"\nCountless words surfaced and sank, written and erased repeatedly. When Cha Eui-jae finally opened his mouth to speak the final word that remained...\nThey were startled and looked in one direction. The air tore sharply.\nKwoooaang—!!\nA fierce ash storm whipped up. Cha Eui-jae shielded the back of Lee Sa-young's head, pulling him close and holding his breath. Simultaneously, a strong arm wrapped around his back and waist. After the storm subsided, Cha Eui-jae surveyed the surroundings. A massive entity moved slowly at the source of the sound. Every movement shook the entire dungeon. That must be the dungeon master. Cha Eui-jae blinked his eyes open and shut.\nWhy were ominous premonitions always spot-on?\nBiting his lip, Cha Eui-jae tapped Lee Sa-young's shoulder.\n\"Over there, where Jung Bin is.\"\n\"...Ha.\"\nLee Sa-young chuckled bitterly, releasing the arm he had wrapped around Cha Eui-jae. Their gazes met for a moment. They started running simultaneously.\nAs they moved, a huge golem became clearer amidst the white ash. It was a giant golem, standing on four legs like a dog, so enormous that its head wasn't even visible.\nGwoooo...\nThe golem let out a long howl, sending chills down their spines. They were now in the shadow cast by the golem's massive body.\n\"...Tsk.\"\nLee Sa-young clicked his tongue. Cha Eui-jae's judgment had been correct. Melting something that size would poison everyone else except for Lee Sa-young. It would be a pointless battle of attrition. Cracking his knuckles, Lee Sa-young stared at the golem. There was no choice but to break it down piece by piece. His hands would shatter first, but with potions, it wouldn't be a problem. At that moment, Cha Eui-jae, who was running, muttered.\n\"There they are.\"\nAt the end of Cha Eui-jae's blue gaze, a transparent rectangular space with a golden border glowed. Inside, a sweating Hong Ye-seong was holding up a shield, with Jung Bin collapsed and a girl supporting him. It seemed they had also noticed them. Hong Ye-seong's groaning voice reached them.\n\"Ugh, shit, we're saved...\"\n\"Watch out!\"\nThe girl screamed. Cha Eui-jae raised his head. A giant hand was flying towards them. Lee Sa-young reached out to grab Cha Eui-jae. However, Cha Eui-jae pushed him away instead of grabbing his hand. Lee Sa-young's eyes widened. Cha Eui-jae was...\nSmiling.\nLee Sa-young's eyes widened, and he opened his mouth to say something. But the words didn't come out. Lee Sa-young found himself near the shield Hong Ye-seong had created. Hong Ye-seong gritted his teeth and shouted.\n\"Student, bring Lee Sa-young inside!\"\n\"Yes!\"\nThe girl grabbed Lee Sa-young's arm and pulled him inside the golden space. Just as Lee Sa-young got up, something ensnared him. It was a black snare. Lee Sa-young growled ferociously.\n\"Fuck, let me go right now.\"\n\"What are you going to do if you go out there? Don't you see Jung Bin?\"\nHong Ye-seong shouted, breathing heavily. Only then did Lee Sa-young look down. Jung Bin was lying there in tatters. Only his faintly heaving chest proved he was alive.",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Coming Back\nSounds of hard objects clashing continued outside the wall. The loud noise whirled chaotically in his mind. Lee Sa-young roughly tugged at the snare that bound him. Is this why he pushed me away?\nGritting his teeth, Lee Sa-young knelt on one knee in front of Jung Bin to check his condition.\n\"...Why is this guy like this again?\"\nJung Bin was surrounded by his own blood. His right arm was visibly dislocated, the bones clearly out of place. The black chain that had been writhing like it was alive was now wrapped around its owner's arm and still. His condition was more serious than expected. Lee Sa-young hurriedly reached into his inventory. Hong Ye-seong muttered sardonically.\n\"It's because he was protecting the two of us who can't fight... Do you have any potions? Save him, please.\"\nWithout a word, Lee Sa-young poured out the potions from his inventory. The girl reached out and quickly started opening the potion bottles. Lee Sa-young frowned and turned to look. The student responded as if she had been waiting.\n\"I'm an S-grade who awakened recently. I thought you might have heard about me from Jung Bin-nim or the director. It's my first time meeting you in person.\"\nLee Sa-young only knew of one S-grade hunter whose face he didn't recognize.\n\"...That high school student?\"\n\"Yes. I'm Yoon Ga-eul.\"\nYoon Ga-eul nodded and placed the opened potions beside her. Hong Ye-seong mentioned there was another person besides him. But why was Yoon Ga-eul moving with Cha Eui-jae? Lee Sa-young scrutinized Yoon Ga-eul with sharp eyes.\nYoon Ga-eul, unaware of the gaze, murmured gloomily.\n\"We didn't have any potions, so we just roughly patched up the big wounds.\"\n\"If you're coming to a place like this, at least bring some potions.\"\nLee Sa-young snapped coldly, pulling out a syringe filled with green liquid and injecting it into Jung Bin's right arm. As the liquid decreased, the bleeding gradually stopped. Hong Ye-seong glanced over and asked.\n\"What's that?\"\n\"It's something Nam Woo-jin made.\"\n\"Oh... that emergency recovery thing.\"\nMost external wounds can be treated with potions. However, no matter how good the potion is, it can't compare to a healer's speed. Nam Woo-jin, Korea's only A-grade healer, made emergency recovery kits using his abilities and sold them instead of entering dungeons himself. Lee Sa-young discarded the empty syringe and poured a potion over the wound. The wound healed quickly, and Jung Bin's breathing stabilized, though his face remained pale.\n\"...He's alive for now. To treat him without aftereffects, we'll need to go to Nam Woo-jin.\"\n\"At least there's that. No matter how capable I am... I can't make healing items.\"\nBoom! The transparent wall surrounding them shook violently. Hong Ye-seong coughed up blood, and Yoon Ga-eul quickly held a handkerchief to his mouth.\n\"Are you taking the impact?\"\n\"Seems like it... I can absorb some of the shock, but the rest comes to me. I set up the shield, after all.\"\nLee Sa-young clicked his tongue and pulled out another syringe. Hong Ye-seong, mouth slightly open, asked.\n\"You're not planning to use that on me, are you?\"\n\"I am.\"\nRip, Lee Sa-young tore off the sleeve of Hong Ye-seong's hiking jacket without hesitation.\n\"Ah, I hate needles! Aaaagh!\"\nThud, slurp. The green liquid quickly diminished. Hong Ye-seong, who had been screaming, began to sob silently. His complexion improved rapidly. Lee Sa-young, who had removed the needle and even poured potion on the spot where the needle had been, glanced at Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"And you.\"\n\"N-no! I'm fine! You two protected us.\"\n\"Good. Then that's fine.\"\nLee Sa-young threw the syringe aside and stood up. Yoon Ga-eul and Hong Ye-seong looked at him with wide eyes.\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"Outside.\"\n\"Hey, do you think poison will work on that golem? And no matter how good this shield is, it can't block poison!\"\n\"Then I'll just break it without poison.\"\n\"That's a reckless idea. You think that'll—\"\nBoom!\nA loud noise interrupted his words, and something huge fell. It was the giant hand that had attacked them. The wrist attached to it was in shambles. Hong Ye-seong muttered blankly.\n\"...It works?\"\nRoar! The golem, now missing a hand, clutched its shattered wrist and howled. The space rumbled with its scream. At that moment, a gray shadow charged at the golem. It was Cha Eui-jae.\nHe leaped off the golem's body and swung a long pole at the other hand wrapped around the wrist. Crack! The enraged golem swung its arm wildly. The pole was caught in the strong wind and flew away. Cha Eui-jae, who was thrown off balance, managed to land on his feet with a roll.\n\"Hey, you're bleeding!\"\nYoon Ga-eul pointed to his mouth in a panic. Lee Sa-young quickly came to his senses. His mouth was filled with a bitter and sweet taste. He roughly wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and black blood smeared on it. He must have bitten his lip without realizing it.\n'Damn it.'\nShould he leave these people and join Cha Eui-jae? No, even if he joined, would it help? If his poison caused Cha Eui-jae to fall...\nBoom!\nAnother loud noise echoed. Lee Sa-young raised his head. The golem had slammed its fist where Cha Eui-jae had been. And then...\nBright blue eyes suddenly turned towards him.\nThe moment their eyes met, Lee Sa-young, as if mesmerized by the blue light, spoke.\n\"Hong Ye-seong, did you bring the spear?\"\n\"Spear? What spear?\"\nHong Ye-seong, with bloodshot eyes, looked back. Lee Sa-young answered shortly.\n\"My spear. Give it to me.\"\n\"Spear, spear... Oh, the Great God Spear? Why is that yours!\"\n\"I won the auction. Why, do you want me to pay you right here?\"\n\"Damn it, what good is money here? Can I make a bed out of it? Hey, hold this for a moment, will you?\"\n\"Yes? Yes!\"\nYoon Ga-eul quickly took the shield. Her stance was firmer than Hong Ye-seong's sloppy hold. Hong Ye-seong rummaged through his inventory and groaned, pulling out the Great God Spear with both hands.\n\"Alright, let's try something. Do you need a bomb? Poison won't work on that crazy golem.\"\n\"No need.\"\nLee Sa-young took the spear and stepped out of Hong Ye-seong's shield. Wind mixed with ash and sand tangled his hair. Hong Ye-seong, holding the shield again, urgently asked.\n\"Hey, what are you planning! Do you even know how to use a spear?\"\n\"No.\"\nHe's never used a spear before. But he knows someone who uses it better than anyone. Lee Sa-young looked beyond the storm of white ash and called out his name.\n\"Cha Eui-jae!\"\nInstantly, those blue eyes found him. Just like that time.\n'Ah.'\nHis heart pounded. And he suddenly realized that he had been waiting more than anything...\nfor the day he would see those eyes again.\n\"Catch!\"\nLee Sa-young raised the Great God Spear high to make it visible, turned towards the golem, and took a stance.\nSometimes, it became the shackle that held him back.\nHe planted his feet firmly apart. He pulled his right arm holding the spear back and, after a moment's breath, exhaled and—\nSometimes, it became the wind that stirred the waves.\nHe threw the spear.\nWhoosh!\nThe heavy Great God Spear flew like an arrow. Cha Eui-jae was already far ahead, running.\nAt some point, just before the spear surpassed human speed, the time came when it aligned with the hunter like parallel lines. Cha Eui-jae, never missing that fleeting moment, expertly caught the spear.\nClang!\nWithout staggering, as if he had been waiting for this moment all along.\nLive quietly?\nWhoosh— His worn-out sneakers scraped the ground roughly as he halted. With a low stance, Cha Eui-jae spun the giant spear and grasped it properly. The golem turned its body slowly. Boom, the ground shook. Boom, it stepped firmly. Boom, his heart raced. Without hesitation, Cha Eui-jae started running again.\nDon't know about that.\nCha Eui-jae doesn't know how to live quietly. No one taught him, and his traits that made everything proficient were useless for that. Even so, Cha Eui-jae always did his best. Trying to live quietly...\nBecause he had nothing he wanted to do.\nHe felt empty. Since the moment he came to his senses. There was no place for him here. Everything he knew was gone, replaced by things he didn't know. Living each day was a struggle.\nIn a world with nowhere to go and no place to rest. Every moment was new, and every moment was painful. Thinking deeply about anything brought up cracks, making even long thoughts difficult. He felt like a lost child.\nA huge fist came flying. His heartbeat raced.\nBecause he's nervous?\nBecause he's scared?\nNo. His heart always raced at moments like this. Only in these moments did he feel alive. Cha Eui-jae smiled. The weight of the spear in his hand was heavy. Countless system windows flashed in his vision.\n[Trait: Enhanced Strength (S+) activated.]\n[Unique trait: Hand of a Master (S+) activated.]\n[Unique trait: The One Who Pierces All (S+) activated.]\nAs if shackles had been lifted, a massive wave surged through his body from head to toe. Cha Eui-jae kicked off the ground and leaped high. Thud! Lightly stepping on the golem's swinging arm, he jumped again.\nHow grateful it is to have someone to protect.\nCha Eui-jae twisted his waist, pulling his right arm holding the spear back with all his might. As he held his breath, everything around him seemed to slow down as if time had stopped. His blue, glowing eyes took in the scene below. The golem, Hong Ye-seong, Yoon Ga-eul, Jung Bin, and...\nLee Sa-young.\nAs he met the violet eyes looking straight at him,\nHow joyful it is to have someone waiting for you...\nCha Eui-jae smiled.\nBOOM—!!\nA blinding white light burst forth.",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Coming Back\nBang! Crash! Groooan... The sound of something enormous and solid breaking, the golem's roar, all mixed together in the dungeon, tearing at the ears. The noise alone shook the surroundings. From the source of the sound, dazzling light and a storm of white ash and dust surged forth.\nMost hunters use all their abilities to fight monsters. Not just their weapons, but also skills and traits that are as flashy and attention-grabbing as special effects in movies or dramas. The attacks of hunters in the stabilized Great Hunter Era were dazzling and powerful...\nHowever, the one facing the golem now was a bit different.\nBOOM—!\nA blue light flashed within the storm. Huge fragments, shattered, poured down like meteors through the fierce wind.\n\"Ah!\"\nHong Ye-seong screamed, raising his slightly lowered shield properly. What had shattered and fallen was another hand of the golem.\nThe skill of the one fighting the giant golem with just a spear and his body could not be called flashy, even as a compliment. It was rather calm, close to tranquility. Yet, it was strong and solid enough to hold one's gaze.\nLee Sa-young watched the storm unflinchingly.\nHow much time had passed?\nGroan...\nThe golem's roar gradually subsided, and the surroundings quieted. As the dust settled, what appeared was...\n\"Wow.\"\nYoon Ga-eul, watching blankly, let out a sigh of admiration involuntarily. In the spot where the storm had cleared, there was only the golem, clutching its chest with its broken hand.\nThe golem lay leaning back, its waist bent, with a huge spear more than half-embedded beside its shattered wrist. It was a perfect penetration.\nAnd standing atop it was Cha Eui-jae, holding the spear.\nThud... The sound of the golem's heart, pulsing beneath his feet and shaking his entire body, quietly stopped. Confirming that the sign of life had completely disappeared, Cha Eui-jae pulled the spear out without hesitation. The heart cavity crumbled around the spot where the spear had been embedded, leaving a giant hole.\nHe slung the spear over his shoulder and lightly jumped down from the golem. The golem, with a large hole in it, collapsed with a thud. That was the last sound before silence.\nUntil Cha Eui-jae approached them, no one dared to open their mouths. Cha Eui-jae, dragging his sneakers and walking slowly, stood before them.\nHis hands still trembled. The uneasy feelings, a mixture of guilt for being the only survivor and regret for not bringing out even a part of the corpses, had long become one with Cha Eui-jae. Probably for a long time to come, they would stay with him, dragging him down and breaking his spirit.\nCha Eui-jae had been sinking like that. From the moment he was ejected from the West Sea Rift, he closed his eyes and ears, submerged in quiet water. Because in this place without J, there was the peace everyone had longed for. He couldn't disturb that peace.\nHowever...\nCha Eui-jae cautiously opened his mouth, scanning the faces that seemed somewhat soulless.\n\"...Are you okay? Is anyone hurt?\"\n\"No, that's what we should be asking you! Don't steal my line!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nHong Ye-seong, spitting out blood, approached briskly. Following closely behind him, Kkokko trotted. He pressed his fist to his chin, inspecting Cha Eui-jae from head to toe with his golden eyes.\n\"You don't seem hurt, nothing looks broken, no cuts or tears. Wow, you're really sturdy. Any internal injuries? Are you okay?\"\n\"Uh, yeah. I'm fine.\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded, still bewildered. Hong Ye-seong clicked his tongue, then suddenly thrust his radiant face forward. Cha Eui-jae instinctively leaned back. Hong Ye-seong whispered with a voice filled with heat.\n\"...So, the spear.\"\n\"Huh? The spear?\"\nCha Eui-jae unconsciously raised the spear in his hand. Hong Ye-seong nodded eagerly.\n\"Yeah, that. How was it using the spear?\"\n\"Um... It was good.\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded honestly, replying. The spear had fit his hand perfectly from the moment he grabbed it. As if it was made just for him. Listening intently, Hong Ye-seong beamed.\n\"Right? It's my masterpiece. Honestly, I was worried when Lee Sa-young said he got it at the auction...\"\nHong Ye-seong puffed out his chest like a rooster courting a hen, boasting about himself. Yoon Ga-eul, with disheveled hair, absent-mindedly chimed in.\nIs it okay to be so peaceful in the dungeon? Cha Eui-jae watched the lively Hong Ye-seong and Yoon Ga-eul blankly. People's voices began to hum and echo as if submerged in water. It felt like his senses were becoming distant.\nNo, he needed to stay alert. Cha Eui-jae deliberately shifted his gaze around to regain focus. At the end of his erratic gaze was Lee Sa-young. Their eyes met.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nContrary to Cha Eui-jae's expectation of immediate questioning, Lee Sa-young was surprisingly silent. Cha Eui-jae, who was waiting for him to speak, also quietly watched. Hong Ye-seong and Yoon Ga-eul's voices grew fainter.\nAs if only the two of them were caught in a gap in a different space, in a moment where time seemed to have stopped. Cha Eui-jae's senses were gradually being reoriented around Lee Sa-young. His mouth felt dry. Cha Eui-jae gripped the spear tightly, veins bulging on the back of his hand.\nKilling the golem? He didn't regret it. It was something he had to do, and if he hadn't stepped up, everyone might have died.\n'But... What should I say to Lee Sa-young?'\nHis fingers, hidden behind his back, curled slightly.\nLee Sa-young knew Cha Eui-jae had hidden his strength. However, it wasn't common for an average awakened person to handle an S+-grade monster relatively easily and without injuries. Even Jung Bin, who was weak against monsters, couldn't do it, and Lee Sa-young, the former number one, couldn't either due to their attributes.\nShould he lie again? What was Lee Sa-young thinking now? His mind swirled with complicated thoughts. Cha Eui-jae hesitated, then stared into the purple eyes he'd met many times before. Even staring into Lee Sa-young's eyes, they revealed no answers.\nThere was no sign of curiosity, nor did he seem intent on questioning. It was as if he was looking at an obvious fact, an expected look.\n'Why?'\n...No way.\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly at Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young, who had been staring at Cha Eui-jae's disheveled hair, opened his mouth with an expressionless face.\n\"It's okay.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I said it's okay.\"\nWas this an answer to the question he asked earlier about whether he was okay? Cha Eui-jae spoke to Lee Sa-young without thinking.\n\"Well used.\"\n\"How was it?\"\n\"Well made.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nCha Eui-jae responded, stretching out his hand with the spear. He intended to hand it over. However, Lee Sa-young, instead of accepting the spear, grasped Cha Eui-jae's hand and pushed it forward. Startled by the incomprehensible action, Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Lee Sa-young spoke as if answering his unspoken question.\n\"It's yours.\"\n\"What do you mean...\"\n\"It was yours from the start.\"\nIn the auction, Lee Sa-young had caused all sorts of problems despite being tied up by Jung Bin's chains and being near death, and had even collapsed after securing the spear.\nIf all that was not just to obtain an S+-grade weapon...\nCountless words surfaced and sank. Cha Eui-jae pressed the words stuck on his tongue against his front teeth.\n'What the hell are you?'\nLee Sa-young's eyes still shone brightly as they gazed at Cha Eui-jae. As if he didn't care about the existence of others. His lips felt parched. Unconsciously, he licked his dry lips, and at that moment,\n\"Ugh... Is it really dead? I'm exhausted.\"\nHong Ye-seong collapsed onto the floor. He looked like a college student who had partied until 4 AM the day before and then attended the 1st period class. With the ends of his hair white with ash and dust, he made zombie-like sounds as he rolled on the floor.\nCha Eui-jae once again examined the disheveled Hong Ye-seong and Yoon Ga-eul. Although the front of Hong Ye-seong's hiking clothes was soaked in blood, he seemed quite alright, judging by his constant groaning about \"I'm going to die\". At least he had the energy to make noise.\nYoon Ga-eul also seemed fine except for her messy hair. Cha Eui-jae sighed a small sigh of relief. Behind the two of them, Jung Bin lay flat. Cha Eui-jae hesitated and asked Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"How is Jung Bin...?\"\n\"Ah, Jung Bin? He was in a bit of danger earlier...\"\nYoon Ga-eul looked anxious as she shifted her gaze. She looked at Jung Bin once, then at Lee Sa-young, who stood with his hands in his pockets and a lazy expression, before continuing.\n\"Guild Leader Pado treated him, so he's better now. Though he hasn't regained consciousness yet.\"\nNaturally, Cha Eui-jae's gaze followed Yoon Ga-eul's, looking at Jung Bin once, then Lee Sa-young once. Lee Sa-young, who caught Cha Eui-jae's gaze, spoke leisurely.\n\"Isn't that why you threw me?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Coming Back\nCha Eui-jae kept his mouth shut. To be honest, the biggest reason he had pushed Lee Sa-young away was that he couldn't fully show his fighting skills, but it was also partly true that he sent him to protect the kids.\nHowever, Cha Eui-jae had learned something through several experiences. If he answered too honestly...\nLee Sa-young would get upset.\nTo appease this guy, he had to wrap his words in bubble wrap. Very softly and gently. Cha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck and answered nonchalantly.\n\"No... I trusted you. I sent you on purpose to protect the kids. You did well.\"\n\"Ah... So you trusted me. I didn't know that.\"\nLee Sa-young crossed his arms and smiled, curling his lips while narrowing his eyes.\n\"When someone reaches out their hand and gets kicked away, it makes you think, 'Is this all our relationship amounts to?' Don't you think? I also wondered if my abilities were lacking. My self-esteem took a bit of a hit.\"\n\"What self-esteem...\"\n\"I've never been rejected like this before.\"\nLee Sa-young started talking nonsense with a beautifully smiling face. Luckily, it didn't seem like he was genuinely offended since he didn't turn his head away. Cha Eui-jae muttered with a pout.\n\"You're being ridiculous, really...\"\nLee Sa-young looked at Cha Eui-jae's unblemished face and spoke in a low voice while crossing his arms.\n\"Anyway, just try doing that again next time.\"\n\"And what if I do?\"\n\"Um...\"\nCha Eui-jae squinted at Lee Sa-young, thinking he might be bluffing, but Lee Sa-young was surprisingly serious. His long eyelashes cast thin shadows around his eyes.\n\"...I don't know.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just... Let's say there won't be a next time. That would be better.\"\n\"...\"\nWith that murmur, Lee Sa-young clamped his mouth shut, seemingly lost in thought. The pretty smile that had hung on his face earlier had disappeared as if swallowed by shadows.\nCha Eui-jae quietly observed his face and noticed black blood on his pale lips. Reaching out, Cha Eui-jae wiped away the black blood with his thumb, clicking his tongue.\n\"But why are your lips like this? Did you get hit by debris or something?\"\n\"...What?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been deep in thought, flinched and widened his eyes. His eyes landed on the black substance smeared on Cha Eui-jae's hand.\nSnap! Lee Sa-young urgently grabbed Cha Eui-jae's hand. He couldn't hide his surprise, pausing for a moment before releasing Cha Eui-jae's hand and rummaging through his inventory. Cha Eui-jae frowned and asked.\n\"What's up with you?\"\n\"Why did you just...!\"\nLee Sa-young pulled out a bottle, crushed the cap, and poured the purple liquid directly onto Cha Eui-jae's hand.\nCha Eui-jae let out a short groan at the peculiar sensation rising from his hand. The sticky and viscous liquid covered his hand. Lee Sa-young, who firmly held his squirming hand, poured a healing potion over it again. His actions were so quick that even Cha Eui-jae couldn't find a moment to intervene.\nLooking dazedly at Lee Sa-young, Cha Eui-jae's hand now drenched in various liquids, he asked.\n\"What is this...\"\nLee Sa-young irritably threw the empty bottle away. The sound of the bottle shattering against some ruins echoed. With a suddenly cold expression, Lee Sa-young sneered.\n\"Didn't you almost die last time and still didn't learn anything?\"\nAt this point, Cha Eui-jae felt wronged. How many times had he said it? That he was fine. That Lee Sa-young's poison didn't affect him. He had practically sung it, but the one who didn't listen was Lee Sa-young.\nCha Eui-jae shook his soaked hand dry.\n\"I'm really fine. You never listen to a word I say, do you?\"\n\"How can someone be so careless...\"\n\"At least pretend to listen, you idiot.\"\nCha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young by the collar. A sweet scent wafted from him as he got close.\nAt eye level, Cha Eui-jae saw Lee Sa-young's torn lips. For a moment, Cha Eui-jae thought absurdly that to calm Lee Sa-young's endless distrust, he might have to drink his blood.\nJust then, a large black hand covered Cha Eui-jae's face. Cha Eui-jae grabbed the hand, grimacing.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"I thought you were about to have strange thoughts, so I'm blocking your view.\"\n\"What strange thoughts?\"\n\"It's natural for anyone to have strange thoughts when adrenaline is pumping. I understand.\"\n\"Stop talking nonsense, seriously.\"\n\"Okay, but you need to calm down too. Isn't it been a while since you last fought a monster?\"\nCha Eui-jae's heart was still racing, showing no sign of slowing down. His heartbeat was loud enough for anyone with good hearing to pick up. Only then did Cha Eui-jae slowly relax his tensed shoulders. He rubbed his temple with his thumb as if praising himself.\n\"Yeah... just like that.\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been muttering incomprehensible things, finally removed his hand after some time. He fiddled with his disheveled bangs, straightening them out, and then let go completely.\n\"Now, let's wrap up this talk...\"\nLee Sa-young sat on the remains of a building that was at a convenient height, crossing his legs. He then looked at Cha Eui-jae and patted the seat next to him, signaling him to sit.\n'Do I really have to?'\nCha Eui-jae shook his head reluctantly. But Lee Sa-young was more persistent than expected. He grabbed Cha Eui-jae's arm and started pulling. Although Cha Eui-jae could resist, having a strength contest in front of Hong Ye-seong, who was lying on the ground with sparkling eyes, and Yoon Ga-eul, who was wide-eyed, seemed inappropriate. Cha Eui-jae sighed shortly and sat next to Lee Sa-young, barely perching on the edge.\nFinally, Lee Sa-young nodded his chin towards the two uninvited guests.\n\"You must have a reason for coming here, right, you two?\"\n\"...\"\nYoon Ga-eul lowered her head deeply. Hong Ye-seong turned his head away.\n\"This dungeon belongs to the Pado Guild, as you should have noticed if your eyes are working properly...\"\n\"We didn't know.\"\n\"Don't talk nonsense.\"\n\"Tsk.\"\nHong Ye-seong's brazen lie was instantly cut off by Lee Sa-young. Hong Ye-seong pouted his lips like a duck and turned his head away. Cha Eui-jae, having escaped the treatment of an intruder, quietly leaned back, trying to avoid Lee Sa-young's gaze.\nLee Sa-young crossed his arms, fiddling with his lips with his thumb, and smiled, using his handsome face to its full extent. It was a beautiful smile, incongruous with the ruins.\n\"Okay...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Speak up properly. I'll listen. It would be better to be honest.\"\nIt sounded like he was just going to listen. His long eyelashes fluttered.\n\"If you don't want to go to court for illegal dungeon trespassing.\"\nIs there even such a law now? Cha Eui-jae, who had been listening quietly, was astonished. The saying that laws change slowly apparently didn't apply to matters related to awakeners. And from the moment the court was mentioned, Hong Ye-seong played dead, lying limp on the ground.\n\"Yeah, well.\"\nYoon Ga-eul bravely opened her mouth but turned her head away, looking at Lee Sa-young's face. She picked up Kkokko, who had been crushing Hong Ye-seong's face, and hid her own face behind it, continuing to speak.\n\"We urgently needed to investigate an eroded dungeon... This was the closest one I knew of. We're really sorry for sneaking in.\"\n\"No matter how urgent it is... You should go through the proper procedures, right? I think you would know such basic protocols.\"\n\"That, that's true. But it's just...\"\nLee Sa-young coldly extended his hand.\n\"If it's that urgent, that proud Ham Seok-jeong would have given you some sort of confirmation. Hand it over.\"\n\"Well, uh... oh?\"\nYoon Ga-eul's eyes widened as she fumbled around.\n\"Wait a moment.\"\n\"If you're trying to change the subject...\"\n\"I'm really sorry, but this is really important. Just a moment!\"\nShe suddenly stood up and started running somewhere, past Lee Sa-young and Cha Eui-jae. She was stumbling but didn't hesitate. Kkokko quickly followed her, wiggling its head. They were heading towards the remains of the collapsed golem. Cha Eui-jae was about to get up and follow when a black hand grabbed his arm again. It was Lee Sa-young.\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"She's heading to the golem alone.\"\n\"After completely shattering the core so that it can't revive at all, what...\"\nLee Sa-young snickered and pulled on Cha Eui-jae's arm again. The grip wasn't strong, but that made it harder to shake off.\n\"There are no monster presences around, right? The dungeon owner is dead, so it's safe for now. She can handle that on her own.\"\n\"...\"\n\"We still need to investigate this dungeon. There must be a reason it was suddenly reconstructed. So...\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been spouting sensible points, rested his head on Cha Eui-jae's shoulder. Cha Eui-jae momentarily held his breath. The low voice drilled into his ear.\n\"Stay here quietly. Next to me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Leaving you behind once is enough.\"\nA leather-clad hand gripped his wrist tightly. Cha Eui-jae didn't shake off that hand. Instead, he covered the warmth encircling his wrist with his own hand. Long, black fingers entwined with his firm hand as if waiting for this moment.\nIt was truly strange. Every time Lee Sa-young acted like this, a strange sense of déjà vu would arise. In such moments, someone who had surely already died would surface in Cha Eui-jae's mind.\nAt that very moment,\n\"Found it! Ah! I found it!\"\nSomehow, Yoon Ga-eul poked her head out of a black hole in the golem's heart.\nShe roughly wiped the dust off her face with her sleeve and waved something she held in her hand. That shining fragment, glittering like a kaleidoscope in Yoon Ga-eul's hand, was something even Cha Eui-jae had seen before—\n\"It's a fragment!\"\nA fragment of the world.",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Coming Back\nA fragment of the world, a piece of a world that had met its end, showing a mirror-like reflection of that destroyed world.\nBut weren't fragments supposed to appear only in Yoon Ga-eul's dreams? Why did a piece of the past world come out of the dungeon master of the restructured dungeon? Yoon Ga-eul put the fragment in the pocket of her pajama pants and shouted below.\n\"Hey, can I take a closer look?\"\nA dungeon where the master has died enters a stable period until a new master regenerates it, making resource gathering and investigation easy. So, taking a closer look wouldn't be very dangerous. It seemed Lee Sa-young made the same judgement as he nodded.\n\"Do as you wish.\"\n\"Yes! I'll be careful!\"\nYoon Ga-eul disappeared back into the golem. Cha Eui-jae silently watched Lee Sa-young leaning on him. Lee Sa-young was staring blankly at the ruins. Soon, as if feeling Cha Eui-jae's gaze, he turned his head.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Nothing... Do you know what Ga-eul was holding?\"\nSince rankers shared information about the apocalypse, Lee Sa-young must also know something about it. Perhaps he knew more about the fragments. Cha Eui-jae feigned ignorance and asked, and Lee Sa-young squinted his eyes.\n\"Ga-eul?\"\nOh no. The way he repeated the question made Cha Eui-jae sense he had made a mistake. While Cha Eui-jae secretly gritted his teeth, Lee Sa-young lazily mumbled.\n\"I didn't even know that girl's face or name, but you call her by name, you two seem very close. Right?\"\n\"We're not close, damn it. We're not close.\"\n\"Should I believe that?\"\n\"Yeah. I'm closer to you than to her. So shut up.\"\nCha Eui-jae reached out to cover Lee Sa-young's eyes and pushed him back. Lee Sa-young grumbled sulkily as he was pushed back.\n\"Why do people flock to you even when you're just standing still...\"\n\"Anyway, do you know what that shiny thing was?\"\n\"Huh? Ah...\"\nCha Eui-jae felt the sensation of eyeballs moving under the eyelids that touched his palm, as if rolling his eyes. It felt ticklish, making Cha Eui-jae want to pull his hand away.\n\"I think I've heard of it... Huh, I can't remember.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I don't know, that kind of thing.\"\nHe remembered every little thing and held grudges about every single one, yet he claimed not to remember something so important? Regardless of Cha Eui-jae's incredulous expression, Lee Sa-young just shrugged his shoulders. His brazen face suggested that prying further would be futile.\nCha Eui-jae propped his chin and sighed softly.\n'It'd be better to ask Ga-eul directly.'\n\"As I said earlier...\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"You don't need to know everything.\"\nBefore he knew it, Lee Sa-young was staring straight at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Knowing means taking responsibility for it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I wonder if you're ready for that, Hyung...\"\nCha Eui-jae, staring at the black scab on the pale lips, suddenly asked.\n\"What about you?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nThe reply came without hesitation. Lee Sa-young smiled broadly, showing off.\n\"I've been ready for a long time... just waiting for the day to take responsibility.\"\n\"...\"\nThe black fingers gently scratched his palm and then pulled away. Cha Eui-jae unconsciously clenched his hand.\n\"So, you can... be a bit more selfish.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae opened his mouth slightly, then closed it. What was the deep source of that unfathomable trust? Lee Sa-young gently tapped the scab on his lips, twisting them.\n\"Just don't touch me like that.\"\nAlright then.\nSomeday, he'd drink Lee Sa-young's blood and show no reaction. Someone as deeply distrustful of humanity as Lee Sa-young needed to have his bad habits shocked out of him through extreme measures.\nGrinding his teeth inwardly, Cha Eui-jae stood up and strode away. Rather than arguing with that guy until his head exploded, he thought it better to check on Jung Bin's condition once more.\nJung Bin lay on the silver mat, hands neatly folded. Although his right arm was splinted and bandaged, the work was somewhat clumsy. Lying sideways beside him as if he were at the Han River bank, Hong Ye-seong pulled out his wireless earphones and looked up.\n\"Oh, Secretary Kim. Done with your lovers' quarrel?\"\n\"I'm holding a spear.\"\nCha Eui-jae thrust the spear at Hong Ye-seong, who shamelessly babbled on.\n\"Who was flirting and bickering first? I was being considerate.\"\n\"Damn it, are you blind... Oh, right.\"\nCha Eui-jae rummaged through his inventory and pulled out a round magic stone. Hong Ye-seong, who spotted the stone, gaped and then straightened his posture. He knelt, holding out his hands.\n\"A magic stone!\"\n\"Let's finish our deal with this. Don't come looking for me at dawn again.\"\n\"What about the hangover soup?\"\n\"Ask them to pack it for you.\"\n\"Oh, I wanted to try it.\"\nGrumbling, Hong Ye-seong waved his hands as if to hurry. Just as Cha Eui-jae was about to place the magic stone in his hands, he snatched it back. Hong Ye-seong's eyes widened.\n\"What, what's this? Why take it back?\"\n\"Since I didn't give it to you yet, it's not taking it back. Anyway, Do me one more favor.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nCha Eui-jae squatted down to meet Hong Ye-seong's gaze and whispered, covering his mouth with one hand.\n\"Answer quietly so no one can hear. Make me a mask in exchange for the magic stone.\"\n\"A mask?\"\n\"Yeah. One that covers the whole face, changes the voice, allows for comfortable breathing, and doesn't obstruct vision. Nothing flashy in design.\"\nCha Eui-jae carefully listed the requirements, folding each finger. Hong Ye-seong scratched his head and said bluntly.\n\"That's just asking for a J mask. Are you revealing yourself?\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nTheir eyes met. Hong Ye-seong's clear eyes sparkled brightly. Cha Eui-jae unconsciously opened his mouth a bit.\nT-this guy...\nHong Ye-seong blinked, tilting his head.\n\"Oh, wait. Is this a breach of our contract? But I didn't dig on purpose, just noticed. That's not a breach, right? I tried so hard not to take an interest.\"\nHow did he know?\nIn that moment, a contract scrawled messily with ink-soaked brushes flashed in his mind.\n[Clause 1 of the contract between Hong Ye-seong and Secretary Kim.]\n[The oddball Hong Ye-seong shall not be curious about or investigate Secretary Kim, whom he met today. He shall not attempt to dig into his background. This also applies to others whom he might instruct to do so.]\nDamn it. The contract was entirely made to prevent Hong Ye-seong from investigating his background. Of course. Until just a few hours ago, he hadn't expected to enter a dungeon with Hong Ye-seong!\nHong Ye-seong was more perceptive than he thought, and he had showcased his skills too much. Cha Eui-jae clenched his fist unconsciously. Could physical memory deletion work on this guy?\nThen, Hong Ye-seong stretched and replied.\n\"Well, making a mask is easy, so don't worry. Just give me the stone already!\"\n\"Easy?\"\n\"How long do you think it will take? A week tops. I'll send it to Kkokko once it's done.\"\nHong Ye-seong winked and gave a thumbs up, striking the same pose as in the photo on the Artisan Exhibition banner. It instilled a strange sense of trust.\nCha Eui-jae shoved the magic stone into the hands of the world's top artisan. Hong Ye-seong screeched like a monkey, elated. After a while, he shouted to Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"Hey! Student! Any magic stones over there? A monster this strong must have some decent ones!\"\n\"Magic stones? Uh, what do they look like?\"\n\"Usually round like this... Eh, I'll come find it myself.\"\nHong Ye-seong ran towards the golem. He stuck to it like a frog and began climbing. Watching his innocent back, Cha Eui-jae felt a vague unease.\n...Doesn't he know everything by now? With an awkward expression, Cha Eui-jae ruffled his hair. Lee Sa-young, who had approached from behind, spoke languidly.\n\"Didn't you come here with a purpose too?\"\n\"Huh? Yeah.\"\nAfter the excitement subsided, the purpose of their visit to this place came back to mind: investigating the eroded Dungeon. This place resembled both the West Sea Rift and the world that faced the apocalypse. It was bound to be related to one of them.\nMoreover, the master of the reconstructed dungeon, which had reacted to Cha Eui-jae's title, possessed a fragment from the world Yoon Ga-eul had retrieved from her dreams.\nIndeed, it seemed like Cha Eui-jae's very presence was the trigger...\nJust as Cha Eui-jae was about to delve deeper into his thoughts,\n\"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\"\n\"Whoa!\"\nKkokko let out a loud crow and took off from the golem, flapping its wings. Yoon Ga-eul and Hong Ye-seong were each hanging from one of Kkokko's feet.\nThe flight, which seemed precariously close to ending in a fall, fortunately concluded safely. Though Hong Ye-seong did crash face-first into the ground. Yoon Ga-eul, with a flushed face, took out the fragment from her pocket.\n\"Look at this, the fragment!\"\nThe white shard had a few strands of black light swirling around it. Yoon Ga-eul quickly explained,\n\"This is the first time I've found a fragment outside of a dream. No other eroded Dungeon has had fragments appear either. The difference with this dungeon is...\"\nAs Yoon Ga-eul's gaze swept over the ruined surroundings, it briefly met Cha Eui-jae's before quickly darting away as if burned. She seemed to have the same thought.\nThe eroded dungeon, restructured in response to Cha Eui-jae, had an interior and monsters reminiscent of an apocalyptic landscape.\nAt the core of all these issues was Cha Eui-jae.\nShould he share this information? There were too many connections between the apocalypse and the West Sea Rift for him to handle alone. Yoon Ga-eul murmured awkwardly,\n\"First, let's discuss this outside since it's dangerous here...\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded slightly and added,\n\"And once we leave, the authorities will likely question us, so let's get our stories straight here. Tell Jung Bin when he wakes up.\"\n\"What should I tell him?\"\nYoon Ga-eul asked, her face tense. Cha Eui-jae pulled up the hood that had slipped off long ago and turned away from Yoon Ga-eul and Hong Ye-seong. Behind him, Lee Sa-young was waiting.\nCha Eui-jae gazed at Lee Sa-young quietly. He recalled the first time they met, the moment they made a contract, carrying out Lee Sa-young's request, visiting the Artisan Exhibition together, and the time Lee Sa-young collapsed. He also remembered holding the fallen Lee Sa-young, helpless to do anything.\nReflecting on it, Lee Sa-young had been present at every moment since the West Sea Rift.\nCha Eui-jae now knew that if Lee Sa-young called for him, he would come immediately. And if Cha Eui-jae called, Lee Sa-young would come too. Enough time had passed, and enough trust had been built. For Cha Eui-jae, who had lost everything and was rebuilding his life anew, this trust was as deep as the ocean.\nKnowing there was someone waiting for him was a joy he understood better than anyone, and he couldn't ignore it.\nCha Eui-jae took a step toward Lee Sa-young, maintaining eye contact, and said,\n\"Tell them that J is back.\"\nLee Sa-young smiled as if he had been waiting for this.",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Coming Back\n\"...So.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"In summary of what I've heard so far.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Ga-eul went into the eroded dungeon to find a fragment of the world, and Hong Ye-seong, who had suddenly disappeared, entered the dungeon with her for some unknown reason.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"For some reason, the dungeon was restructured. In the midst of that, I encountered you, and while I was protecting you from the dungeon master and lost consciousness, J suddenly appeared and defeated the golem in one blow?\"\nCrunch.\n\"Exactly.\"\n\"And J said to tell everyone that he has returned? Directly?\"\n\"Correct. J is incredibly strong. As expected from the number one in the rankings. He pierced through that huge golem in one blow, wow.\"\n\"Bawk!\"\n\"...Do I have to believe that?\"\n\"What can I do if it's true? It's sad if you don't believe me even when I'm telling the truth.\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nA deep sigh escaped as if the ground was sinking. The owner of the sigh was Jung Bin, who was sitting on a hospital bed wrapped in bandages.\nAround the bed were baskets of fruits and flowers and boxes of health drinks. The pink ribbon with the message wishing for a speedy recovery fluttered in the breeze coming through the open window.\nHe placed his relatively intact left hand on his forehead and murmured.\n\"How did the story of my collapse spread?\"\n\"Well, through the ranker chat? It seems it only circulated in the first channel. It was shared by big guilds like HB Guild, Pado Guild, and Samra Guild.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There are no secrets in information powerhouse Korea, official-nim.\"\nNext to Jung Bin, who was staring blankly at the white ceiling, was Hong Ye-seong in patient clothes, munching on a red apple. At his bedside, a chicken was sitting curled up. Compared to Jung Bin, he looked quite clean.\nThe place where a critically ill patient, a mildly ill patient, and a chicken were lying down was the inpatient room within the Seowon Guild. It was a cozy and secret space only allowed for those who had received permission from Guild Leader Nam Woo-jin, but it wasn't comfortable. After all, Nam Woo-jin was about to come to hear their stories.\nThe problem was that Jung Bin knew nothing about the current situation. The last sensation left in his head was the enormous fist flying towards him and the excruciating pain that made his body feel like it was breaking apart. When he opened his eyes, he saw the white ceiling of the Seowon Guild.\nAs soon as he barely regained consciousness and blinked his stiff eyelids, he turned his head toward the sound of movement and saw Hong Ye-seong, the very person who made him want to flee, sitting there.\nBefore Jung Bin could say anything, Hong Ye-seong brazenly and kindly pressed the call bell. Immediately, a marionette arrived and smoothly pulled Jung Bin's bed to the examination room.\n'Something is wrong.'\nJung Bin thought while being connected to countless machines and an IV. He needed to gather more information from Hong Ye-seong, who had barely been released from endless tests.\nBut he was of little help, as the countless words Hong Ye-seong and the chicken babbled could be summarized in one sentence.\n'And then J appeared...'\nWas this some sort of master key? Did they think everything would be resolved by mentioning J? Of course, before the West Sea Rift, it was mostly like that, but not now.\nHe was tired. Just being around Hong Ye-seong drained his mental energy. Despite his dizzy head, Jung Bin summoned his public servant spirit.\n\"First... please do not touch the gifts addressed to me. They need to be sent back. You can have the ones from the Awakened Management Bureau.\"\n\"What, are there still price limits on gifts?\"\n\"Yes, it's the law. There's no good in being indebted to guilds or hunters... it's best not to receive anything at all.\"\n\"That's so lame.\"\n\"Yes, don't become a public servant. It's an extreme job where you have to clean up after people like Hong Ye-seong with a battered body.\"\nJung Bin answered gently and began typing something quickly on his phone with his left hand. It was a message to the security team, which was likely still on emergency duty. Hong Ye-seong, who wiped his hands with a wet tissue, grumbled.\n\"Did you just insult me?\"\n\"You're perceptive. Yes, I did.\"\nJust as Hong Ye-seong pouted his lips to start grumbling in earnest.\nKnock, knock. There was a rhythmic knock. The white sliding door opened smoothly, and a man in a white coat walked in silently.\n\"Seeing you chattering away, you must be doing alright. I was shocked when a corpse was brought in.\"\nIt was Nam Woo-jin. He adjusted his glasses and crossed his arms. Jung Bin let out a small groan and corrected his posture.\n\"You're here.\"\n\"Stay lying down. Although the treatment is over, you need to rest more. If it weren't for the chains, it would have been difficult to recover with my abilities.\"\nHis pure white eyes glanced at the cast on Jung Bin's right arm. Jung Bin smiled bitterly.\n\"Yes, thank you.\"\n\"Alright...\"\nNam Woo-jin rubbed the back of his neck and let out a small sigh.\n\"I can't help but listen to the story. I received a formal report from Lee Sa-young. There was a sudden dungeon restructuring phenomenon in the eroded Dungeon, and the dungeon's grade was upgraded to S+. Is that right?\"\n\"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\"Do we know the cause of the restructuring?\"\n\"Not yet.\"\n\"Well, J said it was because of him.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"Yes?\"\nJung Bin and Nam Woo-jin widened their eyes at Hong Ye-seong. However, the person who dropped the bombshell was engrossed in peeling an orange.\n\"J said so. He thinks the dungeon restructuring happened because of him, but he doesn't know why yet. Until he finds out, he said he would only appear when absolutely necessary, like this time.\"\n\"...\"\nHis voice was unexpectedly calm, indicating it was no joke. And the J that Jung Bin knew was someone who could say such things. Nam Woo-jin muttered.\n\"So J actually appeared. It wasn't a system error; he actually escaped from the West Sea Rift alive.\"\nJung Bin glanced at the thinking Nam Woo-jin. There was a peculiar heat in the pure white eyes staring into space while touching his lips. Even though his eyes and the light in his head were taken away, his thirst for knowledge was endless. It seemed he would not be satisfied even if he burned himself out entirely.\nJung Bin deliberately coughed loudly. Cough, cough. When his shoulders shook, the white eyes turned towards him. Fortunately, the strange heat that had momentarily flickered soon subsided, replaced by concern for the patient.\n\"Are you alright? Is the room temperature a bit low?\"\n\"No, it's fine. It's just right.\"\n\"Alright... I'll contact Ham Seok-jeong. Don't even think about going out until your right arm is fully healed.\"\nNam Woo-jin, who issued a stern warning, fluttered his gown and left the room. Jung Bin rubbed his mouth and took a quiet breath. The weather outside was surprisingly sunny. As he gazed at the leaves shimmering in light green in the warm sunlight, Jung Bin spoke.\n\"Hong Ye-seong.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"How was J?\"\nHong Ye-seong widened his eyes. Jung Bin murmured.\n\"Did he seem alright? Was he hurt anywhere?\"\nWhat was J like in Jung Bin's memory? Too much time had accumulated since their last encounter, making it indistinct.\nAt that time, everyone was on edge. It was hard enough just to survive. The most they could do when they occasionally crossed paths was a nod.\nNo, there was a time when he offered J a cigarette. There was also a day when J seemed in a good mood. Probably. Because J was a person, too.\nHong Ye-seong quietly handed over a cleanly peeled orange cut in half. Jung Bin widened his eyes and stared at the orange flesh.\nOnly after being urged a couple of times did he finally take it. Hong Ye-seong smiled.\n\"He seemed alright.\"\n\"...\"\n\"He smiled after breaking the golem. It was kind of scary.\"\n\"...Is that so?\"\nFinally, Jung Bin smiled faintly. He clumsily tore off a piece of orange with one hand and put it in his mouth. His soft face twisted subtly.\n\"...It's sour.\"\n\"That's why I gave it to you.\"\n\"...\"\nBaaawk! The chicken let out a long cry. It sounded like a laugh, or perhaps a sneer.\n***\nThe day before Jung Bin and Hong Ye-seong were admitted, at the entrance of the underground dungeon in Jongno 3-ga.\nThud. A pair of trembling hiking boots stepped out of the dungeon entrance onto the ground. The boots were covered in dirt, white ash, and bloodstains, all mixed together. Cutting through the quiet dawn air, the owner of the boots spoke in a trembling voice.\n\"So... heavy.\"\nHong Ye-seong, who was holding Jung Bin like a princess, made a crying face. With a broken arm, he couldn't carry him on his back, and he couldn't wrap the person who had protected them in a mat, so carrying him was the only option. Lee Sa-young briskly walked past the trembling Hong Ye-seong like a newborn calf.\n\"Bear with it.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young, can't you carry him?\"\nLee Sa-young twisted his lips as he turned back.\n\"Ah... if you want to see Jung Bin die, go ahead.\"\n\"You bastard.\"\nHong Ye-seong made a face as if he was about to cry. Cha Eui-jae, who was standing next to Lee Sa-young, mumbled awkwardly.\n\"Should I carry him...\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Sa-young moved slightly to block Cha Eui-jae's view.\n\"Hyung, don't even think about meeting Nam Woo-jin.\"\n\"Cut it out, you crazy bastard.\"\nCha Eui-jae pushed Lee Sa-young's head away. The actions of the two, bickering back and forth, had a natural familiarity as if they had been doing it for a long time. Watching this, Yoon Ga-eul cautiously called out to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"But... J.\"\nCha Eui-jae responded with a questioning sound, \"Hm?\" At the same time, Lee Sa-young's sharp gaze also focused on her. Feeling a sudden chill, Yoon Ga-eul pretended to brush off the dirt on her pants and muttered with her head down.\n\"Telling everyone that J has returned is good and all... but what about the hangover soup restaurant?\"\n\"Hm? The hangover soup restaurant? Why?\"\n\"Well... if you're going to be working as J, won't you have to quit the restaurant job?\"\n\"Of course not.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I'm going to do both.\"\n\"What?\"\nWith a confident smile, Cha Eui-jae put his hands behind his back.\n\"Hero J and the part-time worker at the hangover soup restaurant, Cha Eui-jae, are different people. Right?\"\nIn the era of great hunters, where hunters are also models, actors, and even dungeon ASMR YouTubers, the number one ranked hunter confidently declared he would have two jobs: a hunter and a part-time worker at a hangover soup restaurant.\n◄\n☰\n►\n43 responses to \"Episode 95: Coming Back\"AnonymousOctober 9, 2024\nPoor Jung Bin is so done with Hong Ye-seong\nHe's like a mom with multiple kids, but Hong Ye-seong is the most troublesome out of all of them\nLiked by 66 people\nReplyAnonymousJanuary 8, 2025\nI wonder how he even lasted these many years.

      "content": "Chapter 96: Trigger\nSunlight filtered through the glass adorned with a faded red sticker advertising hangover soup. The hangover soup restaurant was unusually quiet today during the ingredient preparation time. Park Ha-eun was at a friend's house, there were no missing ingredients, and the meat was simmering nicely on its own.\nAs a result, Cha Eui-jae sat alone at the counter, leisurely flipping through a paper newspaper for the first time in a while. The pleasant warmth of the sunlight, the familiar commercial jingles from the brown tube TV, and the rustling feel of the paper under his fingertips—all were welcome and nostalgic, just like before the Day of the Rift.\n'...'\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his temple with his fist and tilted his head.\nIs that why hunters often come here? To reflect on the fact that there were once ordinary days, even though the world and themselves have changed?\n'Well, it might just be because hangover soup is cheap...'\nCha Eui-jae brushed off the sentimental thoughts that had surfaced for the first time in a long time. He decided it was more efficient to enjoy the rare peaceful afternoon and leisure instead of dwelling on emotions.\n'But it really has been a while.'\nWhen did it all start? Getting entangled with hunters. In his mind, he saw a glamorous and beautiful face smiling with a twisted lip. Thinking of Lee Sa-young's face, which exuded a striking presence like a bright red rose, Cha Eui-jae sighed deeply.\n'It's all because of Lee Sa-young.'\nFrom the moment he met him, he should have acknowledged that his peaceful life had crossed the Samdocheon 1 . Smacking his lips, Cha Eui-jae folded the newspaper and stood up, stretching.\nBut thanks to Lee Sa-young, he realized what he truly wanted. Picking up a broom, Cha Eui-jae spread his hand wide. Faint golden lines shimmered on his skin.\nCha Eui-jae wanted to protect people. He never wanted to experience the helpless loss of someone precious again. Why hadn't he realized this simple and obvious fact until now?\nAs if someone had blindfolded him...\nClang, the dustpan he tripped over flipped over. Startled, Cha Eui-jae gripped the tighter and sighed deeply again. Just then, the TV was airing a public service ad about the hotline for each country in case of gas attacks.\nEverything was about Lee Sa-young. Glancing at the gas mask, Cha Eui-jae started sweeping.\nDespite defeating an S+ grade golem in one hit and revealing himself as J, Cha Eui-jae's quiet daily life hadn't changed much.\nHe opened the shop, watched Lee Sa-young on TV, took care of Park Ha-eun, looked after his grandmother's health, watched Lee Sa-young on TV, and closed the shop. Hangover soup was still selling well, and the customers were the same as ever, with the same attitude. To an almost eerie extent.\n***\nSeveral days had passed since he declared his double job, but Cha Eui-jae's life remained quiet. In fact, it was quieter than usual. Lee Sa-young, Yoon Ga-eul, Hong Ye-seong, and Jung Bin were all nowhere to be seen.\nHe thought they must be busy with their own circumstances. The Awakened Management Bureau must be harassing them relentlessly. He assumed they were managing on their own.\nAnd then one day, new news arrived at the shop. In the form of a person.\n\"Hello, customer.\"\nToday, A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi suddenly showed up, standing stiffly at the entrance in his black suit and sunglasses.\nYeah, finally, the crusher of today's quiet life has arrived. Cha Eui-jae wasn't surprised and opened the door. Seo Min-gi, who had conveniently timed his visit during the ingredient preparation time, handed over a heavy paper bag.\n\"This is a gift.\"\n\"Why suddenly a gift?\"\n\"Oh. I was on a business trip to Daejeon. I bought something for you while I was there. \"It's bread.\"\n\"Daejeon?\"\n\"Yes, Hong Ye-seong mentioned wanting to eat fried soboro 2 from a certain bakery in Daejeon, so I thought he might have gone there after escaping. \"It was delicious.\"\nCha Eui-jae remembered the text message that had arrived on Choi Go-yo's phone. The message from Seo Min-gi after Hong Ye-seong's escape, and Choi Go-yo rushing out as soon as he saw it.\nThey must have formed a tracking team to find Hong Ye-seong. While the runaway was leisurely munching on boiled eggs!\nCha Eui-jae was going to pity Seo Min-gi, who had gone through such trouble, but seeing his slightly plumper cheeks and healthy complexion...\n'Looks like he ate well and had fun?'\nIt seemed more like I had been on vacation than a business trip. Well, the tyrannical boss must have been busy too, so he must have enjoyed it. Cha Eui-jae put aside his worry and sympathy. Seo Min-gi, looking more energetic than ever, put the bag on the table and spoke seriously.\n\"There were many delicious-looking breads, but I bought a gift set since it was a gift. If there's any bread you find tasty or want to eat, let me know. I'll get it for you.\"\n\"No, you don't have to go that far.\"\n\"No.\"\nSeo Min-gi shook his head firmly and spoke seriously.\n\"For the past few days, the first team of the Pado Guild's combat support team has been operating as your close backup team. That's our Guild Leader Lee Sa-young's order.\"\n\"...Excuse me?\"\nCha Eui-jae looked at Seo Min-gi with a dazed expression. But Seo Min-gi's pale face was more serious than ever. The combat support team, a select few elite members of the Pado Guild, including A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi and Romantic Opener Choi Go-yo. They weren't a team to support guild members?\nSeo Min-gi pushed up his sunglasses.\n\"There's no need to be surprised, J. We have the title of a combat support team, but we're actually the guild leader's direct minion team. We do whatever we're told. This time, it's backing you up. Oh, and we're also diligently keeping the rankers' mouths shut!\"\n'Minions...'\nCha Eui-jae looked at Seo Min-gi, who gave a thumbs up with a bright smile, with a hint of pity. Clearing his throat, Seo Min-gi looked around and leaned in to whisper.\n\"Let me explain briefly about this case. The Awakened Management Bureau has no intention of revealing J's return. The eroded dungeon itself is not well-known, and this time there was an unprecedented event of dungeon reconstruction. \"It's the first in the world.\"\n\"Forks.\"\n\"Being first isn't always good. No matter how much this country is obsessed with ranking and making lists, being the first in this kind of event... well.\"\nSeo Min-gi rubbed his chin with his fingers and briefly said.\n\"It rather incites fear. The fear and anxiety of 'What if it happens again?' kind of thing.\"\nThe public is more easily swayed than you might think. Fear is the best emotion to manipulate people. Watching Cha Eui-jae's expression, Seo Min-gi cautiously continued.\n\"Well... the countries don't want to unnecessarily stir up anxiety. There was also the unprecedented event of a rift appearing in the registration center.\"\nCha Eui-jae was there too. Cha Eui-jae clasped his hands together and pressed his forehead against them. Wherever Cha Eui-jae went, incidents happened. As if his very existence was a trigger. Seo Min-gi munched on the vegetable crackers Cha Eui-jae had given him. After swallowing, I shrugged.\n\"The system itself is unrealistic even now... but anyway, when unrealistic events occur multiple times and at close intervals, it's only natural to feel anxious. \"Especially for ordinary people.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Anyway, the hunters who witnessed J all insist they don't know who he is, and since J appeared in a dungeon where a reconstruction phenomenon occurred, it's hard to announce it openly. Besides, you said it yourself, didn't you? \"That you'd show up again if something like this happens.\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"That reassured them somewhat.\"\nIt was an odd statement. Cha Eui-jae looked up at Seo Min-gi. Seo Min-gi was smiling cynically.\n\"It's about trust in J, something like that. \"They believe J won't abandon them.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, anyway.\"\nSeo Min-gi rested his chin on his hand and murmured as if lost in thought.\n\"I've been thinking hard about it. \"They say it's the first time for dungeon reconstruction... but I feel like a similar phenomenon has occurred before.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nIt was a bombshell statement out of nowhere. Cha Eui-jae whispered quietly.\n\"What exactly do you mean?\"\n\"Just what I said. Dungeon reconstruction means the dungeon's form suddenly changes and its rank rises.\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Well... forgive me for being rude, but you've experienced something similar before, haven't you, J?\"\nClenching his fists, Cha Eui-jae's hand gripped the table tightly. His black eyes glowed with a cold blue light as he looked down at Seo Min-gi. The back of his neck chilled automatically. But Seo Min-gi continued steadily.\n\"The West Sea rift was initially rated as a grade 5, but it was upgraded to a grade 1 immediately after your team entered, J.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The phenomenon itself is similar to the eroded dungeon, isn't it? Although the West Sea rift grew larger over time.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Trigger\nThe phenomenon of restructuring in the eroded Dungeon and the upgrade in the grade of the West Sea Rift. As if it had been waiting for Cha Eui-jae to enter, everything changed the moment he stepped in.\nCha Eui-jae swallowed his breath. In truth, he knew. He couldn't help but instinctively realize that he was entangled in all these problems.\nCha Eui-jae, removing his hand from the table, asked quietly.\n\"Can I check the data on the Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon? Or perhaps re-enter it myself?\"\n\"Oh, entering is out of the question. The Guild Leader will strongly oppose it. But reviewing the data is fine. In fact, that's one of the reasons for my visit today. Just a moment.\"\nSeo Min-gi pulled out a thin file from his inventory and handed it over.\n\"This is the investigation report on the restructured Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon. It was personally investigated by Vice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo, so you can trust it. Take your time reading it.\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly skimmed through the file. The dungeon, which was a lucrative spot for potion ingredients before the erosion, had shown abnormal erosion phenomena starting a month ago. The restructured dungeon was a ruin covered in white ash, and when the ash was cleared, broken Korean signboards could be seen...\nCha Eui-jae bit his lip. Korean signboards were also visible in the West Sea Rift and in Yoon Ga-eul's fragments. The puzzle pieces of information were slowly coming together. Seo Min-gi clapped his hands and stood up from the table.\n\"Then, I'll inform you as soon as any additional information comes in.\"\n\"...Yes. Could you also provide information on other eroded dungeons?\"\n\"Of course. You can ask me to do anything. Espionage, information gathering, and manipulation are my specialties.\"\nSeo Min-gi confidently declared himself an expert in illegal manipulation, but Cha Eui-jae, having benefited from his skills before, couldn't doubt his abilities. The problem was that he seemed to be missing a screw somewhere.\n\"I've delivered everything for today... I'll take my leave now. Here, take my business card. If you need anything, contact me.\"\nPolitely handing over his business card with both hands, Cha Eui-jae also accepted it with both hands and read it. Pado Guild Battle Support Team 1, A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi. Seo Min-gi, standing at the door with his hands clasped behind his back, spoke solemnly.\n\"Feel free to contact us anytime. Our support team is always on standby to back you up.\"\nUpon reflection, this was the third Pado Guild business card Cha Eui-jae had seen. One from the warning sent to Lee Sa-young, one from the top operator Romance Opener Choi Go-yo, and now Seo Min-gi's.\nFiddling with Seo Min-gi's business card, Cha Eui-jae slipped it into his apron pocket. Seo Min-gi waved his hands goodbye and turned to push the door.\nAt that moment, Cha Eui-jae spoke.\n\"By the way... if you're an information investigation specialist, can you find people too?\"\n\"People?\"\n\"Yes. They might be dead now.\"\n\"Oh, you're putting me to work right away. You know how to make use of people.\"\nSeo Min-gi, who was about to open the door, closed it again and turned around. He pushed up his sunglasses and pulled out a familiar tablet from his inventory, blocking the door.\n\"If you have clear information and instructions, it's possible. But if they died on the Day of the Rift, it might be difficult. The whole society was paralyzed back then... there are still unidentified deceased people.\"\n\"They didn't die on the Day of the Rift.\"\nTouching his mouth and reminiscing, Cha Eui-jae added slowly.\n\"They might have died about three years after the Day of the Rift, or maybe later. In any case, they died after the West Sea Rift.\"\nSeo Min-gi's hand paused at the mention of the West Sea Rift. Scratching his temple with his tablet pen, he asked.\n\"Are you certain they are dead? Did you confirm it yourself?\"\n\"No, I didn't. But... they are probably dead.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nSeo Min-gi looked up at Cha Eui-jae from under his bowed head, his black eyes scrutinizing Cha Eui-jae's face as he muttered.\n\"But judging by your words, it's not certain. Let's consider them missing.\"\nHe scribbled something on his tablet and asked.\n\"What about their name, age, appearance? Please provide basic personal information and physical characteristics.\"\nHe waited with his pen poised, but Cha Eui-jae found himself at a rare loss for words. After hesitating for a while, he finally managed to give a clumsy answer.\n\"I don't know their name or face. They are somewhat younger than me.\"\n\"Hmm. So you don't know their exact age either?\"\n\"...No.\"\nFrowning as if deep in thought, Seo Min-gi muttered.\n\"This might be impolite, but... what do you know about this person?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm not blaming you; I'm asking to get more detailed information. Did they live in a particular area, graduate from a specific school? Anything that could start the investigation, no matter how small. Anything.\"\nCha Eui-jae, deep in thought with his arms crossed, finally spoke in a low, resonant voice.\n\"I saved a child from the Mangwon Rift...\"\n\"...\"\n\"They were the sole survivor of that Rift.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Their entire body was damaged from being covered in poison, and they inhaled poison, damaging their vocal cords. The only functional sense was their hearing, but they couldn't move their body, making proper communication impossible. All identifying information was dissolved in the poison swamp. So...\"\nThe long-buried memory slowly resurfaced. Cha Eui-jae quietly lowered his eyes. Something surged within him, but he swallowed it down.\n***\nA tall young man in a black combat suit stood with his arms crossed in front of a glass wall. Beyond the glass was a stark white room.\nOn the operating table lay a boy so disfigured that his original form was unrecognizable. One might think he was a corpse, but J knew he was barely breathing. Numerous machines connected to him sustained his thin thread of life.\nAt that moment, the door of the intensive care unit opened, and a surgeon, wiping sweat, came out. J spoke softly.\n\"Doctor.\"\nHis voice was curiously altered, making it impossible to discern his gender or age from the voice alone. His tall height and solid build suggested he was an adult male. The doctor who approached him responded.\n\"You've been waiting.\"\nThe black mask glanced at the doctor.\n\"Can you save him?\"\nThe doctor swallowed hard.\n\"J, to be very honest... I can't guarantee it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"As you know, wounds inflicted by monsters are difficult to treat with modern medical technology. Simple external injuries can be treated by combining modern medicine and potions, but...\"\nThe doctor's eyes turned to the boy.\n\"In a state where he's so severely poisoned, it's a miracle he's still alive. Without the antidote you've been continuously administering, he would've died long ago.\"\nJ silently turned his gaze back to the scene beyond the glass.\nThat evening, an absorption rift appeared in the middle of Mangwon-dong. The sudden rift swallowed up people and buildings indiscriminately, turning a 3km radius around it into ruins.\nJ headed straight to the Mangwon rift from the dungeon in Chungju and came out with something in his arms after a whole day. Hunters on standby approached, but J stepped back, signaling them not to come closer.\nWhat J held was a small lump wrapped tightly in a blanket.\nA familiar hunter approached.\n\"It's a poison rift, is it safe for you, J? And that...\"\nJ responded urgently, out of character.\n\"It will soon disappear.\"\n\"Pardon? Then the other survivors...\"\nJ's gaze fell on the small bundle in his arms. He murmured.\n\"Only this child. No other survivors.\"\nWith that, he disappeared with the child in his arms. Moments later, the entrance to the rift was filled with charred corpses.\nJ tapped his mask's mouth and spoke.\n\"If there's poison.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"If the poison the child was covered in exists. Can it be used to make an antidote?\"\nThe doctor pondered, biting his lip. Analyzing the serum of a poisoned animal to create an antidote was common. Recently, several potion makers had emerged among the awakened ones, so gathering them for research might make it possible. But...\n\"It would be possible, but... I'm unsure if the child can hold out until then. And whether we can collect enough poison...\"\n\"Let's try.\"\nJ turned to leave. The doctor, taken aback, grabbed him.\n\"Pardon? What do you mean...\"\n\"I'll collect it. I know what monster's poison it is.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Money, time, manpower, it doesn't matter. Just proceed.\"\n\"...Understood.\"\n\"Until then, treat him with the common antidote I provide.\"\nHe walked out of the suffocating space. Soon, he was in the hospital hallway. People's eyes followed his straight back. Expectation, admiration, reverence, fear. The wristwatch on his arm rang noisily with a call. J put on his earpiece and pressed the answer button.\n\"This is J.\"\n—Ah, got through. One moment.\nA gentle female voice was heard. It was Ham Seok-jeong, Director of the Awakened Management Bureau.\n—A rift appeared in Mokpo. It's a grade 4 rift, can you handle it? There are no hunters nearby capable of dealing with a grade 4 rift.\n\"Yes, sure. Am I going in alone?\"\n—It seems so. Jung Bin is involved in a suppression operation.\n\"Understood. Please prepare for immediate transport.\"\n—Alright, I'll have a helicopter prepared at headquarters.\nHam Seok-jeong also seemed very busy, as the call ended quickly.\nJ swiftly moved out of the hospital. The world, still bearing the scars of the Day of the Rift, was eerily quiet. The laughter of children, their playful shouts, and the everyday conversations of people had long vanished.\nIn that silence, a voice, damaged and raspy from poison, echoed in J's ears.\n\"Save... me...\"\nJ stopped walking.\nWithin the rift, where everything had melted away into a horrifying mess from the poison, J searched for the faintest trace of life. Hoping that it wouldn't disappear before he arrived, that it would hold on just a bit longer.\nAnd finally, between the collapsed buildings, after tearing down an outer wall, he found a dying boy who had been embraced by two people melted by the poison. Despite his blurred and melted eyes, the boy managed to look at J. His small lips moved.\n\"Please save me.\"\nThat sight reminded J of himself at 17, also desperately seeking help...\nJ had no choice but to grasp the boy's hand.\nFor he alone understood the weight and responsibility held in that hand.",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Trigger\nThat day, he never once regretted holding that boy's hand at the Mangwon Rift. However...\nCha Eui-jae muttered nonchalantly with his hands in his apron pockets.\n\"He got a lot better with continuous treatment. Well, he wasn't completely cured. He needed periodic antidote treatments... but I couldn't return from the West Sea Rift. The supply of antidote materials must have stopped.\"\nWhat weighed on his mind was that he couldn't take full responsibility. The boy, who likely died quietly due to J's absence, lingered in a corner of his heart.\nDid J save everyone who entered the West Sea Rift after leaving the boy behind? No. He saved no one. Moreover, he lives on, thrown into a peace that exists without him. The back of the hero, once idolized, was stained with failure.\nPerhaps that's why the people he saved from the Jongno 3-ga underground dungeon felt more precious to him. They were people he saved after countless failures.\nCha Eui-jae, not understanding why he was telling this long-buried, scattered story, continued speaking awkwardly. Come to think of it, he had never shared this story with anyone before.\nAs he scuffed the sole of his shoe on the ground, he added,\n\"It's been 8 years since I entered a rift. That's how it is.\"\n\"....\"\nSeo Min-gi listened silently, without a hint of sympathy or worry. That made Cha Eui-jae feel more at ease. The man, tapping his tablet pen on the screen, finally spoke.\n\"I'm just confirming, so please don't be offended. Have you ever tried hiring a detective agency? There are many errand centers run by hunters nowadays.\"\n\"I tried, but they kicked me out as soon as I mentioned the conditions. Well, it's understandable.\"\n\"And requesting to view medical records? If it was 8 years ago, there should still be records at the hospital.\"\n\"Of course, I tried that. They said only the patient, family, or legal guardian could access the records.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\n\"Well, J might be able to get them, but I'm not J, I'm Cha Eui-jae.\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at the calendar.\n\"And in the first place... I didn't admit him to the hospital through formal procedures.\"\n\"...Pardon?\"\nSeeing Seo Min-gi's puzzled reaction, Cha Eui-jae confessed a secret he had been holding back.\n\"I, uh, secretly admitted him under J's name. I had some dealings with the hospital.\"\n\"Pardon me?\"\nSeo Min-gi's voice rose an octave. Cha Eui-jae shrugged.\n\"Back then, they rarely accepted people who were sure to die. There were too many people injured by monsters, and... there was a shortage of manpower and hospital beds. Most people thought it was better to save more than ten others than to hold onto someone who was already dying. Hunter hospitals were even more so.\"\nThree years after the Day of the Rift. Thanks to J and Jung Bin's efforts, South Korea regained stability faster than other countries, but confusion still lingered.\nThere were no rift detectors, no healers. The only treatment for monster-inflicted wounds was the rare potion. In such circumstances, there was no place that would provide a bed for a civilian dying from poison. It was too obvious they would die soon.\nCha Eui-jae reminisced and added,\n\"And we kept the boy's existence a secret from the outside world. It could have become troublesome.\"\n\"Ah, I understand. It could have become a vulnerability. Especially for someone like J.\"\nNodding, Seo Min-gi carefully observed Cha Eui-jae's reaction.\n\"Sorry if that was too blunt.\"\n\"No, you're right.\"\nA brief silence followed. What was the point of finding someone who was probably already dead? Still, Cha Eui-jae felt he had to find even the smallest trace. That was the duty of the survivor.\nWith a low sigh, Seo Min-gi nodded slowly and put away his tablet.\n\"Honestly, there aren't many clues, so I can't guarantee we'll find him, but I have an idea of where to start.\"\nHe pushed up his sunglasses with a serious look.\n\"Let's start by thoroughly investigating the hospital. Leave it to me, sir. Which hospital is it?\"\nHe extended his hand for a handshake. When did the promise to commit a crime ever feel this trustworthy? No, this was the first time Seo Min-gi had ever seemed so reliable. Cha Eui-jae took his hand out of his pocket and shook it slowly.\n\"It's now called Hunter National Hospital. It used to be a private hospital.\"\n\"...Pardon? Hunter National Hospital?\"\n\"Yes, national.\"\nSeo Min-gi's face seemed to turn pale. He began fidgeting with his fingers, as if trying to pull his hand away. But,\n[Trait: Enhanced Strength (S+) activated.]\nCha Eui-jae never let go once he grabbed hold of something. Seo Min-gi's hand turned white under the tight grip. He spoke in a trembling voice like a goat.\n\"S-Sir? You're really strong.\"\n\"Pardon? We're just shaking hands.\"\nSqueeze.\n\"Ouch, ouch, ouch.\"\n\"You'll do it, right?\"\n\"Ah. D-Did you know that Hunter National Hospital is closely connected with major guilds and most large guilds, sir?\"\n\"It seems to have grown a lot in 8 years.\"\n\"Ouch, the security is also very tight.\"\n\"I just found that out.\"\n\"...Ouch. Alright, I'll do my best.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nOnly then did Cha Eui-jae smile and release his grip. Seo Min-gi, wincing, poured a potion over his hand from his inventory. Cha Eui-jae also took out a beginner hunter's potion kit he had received as a gift and sprinkled it over Seo Min-gi's hand.\nOnce the whitened hand regained its color, Seo Min-gi sullenly grabbed the door handle.\n\"Please understand that it might take some time to infiltrate a national hospital.\"\n\"It's alright. I'm used to waiting.\"\n\"Yes, if you need anything else, please contact me. And if you have to act as J, please contact me or the Guild Leader.\"\nThe last request was unexpected. Cha Eui-jae blinked.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Huh? To back you up, of course.\"\nSeo Min-gi also blinked. Cha Eui-jae was momentarily stunned, as if struck by something.\nThe contract with Lee Sa-young was made when he didn't know Cha Eui-jae and J were the same person. Now that he knew, he could have extracted anything from him... so why wasn't he?\nAs one question arose, others followed, intertwining like ropes. Cha Eui-jae suddenly asked,\n\"Why are you helping me so much? This isn't part of the contract.\"\n\"Well... I don't know either, but...\"\nSeo Min-gi awkwardly adjusted his sunglasses, revealing a glimpse of his dark circles. After a moment of contemplation, he smiled and opened the door.\n\"Maybe your good deeds are returning to you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You might not have thought of it as a good deed, but to someone else, it could have been salvation.\"\nWith that, Seo Min-gi waved and disappeared into the shadow of the door. Cha Eui-jae stared at the dark shadow for a long time, then let out a long sigh.\n***\nBang! A fist slammed onto a metal desk, making the files on it shake.\n\"For the last time, I don't know who it was. How am I supposed to know the face of someone wearing a mask? You keep making me repeat myself.\"\nThe man sitting in the room with multiple monitors chewed on a paper cup. The screens all showed similar-looking rooms.\nIn the left monitor, Hong Ye-seong slouched in the interrogation room like a melted slime. The hunter sitting across from him asked again with a troubled face,\n\"...But Hunter Hong Ye-seong, how are you sure it was J if you didn't see their face?\"\nHong Ye-seong scoffed.\n\"You know J logged into Channel 1, right? That confirmed he was alive. The director herself verified his survival. He's a person who can destroy an S+ grade golem with one hit, and he wore a mask. Then he said he was J. How could I not believe him? At that moment, I thought the savior had arrived. Really. He came when I was dying.\"\n\"Why did you escape then?\"\n\"Destiny called me.\"\nHong Ye-seong pouted and spouted nonsense. The hunter questioning him sighed unconsciously.\nA dungeon restructuring and an S+ grade upgrade— an unprecedented event. This alone would turn the world upside down, and then J appeared and defeated the S+ grade dungeon's master.\nGoodness, J did it again! The Awakened Management Bureau and the Rift Management Bureau simultaneously went into emergency mode. Since Jung Bin was lying in Seowon Guild in a half-dead state, the Awakened Management Bureau began grilling the Super Hamsters for any information, not wanting to miss even the smallest clue.\nBut,\n\"Can you handle this?\"\nIt was the Awakened Management Bureau that was being grilled...\nThe Super Hamsters were too powerful to be easily grilled. Yoon Ga-eul, thought to be the easiest to coax, used the wild card of being a high school senior to escape, and Lee Sa-young exercised his right to remain silent, emitting such a killing intent that a restraining order was placed against him.\nThe only one speaking was Hong Ye-seong, but he was babbling nonsense. Looking up at the ceiling with clear eyes, Hong Ye-seong yelled,\n\"When will you let me go? I need to work. I have ideas coming to me. Who will be responsible if my ideas die? I need to go to Bukhansan now!\"\nThe hunter looked sheepishly at the CCTV camera in the corner of the ceiling. It was a plea for help. However, the hunter chewing on the paper cup couldn't help him.\n\"Oh my, such rare and precious people are gathered here.\"\nIt was a deep, resonant voice that suddenly filled the room.\nA middle-aged man with neatly slicked black hair streaked with gray and a face lined with wrinkles but still bearing a fierce tiger-like expression had silently entered the monitoring room and was now standing straight.\nWith a tap of his cane on the floor, the hunter chewing on the paper cup hastily stood up and bowed his head.\n\"Ah, Hunter Song Jo-heon, you're here! How did you...\"\nIt was Song Jo-heon, the Guild Leader of Samra Guild, one of the top three guilds in South Korea. With a hearty laugh, Song Jo-heon made a soothing gesture in the air, as if to calm the hunter.\n\"Don't worry. I came with the director's permission.\"\n\"Ah, I see. Yes.\"\n\"Well... I've heard the rough story.\"\nSong Jo-heon's gaze shifted to the central monitor. In another monitor displaying an interrogation room, Lee Sa-young was sitting alone on a metal chair with his legs crossed, eyes closed. A soft smile played on Song Jo-heon's lips.\n\"J has returned, right?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 99: Trigger\n\"J has returned, right?\"\nThe abrupt statement made the hunter cough unexpectedly. While J's survival was well known, his direct return was a fact known only to a select few within the Awakened Management Bureau. Moreover, the news had just recently come in...\nNoticing the skeptical look, Song Jo-heon sighed softly for effect.\n\"A comrade who fought alongside us returned from the brink of death. How could I not rush over? I must be getting old. Haha.\"\n\"Haha...\"\nThe hunter laughed soullessly, glancing at Song Jo-heon as he picked up the fallen paper cup.\n'Where on earth did he hear this from?'\nDespite the suspicious look, Song Jo-heon continued to smile leisurely. He tapped the ground with his cane once.\n\"Good stance... as a talent of the Management Bureau. But don't be too wary.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"I already heard all about it. Yes, from the person you know as well.\"\nSong Jo-heon winked playfully. The wrinkles around his eyes folded pleasantly. At the same time, the subtle pressure he had been exerting since he entered slightly diminished. The hunter forced a smile, wiping a bead of cold sweat from his temple.\nAwakeners who had emerged within half a year since the Day of the Rift were now categorized as early Awakeners or first-generation Awakeners. They were the ones who first discovered their abilities and fought monsters on the front lines and attacked dungeons during a time of chaos and misinformation.\nEleven years had passed since then, and most of the first-generation Awakeners were either deceased or too injured to continue activities, except for a select few.\nThe tiger-like man watched the hunter with a gentle smile. His low, grating voice whispered softly.\n\"I haven't heard the details... but I want to hear more.\"\nSong Jo-heon was one of those rare individuals. He founded Korea's first guild, Samra, which he still managed smoothly, and despite his middle age, his rising rank made him an exemplar among hunters.\nSong Jo-heon rubbed the handle of his cane with his thumb.\n\"That's right. Tell me everything slowly. No need to worry.\"\nThe hunter suddenly wondered why he had doubted him. Didn't Song Jo-heon give interviews about J in documentaries? If you couldn't trust someone like Song Jo-heon, who could you trust? The hunter straightened up and nodded slowly, setting aside the paper cup.\n\"Yes, understood. What would you like to know?\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nWith the suspicion gone from his eyes, Song Jo-heon nodded contentedly.\n\"I want to hear more about J's return...\"\nHis sharp gaze shifted to the monitor.\n\"Did he really say so himself? Has anyone actually seen him alive?\"\n\"Yes, according to Team Leader Jung Bin. But even he didn't meet him directly; he heard it from Hong Ye-seong. It seems Hong Ye-seong was the one who met him...\"\n\"Where is Jung Bin now?\"\n\"Recovering at the Seowon Guild.\"\n\"Can I meet Hong Ye-seong privately?\"\n\"That would be a bit diffi...\"\nBefore the hunter could finish his sentence, Song Jo-heon rubbed his cane again. The hunter's eyes glazed over. As he swallowed and opened his mouth again,\n\"It's possible...\"\nBANG—!!\n\"Ah!\"\nA loud explosion tore through the speaker. Instinctively screaming, the hunter's focus returned. He quickly checked the monitor.\nEverything was as it had been, except for one screen. It was the interrogation room where Lee Sa-young was being held.\nHe had kicked the metal desk to the corner of the room and was now calmly folding his legs. The center of the desk was dented. The hunter clutched his head.\n\"Just when I thought it was quiet for once...\"\nSong Jo-heon clicked his tongue.\n\"Lee Sa-young is at it again. You have a hard job.\"\nThe hunter, still clutching his head, stood up with a gloomy face and grabbed a gas mask.\n\"Sorry, Hunter Song Jo-heon. I have to go.\"\n\"Go ahead. Better stop it before it gets worse.\"\n\"Yes, yes. Thank you for understanding!\"\nBowing his head quickly, the hunter dashed out of the monitor room. Left alone, Song Jo-heon pushed the chair aside with his cane and stood in front of the monitor. Gripping the handle of his cane tightly, he stared at the screen without a hint of a smile.\nLee Sa-young was back in the metal chair, crossing his legs again. Leaning slightly forward, he looked up. His purple eyes fixed directly on the CCTV, as if piercing through to Song Jo-heon in the monitor room. His lips curved smoothly. Lee Sa-young mouthed silently.\n\"Not as you please.\"\nSong Jo-heon's lips twisted fiercely.\n\"You brat...\"\nThey glared at each other for a long moment. Eventually, the monitor showed the hunter, who had rushed out, bursting into Lee Sa-young's interrogation room, panting. Lee Sa-young turned his gaze to the hunter as if he had never looked at the CCTV. Watching this, Song Jo-heon took out his phone. A brief dial tone ended as someone picked up.\n\"It's Song Jo-heon.\"\nHis face was as cold as it had ever been, devoid of any earlier smiles.\n\"Let's meet as soon as possible.\"\nThe man glanced over the monitors one last time before leaving the room without hesitation. The sound of his footsteps faded away.\n***\nThe dim street was lit only by the flickering streetlights. It wasn't a bustling alley to begin with, but today it was especially quiet.\nCha Eui-jae turned up the TV volume a bit more and played an ASMR video of cutting green onions on his phone, placing it on the counter. The small sounds filled the shop, making it somewhat more bearable.\nAfter a while, Cha Eui-jae took off his wet rubber gloves and hung them on a clip, glancing at the door out of the corner of his eye. It had been a few days since Seo Min-gi had visited, and there was still no news from those who had entered the eroded dungeon with him.\nIt's understandable that Jung Bin doesn't know his identity, and Hong Ye-seong is busy and wouldn't come around often, but he has something to collect from him. Cha Eui-jae glared at the ceiling.\n'He said it would take a week to make it, but what a lie...'\n\"How long do you think it will take? A week tops. I'll send it to Kkokko once it's done.\"\nThe thing he was waiting for was a mask.\nWhat was the point of announcing J's return if the Management Bureau had no intention of revealing it, and he couldn't start acting alone without the mask? Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth as he shook off the apron.\n'And why isn't Lee Sa-young contacting me either?'\nWas the Management Bureau holding him and not letting go, or had something else come up? Cha Eui-jae sighed as he untied the tightly knotted apron strings.\nHe was also curious about the content of the fragment Yoon Ga-eul had found, but she hadn't shown up either. Although he knew which school she attended, it was a girls' high school, so visiting was out of the question.\nAt that moment,\nCha Eui-jae suddenly looked up. He sensed a familiar presence at the door. Without further thought, Cha Eui-jae ran from the kitchen through the hall to the door and pushed it open without hesitation.\n\"Hey, you...!\"\nBut the alley remained as empty as ever. Cha Eui-jae looked around, then down. He wondered why he hadn't noticed it before— there was a large black lump by the door, reminiscent of the box Kkokko had been in last time.\nIt was Lee Sa-young.\nWearing a gas mask and a black coat, Lee Sa-young was crouched by the door, looking rather pitiful. Cha Eui-jae was at a loss for words, looking up at the sky, then back at Lee Sa-young, who remained motionless.\nCarefully stepping out of the shop, the chilly night air brushed against his cheeks and hair. Cha Eui-jae stared at Lee Sa-young's curly hair and head, then crouched down beside him.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nSomewhere, a grasshopper chirped. It was still chilly, yet there were already grasshoppers. Cha Eui-jae rolled his eyes and glanced sideways at Lee Sa-young. He remained silent. The night sky, instead of the moon and stars, swirled with black holes, and a plump ant crawled between the cracks of the sidewalk blocks.\nWhen would they take it down? A slightly worn \"Congratulations on Awakening\" banner flapped gently in the breeze. Cha Eui-jae, taking in the familiar and ordinary surroundings, muttered.\n\"Why are you just sitting here?\"\n\"Just.\"\nThe response came surprisingly quickly, given the preceding silence. Just, my foot. Cha Eui-jae stood up with a grunt. He stood before Lee Sa-young and tapped his black boots with the toe of his sneaker. Lee Sa-young slowly raised his head.\nCha Eui-jae, one hand still in his apron pocket, extended his other hand.\n\"Get up. Your knee joints will give out.\"\n\"...\"\nThe gas mask lenses stared at the hand. Thin scars on the firm palm shimmered with a faint golden chain. Cha Eui-jae shook his hand once.\n\"Grab it quickly. I need to close up the shop.\"\nDespite this, Lee Sa-young remained seated, even plopping down on the ground. Not going to stand up? As Cha Eui-jae was about to retract his hand, a cold leather glove grasped it firmly. Before Cha Eui-jae could brace himself, the black hand yanked him forward.\nCha Eui-jae lost his balance and tumbled forward, his eyes widening. The iron door was rapidly approaching.\n'Is this guy repaying kindness with hostility?'\nBefore the indignation reached his head, and before he could brace himself with the hand he had put in his pocket, something tightly grabbed his waist and pulled him back. In the next moment,\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae found himself firmly embraced in a now-familiar, solid chest.",

      "content": "Chapter 100: Trigger\nA sweet scent tickled the tip of his nose, and the soft touch of hair mixed with the cold sensation of a gas mask brushed against the back of his neck. Unconsciously, Cha Eui-jae shuddered. He wasn't slow to assess situations, but now his mind wasn't working properly.\nThump, thump, thump... The sound of a rapid heartbeat echoed loudly, whose heartbeat it was, he couldn't tell. Through the half-opened door, a faint crimson light and TV sound seeped out.\nIn the corner where the light didn't reach, Cha Eui-jae was held by Lee Sa-young. To be precise, he was half-kneeling awkwardly, half-sitting on Lee Sa-young's legs. Cha Eui-jae blinked quietly.\n'...What is this?'\nEven after roughly understanding the situation, that was the only thought that came to mind. His head was filled with questions. Why is this guy crouching by the door, suddenly pulling me and hugging me? Why? As far as he knows, the only other time Lee Sa-young initiated physical contact was when he was in pain in the dungeon.\nIs he hurt somewhere? But there was no distinct smell of blood. If not, is it internal injuries...\nJust as his mind was getting dizzy, a leather-covered thumb brushed against the back of Cha Eui-jae's hand. It seemed he still hadn't let go of the hand he grabbed earlier. Cha Eui-jae voiced his thoughts without hesitation.\n\"What's wrong all of a sudden? Are you hurt somewhere?\"\nA blunt answer came back near his ear.\n\"Just.\"\n\"You think saying 'just' explains everything? Hey, get up. What are you doing, moping in the corner like this?\"\nIf he wasn't really hurt, there was no reason to stay held like this. Cha Eui-jae, answering curtly, shook off the hand that was holding him. However, instead of letting go, Lee Sa-young held on tighter, interlocking their fingers.\nCha Eui-jae widened his eyes and looked at Lee Sa-young's head buried in his neck.\n\"What are you doing?\"\nA low voice responded almost like a sulk.\n\"Just stay like this for a bit.\"\n\"What do you mean stay like this...\"\nMuttering grumpily, Cha Eui-jae stopped trying to pull his hand free. Being held still, he felt like he had become some kind of comfort object. Lee Sa-young's fingers, interlocked with his, moved slightly as if tickling the knuckles on the back of his hand.\nLetting out a short sigh, Cha Eui-jae looked at the swirling black hole before speaking up.\n\"So why were you... here like this?\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you came, you could have knocked on the door, like last time.\"\nHe recalled the day that felt like a scene from a horror movie. After sending off the uninvited guest, Jung Bin, the gas mask had abruptly demanded a transaction from the person doing the dishes. Up until then, he was just an insolent lunatic. When did he become so unreserved?\nThere was nothing more terrifying in the world than time. Nothing remains unchanged before time. People, and the relationships between people, are bound to change.\nThe same went for Cha Eui-jae, who had avoided time for 8 years. Seeing how an insolent lunatic had grown into a somewhat trustworthy colleague. In the past, he would have kicked him out into the garbage heap.\nAt that moment, Lee Sa-young spoke.\n\"If I stayed like this...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I thought you might come out.\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Lee Sa-young lifted his head. Through the lenses, his narrowed eyes could be seen. A small smile played on his lips.\n\"You really came out.\"\nThose eyes somehow seemed happy.\nCha Eui-jae, who was staring into the eyes beyond the lenses, quickly averted his gaze and changed the subject.\n\"So, why... only now after coming out of the dungeon?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"I thought you'd come and ask about this and that...\"\n\"That's how it happened. For various reasons.\"\n\"Why were you late? Were you busy?\"\nThe movements of the fingers stopped. After a brief silence, Lee Sa-young answered.\n\"I was held up under the pretext of an investigation.\"\n\"An investigation?\"\n\"I had to make excuses for not seeing some distinguished person. Well, it was a lie that wouldn't have worked anyway.\"\nHe was probably grilled by the Awakened Management Bureau to find out anything about J.\nWell, they wouldn't have let him go easily. They would have tried to extract any information they could, considering the unprecedented situation. Even if they had to forcibly detain someone like Lee Sa-young. They must have been desperate in their own way. Cha Eui-jae asked.\n\"Hong Ye-seong and Ga-eul too?\"\n\"Yoon Ga-eul was given leniency because she's a high school senior, and Hong Ye-seong... well, I think he was being held too.\"\nSo that's why he didn't come. Cha Eui-jae sighed briefly.\n\"They're still like that, huh, the Bureau.\"\n\"...\"\nWithout a word, Lee Sa-young just shrugged, looking somewhat exhausted.\n'...Is this okay?'\nHesitating, Cha Eui-jae raised his free hand and began to pat the round head. Honestly, Lee Sa-young's hair was so soft that it felt nice to pat. Lee Sa-young, who had slightly lifted his head as if to say something, answered slowly.\n\"It's okay. Thanks to it, I managed to take care of something... Jung Bin got discharged too.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah, well. If he understands the value of life, he won't bother us anymore, either...\"\nIt was welcome news. Cha Eui-jae asked.\n\"Is Jung Bin okay? Can he move?\"\n\"Even with a cast on his arm, he was moving just fine.\"\nIt was a nonchalant tone. It was hard to keep up with his tone that jumped around like a ping pong ball depending on the topic of conversation.\nAs he patted his head, something else got caught on his finger. It was probably the strap that held the gas mask in place. Cha Eui-jae slipped his finger under the strap and pulled it up. Lee Sa-young lifted his head. As the strap came off, the gas mask was removed, revealing his face with a slight frown.\nCha Eui-jae, satisfied, twirled the gas mask strap around his finger.\n\"What are you doing—\"\n\"Take off your gas mask when talking to people.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young released his hold on Cha Eui-jae's waist and stepped back. He couldn't go far, as the iron door was right there. Besides, he still didn't release their interlocked hands. Cha Eui-jae clicked his tongue.\n\"Seriously, you don't have to worry about the poison. I'm fine.\"\n\"What, does J have an S-grade detoxification ability or something?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young's sarcasm sometimes hit the nail on the head. When Cha Eui-jae remained silent, Lee Sa-young squinted his eyes.\n\"...Do you?\"\n\"...Well.\"\n\"Then why did you cough up blood?\"\nThe conversation circled back. With a grim face, Cha Eui-jae admitted the truth.\n\"At that time, the ability didn't work. Maybe because it was the first time encountering that poison.\"\n\"Ah... You expect me to believe that?\"\n\"It's true.\"\n\"Is it possible for an ability not to work?\"\nWhat could he do when it was the truth? The real problem was that Lee Sa-young's poison was so strong that his ability couldn't neutralize it immediately. However, Lee Sa-young's deep-rooted distrust showed no signs of dissipating.\nLee Sa-young was still glancing at Cha Eui-jae with suspicious eyes, like a detective comparing a montage with a suspect. Cha Eui-jae glanced at the old iron door Lee Sa-young was leaning against before speaking.\n\"But do we really have to do this in front of the door?\"\n\"Why.\"\n\"We could go inside the shop and talk, right? Why are we sitting in the corner like this?\"\n\"To get some fresh air.\"\n\"Bullshit... Get up, get up.\"\nAfter bouncing on his knees to stand up, Cha Eui-jae grabbed the interlocked hand firmly and pulled. Lee Sa-young resisted, but Cha Eui-jae's strength prevailed. Eventually, Lee Sa-young staggered to his feet.\nCha Eui-jae carefully unhooked each of the interlocked fingers. Lee Sa-young grumbled and shoved his hands into his coat pockets. Cha Eui-jae raised both hands.\n\"There, done. Had fun?\"\n\"Sure, whatever...\"\nLee Sa-young gestured toward the shop with his chin.\n\"If closing the shop is more important to you, I should let you go.\"\nCha Eui-jae froze. Because, despite the sarcasm, he felt a strange sense of relief.\n'I must be crazy...'\nCha Eui-jae quickly entered through the open door and immediately grabbed a broom. Then, a low voice came from outside.\n\"Cha Eui-jae.\"\nJust as Cha Eui-jae, holding the broom like a baseball bat, approached the door to chase away the now obnoxious Lee Sa-young,\n\"J.\"\nThe name stopped him in his tracks. Through the glass pane on the iron door, he saw Lee Sa-young, slightly hunched, staring at him. His plump lips moved slightly.\n\"Eui-jae, J. Eui-jae, J, Eui-jae...\"\nRepeating it several times, Lee Sa-young quietly stared at him. His lips curled into a faint smile. He asked leisurely.\n\"I've been curious why you named your Hunter alias J.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Now I know...\"\nThe corners of Lee Sa-young's mouth lifted into a smile as he drew out his words.\n\"You named yourself 'J' by reversing your own name, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"How simple-minded.\"\nIt was irritating, but I couldn't argue. It was the truth. Anyone who knew both Cha Eui-jae and J could easily figure it out, but since there weren't any such people, it was relatively safe. At least, it had been until now.\nLee Sa-young, looking satisfied, waved his hand.\n\"I've been wanting to ask that for a long time.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's why I came here today, just to confirm it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Now I can.\"\nLooking at Lee Sa-young's face, there was no sign he was lying. He pushed the door wide open. Just before the door closed, a low farewell came through the narrow gap.\n\"Goodnight, Hyung.\"\nClick. The door shut. Cha Eui-jae mulled over the last words that he hadn't heard clearly but had been very clear to his ears.\n\"This is something I wanted to say too.\"\nA cheer erupted from the TV. Cha Eui-jae finally came to his senses, pulling out his phone and the business card from his apron pocket. Just as he was about to enter Seo Min-gi's number into his phone, a text message arrived.\n010-XXXX-XXXX: This is Seo Min-gi. I have some information. I'll visit tomorrow.\nIt was a message from A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi.",

      "content": "Chapter 101: A Broken Place\nTap, tap, tap. Footsteps rapidly traversed the long corridor. They were almost as fast as someone running.\nPeople in the hallway hurriedly stepped aside at the sudden approach of the figure. However, upon recognizing the owner of the shoes, their faces shifted from irritation to surprise and then to a welcoming expression. A hunter, who had spilled coffee on his hand, shouted out.\n\"Team Leader Jung Bin! Have you returned?\"\n\"Yes, it's been a while. How have you been? Oh dear, did you spill because of me?\"\n\"No! I have a bit of a tremor!\"\n\"How is your health, Team Leader?\"\n\"Haha, I'm fine. I'll recover soon, so don't worry.\"\n\"Please take care of yourself!\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nJung Bin's right arm was in a cast, and his face was covered in band-aids, giving him a pitiful appearance, but his gentle smile remained unchanged.\nBut that was only temporary. As he passed through the crowded hallway and descended underground, the smile gradually disappeared from his face. His steps quickened until he was almost running.\nThe Awakened Management Bureau had a special detention room and interrogation room for capturing awakened criminals. Only those with proper authority could access it, and it was located deep within the building, accessible only by elevator.\nJung Bin placed his hunter ID on the elevator authentication device.\n[Authorization confirmed. S-grade Hunter Jung Bin of the Awakened Management Bureau, welcome to the Bureau.]\nJung Bin, a diligent civil servant of the Awakened Management Bureau, had returned straight to the Bureau after being discharged earlier than scheduled. He had been unable to sleep due to an ominous feeling.\nAnd as they say, bad premonitions are never wrong. Upon his return, he was met with a broken interrogation room desk and Lee Sa-young sitting crookedly in front of it. It had been quite some time since Jung Bin was hospitalized, yet Lee Sa-young was still detained in the Bureau. He had only broken the desk without much resistance!\nJung Bin smiled.\n'This is bad.'\nAnd that made him even more scared. If Lee Sa-young had made a mess of the interrogation room, Jung Bin might have felt a bit relieved. Lee Sa-young was more terrifying when he was quiet.\nJung Bin quickly moved to resolve the situation. He burst into Lee Sa-young's interrogation room and, as soon as their eyes met, he immediately encouraged him to leave the Bureau, as well as promising to visit the Pado Guild separately.\nHowever, Lee Sa-young didn't seem particularly angry. He didn't criticize or mock Jung Bin for coming quickly. Instead, he gestured for Jung Bin to come closer and whispered in his ear.\n\"I haven't sensed Hong Ye-seong's presence since a day ago.\"\n\"What do you mean... is Hong Ye-seong still here?\"\nJung Bin frowned. He had instructed for Hong Ye-seong to be transported to the Jang-in Village in Bukhansan after a simple inquiry. Lee Sa-young answered nonchalantly.\n\"He was. Not anymore.\"\nHis tone was suggestive. Lee Sa-young patted Jung Bin on the shoulder and left the interrogation room.\n\"You should pay more attention to internal management.\"\nDing, the elevator light turned on as it reached the basement and the door opened. Jung Bin straightened his body and walked down the dark corridor.\nAt the end of the corridor was a firmly closed iron door. In front of it stood hunters, hands behind their backs, guarding the door. They were familiar faces to Jung Bin, as they were his direct subordinates. The hunters bowed their heads.\n\"Hello, Team Leader.\"\n\"I didn't expect you to be here. There shouldn't be any detained awakeners right now. I haven't received any special reports either.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I didn't give any orders to guard this place. Who instructed you to stay here?\"\n\"...\"\nThe hunters didn't respond, staring straight ahead. Jung Bin smiled and asked.\n\"Could you open the door for me?\"\n\"It's not possible.\"\n\"Hmm, that's strange.\"\n\"...\"\n\"As far as I know, there's no place in the Awakened Management Bureau that I cannot enter...\"\nBefore the hunter could pull something from his waist, Jung Bin kicked the door without warning.\nBANG—!!\nThe massive iron door crumpled inward, and a scream was heard.\n\"Ahhh! What's going on?\"\n\"Oh, here you are?\"\n\"Wha–? Official-nim, you've come to save me!\"\nHong Ye-seong, bound to a chair with chains, looked up with teary eyes. However, upon noticing the band-aids on Jung Bin's face and his casted arm, Hong Ye-seong tilted his head.\n\"Or not? Did you get captured too?\"\n\"Sigh...\"\nFortunately, Hong Ye-seong showed no signs of being beaten or tortured. He was just chained in the detention room. That alone was a big deal. Jung Bin sighed and turned around. The hunters who had been blocking the door stood facing Jung Bin with unchanged expressions. Jung Bin ran his hand through his hair and asked.\n\"Why is Hong Ye-seong still here?\"\n\"...\"\n\"He should have been in the Jang-in Village in Bukhansan by now. Who ordered to keep him here?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I don't understand why there's no immediate answer.\"\n\"...Heh.\"\nAt that moment, the head of one of the hunters by the door twisted unnaturally. His eyes lost their light, and blood vessels burst, turning them an eerie red.\nJung Bin sighed again. Creeeak, a black chain wrapped around his left arm with a chilling metallic sound.\n\"Geez... I leave for a moment, and things turn out like this. I owe you again.\"\n\"What's going on? Aren't they hunters from the Bureau?\"\n\"Who knows. Maybe they're imposters, or someone tampered with my subordinates. I guess I've been underestimated.\"\nJung Bin coldly spat out and took a step forward. The hunters' bodies twisted more grotesquely. The sound of metal clashing was clear. Without looking back, Jung Bin spoke.\n\"Hong Ye-seong, please move back as much as you can.\"\n\"Huh? I'm tied to a chair though?\"\n\"Your legs can move, right? Stick to the wall.\"\n\"Geez.\"\nGrumbling, Hong Ye-seong moved awkwardly to the corner of the room.\nAt that moment, black spikes burst out from the hunter's suit.\nCreak, creak... The unsettling, creepy sound was like the buzzing of insect wings. The spikes clashing against each other made a foreboding noise.\nKA-KA-KA-KANG!!\nThe spikes rushed towards Jung Bin.\n***\nIn the late afternoon, just before preparation time, only two customers remained in the hangover soup restaurant.\nBeep.\n\"That'll be 60,000 won.\"\n\"Here.\"\nHoneybee handed over her card. Cha Eui-jae swiftly and skillfully completed the payment and returned the receipt and card. However, Honeybee didn't seem to be in a hurry to leave, lingering by the counter and clearing her throat softly.\nCha Eui-jae looked at her curiously. The question she asked was unexpected.\n\"How is your grandmother's health?\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"You know, you had a notice on the door? Saying you closed for a day to take your grandmother to the hospital.\"\nShe must be referring to the fake notice posted during the Artisan Exhibition. Cha Eui-jae responded while tidying up the counter.\n\"Oh, she's fine now.\"\n\"Really? That's a relief.\"\n\"What made you ask all of a sudden?\"\n\"Nothing much. Our guild is in the middle of a contract with a pharmaceutical company.\"\n\"Honeybee.\"\nTeam Leader Han, who was standing next to her, quietly admonished. Honeybee glanced at him and retorted.\n\"Why the secrecy? It's almost confirmed. The news will spread in a few days anyway.\"\n\"Even so, it's better to keep quiet. Many hunters frequent this place...\"\n\"We're the last customers before preparation time, so what? I've checked everything before speaking.\"\nTeam Leader Han shook his head, exasperated. Honeybee put her card and receipt into her wallet and smiled at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Well, if you have some spare money, you might want to buy some stocks. It'll probably skyrocket. It's a big deal.\"\n\"Phew...\"\n\"You could use the profits to ease the hospital bills. I'm off!\"\nWaving her hand, Honeybee left the restaurant. Team Leader Han gestured for discretion by placing a finger to his lips, then quickly followed her out. Clatter, click. The door closed. Cha Eui-jae checked the sales and pondered.\n'Did she intentionally share classified information?'\nIf Team Leader Han was cautious about keeping it a secret, it must be significant. Was she worried about his struggles with hospital bills? He appreciated the sentiment... Cha Eui-jae scratched the back of his neck.\n\"Hmm, that's some valuable information. Hangover soup restaurants do have a lot of insider info.\"\nA familiar voice spoke from behind Cha Eui-jae. Instantly, Cha Eui-jae threw a punch, but fortunately, nothing was broken. Only a trembling voice was heard.\n\"Oh, your reflexes are very quick... Hello, customer...\"\nThe voice came from the shadow under the chair behind the counter. Cha Eui-jae crouched in front of the chair and replied.\n\"I'll let it slide this time, but don't pop out like that again.\"\n\"Thanks to your ocean-like generosity, I've managed to stay alive. One must always be cautious.\"\nCrawling out, Seo Min-gi stood upright and bowed.\n\"Before we start the conversation, just a moment.\"\nSeo Min-gi took out something small and round from his inventory and pressed it. White fog spread out, clinging to the window glass outside. Seo Min-gi put on his sunglasses.\n\"Though it seems unlikely anyone would peek inside, it's always good to be thorough, given the gravity of the situation.\"\n\"Like how you eavesdropped, Seo Min-gi-ssi?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nSeo Min-gi replied shamelessly as he took out a tablet from his inventory. Cha Eui-jae put his hands in his apron pockets and asked.\n\"Did you find any useful information?\"\n\"Well, to get straight to the point... with the help of Romantic Opener, we thoroughly investigated the national hospital.\"\nSeo Min-gi, with a stylus between his fingers, touched his temple and said.\n\"There are no records at all.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"There are absolutely no records in the national hospital. It's suspiciously clean.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Isn't that strange? There are records of patients from much longer ago, but only the records of the friend you mentioned are missing.\"\nIs that possible? Cha Eui-jae furrowed his brow in confusion. He thought deeply, considering whether the records might have been lost in the chaotic times back then. After pondering, he spoke.\n\"If by any chance it was initially omitted...\"\n\"An ordinary hospital developed an antidote thanks to that friend and received sponsorship from you, didn't it? There must be some kind of record. Money and items would have moved. Especially where money moves, there are always traces. But for it to be this clean...\"\n\"...\"\n\"In the end, there is only one conclusion.\"\nSeo Min-gi's eyes sparkled as he pointed his stylus at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Someone deliberately erased that friend's records. Very cleanly. As if they never existed.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 102: A Broken Place\n\"Someone deliberately erased that friend's records. Very cleanly. As if they never existed.\"\nSomeone erased the records. But who, and for what reason? What could that child possibly be?\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly at the pen pointing at him. Seo Min-gi retracted his arm and crossed his arms, muttering.\n\"But there's definitely something fishy. The information is so cleanly empty that it makes me wonder why they went to such lengths to erase it. There are very few individuals or organizations capable of such large-scale information manipulation. And isn't this the child that J personally entrusted to them? I wouldn't dare touch them out of fear.\"\nSeo Min-gi shuddered. Cha Eui-jae listened to his sincere banter with one ear. There was a phrase that stuck with him like a hangnail. Individuals or organizations capable of large-scale information manipulation.\nAfter pondering for a moment, Cha Eui-jae crossed his arms and asked.\n\"What kind of individuals or organizations could manipulate information on such a large scale as you mentioned, Seo Min-gi?\"\n\"Oh, please wait a moment.\"\nSeo Min-gi muttered as he turned on the tablet screen.\n\"To cleanly organize information to this extent... It would need to be at least the Awakened Management Bureau or one of the top three guilds. Or perhaps someone like Mackerel... Yes, let me summarize it briefly. Just a moment.\"\nAwakened Management Bureau, the top three guilds in South Korea, Mackerel.\nCha Eui-jae frowned at the suddenly familiar name of a seafood. This wasn't Noryangjin Fish Market, so why was Mackerel mentioned here?\nHowever, his face of bewilderment gradually turned to one of shock. Memories of conversations among hunters during the Ma-Seok incident suddenly resurfaced.\n\"I'm going to Noryangjin Fish Market today to ask the mackerel.\"\n\"Can the mackerel really find it?\"\n\"If not, they better give up their title as Korea's top information dealer.\"\nCould it be that Mackerel was a person's name? Cha Eui-jae pressed his forehead, having learned information he hadn't wanted to know.\nWere strange hunter names trending these days? But for a moment, he calmed down as he saw Seo Min-gi, still seriously scribbling something.\nWell, considering there are strange hunter names, Mackerel isn't that bad. At least it's a noun.\nJust then, Seo Min-gi looked up.\n\"I feel a bit strange. Did you just say something, sir?\"\n'Sharp bastard.'\n\"No.\"\n\"I see. Perhaps the Guild Leader was speaking ill of me. Well, let me continue.\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded. Seo Min-gi handed him the tablet. Somehow, it had a familiar red gothic font title welcoming him.\n[A Brief Summary of Factions]\nThere was nothing else except the title. Cha Eui-jae, thinking he would receive a summary, stared blankly at the gothic font. Meanwhile, Seo Min-gi adjusted his sunglasses and spoke.\n\"As I mentioned before, there are very few entities that can manipulate information so cleanly. Especially since the location is a national hunter hospital. Either the Awakened Management Bureau intervened directly, or it was one of South Korea's top three guilds: Pado, Samra, Seowon. Additionally, it could be the HB Guild.\"\nSeo Min-gi gestured for Cha Eui-jae to swipe the screen. As he did, a vibrant picture of a mackerel appeared.\n\"The number of individuals capable of this is even smaller. The only person is South Korea's top information dealer, Mackerel. They operate out of Noryangjin Fish Market, and their information is usually quite useful. However!\"\nSeo Min-gi gestured again. Cha Eui-jae swiped the screen once more, revealing an animation of money bundles spinning around a mackerel wearing sunglasses.\n\"Mackerel only does things that are profitable... They wouldn't have been involved in information manipulation that didn't pay. If it was Mackerel's work, it means someone was behind it.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae clenched his fists. His heart began to race. Seo Min-gi's professional voice continued to ring in his ears.\n\"At that time, their research hadn't progressed much, so they used people with some peculiarities as test subjects.\"\n\"Peculiarities?\"\n\"Yes. Those who had been involved in a rift, or had wounds from a monster attack. In any case, something special related to the rift. They might have kidnapped people for experiments in that chaotic state.\"\nHis mouth went dry. He hoped it wasn't true, but his sharp instincts whispered to seize this opportunity. Cha Eui-jae spoke slowly.\n\"What are the chances that Prometheus took them?\"\nSeo Min-gi, who had been busy with his stylus, froze. He turned stiffly to look at Cha Eui-jae. Behind his sunglasses, his eyes were filled with shock.\n\"Sir, what did you just say...?\"\nMeeting his black eyes, Cha Eui-jae repeated slowly and deliberately.\n\"Prometheus.\"\n\"W-Wait a moment. How do you know about Prometheus? That's highly classified information. Didn't the Guild Leader only tell you about the drugs?\"\n\"Answer my question first.\"\nMeeting Cha Eui-jae's cold gaze, Seo Min-gi shut his mouth. After muttering something to himself, he finally spoke.\n\"I don't know how you know Prometheus's name, but there's a reason I didn't mention it directly. If you think they're the culprit... the conclusion is simple.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That child, they're dead. Absolutely.\"\nFor a moment, his breath stopped. Cha Eui-jae placed his fist near his heart and took a deep breath. Seo Min-gi pressed his thumb and index finger to his temples and continued.\n\"What I'm about to say is classified. I'm telling you because you're a client.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There are three major organizations in South Korea tracking Prometheus.\"\nSeo Min-gi held up three fingers.\n\"The Awakened Management Bureau, Pado Guild, and Seowon Guild. These three cooperate continuously to monitor the flow of drugs and track Prometheus. Of course... the Bureau temporarily paused to search for J.\"\n\"...\"\n\"We also paused for a while and then resumed recently... Anyway, I investigated Prometheus quite extensively. That's why I'm telling you this.\"\nAdjusting his sunglasses, Seo Min-gi continued.\n\"Those guys spread drugs and conduct experiments to create artificial Awakeners... but there hasn't been a single success. As far as is known, all the test subjects died.\"\nSeo Min-gi's sunglasses gleamed.\n\"All of them, until now.\"\n***\nThe Guild Leader's office of the Pado Guild was dark even in the middle of the day. In the middle of the room, a figure lay slumped on a long sofa. Wearing a black eye patch, he clasped his hands over his stomach and breathed quietly.\nFootsteps echoed closer and closer. The sound was clear and unhesitant, belonging to one person.\nThe door burst open.\n\"Hey, Guild Leader! There's a message from Team Leader Jung Bin.\"\nLee Sa-young signaled with a hand to close the door instead of responding verbally. Entering the dark office and closing the door, Bae Won-woo looked worriedly at Lee Sa-young's head.\n\"What, are your eyes acting up again? Is it bad?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Did you take your medicine? Should I call Nam Woo-jin?\"\n\"Just report first.\"\n\"Okay... I get it.\"\nMuttering briefly, Bae Won-woo turned on the tablet he was holding.\n\"Ah... First, they rescued Hong Ye-seong, thanks to you. He was in the underground detention room. And...\"\nAs he read the message, Bae Won-woo gasped.\n\"What? The dummy wore a subordinate's skin?\"\n\"...What?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been listening quietly, lifted his thumb to raise one side of his eye patch. In the darkness, only the tablet screen and Bae Won-woo's face, illuminated by its light, shone eerily. Bae Won-woo stuttered in surprise.\n\"N-No, that's what it says. The subordinate that was guarding the detention room and attacked with black thorns... After subduing him, Seowon Guild analyzed it and found it wasn't him.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The skin was... him.\"\nA heavy silence fell. Lee Sa-young sighed briefly and raised the eye patch to his forehead. He then extended his hand, and Bae Won-woo naturally handed over the tablet. Skimming through the content quickly, Lee Sa-young twisted his lips.\n\"They must have been busy while I looked away...\"\n\"Hey... is this even possible? So the subordinates are already dead?\"\n\"Probably. Their skins were peeled off.\"\nLee Sa-young replied coldly as he sat up. Bae Won-woo cursed harshly. The last part of Jung Bin's message was an address. After running a hand over his face, Lee Sa-young returned the tablet to Bae Won-woo.\n\"Have Seo Min-gi verify the address.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"If verified, I'll go personally.\"\n\"By yourself?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Sa-young stood up and removed the eye patch, placing it in a black pouch. The inside of the eye patch was charred black. Bae Won-woo frowned and spoke.\n\"Hey, let me go with you. I know your situation.\"\n\"If we both leave, it'll be bad... especially now.\"\nLee Sa-young turned to Bae Won-woo and raised a finger to his lips.\n\"Keep quiet.\"\n***\nZiiing, the phone vibrated. Seo Min-gi excused himself and took the phone out of his pocket, pressing the answer button.\n\"Yes, this is Seo Min-gi.\"\n—Hey, it's me.\nA familiar voice. It was Bae Won-woo. Seo Min-gi glanced at Cha Eui-jae and, lowering his voice as much as possible, spoke quietly.\n\"Yes, what is it?\"\n—It's an order from the Guild Leader. I'll send you an address. Go check it out. See if there's really a building there, or if there's something underground.\n\"Alright, I'll go check it out right away.\"\nSeo Min-gi mouthed \"Sorry\" to Cha Eui-jae. It looked like guild business. Yeah, this side needed some time to sort out thoughts anyway. Just as Cha Eui-jae was about to pretend he hadn't heard and step aside, Bae Won-woo spoke again, his voice tinged with a sigh.\n—This is information Jung Bin gave us. It seems to be an address related to Prometheus. Turn it upside down and check everything.\nSeo Min-gi froze with his mouth open. No matter how much he lowered the volume, it felt like the contents had already been heard. A chill ran down his spine. Seo Min-gi, creaking like a broken robot, slowly lifted his head.\nBefore he knew it, a pair of icy blue eyes were staring at him intently. The owner of the eyes smiled slowly, the corners of his lips curling up. J mouthed the word.\n\"Prometheus?\"\nSeo Min-gi shut his eyes tightly.",

      "content": "Chapter 103: A Broken Place\n\"Vice-Guild Leader seems to always have an issue with the final words. Always...\"\nSeo Min-gi muttered in a low voice, covering the microphone with his palm, his face looking as if he had lost his country. Beyond the phone, Bae Won-woo asked, \"Huh?\"\n—What? I didn't hear you.\n\"It's nothing. I'll get back to you after the investigation. Shall I report directly to the Guild Leader?\"\n—Yeah, and keep me updated on this one too. Don't tell Sa-young about it.\n\"You know that such independent actions also need to be reported, right? Vice-Guild Leader.\"\n—Just turn a blind eye this once, man. I'm doing this for his sake.\n\"Then, I'm counting on you!\" Without considering the other person's situation, Bae Won-woo hung up the call after throwing a bombshell without hesitation.\nSeo Min-gi, who ended up holding the bomb out of nowhere, glanced sideways at Cha Eui-jae after lowering his phone. Cha Eui-jae, with his arms still crossed, was softly smiling. The sight made Seo Min-gi's spine chill even more.\n'I must somehow defuse this bomb from exploding!'\nSeo Min-gi let out a big sigh first. Then, he adjusted his sunglasses to reveal his dark circles. If his client was human, they would surely feel sorry for this face. Before Cha Eui-jae could speak, he preempted him.\n\"No.\"\n\"...\"\n\"No matter how much you're a customer, this can't be done.\"\n\"...\"\n\"No matter how much you look at me, really, really, it can't be done...\"\nNo. Go back. Seo Min-gi firmly extended his palm as if he were a judge. But the opponent was also resolute. Cha Eui-jae uncrossed his arms and high-fived Seo Min-gi's palm. A so-called high-five.\nSmack—!!\n\"Ugh.\"\nOf course, it was a bit too powerful to be called a high-five. Seo Min-gi's hand, which had received an unexpectedly strong impact, recoiled like a mimosa1. Seo Min-gi shivered with tingling pain in his shoulder. Cha Eui-jae awkwardly took out a potion from his inventory and sprinkled it on Seo Min-gi's hand, speaking with a sheepish smile.\n\"No, why do you refuse so strongly without even knowing what I'm going to ask?\"\n\"Because you want to accompany me on the investigation, right? Do you think I wouldn't know? You're acting exactly like how the Guild Leader used to!\"\nSeo Min-gi shouted sharply, pushing up his slipping sunglasses. Cha Eui-jae, who got his mark, cleared his throat. Seo Min-gi gloomily muttered.\n\"...Given the situation, it seems like even the customer needs mental remodeling. Got it.\"\n\"No, who is remodeling who...\"\n\"No matter if you're J, you can't accompany the investigation.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because you're my customer.\"\nIt was an unexpected reason. Cha Eui-jae widened his eyes. Seo Min-gi, grumbling, stuffed his tablet and pen back into his inventory.\n\"This issue is related to my Hunter Pride as the 36th-ranked hunter in South Korea, specializing in stealth and infiltration, customer. Have you ever seen a guide take a customer to an unsafe place?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Let me tell you a few more things now that we're on the subject.\"\nSeo Min-gi said in a determined voice while wiping his potion-soaked hand with a handkerchief.\n\"When going somewhere, you must have at least a basic understanding of the situation and secure safety in advance. I know you're very strong, but you can't just rely on your body and rush in.\"\nSituational awareness? Safety measures? Cha Eui-jae, who had never done such things in his life, stared blankly at Seo Min-gi.\nBack in the day, he would handle situational awareness, safety measures, and problem-solving all in one go the moment he entered. Why complicate the process?\nEven though it sounded like an old man's words to him, Cha Eui-jae swallowed it down, thinking Seo Min-gi, who had never gotten angry before, might blow up if he said it out loud. Cha Eui-jae at least had that much sense.\nSeo Min-gi continued to speak rapidly as if rapping.\n\"Even if you haven't done it until now, you must start from this moment. Why? Because the Pado Guild and I will first handle the situational awareness and safety measures there.\"\n\"But...\"\nCha Eui-jae cautiously began to speak, but Seo Min-gi shook his head firmly.\n\"If you want to argue about this, please take it up directly with the Guild Leader. The Guild Leader shares the same opinion as me.\"\nThat guy? Cha Eui-jae rolled his eyes. Of course, Cha Eui-jae didn't know everything about Lee Sa-young. But from what he had seen so far, Lee Sa-young seemed to prefer getting involved directly rather than leaving things to others.\nWhile Cha Eui-jae hesitated for a moment, Seo Min-gi spoke in a prim tone.\n\"The Guild Leader also underwent such mental remodeling once. After scouting me, he didn't give me any tasks, so I sternly disciplined him.\"\nScratch that. It wasn't particularly such a problem. It was just that Seo Min-gi had dug his own grave. Cha Eui-jae looked pitifully at Seo Min-gi, who was burying himself in the pit he had dug. Whether fortunate or unfortunate, Seo Min-gi looked satisfied after finishing his speech.\n\"You heard the call just now, right? Use me properly at least half as much as the Guild Leader does.\"\n\"Ah, yes.\"\nSeo Min-gi's phone rang briefly in his hand. After checking his phone, he bowed to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"The address has arrived. I'll see you again next time.\"\n\"Ah, wait a moment.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been lost in thought for a moment, called out to Seo Min-gi. Seo Min-gi, who had half-hidden in the shadows under the chair, lifted his head.\n\"Yes, please speak.\"\n\"After the investigation, contact me as well. All the information about Prometheus, including the address of the place.\"\nSeo Min-gi looked at Cha Eui-jae for a moment and then asked in a sighing voice.\n\"In secret from the Guild Leader?\"\nCha Eui-jae smiled.\n\"Yes.\"\nSeo Min-gi nodded slightly, almost imperceptibly, and then quickly disappeared into the shadows. Silence returned to the narrow shop. Every time he suddenly found himself alone in such quietness, Cha Eui-jae couldn't help but feel his spirits sink. He clasped his hands together and brought them to his mouth.\n\"Sigh...\"\nEven though he knew it was meaningless to chase after the traces of someone who was probably already dead, he couldn't help but helplessly follow them.\nBecause, that child...\nHis hand, which had been roughly rubbing his face, turned on the TV. The irregular noise provided some comfort.\nCha Eui-jae walked out of the shop with trash bags in both hands. The lingering smell of cigarettes in the air suggested someone had been smoking for a while. He looked up at the gray sky.\n***\nClick, an old fluorescent green plastic lighter flickered. Beyond the wavering small flame, the sky was filled with thick clouds.\nThe young man, staring at the flame, soon put the lighter back into his pocket. His fingertips brushed against a cigarette pack, but he didn't take it out. There were too many people in the building for that.\nWhere there are people, it's noisy. Sometimes unbearably so.\n\"...!\"\nThe senses that developed extremely due to the awakening were either a blessing or a curse. Sometimes, they made him hear things he didn't want to hear. The young man pretended not to hear the noise in his ears and stretched his leg to step down a few steps. He was sitting in the middle of an old outdoor staircase.\nThe Awakened Management Bureau, hastily launched to deal with the flood of awakened criminals, was located in one of the police stations that had not been functioning properly since the Day of the Rift. There was neither money nor time to build a new building.\nPosters for traffic safety and no-smoking campaigns were still stuck on the walls, as if to remind everyone that this was a police station. The campaign posters hadn't moved past the date three years ago and remained stuck on that day.\nSomeone's footsteps were getting closer. Tsk, the young man clicked his tongue so softly that it was barely audible and closed his eyes tightly.\n'This place is hopeless too.'\nSoon, the footsteps reached right below the stairs. With a curious rustle, a voice full of welcoming tone echoed.\n\"J! Here you are!\"\nJ slowly opened his eyes and glanced down the stairs. A hunter from the Awakened Management Bureau, whom he had seen a few times, was sticking his head up and looking at him.\nA newcomer who had joined three months ago, if he remembered correctly. As expected of a newcomer, his eyes sparkled. J replied indifferently.\n\"Summoned?\"\n\"Yes! That's right.\"\nJ took his eyes off the newcomer and looked up at the cloudy sky. In the middle of the sky, a black hole was swirling.\n\"Tell them I'll be there soon.\"\n\"Uh, but I think you should come right away...\"\n\"...\"\nJ didn't respond and just stared at the hunter. Though his expression was hidden behind a mask, the meaning of his gaze was clear. The hunter, receiving the chilly stare, mumbled his words.\n\"It, it's an urgent matter. I was told to definitely bring you along...\"\n\"Who said so?\"\n\"So, Hunter Song did...\"\n\"...\"\nSigh, a short breath escaped. J slowly stood up.\nTap, tap, the sound of solid boots echoed regularly as he stepped down the stairs. His face hidden under a mask, hands in his pockets, he walked past the hunter.\nAt that moment, the strong smell of blood hit his nose. The hunter instinctively frowned slightly and then, startled, quickly covered his mouth.\nPretending not to notice, J nodded. It had already been three years since he was hailed as a hero right after his awakening.\n\"Thank you for letting me know.\"\nThinking about it now...\n\"Go back to work.\"\nHe seemed tired. Very much so.",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Good Days\n\"This rift is in Namyangju. Although its size is not that large, the grade is high, so only a limited number of hunters can be deployed. Therefore, we are asking for your help, J...\"\nThe ensuing words were the same usual repertoire J had always heard. The rescue team was on standby, so once J arrived, they could immediately begin the rescue operations and deal with the rift. J was to wait, dealing with the monsters until the rescue team finished, and then kill the rift's owner when the signal was given. J nodded mechanically. Song Jo-heon smiled contentedly and patted J on the shoulder.\n\"We always trust you, J. We're counting on you again this time.\"\nWell, who knows if they truly trust him? J was aware that most of the work was falling on him. It was impossible not to notice. But he endured it. Because that was the way to save more people.\n\"J!\"\nAs J was leaving the conference room and crossing the hallway, he heard a familiar voice and looked up quickly. At the end of the hall, a middle-aged woman with a friendly face was standing with her arms wide open, smiling broadly.\nAfter checking that no one was around, J quickened his pace a bit. His voice carried a hint of a smile.\n\"Aunt.\"\nThe ID card hanging from the woman's neck swung. Park Hye-kyung. As J approached her, he momentarily stiffened before stepping back. He recalled the frown of the new hunter earlier.\n'If there's a smell of blood...'\nBut Park Hye-kyung stepped forward without hesitation and hugged J. There was no sign of displeasure. Her warm hands gently patted his back. Only then did J relax his tense body.\n\"Oh dear, I called you knowing there was no one around. You always worry too much.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh my, you've grown. Have you gotten taller again?\"\n\"Yes, a bit.\"\n\"You grow so quickly every time I see you. Aren't you working too much? Hmm?\"\n\"Yeah, since you moved to the Incheon branch, we haven't seen each other much.\"\nThe conversation was affectionate, typical of relatives meeting after a long time. However, they were not real relatives but only used the terms aunt and nephew.\nThey were the only two survivors from a rift where they lost their families. But the bond between survivors can be stronger than any other.\nJ looked at Park Hye-kyung's face. Her complexion was much better than when she was at the headquarters. It was natural that managing a specific region was more comfortable than traveling around the country. It was a relief. J smiled.\n\"What brings you to the headquarters?\"\n\"Seok-jeong called me over for a chat.\"\nThe short hug ended. Worried brown eyes scanned J from head to toe.\n\"Are you hurt anywhere? Are you sleeping well? Eating well? I read that you've been traveling all over the country lately.\"\n\"I'm fine.\"\n\"Seriously, they should know their limits... Making a barely twenty-year-old kid work so hard.\"\nPark Hye-kyung clicked her tongue and sighed deeply.\n\"I'm thinking of talking to Seok-jeong about returning to headquarters. I can't leave you alone like this; it's too worrying.\"\n\"Oh no, you don't have to come back. Incheon is much more comfortable for you. I'm really okay.\"\n\"...\"\nDespite his sincere words, the worry did not leave Park Hye-kyung's face. At that moment, J's wristwatch buzzed loudly. It was probably the helicopter team urging him to hurry up. J pressed the earpiece and bowed his head.\n\"Sorry, I'd like to chat more, but I have to go.\"\n\"...Where are you headed this time?\"\n\"Namyangju. It's close by.\"\nPark Hye-kyung opened her mouth as if wanting to say something, but J was quicker. He grabbed her hand and spoke firmly.\n\"I'm really okay.\"\nEven as he said this, the watch's vibrations didn't cease.\n***\nI'm okay.\n\"Kieeek!\"\n'I'm okay.'\nThe giant bird flapped its wings before collapsing. J expertly retracted his spear. The bird, with a large hole in its heart, fell to the ground.\nHe stood before the tightly shut door of a massive ruin. Around him, monster corpses were piled like mountains. Blood from the bodies formed small pools that continued to spread. J stepped back to avoid the flowing blood and gazed beyond the forest.\nHe could faintly hear cries, groans, and screams. He felt the urge to cover his ears.\n'...I have to be okay.'\nJ placed his fist near his heart and steadied his breathing.\nAt that moment,\nBoom! Something exploded, accompanied by red flames bursting beyond the forest. A signal flare. It indicated that the rescue team had completed their mission.\nThis was mainly J's role in the mission. He was to wait, killing monsters until the rescue team finished rescuing people, and then deal with the rift's owner.\nJ lightly leaped over the pile of corpses and stood before the closed door. He then kicked the door with all his might. Crash! The stone door shattered into pieces with a loud noise.\nRoar...\nThe rift's owner, crouched in the dark temple, roared. Its bright red eyes shone fiercely in the darkness. Not just the temple but the ground also shook.\nJ felt a chill run through his body, but he did not back down. He merely readjusted his spear and charged. He could feel the blood circulating through his body. J bared his teeth and smiled.\n\"...\"\n...After that, his memory was hazy.\nA moment later, J blinked slowly. The dark temple was gone, replaced by a collapsed street. Hunters wearing white armbands were moving busily. He saw bodies covered with white cloth and people weeping over them.\n\"...\"\nJ held his head. His temples throbbed. Lately, he has been experiencing more blackouts. Perhaps it was due to adrenaline, excitement, or some trance-like state akin to those in martial arts novels.\nWhen he came to his senses, he often found himself sitting at the rift's entrance, drenched in blood.\n'This time too...'\nHe slowly clenched and unclenched his hand. Though it was soaked in blood, it was intact. His spear lay next to him. His limbs moved without issue, and there were no significant wounds.\n'...That's enough.'\nEven thinking deeply was exhausting. He just wanted to be alone in a quiet place. As J closed his eyes again, someone approached him.\n\"G-Great work, J! You were amazing today!\"\nIt was the new hunter he had seen on the stairs. Covered in dust, he looked a mess. J didn't bother to respond. The hunter hesitated.\n\"Are you hurt? Do you need a potion? I don't have much since it's from the supplies, but...\"\nJ figured that if he didn't reply, the hunter would keep hovering around. He slowly opened his mouth.\n\"...No, I'm fine.\"\nAt that moment, a mechanical voice came through the earpiece.\n—A dungeon has appeared in Chungju. Support is needed. A helicopter is ready at headquarters. J.\nIt was time to go save more people. He wanted to just lie down and not move, but he was already moving mechanically. As he stood up, the new hunter spoke worriedly.\n\"But J, you're bleeding...\"\n\"It's not my blood.\"\nJ replied shortly and stumbled forward, pressing the earpiece.\n\"I'll head back immediately.\"\nHis spear hit the ground with a thud. Blood droplets dripped from the tip of the spear.\n***\nAfter a quick rinse in the shower, J headed straight to the outdoor stairs. He needed some time alone, even if it was brief.\nHowever, it seemed someone was already there. Peeking out, he saw a familiar silhouette. The back of a man in a black suit was recognizable.\nHis golden hair fluttered in the casual breeze. A small sigh escaped the man, white smoke dispersing into the air. J propped his chin on the outdoor stair railing and spoke.\n\"Jung Bin.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nStartled by the sudden call, Jung Bin straightened up and turned around. Despite being in the police academy, his actions were still precise. Recognizing J, Jung Bin relaxed slightly. He took out a portable ashtray from his pocket and extinguished his cigarette with an awkward smile.\n\"It's you, J. I didn't sense anyone. Sorry.\"\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\"I had some free time, so I was resting.\"\n\"Why not rest in the break room?\"\n\"Well...\"\nJung Bin glanced around and shrugged.\n\"It's a bit... crowded there.\"\nHis unfinished sentence was clear. J, who also sought the less populated outdoor stairs, understood.\n\"Is it uncomfortable?\"\nJung Bin didn't respond verbally, just gave a vague smile.\nThree years had passed since the Day of the Rift. Despite the continued chaos with monsters appearing everywhere, South Korea seemed to have regained its stability, thanks to two meteoric S-grade hunters.\nJ and Jung Bin. They traveled across the country, handling dungeons, rifts, and awakened criminal cases. However, the interior was still a mess, despite the outward calm.\nEven with the Awakened Management Bureau established, awakened crimes were rampant. Only Jung Bin could arrest these criminals. Moreover, there were more monsters, dungeons, and rifts than hunters, leading to a chronic manpower shortage.\nThe first-generation awakeners were mostly dead or incapacitated from fighting monsters, and the newly awakened lacked experience. Monster battles were wars of attrition. With such numbers, gaps were inevitable.\nBut it wasn't a situation where they could just leave things as they were. Someone had to fill in those gaps.\n'That would be the two of us.'\nJ gazed blankly at Jung Bin.",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Good Days\nJ stared blankly at Jung Bin. Jung Bin, who was rubbing his nose for no reason, glanced at J. The ends of his drooping black hair were slightly wet. Jung Bin gestured towards J's hair.\n\"It looks like you just came from a shower.\"\n\"Oh, yes.\"\nJ touched the tips of his hair with his fingertips. Despite trying to dry it, there was still some moisture left.\n\"There was a lot of blood. I couldn't get on the helicopter like that.\"\n\"...So you're heading somewhere else right away. Where are you going this time?\"\n\"They said there's a dungeon in Chungju.\"\n\"You must be having a hard time. You should rest a bit.\"\nHis tone was full of concern and disapproval. J chuckled briefly at the familiar words. Jung Bin, who traveled around the country as much as J did, wasn't one to talk. J replied lightly.\n\"We're short on manpower, so it can't be helped. Aren't you going anywhere else today?\"\n\"Oh, no. For now, I'm not. I have an interrogation schedule today.\"\nJung Bin tapped the earpiece he was wearing.\n\"I'll have to go if I get a call, though.\"\nJust as he finished speaking, J's watch rang. Judging by the loud wind and propeller noise, it seemed a helicopter was ready on the rooftop. Jung Bin's face darkened rapidly.\n\"...They say words become reality... Sorry about that.\"\n\"Don't be. It looks like the helicopter is here, so I'll get going. Take care.\"\nJ passed Jung Bin and headed up the stairs. Watching his back blankly, Jung Bin called out urgently.\n\"Wait a minute, J!\"\nJ's masked face popped out from the upper stair railing. Jung Bin was rummaging through his pockets to take something out when a loud voice came from somewhere.\n\"Hey! Bring Hunter Jung Bin here quickly!\"\n\"What should I tell him?\"\n\"Say a detained hunter is causing a disturbance or something!\"\n\"...\"\n\"Sigh, we're both busy.\"\nJ waved his hand nonchalantly and disappeared up the stairs. Left alone, Jung Bin tightly clenched what he was holding. With a snap, the energy bar in his hand broke in two. The commotion was growing louder.\nHa... He sighed deeply and pressed his earpiece firmly.\n\"Yes, I heard about the disturbance. I'll be there soon.\"\nJung Bin looked up at the stairs extending above him and then started down the stairs.\n***\nCreak... A huge body collapsed to the ground with a deflating sound. Thud, the ground shook. J, who was looking at it indifferently, shook off the blood from his spear and put it in his inventory.\nThe Chungju dungeon was dealt with quicker than expected. Since it appeared in a remote mountain area, there were no civilians to rescue, the dungeon rank wasn't very high, and the dungeon itself was small.\nJ stared vacantly at the huge bird, the dungeon boss, that had collapsed on the ground and thought.\n'The hunters here could have handled this.'\nEarlier, when J, who had descended the mountain, reached near the dungeon entrance. A few hunters were already gathered at the entrance. Wrapped in bandages here and there, they were holding cigarettes and seemed to be arguing about something.\nWhy aren't they going in? J, hiding behind a tree, watched curiously. A hunter raised his voice.\n\"Damn it, it's frustrating. I contacted the Awakened Management Bureau! J is coming himself! We don't need to go in!\"\n\"What? Why call J! We can handle this dungeon with our team...\"\n\"Hey, you idiot. If J swings his spear once, it'll be cleared immediately. Do we have to risk our lives fighting the dungeon boss? Do you have two lives?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Seung-min's arm hasn't even healed yet. Damn it, we almost had to amputate. I can't watch that again. Everyone has their role.\"\nThe hunter who was roughly scolding exhaled a puff of cigarette smoke. White smoke billowed and scattered into the sky.\n\"No matter how good we are, we can't compare to the hero. You'll thank me later.\"\nCrunch. A branch broke underfoot. The gathered hunters' eyes focused on the source of the sound. J stepped out from behind the tree without hesitation. Their faces turned pale with shock upon seeing the black mask and combat uniform. The air grew heavy.\n\"...\"\nJ slowly approached and stood in front of the dungeon entrance. Someone gulped. J didn't even glance at them. He just quietly walked into the dungeon.\n'Saving people is something that must be done.'\nThere was no doubt about that. But when others took his actions for granted... that was something he couldn't help but get tired of.\nBuzz... The air vibrated slightly, and an exit appeared behind the dungeon boss's corpse. Fortunately, it interrupted his unpleasant thoughts. J stared blankly at the shimmering exit. Nonetheless, once a thought started, it flowed like water.\n'Nothing is certain in this world...'\nHe closed his eyes. The images of hunters wrapped in bandages came to mind. Hunters holding weapons with their arms in casts. They looked quite tired too. But,\n'I don't necessarily need to step in...'\nBefore he could finish his thought, he took off his mask and slapped his cheeks loudly. His cheeks burned. His cool face, still retaining a boyish look, was revealed. He rummaged through his pocket and took out a crumpled pack of cigarettes.\nHe put a cigarette in his mouth and clicked a cheap lighter. Lighting it, he took a deep drag. But only briefly.\nCough, cough, J coughed harshly, his shoulders shaking. Tears welled up in his eyes. As the coughing subsided, silence returned. The cigarettes, which he had smoked only a few times, felt unfamiliar. But so did the air of the dungeons he frequently entered.\n\"...Ha.\"\nIt seemed he would never get used to it. This, at least.\n***\nAfter the Chungju dungeon was a rift that appeared in Mangwon-dong. It was an absorption-type rift that had swallowed all the surrounding buildings. Listening to the tedious briefing, J closed his eyes. Yes, this was better. Better to stay busy than to have useless thoughts.\nBefore long, they arrived at their destination, and the helicopter's altitude gradually lowered. J lightly jumped out of the helicopter. Thud, the ground vibrated under his feet.\nNear the rift, there was nothing but empty space, as if something had devoured everything. As he approached the target, the screams and clamor of people grew louder.\n\"J!\"\n\"J is here!\"\n\"Oh, thank goodness...\"\nSighs of relief mixed with gratitude were heard from all around. J's eyes narrowed. There were too many people around the rift entrance.\n'Has the rescue team not entered yet?'\nThen a hunter approached, almost running.\n\"May I report, J?\"\n\"Yes, go ahead.\"\n\"The rescue team entered the rift, but it's completely covered in poison inside... They came out immediately. The situation is very serious.\"\n\"...Poison?\"\n\"Yes! We couldn't go far; everyone...\"\nJ slowly looked around. A white tent set up a little away from the crack, and under it, hunters with blackened bodies were lying on the ground, groaning in pain.\nOne hunter had his face buried in a bucket, vomiting dark red blood. Another was clutching his blackened, melting arm, crying out in agony. It was utter chaos. The reporting hunter muttered.\n\"There probably aren't any survivors inside. The poison is too strong for even hunters to withstand... It would be best to deal with the crack boss as quickly as possible...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Here, please take some spare antidotes. They're not the best, but...\"\nThe hunter took out several bottles of purple liquid from his inventory and offered them. But J shook his head.\n\"I'll take half. Use the rest to treat the people.\"\nAnd shortly after, inside the rift. J rarely regretted something.\n'...I should have taken them all.'\nHe frowned. The air was filled with a stinging, acrid smell.\nThe rift inside was a completely different world. Collapsed buildings had melted into the black poison, making them unrecognizable, and giant salamanders and toads were flicking their tongues, their eyes peeking out from the black swamp. J quickly assessed the situation.\n'If the inside is like this, there are probably no survivors...'\nNo, there wouldn't be.\nJ adjusted his mask properly. He could handle most poisons with his body. But in an environment completely surrounded by poison like this rift, whether his body could withstand it was uncertain. In fact, his body felt heavier with every breath.\nIt must be the toxic gas rising from the swamp. Staying long would be foolish.\n'Deal with the rift boss as quickly as possible and escape.'\nBut as always. J's plan didn't go smoothly.\nJust before he leaped forward, he closed his eyes and focused his senses. Numerous monster presences, the presence of the giant rift boss, and then...\nThe small sound of a heartbeat catching his ear.\nJ's eyes widened.",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Good Days\nThe faint sound of a heartbeat. J followed it as if he were mesmerized. He walked without realizing his feet were sinking into the swamp from time to time.\nHow long had he walked? A building that was relatively intact, though partially destroyed, came into view. The sound was coming from there. J began to rummage through the debris.\n'Why?'\nReason asked him. What's the point of rescuing someone who will die soon anyway? Do you want to experience someone dying in your arms again? But his hands didn't stop sifting through the wreckage. In fact, his pace quickened.\nEven if that were the case, J couldn't ignore this sound.\n\"Oh.\"\nA small exclamation escaped. Under the overlapping debris was a small space where one or two people could barely huddle. And there...\nThere was a boy, embraced by what must have been his parents, all melted away.\nHis eyes, clouded with poison, stared at J. His lips moved silently.\n\"Please save me.\"\nJ gritted his teeth. He hurriedly took out an antidote from his inventory and reached out to the boy.\n\"It's okay.\"\nA lie he'd told countless times,\n\"It'll be okay now.\"\nHoping that this time, it wouldn't be a lie.\n***\nTime passed quickly.\nKilling dungeon masters, killing rift masters, killing dungeon masters, killing rift masters, killing dungeon masters... At some point, he was only assigned tasks to kill monsters instead of rescuing people. Endless repetition. J's routine didn't change easily.\nBut, rarely, a new task was added to his routine.\nClomp, clomp, clomp. His black boots cut through the hallway without hesitation. The gazes of passersby were fixed on the tall young man dressed in all black. Someone mustered the courage to greet him. His black mask turned towards them.\nHe nodded slightly and opened the iron door at the end of the hallway. The people in safety suits busily moving around indicated that it was a laboratory set up in a hospital.\nJ crossed the laboratory familiarly and opened another iron door. This time it was a thicker door. Inside, people dressed even more heavily than those in the lab were observing the purple liquid in flasks. A researcher standing by the door bowed deeply.\n\"Ah, J! It's been a while. Thank you for coming despite your busy schedule!\"\nThe researcher greeted him warmly and handed over a metal box. J placed a heavy bag inside it. A pungent smell wafted out as black liquid seeped from the bag. The researcher, moving with great caution, headed to the back storage room. J asked,\n\"Are you short on poison?\"\n\"We still have a little left from last time, so we have enough.\"\n\"Is the research going well?\"\n\"Yes, it's going quite smoothly. Are you going to see the child today too?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Ah, J!\"\nAnother researcher approached in quick steps. J stopped and turned his head. He recognized her as the potion-making Awakener introduced to him by the hospital director.\nA woman in glasses, a white coat, and brown hair tied up with a large clip, Ga-young, looked quite elated. She whispered softly as she came closer.\n\"The child's condition is gradually improving. The antidote we developed seems to be effective. It's all thanks to you, J!\"\n\"...\"\nJ stared at her in silence, making her cough awkwardly.\n\"Uh, was I too excited? We've been focusing on detoxification, so other treatments have been delayed... But he's not at a point where visits are entirely impossible anymore.\"\nGa-young glanced at J's reaction before speaking again.\n\"Starting today, how about you visit the child's room directly? You've always been looking through the glass.\"\n\"...Is that alright?\"\n\"Of course. All this research is possible thanks to you, J.\"\nGa-young waved her hand dismissively. Whether it was a brief act of curiosity, a whim, or self-satisfaction, J couldn't tell. It didn't matter much anymore.\nJ followed Ga-young's lead. The child's room was deep within the hospital. As they walked in silence, Ga-young spoke.\n\"Just so you know... As you might have seen through the glass, the child is mostly unconscious. Sometimes he wakes up, but he doesn't stay awake for long. We're administering painkillers and anesthesia regularly.\"\n\"Is that necessary?\"\n\"It's not by choice! We don't want to either. But...\"\nGa-young sighed heavily.\n\"Without it, the child would pass out from the pain. Last time, he fainted, and it's been like that ever since. Unfortunately, until the poison is completely detoxified... Ah, we're here.\"\nGa-young pressed a card key against a device and opened the door. Beyond it was a white hallway and a firmly shut white door. She opened the door. Inside was a white, spacious room. At its center lay a boy, wrapped in white bandages and connected to numerous machines.\nGa-young stepped back.\n\"I'll wait outside. Take your time.\"\n\"Alright. I'll be out soon.\"\n\"Oh, no rush! Stay as long as you need.\"\nThud, the door closed behind him. J slowly looked around the room.\nBeep, beep, beep... The regular beeping of the machines seemed to replace the sound of the boy's heartbeat. He slowly approached the bed.\nThe nose and mouth barely visible between the bandages, the chest rising and falling slowly, the occasional dreadful groan. His cold eyes scanned the boy.\n\"So this is what they call an improvement....\"\nWell, they had removed the oxygen mask, so it could be considered an improvement. J smirked coldly. Even so, the boy was still like a corpse.\nJ pulled a round folding chair closer and sat down a moderate distance from the bed. He silently watched the boy breathe, observing the faint movements.\n\"...\"\nHow long has it been? Eventually, J rested his elbows on his knees and propped his chin on his hands. The fundamental question that had plagued him since the moment he held the boy's hand. He bit his lip.\n'Was it really the right thing to save this boy?'\nThe boy had asked to be saved, but he wouldn't have known that survival came with the price of being consumed by poison, unable to move, feeling his body decay.\nWas it right to let him endure this pain? The pain was so unbearable he fainted. Was all this just my selfishness?\nWas the boy suffering because of my selfish desire to save someone?\n'Would it be better to just end his life...'\nAt that moment, the boy's fingertips twitched slightly. J momentarily relaxed his grip. He straightened his back and fixed his gaze on the boy's hand. Amid the regular beeping of the machine, the boy's fingers moved again. The movement was larger than before.\n\"You.\"\nThe words slipped out unintentionally. The fingers, as if responding to his voice, curled slightly. J widened his eyes and tapped his knee with his fingers. Could it be that the boy's hearing was unaffected? He asked again.\n\"Are you awake?\"\nThe head, which had been facing the ceiling, slowly turned toward him. The eyes covered by bandages seemed to be looking at J. It might have been his imagination. The cracked, pale lips slowly parted. What came out was a small breath, but...\nIt felt like an answer.\n\"You're awake.\"\nJ spoke the answer out loud. At that moment, a feeling he hadn't experienced in a long time surged through him. He knew the name of this emotion.\nJoy.\nJ hurriedly grabbed the folding chair and moved closer to the bed. The boy's head was still turned towards him. The movements, which had been barely noticeable, grew more pronounced. J asked.\n\"How long have you been awake?\"\n\"...\"\n\"How do you feel? Are you in a lot of pain? Are you okay?\"\nJ's voice grew uncharacteristically loud. Despite the lack of verbal response, the boy's fingers continued to move slightly.\nIt seemed he wasn't writing letters with his fingers but simply proving that he was awake. A small groan escaped the boy's lips. J's face, hidden under the mask, grimaced slightly.\n\"Do you need painkillers? Should I ask them to give you some?\"\nAt that moment, upon hearing the word \"painkillers,\" the boy turned his head away with a speed noticeably faster than before. It might have been his best effort. It was still slow, but...\n\"...Hah.\"\nJ, who had been watching intently, let out a chuckle. The head slowly turned back to face him. The corners of J's mouth had lifted into a grin without him realizing it.\nThe endless tormenting worries, the fatigue eating away at his body, the sinking feeling from the depths— they had all evaporated.\nHis playful eyes were now filled with the boy. J leaned closer to the bed, propping his chin with his hand and smiling.\n\"Hey, you're funny.\"\nApparently, the boy he had saved...\n\"...\"\nHad a strong will.\nQuite a strong one, indeed.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Good Days\nJ carefully examined the boy again. His face was pale, and his chapped lips were tightly shut. He seemed quite displeased.\nHow could he express his feelings just with the shape of his mouth? Despite being on the verge of fainting from the pain, he still managed to firmly express his intentions even in extreme situations.\n'They say people get mean when they're in pain.'\nWas this kid becoming vicious because of the pain, or was it his original personality? J's curiosity was piqued. Lost in thought while scrutinizing the boy, J suddenly asked,\n\"Do you remember me?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I brought you back, from there. It was me.\"\nEven though the story was vague, the boy seemed to understand, as his tightly shut lips loosened a bit. His head turned slightly more towards J, as if he remembered that time.\n'It would be better if he didn't remember that.'\nIf the melted figure that had been protecting the boy was really his parent or family... even more so. J bit the inside of his cheek. Human memory doesn't move as one wishes, and memories one wants to forget only become clearer over time. J, staring at the boy's bandaged face, said,\n\"I heard you can't talk yet... Can you move your fingers?\"\nIn response, the boy's fingertips twitched. J propped his chin up and muttered,\n\"Then just move your fingers. I'll try my best to understand.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm good at talking to myself and reading people.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Got it? Can you move your fingers?\"\nThe boy's fingertips wiggled. J smiled broadly.\n\"Yeah, like that.\"\nBeep, beep, beep... Amid the somewhat rough and labored breathing, there was a quieter breath mixed in. The hospital room, which would usually only echo one person's breathing, seemed a bit fuller. It was a rare moment of peace. With his eyes closed, J whispered,\n\"I'm J.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's not my real name, but just call me that. I'm a hunter, quite high-ranked, and affiliated with the Awakened Management Bureau... That's about it. Oh, darn... I don't really have much else to say.\"\nThe boy's fingers twitched. J watched the boy's fingers move diligently. He had boldly claimed he'd understand everything, but in truth...\n'I have no idea what he's saying.'\nIt was completely incomprehensible. J awkwardly twisted his lips in embarrassment.\nWell, time would solve this too. The more time they spent together, the better he'd get at understanding the boy's slight movements. After all, he was quite good at learning. Tapping his mask with his finger, J said absentmindedly,\n\"You won't see my real face even when you're healthy. I'm wearing a mask. So don't be too sad about your eyes being injured... They can be treated.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The voice you're hearing now isn't mine either. The mask alters my voice.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh, want to touch it once? Can you move your arm?\"\nJ moved closer to the bed and gently rolled up the boy's sleeve.\nBut the bandaged arm was covered in tubes and needles, with no space to spare. It looked like the researchers or doctors would rush in at any moment if he even moved it a bit.\nJ reluctantly put his hands behind his back and stared into the air.\n\"...I guess that's not possible.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Your arm's in no condition to be touched. Sorry.\"\nThe boy's busy fingers stopped abruptly. His lips puckered again. J, coughing lightly, turned his head slightly.\n\"I'll let you touch it when you're healthier.\"\n\"...\"\nThe boy's head, which had been turning away, slowly started to turn back towards J. J quickly spoke,\n\"Really, I promise. I'll let you touch it.\"\nJ hurriedly reached out and lightly touched the boy's pinky with his own. Shaking hands was impossible in the current state. No matter how careful he was, the boy was a severely weakened civilian, and J was a top-tier Awakener.\nFortunately, it seemed to work. The boy turned his head back towards J. Relieved, J began to gently fiddle with the boy's fingers, as if handling a precious porcelain.\n\"Scratch my hand if it hurts.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But don't scratch too hard, your fingers might break.\"\nEvery place he touched made the bandaged hand flinch. It was fun to watch, like a mimosa plant. J, fiddling with the bandages and fingers, murmured,\n\"You must be bored being alone.\"\nJust then, his watch buzzed with a long beep. It was a call.\n\"Oh.\"\nHow much time had passed? As J quickly came to his senses and let go of the boy's hand, the faint fingers brushed against the back of J's hand. J's eyes widened. The boy's fingers were reaching out to him. Surprised, J clasped the boy's hand.\n\"What, does it hurt?\"\n\"...\"\nThe fingers moved slightly as if to say yes. J, looking troubled, said,\n\"...But I have to go because of this call... I really have to go. I'll call the nurse for you.\"\n\"...\"\nThe boy's lips pouted. Without thinking, J blurted out,\n\"I'll come again.\"\n\"...\"\nThe lips stayed puckered. Groaning, J looked up at the ceiling and said,\n\"...I'll try to come as often as I can. But I don't know how often that will be.\"\n\"...\"\nThe lips seemed to pout even more. Damn, he shouldn't have been so honest. J was never good at lying. He sighed.\n\"Sorry. Just wait a bit.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll come back as soon as possible. Okay?\"\nFinally, the boy's fingers lightly poked J's palm and withdrew. He still didn't look happy, though. J lightly touched the bandaged cheek and then pulled his hand back.\n\"See you next time.\"\nJ turned and headed towards the door. As he opened it, Ga-young, who had been sitting in a chair with her arms crossed and eyes closed, quickly opened her eyes. She must have dozed off. Rubbing her mouth, she stood up hastily.\n\"You're out already! You could have stayed longer.\"\n\"No, I got a call from the Bureau.\"\n\"Aren't you too busy? Dungeons, rifts... And you're bringing us materials too.\"\n\"Well... It can't be helped.\"\nClosing the door with a click, J shrugged. They walked in silence as they retraced their steps. As they neared the research room, J spoke.\n\"By the way.\"\n\"Yes! Please, go ahead.\"\n\"Can you make me a card for accessing the hospital room? My own card.\"\n\"Uh?\"\nGa-young looked at J with her mouth agape. J, hands behind his back, spoke with a smile in his voice.\n\"I've donated quite a bit... That should be possible, right?\"\n***\nTime passed quickly again. At least this time, it felt lighter than the time before.\nDrip, drip, drip, blood droplets fell like rain as he swung his spear through the air. J shook off the blood from his spear and headed towards the dungeon exit. As his body was pulled, familiar scenery appeared before his eyes.\nHe stood at the gate of a dilapidated house. It was a rare case of a house turning into a dungeon, so J had personally entered it. Fortunately, it was a relatively peaceful place. A hunter waiting at the entrance handed him a white towel damp with water. J took the towel, wiped the blood from his hands, and pressed his in-ear.\n\"This is J.\"\nA gentle voice asked,\n—How was the dungeon?\n\"It was fine. It was forest-shaped, and there were quite a few useful things. I killed all the monsters and the dungeon master... So how about sending in an investigation and research team?\"\n—Alright. But...\nThere was a moment of silence. J checked his in-ear with a puzzled look. The connection wasn't cut. Ham Seok-jeong was unusually hesitant. After a brief silence, she asked,\n—Is there something good that happened to you recently?\n\"...Pardon?\"\nJ stopped in his tracks and blankly checked his watch. He thought he might be talking to his aunt instead of the director, but it was the director. Why would the director ask something like this? Just as J was about to fall into confusion, Ham Seok-jeong quickly continued,\n—No, you seem happier these days, that's all.\n\"...\"\n—...It's not a complaint. I think I said something unnecessary. Just forget it.\n\"Oh, no.\"\nJ answered in a dazed voice.\n\"Um... Thank you for your concern.\"\n—...Alright. It's relatively quiet today, so get some rest.\n\"Yes...\"\nThe call ended. Not much had changed, but was it enough for Ham Seok-jeong to ask about it? J scratched his head and gestured to the hunter waiting beside him.\n\"Thank you. You can head back too.\"\n\"Aren't you going back to the Bureau with us?\"\n\"Oh, no. I have somewhere else to go.\"\n\"Understood. Thank you for your hard work.\"\nThe hunter bowed and disappeared. J walked slowly. His steps, initially normal, quickened as he reached a familiar alley, and he was almost running by the time he saw the white building.\nEntering through the staff entrance, taking the elevator, climbing the stairs, walking down the hallway, and swiping his ID card. Beep, a cheerful mechanical sound accompanied the familiar hospital room door. J's grin widened as he swung the white door open.\nThe bed in the center of the pristine hospital room was still surrounded by machines. However, it wasn't as quiet and bleak as before.\nThe boy, who had been leaning against the bed, slowly turned his head. His face, still wrapped in bandages, was different from before. Previously, only his nose and mouth were exposed, but now his entire face, including his eyes, nose, and mouth, was visible. Although his eyes were clouded and blurred due to the venom, they were clearly focused on J.\nJ spread his arms wide.\n\"Hyung's here!\"\nThe boy's blurred eyes narrowed, almost as if he were smiling.",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Good Days\n\"Hyung's here!\"\nJ closed his wide-open arms, shut the door behind him, and strode over to the bed. The stagnant air swirled around him. Bringing with him the outside wind, J bent down slightly and asked.\n\"What were you doing?\"\n\"...\"\nThere was no answer. The only response was the slightly narrowed, dull eyes and the faintly raised corners of his mouth under the bandages, which soon disappeared. Beneath the expressionless face, the fingers on the blanket twitched slightly. By now, J had come to understand most of the meanings hidden in the boy's small gestures.\n\"You were waiting for me.\"\nJ dragged a small chair closer to the bed and sat down. J leaned his masked face closer. The boy leaned his upper body back a little. With a voice tinged with laughter, J asked.\n\"You missed me, didn't you?\"\nThe boy blinked slowly and turned his head away. Judging by his tightly closed lips, he seemed upset again. The boy J had observed so far was strong-willed and often changed his mood as quickly as flipping a coin. Though this time, J had an idea.\nJ crossed his arms and sighed.\n\"...I'm really sorry. I wanted to come sooner, but I had a lot to do.\"\nSince the boy had regained consciousness, J had been visiting the hospital regularly. After receiving a keycard, he would sometimes drop by quietly like a phantom. Despite his irregular schedule, he somehow made time to procure the antidote, see the boy, and have conversations that went unanswered. Several months passed like this.\nThe boy's head was turned towards J, but his eyes were directed at the empty space beside J.\n\"...\"\n\"Recently, the number of rifts...\"\nOops. J stopped speaking mid-sentence, covered his masked mouth with his fist, and discreetly scanned the surroundings. A black CCTV camera in the corner of the ceiling was watching them. He confirmed it was a model that didn't record audio, but he still couldn't speak carelessly without certainty.\n'It's not confirmed yet...'\nThe number of sudden rifts has been increasing recently. It was so subtle that only a very few hunters working in the field could notice. But he couldn't act on mere suspicion. His words carried more weight than those of others.\n'I should discuss this with Jung Bin.'\nThe boy tilted his head as if to ask why J wasn't speaking. J, clenching his fist tightly, said.\n\"I missed you too.\"\nMaybe because he spoke in a hurry, his buried true feelings unexpectedly burst out. Someone who had to hide his face, voice, and heart rarely expressed his honest feelings. The boy's fingers lightly grasped the blanket.\nNow, instead of the beeping of machines, the sound of the boy's breathing and heartbeat was louder. Many of the wires connecting his body to the devices had been removed. Compared to the days when he lay there like a corpse, it was a significant improvement.\n'He can sit up now.'\nAlthough he still needed help from people and lay on a bed, the boy's condition was improving day by day. So much so that J was thinking about a future far beyond tomorrow.\n\"...\"\nAfter fidgeting with the blanket for a long time, the boy slowly reached out his hand. J, without hesitation, took it. His sturdy hands completely covered the small hand. As J gently rubbed the back of the boy's hand, he asked.\n\"How are you feeling? Not in pain? I heard they changed the medicine mix a bit.\"\nThe boy nodded very slightly.\n\"That's good.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Seeing you sitting up like this... you might be able to walk someday.\"\nSomeday, he might be able to write something to express himself, to walk out of the bed, and to leave this room on his own.\n'Who knows, maybe he'll be able to speak.'\nThe thought suddenly crossed his mind. Since becoming a hunter, J had never thought about the distant future. He was too busy surviving each day.\nLeaving thoughts to others, reassuring himself it was okay, and swinging his spear, believing that peace would eventually come, and that a house of peace would be built on the foundation he laid.\nBut this boy made J dream of a different future. Not a grand future where peace arrives, but a more personal one. J looked at the small hand moving in his grasp and opened his mouth.\n\"Have you ever seen the sea?\"\nThe cloudy eyes rolled to look at J. The boy's lips pouted as if asking what kind of question that was. Or maybe he thought J was mocking him. J smiled.\n\"I'm not mocking you. I was thinking we could go to the sea when you get better.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I went to Gangneung once to catch a Kraken or a giant squid... Anyway, its sucker was really big. That's not the point...\"\n\"...\"\nJ cleared his throat and patted the boy's hand.\n\"The sea was beautiful there. Let's go together when you get better.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you like the idea, blink.\"\nPeople have to blink because of physiological needs, but it was a suggestion nonetheless. However, the boy blinked without hesitation. In his closed and opened cloudy eyes, J was fully reflected. The corners of his mouth curled up.\n\"It's a promise. Even if you don't want to go later, I'll carry you there.\"\nJ held out his pinky finger. Then he carefully grabbed the boy's bandaged hand and linked their fingers. The boy let out a small sigh. J chuckled.\n\"Oh, you can sigh now.\"\nThe corners of the boy's mouth curled up under the bandages.\nWhat was the source of the rifts, where did the dungeons connect to, where did the monsters come from? What was the system that chose humans and lent them power?\nThe world turned upside down since the Day of the Rift was full of unknowns. The days were so messy that it was hard to judge what was right and wrong. But that messy world was J's everyday life.\nThe one constant in the endless changes was the one who waited for him. The place he had to return to. J closed his eyes and bowed his head.\nIt's strange. It felt like you were showing me the way. That I wasn't wrong.\nWhat happens when lonely people meet? J now knew the answer. When lonely people meet, they become each other's only. The boy had grown into a significant presence, so much so that no special words were enough to describe him.\nHow long has it been? The boy fell asleep while listening to J's random stories. His irregular breathing became even, and his grip loosened. Watching his chest rise and fall weakly, J stood up. Without letting go of the boy's hand, he bent down and gently cupped his cheek with his other hand. Brushing against the bandages, he whispered softly.\n\"Do you know?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You're my only success.\"\nJ withdrew his hand from the boy's cheek. A serene atmosphere surrounded them. The small sound of breathing and heartbeat. It would be nice to continue being together like this. Like a family.\nHe had thought that way once.\n***\nAfter staying by the boy's side for a long time, J sensed a small presence and stepped out of the hospital room. Ga-young, holding a file to her chest, was waiting for him with her other hand in her coat pocket. Bowing her head, she whispered.\n\"Hello, J! I have something to tell you.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"It's about the antidote and the boy's condition, uh... Shall I give you a brief explanation?\"\nGa-young glanced at J's wrist. His watch screen was blinking. It seemed the Awakened Management Bureau was contacting him. The sender was...\nJung Bin.\n\"Just a moment.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nJ half-turned and manipulated the watch. The message displayed on the small screen was brief.\nJung Bin: I would like to meet with you. Please let me know if you're available in the evening.\nWhat could he want to discuss? J was a bit puzzled, but it might actually be a good thing. He needed someone discreet to talk to about the changes in the rifts. J lowered his eyes and, lost in thought, replied.\n\"I have a little time. Please tell me briefly.\"\n\"Oh, okay! Then I'll report. Recovery is progressing smoothly. We still need to administer the antidote regularly, but the detoxification process is almost complete. After the detoxification, we plan to start research on restoring the damaged body.\"\n\"Will he be able to walk someday?\"\n\"Well, I think it's possible. Honestly, I'm not sure about the eyes and vocal cords. Um, but we'll do our best.\"\nJ let out a deep breath. Ga-young, who had been bowing her head, glanced at J and asked.\n\"But are you going to keep calling him 'that boy'?\"\n\"...What?\"\nJ opened his eyes wide. Holding the file under her arm, Ga-young spoke awkwardly.\n\"We still don't know his name, right? He can't write, and he can't speak... And we can't find his family either.\"\n\"...\"\nHe recalled the ruins covered in venom. The two melted corpses that had been surrounding the boy. Identifying people in a place where everything was engulfed by poison was impossible. There was neither the time nor the manpower to invest in that. It was a harsh reality. Ga-young muttered.\n\"Anyway, since you brought him, J... How about you give him a name?\"\n\"A name.\"\n\"Yes. A name is important for a person. I think the boy would like it too.\"\n\"...No.\"\nJ glanced into the hospital room and muttered.\n\"It's fine. He must have his own name.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Someday, he'll tell us his name himself.\"\n\"...What if he can't?\"\n\"What?\"\nSurprised by the sudden question, J looked at Ga-young. Receiving his gaze, Ga-young straightened up and answered.\n\"Oh, I mean... not in any other sense, but his vocal cords might not recover. He might have forgotten how to write.\"\nJ nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders, as if to say, \"Why are you asking that?\"\n\"I'll give him a name then, myself.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 109: Short\nAs the bright red sunset receded and the bluish night sky took over, J, who was sitting crookedly on the outdoor stairs of the Awakened Management Bureau headquarters, was rarely looking at the rankings provided by the system. With each upward swipe of the air, the names on the ranking list updated quickly.\n\"His vocal cords might not recover. He might have forgotten how to write.\"\n'...That's true.'\nGa-young's opinion was valid. In reality, the boy's injuries were not ones that could be easily healed. The fact that he was still alive after being poisoned was nothing short of a miracle.\nEven with treatment, he might never be able to speak again or see anything. It would be best if the boy could tell his own name, but...\nMost of J's wishes had not come true so far.\n'I should at least think of a name candidate.'\nPhone books and graduation albums were swept away during the Day of the Rift, and the names J could remember were few and far between. The barely recovered internet was incomparably slower than before. Would the system ranking list be of any help?\nJ propped his chin crookedly and glanced through the newly updated list.\n[BaekdusanTiger]\n[GloryUnbeaten]\n[Berserker]\n[HeroicSpirit]\n'None of these are helpful...'\nWhy do hunters like hunter names so much? J, a pioneer and leader in using a hunter name, lamented. At that moment, he heard approaching, regular footsteps.\n\"There you are, J.\"\n\"You're here?\"\nJung Bin, wearing black combat gear similar to J's, seemed to have captured another awakener somewhere. He bowed with an apologetic look.\n\"I said I'd be on time but I'm late... I'm sorry.\"\n\"It's okay. You caught a bad guy, right? Who was it this time?\"\n\"Oh, I caught a mental-type awakener who was threatening civilians.\"\nJ, leaning against the wall, tapped the spot next to him. Jung Bin hesitated before taking a seat. With two grown men sitting side by side, it felt a bit cramped. J closed the system window and clasped his hands together.\n\"So, why did you want to see me? Do you have something to say?\"\n\"Yes, I do.\"\nClearing his throat, Jung Bin spoke.\n\"You might have seen the report, but did you know there's a rift in the West Sea?\"\n\"I saw it in the rift list. I thought the Incheon branch could handle it. Isn't it a grade 5?\"\n\"That's right. But...\"\nJung Bin rubbed his chin before continuing.\n\"Since it appeared in the sea, we sent in skilled hunters, but there's been no news from them.\"\n\"When did they go in?\"\n\"It's been 18 days since they entered.\"\n\"...\"\nThe movement of rubbing his fingers stopped. A level 5 rift, if enough personnel were sent in, could typically be resolved within a week. Even if an accident occurred, it rarely took more than a week. But now it has been 18 days.\nJung Bin continued, rubbing his chin.\n\"After 14 days, we sent in additional personnel... but there's been no word from them either.\"\nSomething had clearly happened. J leaned forward, clasped hands to his masked face. His voice, altered by the mask, carried tension.\n\"...What about Aunt?\"\n\"Hunter Park Hye-kyung hasn't gone in yet. She's in charge of the Incheon branch, after all.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But if this continues, not just Hunter Park Hye-kyung...\"\nJung Bin trailed off. Both of them knew well what he was about to say next and the weight of those words. Knowing that Jung Bin would feel guilty even saying it, J cut him off.\n\"That's enough.\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nJung Bin lowered his head deeply. Silence ensued. Watching the streetlights turn on one by one, J got up with an exaggerated motion. He touched the back of his neck and turned his head.\n\"Thanks for telling me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, at least I can prepare.\"\n\"...I'm sorry.\"\n\"No need to apologize... Instead of just digging, why don't you think of a name if you have time?\"\n\"A name?\"\n\"Yes, a boy's name.\"\nJung Bin's head shot up. The face that had been filled with guilt now showed astonishment.\n\"Are you planning to have a child? But you're not at that age yet, are you?\"\nJ, also astonished, looked at Jung Bin. Though it wasn't visible because of the mask. Jung Bin hurriedly continued.\n\"I heard you've been visiting somewhere recently... Well, if both of you are happy, I won't object, but...\"\n\"What nonsense is this?\"\n\"Should I tell Hunter Park Hye-kyung...!\"\nWhack! A crisp sound echoed. That day, J hit an S-grade for the first time in his life.\nHe was sturdy.\n***\nAs always, good days are short. Misery is long.\nJ walked with measured steps to the director's office. Knock, knock, he knocked twice before opening the door to a spacious room.\nBehind a heavy brown desk sat a middle-aged woman with short, neat hair that didn't cover her neck and a stern, raptor-like face. The black nameplate shone under the fluorescent light.\n[Awakened Management Bureau Director Ham Seok-jeong.]\nHam Seok-jeong gestured.\n\"Come in. Sit.\"\nHam Seok-jeong adjusted her glasses and pressed her fingers against her forehead. Her face was etched with unshakeable fatigue. J sat on the sofa and glanced at the documents on the table. They were profiles of hunters affiliated with the Awakened Management Bureau or unaffiliated hunters.\nJ flipped through the documents, checking their faces. His hand soon stopped. Among the familiar faces was Park Hye-kyung.\n\"...\"\nPark Hye-kyung, 45 years old, A-grade hunter, Incheon branch of the Awakened Management Bureau. Above her confident smile was a red stamp.\n[Status: Unknown.]\nThe edge of the document crumpled. Ham Seok-jeong, who had gotten up with a sigh, asked,\n\"Would you like something to drink? We have green tea and coffee.\"\n\"So Aunt went inside after all.\"\n\"...\"\nThough his tone was sarcastic, Ham Seok-jeong only gazed at J with an inscrutable expression. He mouthed silently. 'Status: Unknown'. No matter how many times he repeated it, it didn't feel real. It felt like he had lost his sense of reality, like wandering in a dream...\nJ threw down the document. The collected papers scattered randomly on the table.\n\"Well... it's a rift close to the Incheon branch, so of course she went in.\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"And the headquarters sent additional personnel too.\"\n\"They did.\"\n\"But no one came back.\"\n\"...Right.\"\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"Are you testing me?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nShe sighed deeply. Ham Seok-jeong, who sat opposite J on the sofa, took off her glasses and covered her face with both hands. Heavy silence fell. Neither Ham Seok-jeong nor J spoke first.\nHow much time passed? J saw another familiar face among the scattered documents. A new hunter he had encountered a few times in the rift. J bit his lip.\n[Status: Unknown.]\nHe crossed his legs and leaned back on the sofa.\n\"What's wrong, Director?\"\n\"...\"\nStatus: Unknown.\n\"Just give the order.\"\nStatus: Unknown.\n\"Say I'm the only one you can trust, that I'm the last resort.\"\nStatus: Unknown.\n\"So order me to go into the rift.\"\nStatus: Unknown.\n\"So order me to die there—\"\nHam Seok-jeong snapped her head up like lightning, her eyes wide as if she had seen a ghost. Only then did J see her eyes were swollen and red. Ah, J let out a small sigh.\nHe regretted it too late. He should have looked at her face first. He should have had a light conversation as usual. His neck felt cold. Since seeing the 'Status: Unknown' stamp on Aunt's photo,\n'Where did it start...'\nJ clenched his fist. He swallowed hard.\n'...to go wrong?'\nOnce spoken, words couldn't be taken back.\nAfter fleeing the director's office, he came to his senses in front of a familiar hospital room door. How he got there, he didn't know. J banged his forehead against the cold door. Should he tell the boy he was going into the rift?\nJ brushed away the sudden question. No. Entering rifts was as routine as eating. There was no need to say anything special. It wouldn't take long to come back.\nHe just needed to rescue the people and kill the rift's master. As always. This time, the rescue targets were hunters, which was a bit different.\nAnd it was a bit different because he had to rescue Aunt.\nStatus: Unknown.\n'...'\nHe clenched his fist tightly. He was overwhelmed by the urge to smash something. It felt like his insides were burning.\nStatus: Unknown.\n'Rather, if in the rift...'\nStatus: Unknown.\n'If I die...'\nAt that moment, a rustling sound caught his ear. It came from inside the hospital room. J instinctively flung the door open. He widened his eyes.\nThe boy, covered in bandages, was trying to get up from the bed. With weak arms, he was removing the wires connected to his body and struggling to sit up.\nCough, cough... But it seemed too much for him, as harsh coughs burst out. The boy urgently covered his mouth, curled up, and his shoulders shook. The smell of blood filled the air. Between the boy's fingers, which covered his mouth, dark red blood seeped out. J hurriedly ran over and grabbed the boy's shoulder.\n\"Hey, why are you trying to get up?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why...!\"\nJust as J was about to shout, he froze. The bloodied hand desperately gripped the hem of J's clothes. Soon, rough bandages touched his neck, and beyond that, the warmth of...\nA person's warmth.\nJ clenched his teeth. He didn't know how to reject warmth. So, he could only hold him endlessly.",

      "content": "Chapter 110: Short\nBeep, beep, beep... The alarm blared loudly. J carefully embraced the boy, putting as little force as possible into his arms. The boy, nestled in his embrace, coughed intermittently.\nThe smell of blood lingered. J gently stroked the boy's protruding backbone. The boy's body, leaning powerlessly against him, felt unnaturally light, and his heartbeat, though faint, was rapid, as if proving he was still alive.\n'He's alive.'\nI saved him. This child.\nJ reaffirmed the startling truth. Only then did his tense body relax. He sighed. The boy's body, which had just begun to stop coughing, flinched. It seemed the boy knew he had done something wrong. However, J didn't feel like getting angry. Thanks to this boy, he had barely come to his senses.\n'Why die? You have to live till the end...'\nOnly then could he continue living with this stubborn, self-assertive, and highly active child. J sighed once more, a much longer sigh this time. The boy's bloodstained hand cautiously released its grip on J's collar. J pressed his cheek to the boy's crown and muttered.\n\"Does it hurt?\"\n\"...\"\n\"It must hurt... Why did you suddenly do that?\"\nAs always, no answer came back. But as time passed, J could find answers in the boy's small reactions.\nClearly labored breaths and a trembling body. A boy who had learned to endure instead of saying he was in pain. J patted the boy's back. The warmth against his body was comforting.\n\"You can do anything... but don't scare me like that. Got it?\"\n\"...\"\n\"The doctors will be here soon. Just hang on a little longer.\"\n\"...\"\nThe boy, who had been quietly listening, suddenly shook his head. Then, as if trying to escape the embrace, he began to push against J's chest. Startled, J grabbed the boy's arm.\n\"What is it? Why?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't you want to see the doctors?\"\nThe response was ambiguous. It didn't seem like he particularly liked or disliked them. At times like this, it was best to ask a new question. After rolling his eyes for a moment, J rubbed his cheek against the boy's crown and playfully asked.\n\"Or do you just want to stay with me?\"\nThe head beneath his cheek began to nod vigorously. It was such a clear reaction that it took J by surprise. He stared at the boy with a dumbfounded expression. Then a smile bloomed behind his mask. And that smile turned into laughter in an instant.\n\"Haha! Oh... really.\"\nThe boy started to wriggle as if trying to escape his arms. J hurriedly hugged the boy tighter and soothed him.\n\"Wait, wait. I'm not laughing at you. Really.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Ahem, ahem. Hold on.\"\nJ pulled out a bottle of opaque sky-blue liquid from his inventory. The liquid crawled around inside the bottle as if it had a life of its own. It was a piece of slime he had picked up after seeing hunters play with it. He thought it would be a good toy for a child, but it seemed to have found a new use.\nJ tore off a piece and threw it towards the door crack. The slime piece hit the crack with a squelch and slowly expanded, sealing the small gap completely. With it sticking like that, it would be hard for anyone to open the door.\n'While I'm at it...'\nHe tore off another small piece and threw it at the CCTV camera on the ceiling. The piece wiggled and wrapped around the entire camera. J clapped his hands.\n\"Alright... Now no one can come in. Satisfied?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Honestly, you're such a handful.\"\nHis voice, sounding like he was scolding, was full of undeniable affection. The boy leaned in closer. Their upper bodies pressed together. Now, even the boy could probably feel J's heartbeat. J patted the boy's back and, without thinking, blurted out something he hadn't intended to say.\n\"...I'm going away for a while.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, it might take a long time this time. I don't even know how long it'll be...\"\nA hand that could barely grasp anything clutched desperately at his shirt. J stared at the hand for a moment before asking.\n\"...Are you telling me not to go?\"\nThe boy slowly nodded. How great it would be if he could. Honestly, J didn't want to go into the fray either. In the past, he would have entered immediately upon receiving orders. Without any judgment, just doing as they said. Without considering his own life. But the reason he was still here was...\nJ lifted his mask, which covered his entire face, a little. Though he still had a youthful look, a sharp jawline that signified he was now a grown man was revealed.\n\"Give me your hand.\"\n\"...\"\nHe guided the hand gripping his shirt to his face. As soon as the fingers touched his bare skin, they flinched as if burned. J chuckled softly.\n\"Touch it properly.\"\n\"...\"\n\"We promised, remember? I said I'd let you touch. Well, this is my face, not a mask...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Weren't you curious?\"\nAt his gentle urging, the fingers that had been frozen in place cautiously brushed his cheek. J closed his eyes and quietly offered his face. The hesitation in the fingers melted away as they continued to move. The fingers that had slid down from his cheek to his chin stopped at his lower lip. J's lips curved slightly upward. He deliberately opened his mouth and asked.\n\"Why stop?\"\n\"...\"\nThe fingers, startled, jumped away from his lips. The cautious movement amused J, making it hard to hold back his playful side. After all, the reactions were interesting. J said teasingly.\n\"You're the first person to touch my face like this.\"\nThe fingers, which had been touching his face, suddenly stopped. J gently pressed his cheek against the palm of the boy's hand. Warmth met warmth. The human body heat was reassuring. It was proof of life. J's lips moved slightly.\n\"...I'll be back.\"\nHe knew it. The chances of returning were extremely low. The possibility of finding survivors inside was also slim. But he had to go. Everyone wanted him to. They wanted J to enter the mysterious rift and get rid of it.\nJust like heroes always have. Because a hero is supposed to.\nJ agreed with their wishes. He had to save whoever he could. No reason was needed to save people. Since he himself thought so, no one could stop him.\n'...Except for you.'\nJ looked at his one and only. The boy's face was slightly distorted. It seemed he might cry soon. How selfish it was to ask someone to wait for a person who might never return.\nBut still.\nHe allowed himself this small selfishness. Carefully, he revealed his heart.\n\"Will you wait for me?\"\nThere was no answer. The boy withdrew his hand from J's cheek. Of course. It was understandable. Just as J was about to close his eyes.\n\"...\"\nThe boy held out his pinky finger.\n***\nIn truth, what happened in the West Sea rift is a blur. Even when he tries to recall, only short, fragmented scenes come to mind.\nHe remembered thinking the sight of pure white ashes falling like snow was beautiful, but before he could even finish that thought, seeing blood splatter onto the white ashes.\nKilling monsters, finding parts of the bodies of hunters who had entered before, watching fellow hunters get torn apart by monsters, hearing the screams for help, the cries, the inhuman sounds, his dying aunt's last words...\nDigging through piles of bodies to at least retrieve a limb, jamming a fang into the head of a basilisk only to be met with deathly silence...\n'And then I woke up in the garbage dump.'\nCha Eui-jae sneered and tossed the bags he was holding into the garbage pile. He took off his plastic gloves and ran a hand through his stifling hair.\n'They say if you're under too much stress, you erase parts of your memory. I guess that's what happened to me. It's just my own speculation. That place was hell.'\nYes, that place was a cauldron of life and death.\nDrawing in countless lives and locking them up, leaving only one survivor...\nAfter realizing that place was a cauldron of life and death, Cha Eui-jae stopped trying to piece together his fragmented memories. He just repeated the names and faces of those he couldn't save.\nEven though Cha Eui-jae's body was outside, J seemed to remain in the cauldron of life and death. Digging through the corpses of his comrades, wandering the void, hoping for survivors. Remembering those he couldn't save.\nHolding onto the determination and promise to save everyone. Alone.\n'And now...'\nHe had finally escaped. From that cauldron.\nCha Eui-jae walked without hesitation. Warm orange light flickered from a hangover soup restaurant. In front of the firmly closed iron door stood something shiny. It was a welcome guest. Cha Eui-jae smiled brightly.\n\"Kkokko!\"\n\"Bawk?\"\nThe ceramic chicken turned at the sound of his voice. Carrying a box as big as a human head on its back, Kkokko jumped up and down in place.\n\"Baaawk!\"\nAt the same time, the phone in Cha Eui-jae's apron pocket rang. It was a message. The sender was...\n010-XXXX-XXXXX: Your order has arrived. Please check the attached file.\nA Small Miracle Seo Min-gi.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Short\nIn the midst of the forest on Odaesan in Hongcheon, Gangwon-do, a dark brown wooden door appeared under the shade of a tree. The door opened slowly with a creepy creak, reflecting the hesitant feelings of the person opening it.\nSoon, a young man wearing a black baseball cap and jacket walked out. His face was almost completely obscured beneath the cap, which was because he wore a mask.\nHis worn-out sneakers stepped on the overgrown grass. After surveying the area and confirming there was no one around, the young man squatted down in front of the door. He spoke in a strangely altered voice.\n\"Thank you for opening the door. Thanks to you, I got here quickly.\"\n\"Th-thank you...\"\nRomantic Opener, Choi Go-yo, responded in a dying voice. He was lying face down on the floor of a small room where Cha Eui-jae was staying, with his cheek pressed against the floor. The space was too cramped for an adult male, forcing him to curl up like a frog, presenting a pitiful sight.\nCha Eui-jae looked at him with pity.\n\"Should I move you to a more spacious place?\"\n\"A more spacious place... where?\"\nAfter a moment of thought, Cha Eui-jae asked cautiously.\n\"The floor of the store isn't ideal... How about we put some tables together and lay you on top of them?\"\n\"No...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just drag me over to the grass, please...\"\n\"Are you sure it's okay to stay here? We're in the middle of the mountains.\"\n\"I... I think I'll be fine? Seo Min-gi-ssi will pick me up... probably.\"\nHis answer wasn't convincing. Cha Eui-jae looked at Choi Go-yo doubtfully, then lifted him up and laid him down under the tree's shade. Choi Go-yo feebly waved his hand. It seemed to be his best attempt at a gesture of thanks.\n\"Take care... When you go home...\"\n\"When I go home?\"\n\"...Ugh.\"\nHe couldn't finish his sentence and dropped his head with a pitiful last breath. Though he looked like he was dead, a moment later, the sound of his breathing could be heard.\nCha Eui-jae squatted nearby, observing the unconscious Romantic Opener. After a while, a low voice emerged from Cha Eui-jae's shadow.\n\"Oh, you've arrived. I'm sorry for the delay. Just a moment, please...\"\nThe voice was familiar. Seo Min-gi crawled out from the edge of Cha Eui-jae's shadow. He looked at the snoring Romantic Opener with satisfaction and said,\n\"You've done well according to the instructions in the attachment. Excellent.\"\nCha Eui-jae had opened the attachment Seo Min-gi sent, which not only contained the address and map of the Prometheus branch but also detailed directions to this location. In summary, it said:\n[Contact the Romantic Opener and tell him to come quickly.]\n[Tell him to open the door.]\n[I'll handle the rest.]\n'Manuals are great...'\nCha Eui-jae thought that was why Lee Sa-young trusted Seo Min-gi with everything. The plan he proposed was incredibly fast and convenient. Cha Eui-jae looked at Seo Min-gi with admiration. Somehow, today, his sunglasses looked even more reliable.\nSeo Min-gi brushed off the grass from his suit.\n\"Now, before we proceed, let's take a moment to review and explain some points. I'll briefly go over the information and precautions you should know.\"\nWith a snap of his fingers, something black began to wriggle and gather on the ground. It was a shadow.\nThe shadow shifted and formed a rectangle, and Seo Min-gi drew lines on it with a stick. Soon, the shadow transformed into a shape resembling the map from the attachment.\n\"Prometheus has branches everywhere. The information about this branch was provided by Jung Bin. After exploring it, I found it's quite large.\"\nSquatting, Cha Eui-jae muttered,\n\"Didn't the government and guilds say they were cracking down on Prometheus? How can it be this big?\"\n\"Hmm, there's a sad story behind that. To summarize, it's because of you.\"\nCha Eui-jae, suddenly blamed, looked at the shadow with a perplexed expression. How much effort had he put into quietly living among hunters!\n\"What did I do? Didn't I just quietly run a soup restaurant?\"\nThe self-proclaimed soup restaurant part-timer, who had been through events like the magic stone incident, the Incheon port battle with hunters, attending the Artisan Exhibition, and taking down the S+ rank dungeon master, tried to plead his innocence. Fortunately, Seo Min-gi shrugged his shoulders.\n\"I might have summarized it too briefly. It's not that you did anything wrong. I'm not blaming you. To put it simply, the flow of events is like this. Now, like this.\"\nSeo Min-gi drew a circle and divided it into three parts. Soon, the circle filled with shadows.\n\"Last time, I explained, right? The pursuit of Prometheus was a collaborative effort between the government, Pado Guild, and Seowon Guild. But then.\"\nHe pinched a piece of the shadow and moved it aside, leaving two pieces.\n\"Since J appeared in the rankings, the Awakened Management Bureau decided that tracking J was more important and withdrew from the Prometheus case. Most of their manpower was redirected to find J.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been forcibly resurrected and dragged into the ranker channel against his will, remained silent. Who would have known that being resurrected and forced into the ranker channel would have such a significant butterfly effect? He knew they'd look for him, but he didn't realize they'd search so aggressively.\nThe stick poked the remaining two pieces. One piece turned into the shape of a small person, mimicking the act of moving goods.\n\"If it were just the government, it wouldn't be a big deal. But the Pado Guild also focused their manpower on tracking and disrupting. Since the most aggressive pursuers of Prometheus were the Pado Guild, the opportunity was missed.\"\nA strange word was inserted into the explanation. Cha Eui-jae, who had been quietly listening, raised his head abruptly.\n\"Disrupting? ...You mean the Pado Guild was looking for me too?\"\n\"Oh, that was supposed to be confidential.\"\nSeo Min-gi, having made a slip of the tongue, didn't seem too flustered.\n\"But well... since it's a concluded matter, I guess it's okay to tell you. The Pado Guild was also diligently searching for you. They even carried out disruption operations to prevent the Awakened Management Bureau from finding you.\"\n\"...Why?\"\nWhy was the Pado Guild looking for J? And it seemed they were doing it independently, not in collaboration with the Awakened Management Bureau. Wasn't Pado formed after J entered the rift?\nAs if understanding Cha Eui-jae's doubts, Seo Min-gi responded nonchalantly,\n\"Well, as usual, it's the Guild Leader's orders. What else? We don't know the exact reason either.\"\n\"...\"\n\"When they say jump, we jump. Anyway...\"\nCountless questions about Lee Sa-young arose. However, Seo Min-gi's businesslike demeanor cut through his thoughts.\n\"To explore the interior, you'll need a certified key card. Most areas require authentication to enter. Security is quite tight.\"\nThe seriousness of his tone brought Cha Eui-jae back to his senses. A key card. Researchers must each have one. Cha Eui-jae rubbed his chin and asked,\n\"Are the access levels different for each rank?\"\n\"Oh, that's a very good question. Yes, you need at least a senior researcher's key card to access the core of the branch.\"\n\"Good...\"\nCha Eui-jae muttered as he took in the shadow map.\n\"So, we go in, beat up anyone who looks like a researcher, and take their cards? One by one...\"\n\"...\"\nDespite giving the correct answer, there was no response. When Cha Eui-jae looked up, Seo Min-gi was staring at him with a face like Munch's \"The Scream.\" The shock on his face was so evident that Cha Eui-jae uncharacteristically read the room.\n\"...Is that not it?\"\n\"...Absolutely not.\"\nSeo Min-gi muttered gloomily, taking something from his pocket and handing it over. It was a plastic card with a few bloodstains. The card featured a photo of a man with glasses. Cha Eui-jae accepted the card with both hands respectfully. Seo Min-gi's sunglasses gleamed.\n\"Trust me more! Do you think I wouldn't have prepared such things? I'm Seo Min-gi! A specialist in stealth and infiltration, and ranked 36th in South Korea!\"\n\"Oh, yes, yes. Thank you very much.\"\nThe number one hunter in South Korea bowed to the 36th. Still slightly agitated, Seo Min-gi exhaled deeply and ran a hand through his hair.\n\"Putting that aside... Let's clarify your objective. What exactly are you looking for or confirming in this place?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Having a clear goal will save time.\"\nCha Eui-jae fiddled with the key card and then answered.\n\"First, I want to check the list of test subjects and find out what experiments are being conducted here.\"\n\"The list of test subjects likely won't contain the person you're looking for.\"\n\"I know. But if I start from here and work my way up...\"\nThe surrounding air stirred. A sharp energy swirled around, shaking the area. Seo Min-gi involuntarily stepped back. The branches of the trees shook violently.\nCha Eui-jae pocketed the key card and continued.\n\"I might find some clue.\"\n\"...\"\n\"A very small clue. That's all I need.\"\n\"...Alright. In that case.\"\nSeo Min-gi pointed deeper into the forest.\n\"If you walk straight down this path, you'll find the entrance. I cleared away some of the trees covering it... Just go straight in.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae nodded, Seo Min-gi twisted his lips and looked somewhat embarrassed.\n\"...The inside might be a bit of a mess.\"\n***\nBeep. As Cha Eui-jae held the key card to the scanner, the closed door opened. Squelch, squelch. His worn-out sneakers stepped into puddles. A fishy and sweet scent seeped through the gaps of his mask. The dark and spacious area was eerily quiet. Cha Eui-jae looked around and sighed deeply.\n\"You said it might be a mess...\"\nFeeling along the wall, he pressed a button, and the spacious area was suddenly illuminated. What came into view was...\n\"This is beyond just a mess.\"\nThe laboratory was covered in blood, with corpses lying on the floor, bleeding dark red from every orifice.",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Short\nCha Eui-jae shoved his hands into his pockets and glanced around. This appeared to be some kind of research facility, and the place he had entered seemed to be the lobby connected to the entrance and hallway. And from the lobby onward, there were dead bodies everywhere.\nThe white lab coats they wore were so thoroughly soaked in dark red blood that their original color was hard to discern. Cha Eui-jae looked up at the ceiling. The stark white incandescent light flickered ominously. The space was eerily silent, devoid of even breathing sounds or the thumping of a heartbeat. White walls and red blood.\n\"I don't want to die!\"\nSomeone's desperate scream echoed. A stabbing headache came over him. Cha Eui-jae bit his tongue out of habit. As the sharp pain spread, he finally regained some composure. There was no time to be idle.\nCha Eui-jae glanced at a corpse that had collapsed against the wall with its head against it. Judging by the vertical scratches on the wall, it seemed the person had clawed at it in unbearable pain.\nWhen he flipped the body over, the face, wide-eyed, was drenched in blood. Cold black eyes scanned the entire body. At first, he thought Seo Min-gi had killed them all. But on second thought...\n'No external injuries...'\nHe had never seen Seo Min-gi fight, but handling a large number of people without leaving any visible injuries would be impossible without some special ability. Didn't he claim to be a specialist in stealth and infiltration, not assassination?\nThere were no external injuries, yet there was an abnormal amount of bleeding. Corpses that had died vomiting blood, and the dark red color of the blood...\nIt looked strangely familiar. Unconsciously, Cha Eui-jae touched his own neck.\nYes, it was similar to the symptoms when he was poisoned by Lee Sa-young. The sweet scent lingering in the air was familiar too. It was always the scent that tickled his nose when Lee Sa-young was nearby.\nSeo Min-gi must have known there was a guest inside. Despite that, he only said, \"It might be a mess inside.\" This likely meant he judged the guest wouldn't be a threat to Cha Eui-jae.\nCha Eui-jae chuckled and then examined the face of the corpse after touching its neck. There was still warmth, and rigor mortis had not set in. It was clear the person hadn't been dead for long.\n'He must still be inside.'\nIf he continued, he would surely encounter him. Cha Eui-jae planted the blood-stained soles of his sneakers on the floor and started walking.\nPursuing Prometheus were the Pado Guild, Seowon Guild, and the Awakened Management Bureau. Lee Sa-young, who was a test subject of Prometheus. It was likely Lee Sa-young who had turned this place into a mess and brutally killed the researchers.\n'Is it because of his grudge against Prometheus?'\nAs he walked down the long corridor, avoiding corpses and puddles of blood, his thoughts began to center around Lee Sa-young.\nSeo Min-gi had firmly stated that no one survived Prometheus' experiments. Nam Woo-jin had said that Lee Sa-young was a former test subject of Prometheus. One of them had to be lying.\n'Judging by the state of the interior, it seems Nam Woo-jin was right...'\nNo ordinary grudge would lead someone to kill every single person like this.\nAt that moment, a bright light shone from a half-open door. Cha Eui-jae peeked inside, extending his head. It looked like a monitoring room with multiple large monitors. The monitors displayed prison-like spaces devoid of people.\nThis place too was in disarray, with the floor and walls disturbed by researchers struggling in pain, but the items and documents on the desks were unusually tidy. It was as if they were prepared for someone. Cha Eui-jae picked up a blue file. The file was labeled:\n[#707 Experiment Record]\n\"...\"\nHe carefully opened the file and began reading through it page by page. The subject of the file, 707, was a survivor who had been rescued after being caught in a rift. Researchers injected his body with enhancement drugs, transfused him with the blood of Awakeners, transplanted monster flesh, and conducted numerous experiments. And,\n[Failed.]\n[Failed.]\n[Failed.]\n[Failed.]\n[Failed.]\n\"...\"\nThe last page stated that it was decided to dispose of him as there was no longer any value in continuing the experiments. The final phrase of the record was:\n[Let us hold gratitude in our hearts for all those who sacrifice to prevent the end.]\nCha Eui-jae clenched his fist instinctively. He gritted his teeth. Crack, the plastic file crumpled in his grasp like paper. Kidnapping a survivor who barely escaped from a rift, using them as a test subject, and then disposing of them when the experiments failed. Anxiety surged within him. He picked up another file and quickly skimmed through it.\nFailure, failure, failure, disposal, let us hold gratitude in our hearts for all those who sacrifice to prevent the end. Failure, failure, failure, disposal, let us hold gratitude in our hearts for all those who sacrifice to prevent the end. Failure, failure, failure... end. Gratitude. End.\nBang!\nThe desk split in half from his punch. His shoulders, which had been heaving up and down, gradually settled. Cha Eui-jae stopped himself from slapping his cheek, halting at the cold touch of his mask.\nHe had questioned it from the beginning. Why was Prometheus trying to artificially create Awakeners? Were they resentful for not being chosen by the system?\nIf that had been their motive, they wouldn't have been so threatening. Those driven by selfish desires tend to scatter ironically because of their greed.\nBut these people were far from such desires. They believed they were striving to prevent the end. They believed that small sacrifices were unavoidable, like fanatics. They were neither researchers nor scientists. They were a group of mad zealots.\nArtificially creating Awakeners to prevent the end? How foolish...\nSuddenly, a faint groan was heard. Cha Eui-jae lifted his head sharply. The human voice came from beyond a door on one side of the monitoring room. There had been no sign of any survivors. Cha Eui-jae hurriedly opened the door.\n\"Ugh, aah!\"\nInside, a man in a white lab coat was crouching and trembling. He began banging his head against the wall, covering his mouth.\n\"Please save me, please save me, please save me...\"\n'Where did he suddenly come from?'\nThere were countless questions, but Cha Eui-jae's body moved instinctively to help the survivor. He quickly scanned the man's condition to check if he could communicate...\nBut only for a moment, Cha Eui-jae withdrew the hand he had extended towards the man. The card key around the man's neck indicated he was part of the research facility.\n'He's from Prometheus...'\nFailure, failure, failure, let us hold gratitude in our hearts for all those who sacrifice to prevent the end.\nCha Eui-jae, with his hands in his jeans pockets, leaned forward slightly to look down at the researcher. The man, noticing that the presence before him wasn't a threat, gradually stopped banging his head against the wall. Squinting his eyes, the man saw the black mask filling his view.\nThe man's eyes filled with a strange sense of joy.\n\"Th-that mask, you're J, right? J, it is you, isn't it? I heard stories that you were alive. How did you get here, no, no!\"\nThe man crawled on his knees and clung to Cha Eui-jae's leg. His hands were trembling pathetically.\n\"Please, please save me. A madman wrecked the research facility and killed innocent people...!\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae did not respond. The man bit his lips anxiously and then suddenly looked up. The eyes that had been filled with joy now shone oddly.\n\"I-I had so much I wanted to say to you, J. I-I'm a big fan of yours. I wanted to ask about the inside of the West Sea Rift. We received a revelation that it was touching the end, and everyone, everyone...\"\n\"What? What are you talking about...\"\nIt was the moment when Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened.\n\"Aaagh! Ugh!\"\nThe researcher clutched his throat and screamed, then vomited blood. Dark red blood. The researcher reached out with a trembling hand.\n\"Please, J, save, save me...!\"\n\"No.\"\nThud, thud, the sound of footsteps approached from the darkness. A languid voice whispered.\n\"You got the words wrong.\"\n\"Save, save...\"\n\"At the very least, you should say sorry, I was wrong...\"\n\"Sorry, so... Ugh...\"\nThe researcher, who had been writhing and scratching the floor, gradually stopped moving. Coughing up blood instead of uttering last words, his body slumped down. From the darkness, the languid voice murmured.\n\"I killed them all, but there was still someone alive.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Sorry about that... Are you okay?\"\nFrom the darkness, a hand appeared with only the fingertips stained black. As the hand touched the researcher's head, a chilling sound ensued, and the corpse began to melt into a black liquid.\n\"It looks like Hong Ye-seong put a gas mask function into your mask. Lucky.\"\nThe corpse had already turned into a black puddle, which soon disappeared into the hand. The hand, having completed its task, vanished back into the darkness.\nCha Eui-jae gave a short reply.\n\"Get your facts straight. You left him alive on purpose. Just him.\"\n\"...\"\nA short laugh echoed from the darkness. The voice, mixed with laughter, whispered.\n\"You're so quick with this kind of insight. No other insight though.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, yes. I thought you might be curious, Hyung.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Though, in hindsight, it was a mistake to keep him alive. He just spouted nonsense until the end.\"\nFrom the darkness, black boots emerged.\n\"So... after coming all this way.\"\nA long black coat reached halfway down long legs and calves. A hand in the coat pocket, disheveled curly hair, and shining eyes underneath. Long eyelashes blinked slowly. Full lips parted.\n\"Did you find what you were looking for?\"\nPurple eyes narrowed slightly.\n\"J.\"\nAs if smiling.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Short\n\"Did you find what you were looking for?\"\n\"...\"\n\"J.\"\nThere wasn't a trace of surprise on his delicate face, as if he knew he would meet J here. A hint of mischief flickered in his narrow, violet eyes. Lee Sa-young muttered as he put on black gloves. The black fingertips disappeared into the gloves.\n\"I purposely left some of it.\"\nThe neatly placed files, the monitor room with the lights on as if to guide him, the survivor's voice that came when he finished reading the files. Everything was prepared for one person.\nThe owner of the gift...\n\"Did you read it?\"\nCha Eui-jae.\nSo, the files on the desk, and the corpses were deliberately displayed. Cha Eui-jae thought cynically. He could have handled it cleanly like this. Cha Eui-jae stared at the spot where the man had fallen. Only a few bloodstains remained on the empty floor. Cha Eui-jae responded in a strangely altered voice.\n\"Yeah. I read it. Records from this facility?\"\n\"Well, just a tiny part of the records.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I filtered it out. I didn't leave too much, since I'm afraid it might not reach me.\"\n\"Seo Min-gi must have told you. That I would come here.\"\nLee Sa-young just smiled instead of answering. Seo Min-gi and Romantic Opener. They help Cha Eui-jae, but fundamentally, they are Lee Sa-young's people. Considering the space door delivery he experienced at Incheon Port, it wasn't surprising. Cha Eui-jae answered himself in place of the silent Lee Sa-young.\n\"That must be it, seeing as you weren't surprised by my sudden visit. And you had the materials prepared.\"\n\"Oh, I was surprised. I didn't expect J's first activity after returning after eight years...\"\nLee Sa-young looked around and shrugged.\n\"I didn't expect it would be raiding the Prometheus research facility.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Though I didn't ask you to...\"\nLee Sa-young approached soundlessly with a few steps. His black hand reached out and gently removed the black cap Cha Eui-jae was wearing. Cha Eui-jae did not resist. Lee Sa-young whispered as he tidied up Cha Eui-jae's slightly tousled hair.\n\"I remember when we made the contract, I only mentioned that I was chasing a group luring people with drugs.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And then, you suddenly mentioned the name Prometheus...\"\nLee Sa-young lightly flicked the brim of the cap with his finger. His long eyelashes blinked slowly. The corners of his mouth remained lifted.\n\"Where did you hear it... and why did you come here?\"\nAlthough the tone seemed interrogative, the atmosphere was different. The Lee Sa-young that Cha Eui-jae knew would be completely annoyed by now, pushing down on his opponent until he felt better. But now, the Lee Sa-young in front of him...\n\"You're good at coming up with new secrets each time.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Liar.\"\nIn his two eyes...\n\"Shall we have a Q&A after a long time? Asking each other questions, answering, and trying to guess what's hidden.\"\nA gaze pretending to be indifferent, with something unknown stirring violently beneath the calm surface.\nCha Eui-jae instinctively realized that this would never let him go. If he made a wrong move, he would be caught in the raging current.\nCatching a rampaging monster or dealing with an annoyed Lee Sa-young would have been easier. At least, there was a clear strategy for those. But the calm Lee Sa-young needed a new strategy. Facing the violet gaze made his insides itch.\nCha Eui-jae clenched his fist, pressing his nails into his palm inside his pocket. It was fortunate that his mask hid his expression.\n\"I have no questions.\"\n\"Well, actually, you don't have a choice.\"\nThe voice responded with a hint of laughter. Lee Sa-young tilted his head slightly. His curly hair swayed gently.\n\"I have a lot of questions for you... about you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Then... shall I start first?\"\nA large hand wrapped in leather grabbed Cha Eui-jae's nape. A soft voice spoke.\n\"You know, don't you? That I am a product of Prometheus experiments.\"\nIt was an unexpected question. Cha Eui-jae instinctively tensed his fingers. Lee Sa-young muttered, tilting his head.\n\"Who told you is obvious... very few people know that fact. They're all dead.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The ones still alive are Ham Seok-jeong, Jung Bin, Nam Woo-jin, and Bae Won-woo. Since you avoided Jung Bin and Ham Seok-jeong, it couldn't be them. Bae Won-woo isn't sharp enough to know that you're J. That leaves...\"\nThe thumb gently rubbed behind the ear.\n\"Nam Woo-jin. That bastard.\"\nLee Sa-young was keen and had excellent information-gathering skills. In fact, there was no reason to hide anything anymore. He had revealed the secrets he tried to keep hidden. Cha Eui-jae admitted honestly.\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"And you heard that when you took your grandmother, right? You heard about Prometheus then.\"\n\"Accurate.\"\nLee Sa-young gritted his teeth and then let out a small sigh. He removed his hand from Cha Eui-jae's nape. The lukewarm warmth vanished.\n\"Now it's your turn.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been silent, asked.\n\"I heard there were no successful cases of Prometheus experiments. That everyone died.\"\n\"Ah-ha...\"\nLee Sa-young drew out his words leisurely, lifting his head with a slight smirk on his lips, as if mocking.\n\"Seo Min-gi said that? Well... he's not wrong. Prometheus never succeeded in their experiments. Not once. They all couldn't withstand the experiments, their bodies collapsed, or they became something worse than a monster.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You're curious about this, right? How I, a test subject, am still alive...\"\nLee Sa-young slowly placed his hand on the center of his chest.\n\"It's simple. I awakened.\"\nHe whispered in a languid voice.\n\"I didn't artificially awaken because of their experiments; I was chosen by the system.\"\nHe recalled the conversation they had at the hangover soup restaurant after finishing their messy contract, when the small black humans moved according to Lee Sa-young's finger movements.\n\"So, what criteria does the system use to choose the awakened?\"\nA languid voice asked.\n\"The system,\"\nThe finger that was rubbing against the broken glass,\n\"Respond to a desperate wish.\"\nIt had become a commonly accepted fact since the Day of the Rift.\n\"When a human has a desperate wish, the system is drawn to that energy and finds the human.\"\nAppearing out of nowhere, the white, burnt-out eyes stared at Cha Eui-jae. Suddenly, the surroundings transformed into a forest. The conversation he had with Nam Woo-jin at the Seowon Guild came to mind bit by bit. Nam Woo-jin, fluttering his white coat as he walked ahead, whispered,\n\"Whether he awakened because of their experiment, or the system answered Lee Sa-young's desperate prayers.\"\nThe surroundings shifted once more. In the midst of the wreckage and ruin, Cha Eui-jae was huddled in the rubble, clutching the bodies of his parents. The stench of burnt and bloody flesh was overwhelmingly strong. The cold bodies. Thud, thud, the sound of monsters rummaging through the path echoed in his ears.\nAt that moment, what did Cha Eui-jae think in the face of death?\n'I want to live.'\nHe wanted to live.\n'I don't want to die.'\nHe didn't want to die.\nAnd then a bright white light burst out before his eyes. It was the moment he encountered the system.\nCha Eui-jae lifted his head. In the dark and narrow room, the only light came from the half-open door. Lee Sa-young was quietly watching Cha Eui-jae. Suddenly, a question arose. What was Lee Sa-young's desperate prayer? What was so desperate that it led to his awakening?\nStrangely, Cha Eui-jae felt like he knew the answer.\nAs if someone were teaching him. His heart raced. Emotions swirled— excitement, anticipation, or perhaps anxiety and confusion. Cha Eui-jae slowly opened his mouth.\n\"You...\"\nIt felt like something was stuck in his throat, making it hard to speak. He wasn't sure. Even though he thought it was impossible, he still harbored a faint hope, a conflict of feelings.\nA boy dying from poison, Lee Sa-young who used poison. A boy whose records were erased by Prometheus or some other hand, Lee Sa-young who escaped after being a test subject of Prometheus. A boy who tried to smile with narrowed eyes, Lee Sa-young who smiled with narrowed eyes.\n'It can't be.'\nCha Eui-jae looked at Lee Sa-young with confused eyes. At that moment, Lee Sa-young smiled. His eyes narrowed, shining like a child's, waiting for the moment to open his prepared gift.\n'This is strange.'\nCha Eui-jae swallowed countless words.\n'This is too convenient...'\nMiracles like this don't happen to Cha Eui-jae. He knew that. He had given up expecting miracles long ago. Yet, even though he kept telling himself it wasn't possible, he barely managed to utter a single word. His voice cracked.\n\"...Is it you?\"\nA step closer came the black boots. Only a very narrow space remained between them. Lee Sa-young extended his hand. Cha Eui-jae, as if entranced, took that hand, just like he always did eight years ago.\nThe black hand gently pulled his hand to Lee Sa-young's cheek. The warmth radiating from his cheek was soft. It was starkly different from the rough texture of bandages.\nLee Sa-young slowly rubbed his cheek against the palm. The gloved hand covered the hand resting on his cheek. A low voice whispered.\n\"Yes, Hyung.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Short\n\"Yes, Hyung.\"\nIt was a soft, soothing voice. Even as he rubbed his cheek against Cha Eui-jae's hand, Lee Sa-young's eyes were fixed on him. In Lee Sa-young's dark pupils, J's black mask was reflected perfectly. Lee Sa-young, who had been gazing at Cha Eui-jae in silence, sealed the moment with a gentle voice.\n\"It's me.\"\n\"... Is it really you?\"\nCha Eui-jae stuttered. For the first words he managed to get out, they were pitiful. Lee Sa-young blinked and then smiled.\n\"Yeah, I've grown up pretty well, haven't I? Are you surprised?\"\nUnlike himself, Lee Sa-young was being playful. Cha Eui-jae could only open and close his mouth soundlessly.\n'How?'\n'You were an experiment subject?'\n'Why?'\n'Why were you taken there?'\n'Did you know I was J?'\n'If you knew, since when?'\n'Why didn't you tell me?'\nCountless questions rose and fell. Though he'd often swallowed back words he wanted to say, it was the first time he had so many things to say that he couldn't get a word out. It was impossible to even choose the words.\nLee Sa-young stopped rubbing his cheek against Cha Eui-jae's palm and muttered.\n\"What, don't you believe it?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young twisted his lips.\n\"I'm your only success, aren't I?\"\nOnly success.\n\"You...\"\nThump, his heart pounded. Cha Eui-jae shivered as if struck by lightning.\nHe thought it was a word he'd never think of again. Moreover, he never imagined he would hear it in Lee Sa-young's voice.\nIt still didn't feel real. Instead, a baseless sense of unease surged up.\nWhat if all this was a dream? What if all this was just a mere delusion? What if he was confused by the pervasive smell of blood? It felt like the ground would give way any moment, plunging him into a deep pit.\nJ doesn't believe in miracles. He's spent too long in the rift to believe in miracles. Seeing the remains of comrades scattered about makes it impossible to believe in miracles. Knowing that desolation, he couldn't hope for a miracle.\nHowever, despite everything.\nIn the West Sea rift, J dreamt. He could say that J in his dreams was happier than anyone else. Waking up from a soft, cozy bed, greeting his parents, fussing over breakfast, chatting with his aunt, joking with Jung Bin, and ending the day by telling the boy about what happened that day. The ordinary life he longed for but never had.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was still surrounded by a sea of blood.\nThe hope for a miracle was whittled away day by day. Each time he pierced through a monster. Each time he couldn't even hear the cries for help. Each time he found traces of what used to be his comrades.\nYet J did not lose his last bit of hope. He comforted himself and the few remaining comrades, believing somehow they could make it out alive. He had promised. He couldn't become a liar to his only success. He endured with just that thought.\nWhat finally broke the last bit of his spirit was...\nFinding his aunt's hand.\n\"...\"\nSuddenly, he snapped back to reality. Cha Eui-jae stared blankly at the young man before him. It was hard to believe this clean face belonged to the boy whose skin was like bandages. The hand that had been cupping his cheek flinched as if burned.\nAs Cha Eui-jae hastily tried to pull his hand away, the black hand that had been covering it tightened. A gentle voice spoke.\n\"No, that's not it.\"\n\"What...\"\n\"You have something else to say, don't you, Hyung?\"\nAnother black hand reached for his face. Normally, he would have dodged as soon as the hand moved, but Cha Eui-jae stood still, unable to even think of avoiding it. Soon, the large hand covered his mask. Then, carefully, it was removed.\nCool air touched his skin. Lee Sa-young's eyes widened slightly before narrowing. The hand that had been covering Cha Eui-jae's face was removed. At the same time, Cha Eui-jae's hand fell limply.\nLee Sa-young murmured.\n\"...With a face like that.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There's nothing I can say.\"\nClatter, the sound of the mask hitting the tiled floor was clear.\nSimultaneously, two black hands reached out. They cupped Cha Eui-jae's cheeks, just as Cha Eui-jae had done. The unfamiliar warmth of the leather, heated by body temperature, felt strange. Gently, the thumbs stroked his eyes, as if handling something precious.\n\"Can't you be a bit happier, huh?\"\n\"...\"\nThe warmth on his cheeks felt comforting, and Cha Eui-jae buried his face in those large hands. It was an instinctive action. Lee Sa-young let out a small sigh.\n\"I didn't expect this reaction.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why do you look like you're about to cry...\"\nIt was only then that Cha Eui-jae realized his face was a mess. Even biting the inside of his lip couldn't suppress the rising emotions.\nDo miracles come only to those who do not seek them? After giving up all desires and surrendering everything, he finally saw what was left in his hand. In the emptiness...\nHis only had come to him.\nLike a miracle.\nUnable to hold back, Cha Eui-jae extended his arms. He pulled the solid body into an embrace. The body stiffened as they touched. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath and exhaled. A sweet scent wafted over him. As he cupped the back of the head, soft hair tangled between his fingers.\nHe could hear the heartbeat from the chest against his and the quick breaths by his ear. Both hearts were beating faster than ever. It was the fact that their hearts were beating at a similar pace that made him happiest.\nCha Eui-jae whispered with a distorted face.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nJ always wondered what he should say when he returned.\nAt first, the answer wasn't hard to find. \"Hyung's back, you waited, I kept my promise.\" The usual words. Words he could say lightly without any weight. But the longer he wandered in the rift, the more those joyful words sank,\n\"Aunt!\"\nand eventually became unspeakable.\nWhat remained in their place was...\n\"I'm sorry for being late.\"\n\"...\"\nGuilt and,\n\"I'm sorry for breaking my promise.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm sorry for making you wait.\"\nEndless apologies.\n\"I'm sorry...\"\nNo tears came out. They had dried up long ago. He felt the stiffness slowly leave the body he was holding. Strong arms wrapped around his neck.\nLee Sa-young exhaled slowly and lowered his head. His soft cheek and hair touched Cha Eui-jae's neck. Though the weight pressed against him, Cha Eui-jae didn't waver. He stood firm, bearing the full weight. It was his rightful burden.\nA voice, like a sigh, echoed in his ear.\n\"It's okay.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Because I kept the promise.\"\nThe fingers tangled in Lee Sa-young's soft hair twitched. He remembered the scene in the dungeon. Lee Sa-young, with a pale face, smiling twistedly. The incomprehensible words.\n\"What if I said I've been waiting for you?\"\nThe selfish request he had made.\n\"Will you wait for me?\"\nOnce, when he was crouched among corpses and blood. Trying to think of something else to avoid going mad, the boy naturally came to mind. And the end of those thoughts was always regret. J regretted making such a promise. He wished he hadn't tied him with even a finger.\nHow futile it must be to wait for someone who would never return.\nIronically, that regret saved J. The regret was the only anchor that held him, wandering aimlessly without a destination. Without it, well, he might have become part of the sea long ago.\nAt that moment, lips moved against his neck.\n\"Why is it that those who should apologize don't, and those who shouldn't do?\"\nThe voice, muttered like a curse, soon regained its gentle tone. Lee Sa-young rubbed his forehead against Jae's shoulder. The touch of the hair was ticklish.\n\"Well, you're late... but you came, didn't you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You came to find me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's enough.\"\nIt was an unexpected, kind remark. Cha Eui-jae didn't know how to handle such joy. All he could do was tighten his embrace around the solid body. Different from his memories, unfamiliar yet familiar, Lee Sa-young was, in the end, his boy.\nLee Sa-young was Cha Eui-jae's only.\nThey stood there, silently embracing each other, listening to their heartbeats, as if it was their natural state.\nCha Eui-jae patted Lee Sa-young's back and looked up at the ceiling. In place of the sinking guilt, anger surged. Lee Sa-young had been an experiment subject for Prometheus. But who dared to use his entrusted child as a test subject?\n'Those bastards...'\nAt that moment, Lee Sa-young, who was nestled against him, muttered with a chuckle.\n\"It's better if you don't overthink it, Hyung.\"\n\"What?\"\nCha Eui-jae responded sharply. Lee Sa-young giggled.\n\"Just be purely happy. Just think, 'he's alive.'\"\nThe arm around his neck moved down to stroke Cha Eui-jae's back. The unfamiliar touch made Cha Eui-jae tense up. Lee Sa-young, who was rubbing his back and shoulder blades, whispered.\n\"The important thing is that I'm alive,\"\n\"...\"\n\"and that you came back. You came to find me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's enough, isn't it? Don't you think so?\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been silent, nodded slightly in agreement. Lee Sa-young, who had buried his head against Cha Eui-jae's neck, lifted it a little. Through the disheveled hair, his violet eyes shone brightly. However, the person holding him didn't see this. Anchors always sink deep into the sea.\nLee Sa-young murmured.\n\"Yeah, that's enough.\"\nLee Sa-young carefully lifted his head and placed a kiss on Cha Eui-jae's temple. Before Cha Eui-jae could even notice, he withdrew. The gaze with which he looked down at the young man holding him was filled with gentle affection. But he couldn't hide the emotions flickering behind that affection.\nLee Sa-young silently mouthed,\n\"It's okay if you don't know anything else.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Short\nLee Sa-young, who had been fiddling with the protruding shoulder blades and back muscles, withdrew his hand and lightly tapped the arms that were embracing him. Cha Eui-jae slowly let go. Lee Sa-young picked up the mask that had fallen to the ground and handed it over.\n\"Sorry for dropping it, Hyung.\"\n\"It's fine. A madman made it, so it should be sturdy enough.\"\nCha Eui-jae dusted off the mask. The face that had seemed on the verge of tears had returned to its usual cold expression. 'Perhaps I should have watched a little longer', Lee Sa-young thought, ignoring the surge of regret as he watched the red-rimmed eyes disappear behind the black mask. He wanted to touch him a little more, but there would be plenty of opportunities in the future. After glancing at the light filtering through the door, Lee Sa-young spoke.\n\"Let's go, Hyung.\"\n\"Are you sure you don't need to investigate more? This place seems pretty big.\"\nA distorted voice asked, carefully enunciating each syllable. How much he had missed that voice. Lee Sa-young narrowed his eyes and smiled with his hands behind his back.\n\"Well... the investigation was done a while ago. Seo Min-gi has already taken the data.\"\n\"The remaining data?\"\n\"That was left on purpose. For you to see, Hyung.\"\nLee Sa-young reached out and tapped Cha Eui-jae's fingers as if urging him. But he didn't move. Lee Sa-young quietly observed the black mask. It seemed like he had something to say. After a long silence, Cha Eui-jae asked.\n\"The story isn't over yet.\"\n\"...\"\n\"What kind of experiments were done to you? How did you end up being taken there?\"\n\"...\"\n\"How did Prometheus manage to take you from the hospital...?\"\nThere was a grinding sound of teeth from beneath the mask. Even though it was an expected question, there was no sense of accomplishment in guessing it. Only pity. Cha Eui-jae was kind and upright. To a foolish degree.\n'He doesn't realize that kindness is gnawing away at his life...'\nLee Sa-young, who had been silent, lowered his gaze and blinked. His long eyelashes fluttered. Wearing gloves, he traced Cha Eui-jae's fingers with his own. The firm hand flinched. Lee Sa-young lowered his head and muttered.\n\"I don't want to talk about it here. That...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Can we talk about it later? Hyung.\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't respond. Instead, he held Lee Sa-young's hand tightly with his firm grip. The other hand wrapped around the back of his head. As if soothing him, he gently stroked his hair and spoke in a kind tone with his distorted voice.\n\"Sure, tell me later. Let's go.\"\nLee Sa-young closed his eyes, feeling the gentle touch brushing through his hair. He replied with words that were different from what he had thought.\n\"Okay.\"\nNo.\n\"I will...\"\nThis is a story you don't need to know.\n***\nA week later. The hangover soup restaurant was bustling as usual during the dinner hours.\nThe place was crowded with people squeezed into small spaces, and there was a line of people in front of the automatic self-serve bar for kimchi and side dishes. The magic stones embedded in the self-serve bar gleamed as they continuously dispensed kimchi into empty bowls. Hands shot up here and there.\n\"Two hangover soups here!\"\n\"Yes, just a moment.\"\n\"Excuse me, can I grab a bottle of soju?\"\n\"Just take one bottle. I saw you take one earlier.\"\n\"Our part-timer's eyesight has gotten better since becoming a Hunter.\"\nThe hunter grumbled as he headed toward the industrial refrigerator. Instead of taking a straight path, he deliberately took a detour around the tables, which was inefficient but had a clear reason.\n\"...\"\nThat's because a gas mask was sitting with crossed legs at the neighboring table.\nPerhaps Lee Sa-young had developed a conscience. Unlike in the past, when he would boldly occupy a central table, he had now chosen a seat in the corner with a full view of the restaurant. The problem was that he had been showing up every day, not just once or twice.\nRegular customers were fed up. Wasn't the second-ranked Hunter in South Korea busy? Why was he showing up at a hangover soup restaurant instead of the Pado Guild? They desperately looked at the part-timer, silently pleading for him to kick Lee Sa-young out. After all, the part-timer held the highest authority in the restaurant.\nBut strangely enough, Cha Eui-jae, the part-timer who would usually have something to say, was quiet in the face of this disruption. Instead of confronting Lee Sa-young with a ladle, he would exchange brief glances and even greetings with him from time to time. And each time Lee Sa-young received a glance, he would wave his hand in response.\nThe part-timer and Lee Sa-young!\nWho was Lee Sa-young, if not the most unwelcome guest? And yet, to show such kindness to him...\n\"Fuck, I can't stand this.\"\nThunk! The chopsticks precisely stabbed the center of a radish kimchi cube. Three people were sitting around a green table. Bae Won-woo, who had already finished two bowls of soup. Team Leader Han, who was shoveling rice into his mouth with his glasses all fogged up. Honeybee, who was tormenting the poor radish kimchi, suddenly took a short breath and glared menacingly at Bae Won-woo.\n\"Shield Guy, be honest.\"\n\"Hey, I told you not to call me that. What is it?\"\nHoneybee leaned in and whispered harshly.\n\"What did your Guild Leader do?\"\nBae Won-woo rolled his eyes as he diligently mixed his rice with the soup. The list of things Lee Sa-young could have done was so long that it was hard to pinpoint. Finally, he gave up filtering and replied gloomily.\n\"He's been up to all sorts of things, so what exactly?\"\n\"Don't pretend you don't know. Just tell us honestly. Didn't we come to an agreement behind the shop?\"\nTeam Leader Han also pushed up his foggy glasses and chimed in.\n\"This situation clearly violates our agreement. The Pado Guild Leader is causing a disturbance in the shop, and yet Cha Eui-jae isn't saying anything. Didn't he offer some kind of deal?\"\n\"What kind of deal?\"\n\"Something like the renovation of the hangover soup restaurant.\"\n\"Oh, come on, what is this, a conspiracy theory?\"\n\"What exactly happened between them to make them...\"\n\"Oh, seriously, I have no idea...\"\nWhile Team Leader Han started arguing, Honeybee glanced at Lee Sa-young. Not only was he waving, but now he was making a flower pose with both hands, observing the part-timer's every move.\n'What the heck is he doing?'\nJust as Honeybee pretended to gag, their eyes met. Lee Sa-young folded one hand from the flower pose and raised his middle finger high. His skill in cursing while posing was top-notch.\nNot to be outdone, Honeybee raised both middle fingers in return. But it was only for a moment because, as soon as the part-timer emerged from the kitchen, the black-gloved hands quickly reverted from cursing to a flower pose. Honeybee propped her cheek on her hand and observed them.\nThe part-timer, holding a tray under his arm, approached Lee Sa-young. The two began quietly conversing. The conversation was nothing special. It was just ordinary talk like, \"Do you want a bowl of soup?\" \"I'm fine,\" \"When does your shift end?\" But the part-timer was smiling gently, which was rare.\n'I don't think I've ever seen him smile like that...'\nA short laugh escaped. The atmosphere was different where the two of them were. Pouting, Honeybee continued to watch them. What on earth had happened to make them so close?\nBut only for a moment. Her sharp instincts, which had saved her life many times, were tingling. Beneath that kind demeanor was something hidden. Don't be fooled by the appearance.\nHoneybee blinked. Beneath the smiling side profile, what was hidden...\n'Tension...?'\n***\n11:53 PM. Despite it being well past closing time and nearing midnight, the lights in the Awakened Management Bureau's First Field Response Team office were still brightly lit. Almost no one had left. With the team leader still at his desk with his head in his hands, no one else dared to leave.\nNo one even thought about going home. The entire Awakened Management Bureau was on high alert.\n'A hunter from the Awakened Management Bureau was swapped out, leaving only an empty shell.'\nIt was an unprecedented situation since the bureau's inception. It was undoubtedly the work of Prometheus, but no one knew when or how the switch had taken place. Without any clues, the investigation couldn't even properly begin. Although Lee Sa-young had dealt with one of the research facilities and sent some data...\n\"Sigh...\"\nThere was no significant information there either. All they had were mountains of experiment records to go through.\nAnother deep sigh escaped. The hunters at their desks subtly hunched their shoulders. The team leader of the First Field Response Team, Jung Bin, was clasping his hands together as if in prayer and resting his forehead on them.\nHis shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, and the usual gentle smile on his face was replaced with a deeply troubled expression. A long scar remained on his right arm, from which the cast had just been removed.\nAt that moment, his phone buzzed. Without looking, Jung Bin fumbled for the phone and quickly answered the call. His tired voice spilled out mechanically.\n\"Yes, this is Jung Bin, Team Leader of the First Field Response Team at the Awakened Management Bureau. How can I help you?\"\n—Jung Bin.\nA strangely distorted voice. It was slightly different from the voice he remembered, but the way it addressed him was very familiar. It sent a chill down his spine.\n—Could we talk for a moment? I have something to say.\nThe tone was polite but had an oddly casual, almost irreverent undertone. As far as Jung Bin knew, there was only one person who spoke like that. And as if to confirm it, the strange voice continued.\n—Oh, it's me, J. Just in case you were confused.",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Short\nJ.\nJung Bin adjusted his grip on the phone and looked around. None of the team members were watching him yet, but they would surely notice if he acted strangely. He needed to stay as natural as possible.\n\"...I see. Please wait a moment.\"\nJung Bin ran a hand over his face, then stood up and grabbed the suit jacket that was draped over the back of his chair. The rustling sound of the jacket seemed unusually loud.\n\"...\"\nSeveral team members glanced at him with puzzled expressions. Jung Bin didn't respond verbally; instead, he raised his index finger to point at the ceiling. A look of fatigue spread across their faces. Someone even seemed to sigh.\nWith the phone wedged between his shoulder and ear, Jung Bin scribbled a sentence on a scrap of paper and held it up.\n[I'll be stepping out for a moment. Please take a break.]\nThe team members nodded after reading the note. As he left the office, Jung Bin's pace quickened the moment he opened the emergency stairwell door. His feet pounded rapidly down the steps.\nHe stopped at the stairs leading to the basement— a place with no CCTV and where no one could overhear his conversation. Jung Bin paused to catch his breath.\nNormally, he would have ignored this. He would have dismissed it as just another impersonator. But...\n\"J has returned.\"\nDid that person understand the weight of those words?\nJung Bin rubbed the back of the phone with his thumb, took a deep breath, and spoke.\n\"Sorry for the delay. You can speak now.\"\n—Seems like you were with other people. Haven't you left work yet?\n\"...\"\n—It's almost midnight.\nEvery time he heard that distorted voice, something fluttered in his chest— a feeling he couldn't quite identify. Was it tension or anticipation? No, it was closer to anxiety.\nWhether the person on the other end knew his feelings or not, they continued talking.\n—Talking over the phone feels a bit insecure. I'd prefer to meet in person. Are you available now?\nThe person, J, whom they had organized a tracking team to find but failed, was now contacting him first to arrange a meeting— something he hadn't anticipated.\n'Moreover...'\nHong Ye-seong's words echoed in his mind.\n\"J said so. He thinks the dungeon restructuring happened because of him, but he doesn't know why yet. Until he finds out, he said he would only appear when absolutely necessary, like this time.\"\nAbsolutely necessary. A vague statement. He quickly ran through recent events. Was there a crisis as serious as the S+ grade dungeon? Although Prometheus had infiltrated the depths of the Awakened Management Bureau, it wasn't an issue that warranted J's involvement. So then why? Jung Bin couldn't easily answer.\n\"...\"\n—Are you very busy? If so, I guess it can't be helped.\nThe distorted voice now carried a hint of disappointment. Jung Bin quickly responded.\n\"No, I'm available. Where should I go?\"\n—Oh, I'll give you the address. But come alone. And don't tell the Director.\nThe voice then recited an address, which Jung Bin noted down mechanically while pondering.\nWith Prometheus's dummy infiltrating the core of the Awakened Management Bureau, he couldn't entirely dismiss the possibility that this could be a trap. After all, it had been eight years since J disappeared into the rift, and many had impersonated him since then. Most weren't worth dealing with and had disappeared before they could be apprehended, but...\n'Still...'\nEven a slight possibility meant he had to go. It was the duty of the survivors.\nThe address J provided was a playground. As he made his way there, Jung Bin tried calling the number back, but there was no answer. Out of curiosity, he searched the number and found it was a certified public phone number.\n\"...\"\nHe parked his car in a nearby alley and walked slowly. The night was quiet, with not even the sound of insects. His lips keep drying up. Eventually, the playground came into view.\nA young man wearing a cap and a plain black mask was sitting at the end of a red slide. His posture was casual, with his arms resting on his knees.\nHe wore a thick jacket zipped up to his neck, black track pants, and sandals with three white stripes— an outfit so ordinary that he could have easily been mistaken for a regular person if not for the mask.\nBeneath the flickering streetlight, insects buzzed about busily. The air around the young man seemed to hang still. As if sensing Jung Bin's presence, the young man looked up.\n\"Oh.\"\nThe distorted voice let out a short exclamation. He nodded slightly as if in greeting.\n\"Long time no see. I hope you've been well.\"\nJung Bin didn't respond. The tone was familiar, but he couldn't easily trust it.\nWas it really him? How did he know his number to contact him? If it was really him, why had he suddenly appeared? Why had he stayed hidden for so long? Countless questions arose, but all were left unanswered.\nFortunately, Jung Bin was good at hiding his emotions, and even better at extracting information.\nWith his hands behind his back, he smiled faintly.\n\"Yes. Long time no see.\"\n\"...\"\nThis time, the young man didn't answer. Jung Bin searched his hazy memories. What was J's build like? Although the young man was a bit smaller, his overall physique was similar. But it was hard to gauge as he was sitting on the plastic slide. The young man rested his chin on his hand and muttered.\n\"Is your arm okay?\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"You injured your right arm back then, protecting the others from the golem.\"\n\"...\"\nJung Bin's eyes widened, but he quickly masked his expression. The fact that he injured his arm was widely known, especially on Channel 1 and elsewhere. But the details were only known to those who were there... No. This alone wasn't enough to be sure. There was a possibility he could have heard it from Hong Ye-seong's debriefing...\nAt that moment, the young man let out a deep sigh.\n\"Oh man, how does that guy manage to twist his words so much... I can't deal with it.\"\nWith a groan, the young man stretched and stood up. He slipped his hands into his pockets and stood crookedly, his gaze sweeping over Jung Bin from head to toe, lingering on the scars on his arms exposed beneath his rolled-up sleeves. The young man shrugged.\n\"You've grown a lot more suspicious.\"\n\"I apologize. Given the current circumstances.\"\nJung Bin lightly bowed his head. The young man paced in front of the slide, seemingly deep in thought, before crossing his arms.\n\"Shall we talk about that time when we had a chat on the outdoor stairs of the headquarters?\"\nOutdoor stairs. The familiar location brought back memories, and Jung Bin let out a breath he had been holding. The tension that had stiffened his shoulders eased. Jung Bin ran his hands over his face and muttered.\n\"Ah... So you really are him.\"\n\"Of course, I'm not a fake.\"\n\"...\"\nAfter rubbing his face for a while, trying to regain his composure, Jung Bin suddenly lifted his head.\nJ, who had said he would only appear when absolutely necessary, had reached out to him suddenly. Could something serious have happened? It couldn't have been just to say hello.\nJung Bin urgently asked.\n\"Has something serious happened?\"\n\"Oh... that. It's nothing too big.\"\nThe young man rubbed the back of his neck.\n***\nA boy presumed dead was alive and well. Like a miracle.\nEven Cha Eui-jae, who didn't believe in miracles, believed in one the moment he held Lee Sa-young in his arms. In a dark space reeking of blood, they were the only two breathing. The warmth of Lee Sa-young's head nestled against him was so comforting that he could have held him all day.\nHe was the only proof that Cha Eui-jae's life had not been a failure, and he was so precious that no amount of good words would suffice...\nHowever,\n\"I'm tired.\"\n\"I see.\"\nPrecious was precious, but...\n\"Sorry, I have a guild meeting. Let's talk later.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nBut the fact that they couldn't communicate was a separate issue!\nIt had been eight years since they last met. Even friends or family would have a mountain of things to say after eight years, and the bond between Cha Eui-jae and Lee Sa-young was much deeper.\nCha Eui-jae felt he had an obligation to hear exactly what had happened to Lee Sa-young over the past eight years— how he had been taken by Prometheus and what experiments he had endured. That was his duty as a guardian!\nBut Lee Sa-young avoided serious conversations like a slippery eel, despite showing up at the hangover soup restaurant daily. He always had some excuse: a guild meeting, a dungeon, a rift, handling a guild member's mistake, or attending the Awakened Management Bureau.\nOne day, Cha Eui-jae tried to keep him from leaving, only for Lee Sa-young to feign exhaustion and cling to him. Cha Eui-jae had initially worried that he might have fallen prey to Jung Bin's chains again but decided to let it slide.\nHowever, even that had its limits.\nOn the day when a week had passed without a real conversation, Cha Eui-jae was squatting by the recycling bin, peeling labels off drink bottles, thinking to himself.\nIf a week had passed without any progress, there was a high chance that Lee Sa-young would never open up. He was overly sensitive and stubborn— traits that had only become more pronounced over time.\nThe only card Cha Eui-jae could play at the moment was one— A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi. However, if he requested information about Prometheus from Seo Min-gi, there was a high chance that it would be blocked at Lee Sa-young's level.\nAs someone who had operated as J, Cha Eui-jae was more familiar than anyone with receiving limited information. Of course, he knew how to handle it. But was he really going to live off these scraps of information? No.\n'I need to find another source of information.'\nCha Eui-jae threw aside the recycling bag and returned to the store, where he pulled out the [Basic Guide for New Hunters]— a gift that he had only flipped through two or three times since receiving it. He opened a page. Acting as a bookmark was a business card that read:\n[Awakened Management Bureau, Field Response Team 1]\n[Team Leader Jung Bin]\n***\nThe streetlight flickered precariously. Late at night, two young men, who seemed out of place at a playground, were standing tensely, facing each other.\nAs Cha Eui-jae watched the bewildered and tense expression on Jung Bin's face...\n\"Give me all the information you have on Prometheus and Lee Sa-young.\"\nHe bluntly demanded confidential information.",

      "content": "Chapter 117: Short\n\"Give me all the information you have on Prometheus and Lee Sa-young.\"\nSilence fell. In the chilly dawn air, only the sound of crickets chirping filled the stillness. Jung Bin stared blankly at the black mask.\nThere were so many things he wanted to say to J. So many things he wanted to ask. How did he escape from the West Sea Rift? When did he get out? Was he okay? If he had been alive, why hadn't he contacted him sooner?\nHe sifted through the words buried in those eight years. He agonized over what to say, what to ask, and what to swallow. Despite spending the whole way here pondering what kind of conversation they would have, it was all for nothing. Because at his request, Jung Bin's mind went completely blank. Instead, a strange sentence popped into his head.\n'How should you deal with a supposedly dead former colleague (a.k.a. hero) who shows up after 8 years and demands classified information?'\nJung Bin came up with a title that would make any anonymous online board explode with comments— something he had never thought of in his life. He felt like an AI tasked with answering questions. Unconsciously, he looked up at the dark sky. The guilt and relief that had rushed upon seeing the mask had long since vanished like scattered ashes. Instead, anxiety filled every corner of his mind.\nJung Bin thought to himself,\n'Didn't you say it wasn't a big deal?'\nNot a big deal? No, it was indeed a big deal. A very big one.\nThe fact that J, who was thought to be dead, had returned safely. It was truly something to be thankful for. He seemed to be in good health, with all his limbs intact. That was a relief. However, the amount of information buried within his brief sentence was overwhelming.\n'Information about Prometheus and Lee Sa-young.'\nJ was a top-ranked hunter, and his skill at pinpointing classified information was no joke. How did he know about Prometheus? And what connection did he have with Lee Sa-young to request information about him?\n'Could he have possibly made contact with Prometheus?'\nNo. Jung Bin immediately rebutted his own thoughts. Prometheus was being hunted by multiple factions. They wouldn't have had the time or reason to contact J. It's more likely that...\n'It's more likely that Lee Sa-young got involved...'\nHe remembered the ominous words Gyu-Gyu had thrown out in the dark interrogation room.\n\"Look into Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"I dug hard and shortlisted a few J candidates... But all information gets cut off at Lee Sa-young and the Pado Guild. That guy, he gives out misleading information and it's really annoying.\"\nGyu-Gyu definitely suspected Lee Sa-young. He claimed that guy had cut off all paths leading to J. And the day J reappeared in the rankings, when Jung Bin met Lee Sa-young in front of the West Sea Rift Memorial... Yes, that was strange.\nNot even trying to hide the suffocatingly ominous energy and sinister aura, he said,\n\"Everything that comes out of the rift...\"\nHe clearly stated...\n\"Is mine.\"\nHe was smiling.\n\"So get lost.\"\nSo eerily, so brightly.\nAt that time, he was absurdly asserting his ownership over J, who had escaped from the rift. But Lee Sa-young awakened as a hunter long after J had entered the rift. There shouldn't be any connection between them. Yet, why...\n\"Hmm, is this really that difficult? Do you really have to agonize over it this much?\"\nThe distorted voice interrupted his spiraling thoughts. Jung Bin quickly lifted his head. J, with his hands thrust into the pockets of his black jacket, was standing crookedly, tilting his head. He innocently asked,\n\"Isn't it strange? Back in our day, there were no secrets, were there?\"\nWell, that's because you had the highest security clearance and could see everything. Jung Bin swallowed the words that almost escaped his mouth. True, J's high clearance only allowed him access to information about monsters, dungeons, and rifts. J muttered to himself,\n\"Hunter Song might have kept me out of the loop a bit... but anyway.\"\nHe shrugged.\n\"It would be nice if you could give it to me in a report... but if you're worried about leaks, just tell me. I can memorize it. And you're really busy, right? I saw you recently shot a commercial about earthquake safety.\"\nHis tone was light, as if he were doing a favor. When had he seen that earthquake safety commercial? Jung Bin rubbed his face with both hands, trying to shake off the stress. He was skilled at hiding his expressions while extracting information, but maintaining composure in this situation was impossible.\nAfter a moment, Jung Bin lifted his head. His face was visibly exhausted, but his mouth moved mechanically.\n\"I recommend searching online for information about Lee Sa-young, J. It's very well documented on the internet wiki.\"\nJ replied in a disinterested tone,\n\"Who asked about his personal details? I'm asking about something else, that's why I called you all the way here. You know everything; why are you acting like this?\"\n\"It's a violation of personal information protection laws.\"\n\"I'm not asking for his ID and password.\"\n\"What's forbidden is forbidden, J.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young aside, Prometheus wouldn't fall under that law, would they?\"\n\"Prometheus is top-secret classified. J. I need the director's approval to tell you about it.\"\nJung Bin could feel the sharp gaze behind the black mask. But his stance remained firm. He didn't know why J was asking, but both were matters he couldn't easily talk about. And...\n'There must have been a reason you hadn't shown yourself until now.'\nThe rift from which countless hunters had entered and never returned. The only person who came out alive. The former strongest and the current strongest. The moment J officially reappeared, all attention would inevitably be on him. Whether that attention was good or malicious.\nJung Bin didn't want to expose him to that unprotected.\n\"...\"\nIt might be self-satisfaction, maybe even selfishness. Perhaps he was doing now what he couldn't do before. But Jung Bin wanted to protect him. He wasn't powerless like before. This was his way of caring.\nBut,\nA long sigh escaped. J was now bowing his head deeply. Resting his forehead on his palm, he murmured gloomily.\n\"I didn't want to do this...\"\n\"What?\"\n\"...But I guess I have no choice.\"\nIt was a foreboding warning. Soon after, thud, his slippers touched the green floor. His stance and aura were anything but ordinary. Jung Bin looked at J with anxious eyes. J, standing crookedly like a thug with one leg bent, shouted,\n\"How can you not tell the hero who saved the country!\"\nIt was a trap!\nJung Bin's jaw dropped. It was a shocking statement, one that made him doubt his ears. Wasn't this the same person who used to wave off the idea of being a hero? And now, he was fully wielding his authority. Although it had been long enough for rivers and mountains to change, Jung Bin hadn't anticipated this kind of situation. He stammered,\n\"What, what did you say?\"\n\"How many monsters I've caught, how many rifts I've closed!\"\n\"Wait a minute, J!\"\n\"How many dungeons I've cleared, I say!\"\n\"Please calm down!\"\n\"I'm not asking for anything unreasonable! I'm not even asking you to summarize the past 8 years! I'm just asking about two things, reasonably! And an old colleague can't even tell me that!\"\n\"I'm sorry, please calm down!\"\nThankfully, J's rampage ended with a rant about how, in his day, he had no time to rest, going from dungeon to rift and back to dungeon, using monster carcasses as pillows...\nAfter enduring it for a long while, Jung Bin staggered to the bench and collapsed into it. J, too, slumped down, his head lowered near the exit of the slide. Silence fell again. This time, even the crickets were quiet. Eight years was enough time to turn a young man into an old grump, Jung Bin thought.\nAfter a war with nothing but defeat.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nFor a long time, neither of them spoke. It would be more accurate to say that neither dared to break the silence. Glancing sideways, Jung Bin saw that J was twisting his body restlessly.\nAfter a while, Jung Bin, hunched over with his face in his hands, muttered weakly.\n\"...I will tell you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But before that... May I say something?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nA similarly weak response came back. Jung Bin brushed his lips, then sighed.\n\"J, when you officially start your activities, all eyes will inevitably be on you. To be honest, I... hope you don't reveal yourself. I'm saying this as Jung Bin, not as the team leader of the Awakened Management Bureau.\"\n\"...\"\n\"People can be cruel at times. Back then...\"\nWhat had he thought while watching J's exhausted figure wandering through the Bureau, drenched in blood he didn't even bother to wipe off? People pretended not to know his weary figure, and they ignored the youthful appearance that even the mask couldn't hide. Because that's how they could survive. Jung Bin muttered,\n\"Haven't you experienced enough of that?\"\n\"Oh man, what are you even talking about...\"\nJung Bin quickly looked up. J was resting his chin on his hand, staring at Jung Bin. After a long silence, J responded with unwavering certainty,\n\"I already finished worrying about that a long time ago. I've made my decision.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Short\nBut only for a moment, J added awkwardly.\n\"I said it so confidently... but I was confused. A lot.\"\nJ tapped the cheek of his mask with his fingertips and slowly began to speak.\n\"I'm the only survivor of the West Sea Rift.\"\n\"...Did everyone else die?\"\n\"Yes. Actually, it hasn't been long since I came out of the Rift.\"\n\"...\"\n\"When I came out, several years had passed.\"\nJung Bin's complexion changed as he quietly listened to J's story. A cold sensation ran down his spine. He looked up with a pale face.\n\"Wait, wait a minute... Are you saying you spent years inside the West Sea rift?\"\nEight years had passed since J entered the West Sea rift. J had only recently escaped the rift. If they were trapped inside the exitless rift for those eight years, and if J was the only one who escaped...\n'That's too cruel.'\nCold sweat broke out. Jung Bin struggled to remain calm, searching for the right words but failing to find them. But J himself responded indifferently.\n\"Oh, I can't be sure of that.\"\nHe muttered with his head tilted slightly.\n\"Whether I was really in the Rift for eight years, or if the flow of time is different between the rift and reality... my memory isn't clear.\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\"My memory isn't complete. Some parts are hazy, as if they've been cut out.\"\n\"...\"\nCould it be that excessive stress had caused memory issues? It was a plausible explanation. In fact, there were even first-generation Awakeners who had memory problems and were receiving treatment. But it was not something to jump to conclusions about. After some thought, Jung Bin spoke.\n\"...So far, there have been no reported cases of time flowing differently between the rift and reality.\"\n\"The West Sea rift might be the first case. That rift was rather strange.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Anyway.\"\nJ stretched out, continuing in a tone that sounded almost like a lament.\n\"I came out of the rift, only to find that eight years had passed, that I was considered dead, and that so many things had changed. The world I knew wasn't like this...\"\n\"...\"\n\"The world was at peace without me. Or maybe it was because I wasn't there. I felt like everything would disappear if I showed up.\"\nThe words he spoke so casually carried a weight that was heavier than any other. Words that Jung Bin dared not respond to, simply listening quietly as J continued to speak.\n\"There was no place for me here.\"\nThe J that Jung Bin had observed for a long time wanted peace more than anyone else. He believed that if he sacrificed himself, eventually the chaos would subside and the world would find stability.\nBut the peace he had longed for had been achieved in a world without him, and the person who had wanted it more than anyone else had hidden away, of fear of breaking it. It was an ironic situation. J shrugged.\n\"At that time, I was scared to face people... I felt guilty for surviving alone when I couldn't save anyone, and honestly, well, I wasn't in my right mind. So, like someone said, I tried to live quietly. That was the conclusion I reached after struggling a bit.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...It didn't go as planned, though.\"\nWas he referring to the day the rankings were updated? Few people could shake up the entire nation with just their name. Jung Bin smiled wryly. J spoke lightly.\n\"But I gained some certainty. In that dungeon.\"\n\"Dungeon?\"\n\"The one where your arm got broken.\"\nJ gestured towards Jung Bin's right arm. Unconsciously, Jung Bin touched the scar on his arm. The eroded dungeon that suddenly escalated in rank. The dungeon where J had appeared, smashed the golem, and disappeared when Jung Bin had collapsed and lost consciousness. Jung Bin cautiously asked,\n\"I did hear a rough explanation from Hong Ye-seong, but... it was somewhat vague. Could you tell me what happened then?\"\n\"Huh? It's nothing special.\"\nJ, who had been tapping his mask, spoke.\n\"I had business in the eroded dungeon, and suddenly the rank increased. Then the dungeon master showed up, so I dealt with it. That's it.\"\nFrom earlier, J had been packing too much information into casual words. Jung Bin, unable to process the overload of information, rubbed his temples.\n\"Where did you hear about the eroded dungeons...? That's classified information. Only a very select few rankers are privy to it. How did you...?\"\nJ averted his eyes, mumbling his response.\n\"...There were circumstances.\"\n\"Are you sure you were trying to live quietly? It seems you know more than even my direct subordinates...\"\n\"No, I really tried... honestly.\"\n\"Sigh...\"\nJung Bin sighed deeply, running his hands through his hair.\n\"...So, what certainty did you gain?\"\n\"...It's nothing grand.\"\nJ slowly stood up from the slide with an \"Oops.\" The flickering streetlight suddenly brightened. He shoved his hands into his jacket pockets and leaned slightly forward. There was a playful tone in his posture and altered voice.\n\"I realized I still like saving people.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Killing monsters, closing rifts, clearing dungeons— those are all fine, but I like saving people with my own hands the best.\"\nJung Bin slightly parted his lips, but unsure of what to say, he simply watched the figure before him.\nIn truth, it might have been impossible for someone like him to live quietly. Both in the past and now, J had a way of drawing people's eyes to him. No one could help but notice him. He was that radiant.\n\"I've failed over and over, I failed in the rift, and I might keep failing... but there was at least one success.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, I'll keep trying. I took a break, so I should be able to do better.\"\nThere are things that can't be done with just a sense of duty. In the past, the J that Jung Bin had seen was always someone barely holding on at the edge of a cliff. The whole world seemed to be pushing him to the brink. Jung Bin had also been one of those pushing him. There had been days when J had barely held on.\nBut now,\nThe man he met after eight years...\n\"And...\"\n...was shining brighter than ever.\n\"There's someone waiting for me.\"\n\"...\"\nSomeone who had once swayed on the verge of falling off a cliff was now gone. Countless things must have happened during those eight years, both to J and to Jung Bin. The time they couldn't share had changed many things. But something hadn't changed.\nJung Bin wanted to help J.\nThen, and now.\n\"...It seems I spoke out of turn.\"\n\"It wasn't out of turn... Were you worried?\"\n\"I was worried, yes. But... I see there was no need.\"\nFinally, Jung Bin regained his warm smile. He rolled down the sleeves of his shirt, hiding the scars. After neatly buttoning the cuffs, Jung Bin pulled out a leather-bound notebook and pen from the inner pocket of his suit jacket. Both bore the Awakened Management Bureau's emblem.\nClicking the pen, he looked at J.\n\"You asked for information about Prometheus and Lee Sa-young. What exactly are you looking for?\"\n\"Everything.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\nJung Bin looked at J with a puzzled expression. J crossed his arms.\n\"I know that Lee Sa-young was an experimental subject of Prometheus. I'm looking for anything that could fill in the gaps between those points. I heard you were the one who first rescued Lee Sa-young. Could you also tell me what happened then?\"\n\"How do you even know about that?\"\n\"Let's just say there were circumstances.\"\n\"If it weren't you asking, I'd have immediately detained you to find out your source of information. Really...\"\nAfter searching for the right words for a while, Jung Bin finally spoke, trying to sound as mild as possible.\n\"...You really do have all the crucial information.\"\n\"I'll take that as a compliment.\"\nJ sighed and began to watch Jung Bin jotting something down in the notebook. Then, when Jung Bin had filled about half a page, J suddenly spoke up.\n\"Well, I won't just ask for a favor without giving something in return. I have some information for you too.\"\n\"Really? What kind of information?\"\n\"You know the scenery inside the eroded dungeon where you hurt your arm? Or the unique features of other eroded dungeons? Like the monsters that only appear there, the sky filled with white ashes, or the ruined buildings.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"They're surprisingly similar to what's inside the West Sea rift.\"\n\"What did you say?\"\nJ's words were a series of shocks. Jung Bin widened his eyes. J calmly continued.\n\"That's why I went. I wondered if the eroded dungeons and the West Sea rift might be connected. I couldn't investigate properly because the dungeon's rank suddenly changed, but...\"\n\"Wait a minute! Is that really true?\"\n\"It's just a hypothesis, but if we investigate properly, we'll find out.\"\nJ tilted his head.\n\"If they're really connected... we might even be able to retrieve the bodies buried there.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Short\nThe air hung heavy. Jung Bin placed the notebook on his lap and clasped his hands together, closing his eyes tightly. The bodies buried in that place. Among them, there would be several hunters Jung Bin knew.\nAnd the last survivor who had witnessed their final moments...\n\"It's a miracle that you came back.\"\nIn a world where countless hunters lost their minds watching their comrades die right beside them, this was especially true. It was a story no one who hadn't experienced it could dare to console or claim to understand. So, Jung Bin barely opened his mouth, speaking formally.\n\"...Yes, I understand why you appeared in the eroded dungeon. If that's the reason, of course, we should cooperate. You'll need information on the eroded dungeon as well, won't you?\"\n\"Are you okay with that?\"\n\"There's no reason not to be. As you said, you're a hero of this nation.\"\nKuk. J let out a short groan and twisted his body in a small wriggle. The reaction was more intense than expected, making Jung Bin, who had spoken with genuine intent, awkwardly scratch the back of his neck.\nJung Bin cleared his throat briefly and furrowed his brows slightly.\n\"Ah, but providing information on the eroded dungeon might take some time. It's not under my jurisdiction.\"\n\"Who manages it?\"\n\"You might have heard of him... Guild Leader Nam Woo-jin of the Seowon Guild manages it. He was the first to discover it, and he's been observing it ever since.\"\nAt that moment, J's shoulders twitched. Jung Bin, who was watching him with a puzzled expression, pressed the temple of his head with the tip of his pen.\n\"He'll get it sorted out quickly if we ask. Should I avoid mentioning that you requested it?\"\n\"...Yes, for now.\"\n\"Understood. And...\"\nJung Bin quickly began organizing J's requests. Data on Prometheus, the first appearance of Lee Sa-young, who was one of Prometheus' test subjects...\nIt would be best to relay whatever information he could now, as there was no guarantee they would be able to contact each other again like today. Soon, Jung Bin looked up. J was still standing upright. Jung Bin cautiously asked,\n\"How much do you know about Prometheus?\"\nJ answered smoothly without a moment's hesitation.\n\"That they lure in awakeners using drugs and create artificial awakeners by using them. In the past, they used ordinary people with peculiarities like rift victims as test subjects. They claim to prevent the apocalypse, but they're just a bunch of incompetent, fake fanatics without any success stories.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nA brief silence passed between them. It felt like their eyes met behind the mask.\n\"...\"\n'Perhaps he had the eyes of a puppy that just made a mistake.' Jung Bin suddenly had that conviction. In any case, he stared blankly at the black mask, lost in thought.\n'There's nothing more to convey.'\nJ's summarization skills were exceptional. After all, he had condensed a report spanning hundreds of pages into a three-sentence summary, perfectly hitting all the key points. It was so flawless that Jung Bin wanted to share it with his subordinates. He couldn't help but blurt out,\n\"You already know everything...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nJ, who had been exercising his right to remain silent, slowly squatted down in front of Jung Bin. He pressed his fist against the corner of his masked mouth and mumbled.\n\"Can I take back what I just said?\"\n\"It seems you've come too far to take it back...\"\n\"Can't you just pretend you didn't hear it? We have that kind of bond, don't we?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"...Damn.\"\nJ let out a gloomy curse and, after a long moment of contemplation, opened his mouth.\n\"Then do you know what this so-called apocalypse those fanatics are talking about is?\"\n\"Ah, the apocalypse.\"\nJung Bin organized his thoughts and slowly began to speak.\n\"Prometheus has beings known as Seers. They claim to see a future where the apocalypse comes in their dreams. Although they are all different individuals, the apocalyptic scenes they describe are surprisingly similar.\"\n\"So they're acting based solely on that? That such an apocalypse will really come?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nJung Bin smiled bitterly.\n\"It's hard to believe, really. It does sound like a cult. But even if it's a lie, the problem is that they believe it, grow their influence, and harm others. And...\"\nA girl with glasses naturally came to his mind.\nThe girl who sees fragments of the world, Yoon Ga-eul. She foresaw the apocalypse and predicted that it would come to this world as well. Jung Bin sighed, rubbing his mouth.\n\"...The apocalypse will indeed come. I can't explain in detail, but... hmm... I suppose it's okay to tell you. There's a hunter who reads special information. They, too, predicted the apocalypse. And there's credible evidence.\"\nJ's shoulders twitched again, this time more noticeably.\nAs expected, even someone like him would be surprised to hear that the apocalypse was coming. Jung Bin looked at J sympathetically. Surviving that hellish rift only to face the apocalypse now. It was enough to shock anyone.\n\"That's why we were looking for you, J. We concluded that we need you to stop the apocalypse.\"\nAnd Cha Eui-jae thought to himself.\n'What should I do?'\nHis kind old colleague, Jung Bin, was looking at his black mask with a concerned face, seemingly worried that Cha Eui-jae might be in shock.\nShock? He was shocked. In a different way.\n'Fuck...'\nIt was fortunate he was wearing a mask. His current unsettled feelings and expression would be impossible to hide, even with his poker face ability.\nAnyway, this was a big problem.\n'I knew too much...'\nMost of the information Jung Bin had painstakingly provided wasn't new at all!\nCha Eui-jae began to reflect on himself. He had certainly tried to live quietly. He didn't know how, but he had made an effort, at least. And he had failed spectacularly. Judging by the fact that a mere hangover soup shop employee knew everything from the top-secret information strictly managed by the Awakened Management Bureau to the purpose of a cult organization!\n'Nam Woo-jin, who manages the information on the eroded dungeon?'\nHe knew him. Not just acquaintances; he had even met him directly, treated his grandmother, and given him a black ticket.\n'The hunter who reads special information and predicted the apocalypse?'\nHe knew that person too. It was probably Yoon Ga-eul. She had been the one to visit the hangover soup shop first, predict the apocalypse, and even show him the image of a world already destroyed.\nAt this point, he was afraid of himself. Without realizing it, Cha Eui-jae muttered.\n\"I guess I'm not destined to live quietly...\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"Nothing. What about Lee Sa-young?\"\n\"Lee Sa-young... When he first appeared...\"\nJung Bin furrowed his brows again, as if trying to recall the memory, and then slowly began to speak.\n\"It was seven years ago. The Awakened Management Bureau received a tip. About a research facility abducting people for experiments...\"\n***\nSeven years ago.\nOn a cold night, while the clouds covered the moon, figures hidden in the darkness moved silently. The man at the front, crouching low, signaled to those behind him. All movement ceased.\nThe man who gave the signal, Jung Bin, adjusted the bulletproof helmet and mask he had put on to cover his face. The mountainside was eerily quiet. Not even the usual deer cries could be heard.\nA burly man crouched behind a tree whispered.\n\"...Captain, are you sure this is the place? There's no sign of anything, no presence, nothing.\"\n\"If the report is true, it should be here.\"\n\"Good grief...\"\n\"If it's a false report, that would actually be a good thing. Please verify.\"\nJung Bin responded briefly, gesturing to the burly man. The man, Bae Won-woo, pulled out a night vision scope and scanned the area.\nAt that moment, a sweet scent wafted through the air, tickling their noses. Jung Bin frowned. Turning around, he saw that the others had also noticed the scent.\n\"Do you smell something?\"\n\"Yeah, suddenly there's...\"\n\"Cap, Captain!\"\nBae Won-woo suddenly raised his voice. Jung Bin quickly turned around.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Ah, you have to see this for yourself... there's something, or rather, someone...\"\nClearly flustered, Bae Won-woo hurriedly handed the night vision scope to Jung Bin. Like Bae Won-woo, Jung Bin scanned the surroundings with the scope. Then, his eyes widened.\nAmid the lush forest stood a stark white building. But why had the hunters, with their sharp senses, failed to notice such an out-of-place structure?\nAs if to answer, a breeze blew. The clouds parted. The full moon, which had been hidden behind the clouds, slowly emerged, and 'it' shone under the light. Jung Bin unconsciously murmured,\n\"...Oh my God.\"\nThe building was covered in a sticky, pitch-black substance. No, could that even be called a liquid? It pulsated as if alive, covering every intact surface of the building.\nSssss... A sound of something melting filled the air. Everything around them was corroding.\nAnd in the midst of it all, there was something white.\n\"Is that...\"\n\"A person, right?\"\nAn excited Bae Won-woo asked. Jung Bin did not answer and lowered the scope. With the darkness lifted, they could now see it with the naked eye. In the middle of the building, covered entirely by the black substance, there was one spot— an untouched, white, rounded area.\nThe wind blows. The boy's long, messy hair, which covers the nape of his neck, flutters in the breeze. The sweet scent lingers in the air.\nAnd there...\n\"...\"\nA boy in loose white patient clothing was standing there.",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Short\nInstinctively, he knew.\n\"An Awakened.\"\nMoreover, the boy's aura was far from ordinary, hinting at something unusual. Jung Bin signaled to the hunters. The hunters, who had been closing in, quickly retreated in unison. Jung Bin pulled out a chain and wrapped it around his hand. Despite the sounds and presence they must have made, the boy didn't look back at them.\nA chill ran down his spine. Bae Won-woo, who had taken back the night vision goggles, alternated between looking through them and with his naked eye at the boy.\nThe boy still stood motionless, like an isolated island. His pants were so short that his ankles were exposed, and his bare feet stood on the ground. There was a calmness that didn't match the horrific surroundings, where everything had melted away.\n\"...He looks a bit dangerous, Captain.\"\nUnder normal circumstances, Bae Won-woo would have rushed to rescue the boy by now, but even he felt something was off in this eerie space. The air itself felt heavy as if it was being consumed by the black liquid. Jung Bin nodded silently in agreement. Bae Won-woo roughly scratched his short hair.\n\"No matter how you look at it, the kid seems to be the one who caused all this mess.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If we get too close, we might end up dead... Damn it, is this okay? Should we approach him?\"\n\"No, wait.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"We need to ensure safety first.\"\nThe research facility that was rumored to kidnap people for experiments had melted away, leaving only one presence. The sole survivor, dressed in something resembling hospital clothes, was strangely spotless. The only thing that came to mind was a sinister possibility. After taking a deep breath, Jung Bin picked up a stone lying on the ground and threw it into the black liquid.\nSsszzz... The stone started to dissolve the moment it touched the liquid. It soon sank into the sludge with a puff of black smoke. Bae Won-woo's mouth hung open. Jung Bin responded,\n\"It's best not to approach recklessly. We need to find a detour.\"\n\"Is that acid? Like hydrochloric or sulfuric acid? Or poison?\"\n\"I'm not sure. We'll have to analyze the composition, but... whatever it is, it's definitely dangerous.\"\nBae Won-woo frowned and looked at the boy. He muttered, belatedly realizing something.\n\"...He must be an Awakened.\"\n\"Yes, seeing how he's unharmed in the middle of all this.\"\n\"Could he have just awakened?\"\n\"That's something we'll need to confirm.\"\nJung Bin straightened up from his crouch. The chain jingled softly. Bae Won-woo stood up awkwardly but stopped when Jung Bin shook his head.\n\"Please step back with the others. I'll make contact.\"\n\"But the whole area is covered in poison. Shouldn't I, being more durable, go instead?\"\n\"No matter how tough your body is, Hunter Bae Won-woo... I don't think you could withstand this.\"\nJung Bin nodded toward the black liquid. After hesitating for a while, Bae Won-woo reluctantly stepped back.\nNewly awakened individuals are often poor at controlling their abilities. Moreover, their heightened senses can make them extremely sensitive. Getting too close could provoke them. After surveying the area, Jung Bin climbed onto a rock untouched by the black liquid.\n\"Can you hear me?\"\nThe boy slowly raised both hands. Was he about to attack? Jung Bin tightened his grip on the chain, his face tense.\nBut the boy only wiggled his fingers. As if observing his own movements, his violet eyes followed the motion of his fingers. Next, he examined his feet. The boy rubbed the white floor with his soles and then took a step forward before sitting down with his legs stretched out.\nEvery movement was careful and puzzling, as if...\n'Like someone moving for the first time in a very long time...'\nJung Bin snapped back to his senses. The boy had long, unkempt hair that looked like it hadn't been cut in ages. His clothes were too thin for being outside and too short for his body. The research lab that kidnapped people for experiments...\n'He must be a kidnapped victim.'\nThey needed to rescue the boy to find out what had happened. After taking a deep breath, Jung Bin called out,\n\"I am Jung Bin from the Awakened Management Bureau. I've come to rescue you.\"\nThe boy, who hadn't shown a hint of interest in him before, suddenly turned his head and stared at Jung Bin. His pale, almost ghostly face was expressionless. Just as Jung Bin was about to say something more,\nThe boy lifted both hands and wrapped them around his neck as if he were choking himself. Jung Bin's eyes widened in shock, and he instinctively reached out.\n\"Wait...!\"\nFortunately, the boy seemed to be checking something as he held his neck. The hands that had been gripping his throat slowly moved upward. The boy's violet eyes didn't seem to register Jung Bin as he ran his hands over his neck, jaw, and cheeks. Then he slowly blinked. The boy opened his mouth, revealing a pitch-black tongue.\n\"...Ah.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Mm, eh.\"\nHis speech was clumsy. Like a child learning to talk for the first time, he mumbled sounds that didn't form words. Finally, the first clear word he uttered was,\n\"J...ee.\"\nIt was a name he couldn't forget— a name that was all too familiar.\nJung Bin's mouth fell open. The boy struggled to continue,\n\"How... much.\"\nBut then he started coughing violently. Before he knew it, Jung Bin jumped off the rock and ran toward him.\n***\nThe water from the red rubber hose poured out with a hiss. Jung Bin spat out the bitter contents that rose in his throat. Dark red blood mixed with the clear water and flowed away.\nEven after taking an antidote, he was in this state. Or maybe he should be glad the antidote worked at all, he thought bitterly as he rinsed his mouth with water. He looked up. His face was as pale as a sheet.\n'It's a good thing the others didn't try to approach.'\nAfter wiping his wet mouth with the back of his hand, Jung Bin stood up.\nAs expected, the substance covering the research facility was poison. What he hadn't expected was just how potent it was— strong enough to affect even his S-grade body, which usually shrugged off most toxins. With such deadly poison everywhere, there was no hope of finding any useful information.\nSwallowing the metallic taste of blood, Jung Bin thought,\n'It's too dangerous to take him directly to the Awakened Management Bureau...'\nThe next best option was to stay in an abandoned house at the foot of the mountain, away from people. On the Day the Rift, a rift had appeared near the valley by the mountain, and the civilians living nearby had quickly packed up and moved to safer areas. Thanks to that, it was easy to find an empty house with running water.\nHeavy footsteps approached from behind. Jung Bin turned around. Despite the chilly weather, Bae Won-woo was wearing a short-sleeved black shirt, his sleeves rolled up to his shoulders, as he scratched his head.\n\"Are you okay, Captain? That was the last of the antidote...\"\n\"I'm fine. What about the target?\"\n\"I cleared out a room and told him to go in, and he did so on his own. He's quieter than I expected. Now I'm going to chop some wood and start a fire.\"\nSince J had gone missing in the West Sea rift, the Awakened Management Bureau had been in turmoil. J's absence left a void too big to fill— one that no one could easily replace. J had handled more dungeons and rifts than any other hunter alone, so it was no surprise.\nTo fill the gap, the Bureau launched a massive recruitment drive for Awakened individuals. Bae Won-woo was one of the hunters urgently brought in through special recruitment. Jung Bin asked,\n\"Hunter Bae Won-woo, are you sure it's okay not to return to headquarters? I can handle this alone.\"\n\"Ah, it's fine. This is nothing.\"\nAll the other hunters had returned to headquarters. The boy's abilities were dangerous, and with the Bureau facing a severe manpower shortage, they couldn't afford to leave many people behind. But Bae Won-woo volunteered to stay. He cheerfully joked,\n\"There's one room left, so I think the Captain and I can share it. Or I could set up a tent outside in the yard.\"\n\"Let's share. Have you talked to the target?\"\n\"Yeah, I just asked if he was okay, if he was hurt anywhere, stuff like that. He answered pretty well with yes or no. But there's something odd— his speech is kind of clumsy.\"\nBae Won-woo crossed his arms and furrowed his brow.\n\"He looks pretty clean, and he's taller than I thought. But his speech is awkward. Like they put a gag on him or something...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Eh, no point in speculating. How long will we stay here?\"\nJung Bin stood up from his crouching position and turned off the faucet. The water, which had been trickling out, came to a stop.\n\"Until the target stabilizes and can fully control his abilities.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"We'll stay here until then. Bringing the target to headquarters before he can control the poison is too risky. It could endanger not only the headquarters but also civilians.\"\n\"This is totally...\"\n\"You're free to return ahead of me.\"\n\"No, that's not it.\"\nJung Bin stared at the firmly closed door. The boy seemed to be sitting quietly inside, barely making a sound. A kidnapping victim, the sole survivor, the one who brought down the research facility... The boy with the awkward speech had uttered a single word first.\n\"J...ee.\"\nJ.\nWhy did the name of the hero trapped in the West Sea rift come out of this boy's mouth? What kind of relationship did they have?\nJung Bin quickly moved to the firmly closed door. After clearing his throat lightly, the boy rustled inside. Jung Bin carefully opened the door. The boy sitting in the corner looked up. Jung Bin politely asked,\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"Forget that.\"\nJung Bin's eyes widened at the boy's cold voice. The boy's violet eyes were fierce.\n\"How much... time has passed?\"\n\"What...\"\n\"The rift.\"\nThe boy spat out the words.\n\"How much time has passed?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 121: Short\nJung Bin examined the boy's face. Beneath the fierce expression, there was a hint of wariness.\n'It seems like calming his wariness should come first.'\nHe would have to stay with the boy until his powers stabilized. The faster they built trust, the better. Jung Bin calmly pulled out a laptop from his inventory and spoke.\n\"Let me first explain the situation. I'm Hunter Jung Bin from the Awakened Management Bureau. I heard there was a facility where people were being kidnapped for experiments, and I went there. You were the only survivor, so I rescued you and brought you here.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I have many things to tell you and many questions to ask, but...\"\nJung Bin cautiously asked.\n\"First, let me ask you one thing. Did you happen to see a white, square window?\"\nThe boy, who had been silent, slowly nodded. Seeing the system window meant that the boy had been chosen by the system, meaning he was an Awakener. It was as Jung Bin had expected.\n\"You've awakened. Do you remember when you first saw it?\"\n\"...Not long ago.\"\nIt was a vague answer. Jung Bin tapped on his laptop and made eye contact with the boy. The wariness still hadn't disappeared.\nThrough the slightly open door, there was a sharp, rhythmic sound of something being struck. Bae Won-woo was diligently splitting the dry wood he picked up from somewhere with his bare hands. While Jung Bin was choosing his words, the boy spoke first.\n\"...You said you're with the Bureau.\"\n\"Yes. Ah, if you don't know about the Awakened Management Bureau, I can explain...\"\n\"I know.\"\nThe boy stared at Jung Bin, then asked again.\n\"So, what about the rift?\"\nIt seemed like he needed to address the boy's questions first before moving on. Jung Bin opened his laptop and asked,\n\"Can you explain which rift you're talking about? If I know the location, it will be easier to find.\"\nThe tension in the boy's shoulders eased a little. The boy, who had been observing Jung Bin, tersely responded.\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\nJung Bin's eyes widened in surprise. The boy added nonchalantly.\n\"I don't know. The location.\"\n\"Hmm... Do you have any other information? Like when it might have appeared? Even a rough estimate would help.\"\n\"I don't know.\"\nThe boy's tone was awkward, but his insistence on not knowing was clear. His violet eyes drifted towards the laptop bearing the Awakened Management Bureau's logo. He tilted his head slightly.\n\"It could be a dungeon...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Anyway, they said it would take a long time.\"\n\"A rift or dungeon that takes a long time...\"\nIt wasn't exactly good information. The meaning of \"takes a long time\" wasn't clear. Jung Bin rubbed his chin with his thumb. The boy turned his head away.\n\"I don't know... That's all I can tell you.\"\n\"Understood. I'll look into it, but...\"\nAs the amount of information increased, so did the possibilities. It might be easier to just search for all rifts and dungeons. As Jung Bin began to scroll through the list of rifts and dungeons stored on his laptop, sorted by date, the boy, who had been watching him, suddenly muttered,\n\"...No, asking like this...\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"You are definitely with the Bureau, right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Do you know J?\"\n\"What?\"\nHearing J's name again, Jung Bin looked up.\nCould the boy have had some kind of relationship with J? Or perhaps he idolized J, seeing him as a role model. After all, J was a national hero. The boy, with a puzzled expression, sat with his knees up, resting his chin on them, and stared at Jung Bin.\nHis dry lips moved slightly.\n\"They said J was dead.\"\nJung Bin's hands, which had been typing quickly, suddenly stopped.\nJ's death. It was already a well-known fact, but it seemed it wasn't to the boy.\nIt took about three months to confirm J's death. If he could get the boy to talk a bit more, he might be able to estimate when the boy was kidnapped by that research facility. As Jung Bin made that judgment and was about to speak, the boy blinked. Biting his pale lips, he closed his eyes. A fleeting emotion crossed his usually expressionless face. With his eyes tightly shut, he asked in a trembling voice,\n\"How much time has passed?\"\nThe emotion in his voice was unmistakable.\n\"...\"\nIt was an overwhelming and profound despair.\nJung Bin couldn't bring himself to say anything and just closed his mouth. What could make such a young boy feel such deep despair? But before he could figure out the answer, the boy suddenly stood up, staggering. Jung Bin hurriedly set down his laptop and stood up to follow. When he grabbed the boy's arm,\n\"Get lost!\"\nBang! With a sharp tug, the boy broke free and ran out the door barefoot. Bae Won-woo, who had been stacking firewood in the yard, looked confused as he pulled the wireless earphones out of his ears and shouted.\n\"Hey! Where are you going without your shoes? I left some slippers out!\"\nOf course, there was no reply. The boy disappeared into the dense greenery. Should he go after him? No, if the captain wanted that, he would have yelled to catch him. Bae Won-woo grumbled to himself as he went back to stacking the firewood. Then suddenly,\nThud!\n\"Huh?\"\nThere was a loud crashing sound. Bae Won-woo quickly turned around. And there,\n\"Oh my god.\"\nHe gasped. Jung Bin was standing still, his face pressed against the top of the door frame. A crack had formed in the thick wood, as if it was broken.\nOnly the lower part of his usually calm face was visible, and his lips were tightly pursed, which was unusual. The ceiling of the house was low, and Jung Bin was too tall, resulting in this unfortunate incident.\nBae Won-woo stammered,\n\"W-what... what happened, Captain?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Wait... did you interrogate the kid or something?\"\n\"I didn't do anything like that. I just...\"\nJung Bin sighed and rested his forehead against the door frame again.\n\"No... no, it must be my lack of ability...\"\n\"What?\"\nIt was so rare to see the normally composed captain so out of sorts that Bae Won-woo didn't know how to react. He stood there awkwardly, waiting for instructions. After taking a deep breath, Jung Bin suddenly looked up.\n\"...Hunter Bae Won-woo, do you have any siblings?\"\n\"What? Well, I have a younger brother.\"\nIt was a reassuring answer. Someone with siblings would likely be more adept at handling a temperamental kid. Jung Bin pointed towards the forest where the boy had disappeared.\n\"Can you go after the target? Don't force him back, just ensure his safety and stay with him.\"\n\"Yeah, I can do that, but...\"\n\"Then... I'll leave it to you. I have something to look into.\"\nJung Bin whispered gloomily before stumbling back into the room. The door clicked shut. Left with this unexpected responsibility, Bae Won-woo had no choice but to head towards the mountain.\nIn the misty light of dawn, Bae Won-woo, holding a pair of green rubber slippers, walked through the tall grass, surveying the area.\nThe mountain was remote, with no clear hiking trails or even paths made by people. There should be some traces left behind. However, Bae Won-woo wasn't skilled in tracking or delicate tasks, and he worried that taking too long might lead to danger.\n\"No choice...\"\nSometimes, you just have to do what you're told. He cupped his hands around his mouth and took a deep breath. Then he shouted loudly.\n\"Hey! Where are you!!\"\nYou... you... you...\nThe shout echoed through the densely packed trees, causing a few startled birds to flap their wings and take flight. There was no response. Bae Won-woo shouted again.\n\"Hey! The mountain is dangerous! Even if you've awakened!\"\nAs the echo faded, he took another deep breath to shout again. But before he could, a voice filled with annoyance came from behind him.\n\"Stop it. You're too loud.\"\nBae Won-woo quickly turned to where the voice had come from. The boy was sitting on a thick tree branch. How he had climbed up there was a mystery. Bae Won-woo scratched his head.\n\"Whew, I'm glad you're safe.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why did you run out without your shoes on?\"\nThe boy turned his head away, clearly not wanting to listen. Regardless, Bae Won-woo kept talking.\n\"We're not bad people. We're hunters from the Awakened Management Bureau. We're here to help you.\"\n\"...\"\nThe boy, seemingly uninterested, just swung his legs back and forth. Despite wandering through the forest, his pale feet were still clean. The captain, Jung Bin, had told him to stay with the boy, but...\n'Anyway, we need to bring him back to base.'\nHe understood what that really meant. Jung Bin had wanted him to coax the boy back.\nHow could he persuade the boy to come back? As Bae Won-woo pondered, he suddenly looked up. He had heard the boy's first words in the ruins. J.\n'Even though J is dead... well, nobody dislikes hunters these days.'\n\"You've only just awakened, right? You're probably still clumsy with your powers and don't know much about the system window. The captain and I can help you with that.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And you seem pretty strong. You could even become a hunter like me or the captain.\"\n\"...A hunter?\"\n\"Yes, a hunter.\"\nThe boy stared down at Bae Won-woo. Good, it seemed like he had taken the bait.\nAfter a moment of silence, the boy slowly spoke.\n\"If I become a hunter.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"I can enter rifts, right?\"\n\"Rifts? Oh, yeah, you can. You can fight monsters, enter rifts, and dungeons too.\"\n\"Then, if I enter a rift...\"\nThe boy took a deep breath and tilted his head.\n\"Can I find the people who went in before?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 122: Short\n\"Someone who went in before? Do you know someone?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThe boy nodded, biting his lip before speaking slowly, carefully pronouncing each word.\n\"I have to find them. Even if it's just the body.\"\n\"Oh no... Are you sure it was a rift? There wouldn't be any bodies if it was a rift.\"\n\"It could be a dungeon.\"\n\"This is tricky...\"\n\"They said it would take a long time. Do you know anything else?\"\nBae Won-woo rubbed the back of his neck, looking a bit flustered. But he also saw an opportunity. If he asked the right questions, he might be able to uncover something about the boy's past. He asked gently,\n\"I can't really say with just that... Was it a civilian caught in the rift? Or was it a hunter you knew?\"\n\"...\"\nThe boy remained silent. Bae Won-woo smirked slightly.\n\"Hey, do you think I'm asking for my own good? I'm trying to help you out here.\"\n\"...It was a hunter.\"\n\"A hunter? There shouldn't be any cases where a hunter can't return from a rift... No, wait.\"\nWhen a rift collapses, anyone inside is expelled to the rift's entrance, even if they're dead. Hunters often joked that rifts spit out anything foreign. This had always been the rule since the appearance of the rifts, and no one questioned it. It was a rule of the system.\nBut there was one exception.\n\"The West Sea rift.\"\nThe West Sea rift was different in every way. Normally, a rift's entrance remains open until the rift's master is killed, but the West Sea rift's entrance vanished right after J and the other hunters entered, as if it had been waiting for that moment.\nWhen the entrance disappeared, the rift's turbulent energy, which had seemed like it would engulf the entire West Sea, suddenly subsided and eventually vanished completely, leaving nothing behind but a large hole in the middle of the sea. None of the people it had swallowed were ever returned.\nWhen the rift collapsed, ships and helicopters were sent out to search for any remains, but they found nothing. People were devastated. Someone had said,\n\"It completely defied the laws of the system.\"\nThe boy propped his chin on his hand and asked,\n\"The West Sea rift?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah. About a year ago, a rift appeared in the West Sea. It's gone now, though.\"\n\"Did anyone go in there?\"\n\"Huh? Hunters? I'm not sure about everyone, but I know one for sure. J. He's a national hero.\"\n\"...\"\nThe boy's eyes darkened, but Bae Won-woo didn't notice. He was too busy trying to remember.\n\"But that rift... it just vanished.\"\nThe boy asked urgently,\n\"Is there no way to enter a collapsed rift?\"\n\"Huh? Well...\"\nThe West Sea rift, a rift that defied the system's rules, showed no signs of an exit when it collapsed, and there were no observable changes that usually occur when the rift's master is killed. It had simply disappeared, as if it had never existed.\n'That's why there was so much debate about whether they were still alive or not...'\nThere had been arguments about whether or not to send a rescue team, whether they were still alive or already dead... They had argued for so long that it took two months after the rift collapsed for an official death announcement to be made. Bae Won-woo scratched his head, frowning. A collapsed rift couldn't be re-entered. That's what \"collapsed\" meant.\nBut if the rift truly defied the system's rules... could it be different?\nIt was only speculation, but before he could think any further, the boy pressed him again.\n\"Is there really no way?\"\n\"Well... technically, there shouldn't be.\"\nSometimes, a little lie is necessary to keep someone going.\nBae Won-woo looked at the boy with eyes filled with pity. He was much better-looking than his own younger brother, though he was more bratty, but still, they were about the same age. It was hard not to soften at the thought of his brother. Hesitantly, he spoke carefully.\n\"...There was something a bit strange about the West Sea rift.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Hmm, do you know the difference between a dungeon and a rift?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then I should explain that first. It's basic knowledge for a hunter, so it'll be useful for you later.\"\nBae Won-woo picked up a thick stick and found a patch of ground where the grass hadn't grown too thick. He gestured for the boy to come closer, and the boy silently jumped down from the tree to join him. Bae Won-woo pulled out some of the low-growing weeds and drew two circles in the dirt, labeling one as \"dungeon\" and the other as \"rift.\"\n\"Dungeons and rifts are similar in that they both appear suddenly and contain unfamiliar ecosystems, worlds, and monsters, but there's a key difference. A dungeon can be left alone or destroyed, but a rift must be closed no matter what.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because if you leave it alone, it'll destroy everything around it. How can I explain this simply? Oh, I know.\"\nBae Won-woo, deep in thought, drew a house with a triangular roof.\n\"A dungeon is like a house. The monsters live in there, minding their own business, but eventually, they multiply, right? When the house is about to burst at the seams, the monsters can't take it anymore and burst out. That's a dungeon break.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Hunters are like the ones who manage traffic before the house bursts. Sort of like janitors. But in some houses, there's a fountain that spits out gems. And it even refills periodically. So, we take some of those gems, and keep working together for a long time.\"\n\"That's stealing.\"\n\"No, no. That's our reward.\"\n\"...\"\nThe boy looked at him incredulously as Bae Won-woo proudly continued. He drew lines outside the house, depicting something bursting out.\n\"And in some houses, instead of gems, there's a giant cockroach. Then you destroy that house. It's about making choices.\"\n\"...I get it.\"\n\"Good. But a rift isn't a house; it's more like... a hole.\"\n\"A hole?\"\nThe boy furrowed his brow. The stick traced a circle in the dirt, and then he shaded it in.\n\"Well, it's not an official entrance. It's more like a hole in a wall. Some people say it connects to another world, but that's too complicated for me.\"\nThe boy's gaze turned suspicious, but Bae Won-woo pretended not to notice.\n\"And if it were just a simple hole, it wouldn't be a problem, but it's more like a vacuum cleaner hole that sucks in everything around it. Some rifts, called gates, pour out monsters like water from a dam. But right now, we're talking about vacuum cleaner holes.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"If you leave it like that, everything near becomes a wasteland. So the goal is to close it as quickly as possible to minimize the damage. There's nothing to gain from it.\"\n\"How do you close it?\"\n\"By killing the rift's master and destroying the rift stone. That forces everything inside to be expelled. Even if it's just bodies. That's why I said there's no way anyone could have been stuck in a rift.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But...\"\nBae Won-woo drew a large circle in the dirt and labeled it \"West Sea,\" adding a question mark next to it.\n\"The West Sea rift was strange. As soon as J went in, the entrance disappeared, and not long after, the rift itself just collapsed. It vanished, just like that. And the people inside never came out...\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's why people say it defied the system's rules. It was something entirely different. Even its appearance was strange. It grew so rapidly and swallowed everything in its path, like no rift we'd ever seen before.\"\nThe boy stared at the crude drawing in the dirt, lost in thought. His fingers moved slightly, as if pondering something. Finally, he spoke slowly.\n\"What if it didn't completely collapse?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"You said it defied the system's rules. That rift.\"\nHis awkward pronunciation became clearer. In the dim dawn, in the light filtering through the forest, in the cool air and dew-covered grass, the boy's violet eyes gleamed with a strange intensity. An undefinable emotion flickered across his face. He stepped closer, standing over the drawing in the dirt. His full lips moved.\n\"What if the system... just decided to hide it?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Do you think it would just leave it alone... something that defied its own rules?\"\n\"...\"\n\"No, I don't think so...\"\nA slow smile spread across his face. The boy snatched the stick from Bae Won-woo's hand and stabbed it into the dirt circle. The sound of crickets stopped.\n\"It got rid of it. Because it was a nuisance.\"\n\"Well, maybe... maybe the system did destroy it?\"\n\"No...\"\nThe boy looked up at the sky. Dawn was breaking. The sky, starting to turn a deep shade of orange, had a black void in its center. The boy murmured,\n\"If the system was going to destroy it, it would have done so the moment it first appeared.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's still out there, somewhere. We just can't see it...\"\nIt sounded like a crazy story. But the boy...\n\"I just have a feeling that it's true.\"\nThe boy turned his gaze back to Bae Won-woo, his violet eyes narrowing slightly under his long lashes.\n\"Help me out.\"\nWith that, he suddenly turned and started walking. Bae Won-woo hurried to catch up.\n\"Well, I mean, sure, I'll help. But with what?\"\n\"Various things.\"\n\"What exactly are you planning to do?\"\nAt that question, the boy stopped walking.\n\"I'm going to make a map for someone who's lost.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"...You're a bit slow to understand.\"\nAfter pausing for a moment, the boy began to move again. His voice, full of intensity, whispered as he walked ahead.\n\"I'm going to find and open the West Sea rift.\"\n\"What? But...\"\nEven if the West Sea rift hadn't completely vanished, would the people inside still be alive? What if they managed to open it only to find corpses? Or worse, if they found nothing at all? Bae Won-woo hesitated, unable to voice his doubts. However,\n\"They're not dead.\"\nThe boy cut him off. The sky had turned a deep red. Somewhere, the wind began to blow. The boy's long hair, long enough to cover his neck, swayed in the breeze. A sweet scent filled the air.\n\"He couldn't be dead.\"\nThe boy muttered as if spitting out the words.\n\"Because he made a promise.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 123: Short\nJung Bin, having finished his long story, cleared his throat with a loud sound. His gentle gaze flicked to Cha Eui-jae's feet for a moment before quickly dropping away. The flickering streetlight above caused their shadows to pause in their movement. With a worried expression, Jung Bin asked,\n\"By the way, J, you didn't say much about it, but... are you really okay?\"\n\"Ah, I'm fine.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes, I'm aware, so don't worry about it.\"\nCha Eui-jae, shrugging indifferently, suddenly asked playfully,\n\"But, do you happen to know what happened to my assets? Were they confiscated by the government?\"\nIn the past, when he lived as J, most financial matters were handled by his aunt. It was necessary to avoid revealing his identity. He had never felt lacking in anything and hadn't paid much attention, as he didn't have much use for money.\nEven now, he didn't particularly need money. But he was curious. It had been eight years, after all.\nHowever, Jung Bin's answer was something he hadn't even considered.\n\"Ah, no. The Director has been keeping it safe. It's unprecedented, but... yes, it seems the Director managed to handle it somehow.\"\nJung Bin hesitated before carefully adding one more thing.\n\"The house where Hunter Park Hye-kyung lived was also purchased by the Director.\"\n\"...\"\nIt had been so long since he heard his aunt's name from someone else's lips. The name that had once been so familiar and dear to him now felt strangely foreign, a sensation that wasn't particularly pleasant. Cha Eui-jae abruptly changed the subject.\n\"Let's continue talking about Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"...Yes, understood.\"\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Jung Bin rubbed his fingertips together and began to speak.\n\"It's a difficult story to believe, reopening a closed rift. But when you consider what Lee Sa-young did afterward, he was probably serious.\"\n\"Did?\"\n\"Um, how should I put it...\"\nJung Bin, choosing his words carefully, sighed deeply before speaking.\n\"Yes, 'bulldozer' would be an accurate description.\"\nA bulldozer. It was a word that didn't suit Lee Sa-young at all, someone who always maintained a laid-back, languid demeanor. Cha Eui-jae tilted his head slightly.\n\"Was it really that much?\"\n\"Well, after Lee Sa-young appeared, the whole landscape of this world changed. If J, you, quelled the chaos... Lee Sa-young advanced what was stabilized. The Hunter system became more organized, and the power once concentrated in the Awakened Management Bureau started to shift towards the guilds, beginning with Lee Sa-young's arrival.\"\n\"...\"\n\"After finishing his ability control training in the ruins, Lee Sa-young returned to the headquarters for his rank assessment. Naturally, he was rated as an unquestionable S-grade.\"\nHe was the third S-grade to appear during the chaotic era following J's disappearance. Though it was kept secret that he had been in a research facility, it was inevitable that his striking appearance and dangerous abilities would attract attention.\nAnd he didn't seem burdened by that attention; instead, he accepted it as a matter of course. In fact, he wielded it skillfully.\n\"He revealed his name and face openly.\"\nLee Sa-young.\nPeople were captivated by the new S-grade Hunter who revealed his name and face. He was as capricious as he was powerful, but no one dared to criticize him because he filled the void left by J so effectively.\n\"As you may know, Hunter Song Jo-heon had left the Awakened Management Bureau by then and established Korea's first official guild, Samra Guild. Both he and the understaffed Bureau extended offers to Lee Sa-young, but, well.\"\nJung Bin chuckled awkwardly.\n\"He ignored them all.\"\nIt felt like the word \"completely\" was omitted but implied. Jung Bin and Cha Eui-jae both chose to overlook it. Cha Eui-jae recalled Lee Sa-young's impudent yet handsome face. Frankly, he was someone who would do such a thing. Even from what he'd heard about Lee Sa-young's past, he wasn't exactly well-mannered to begin with.\n'...No.'\nThe boy wrapped in bandages quietly took his place beside Lee Sa-young, who was smiling with the corners of his lips raised.\nEven when he could barely move, Lee Sa-young would say whatever he wanted, using just his fingers to gesture. He was headstrong, not necessarily rude... he was just doing his best, in his own way...\n'Oh no.'\nAt that moment, a realization struck Cha Eui-jae. From the moment they first met until now, the defiant, impudent, and exasperating Lee Sa-young had always conflicted with the obedient but strong-willed boy in his mind!\n'Damn it.'\nHis face behind the mask turned pale. It was as shocking as finding a tree branch sprouting where he had planted bean seeds.\nCould it be that he had grown up to be this way because he wasn't around during his formative years? As Cha Eui-jae shuddered at the sudden realization of the importance of parental guidance, Jung Bin continued to earnestly share more information.\n\"...Afterward, Lee Sa-young single-handedly dealt with countless dungeons and rifts, and when he had gathered enough funds, he founded the Pado Guild. He even scouted Hunter Bae Won-woo. I was also offered a position at the time, but...\"\nJung Bin trailed off. Cha Eui-jae, who had barely regained his composure, responded.\n\"You must have refused, seeing as you're still in the Bureau.\"\n\"Yes. Um, not to overestimate myself, but... I felt there needed to be someone strong in the Awakened Management Bureau to maintain balance.\"\nJung Bin rubbed his lips.\n\"In any case... Pado Guild quickly expanded its influence. Although they had few Hunters, they ran an extensive research team and invested heavily in it.\"\n\"When you say 'heavily,' how much are we talking about?\"\n\"There's a joke that they spent all the money they earned from clearing dungeons and rifts on research, so they ended up with nothing left. And as you know, before that, survival was the priority, so there hadn't been much room for serious research.\"\n\"That's true.\"\nThey were days when even surviving was a struggle. Rifts and dungeons appeared unpredictably, spewing out monsters no one had ever seen before. The world was one where everyone was simply struggling to survive.\nJung Bin cautiously continued.\n\"But after the West Sea rift was closed, everything... strangely quieted down. All of it. The frequency of rifts appearing decreased dramatically compared to before. That must have made the research easier as well.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The research from that time became the driving force that led to Pado Guild being recognized as one of Korea's top three guilds. And as a reward for that...\"\nCha Eui-jae looked up, sensing Jung Bin's gaze. Jung Bin was looking at him with a thoughtful expression. His lips moved slightly.\n\"Lee Sa-young received the ownership of the West Sea rift from the government.\"\n\"...Is that even possible?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened in disbelief. A firm expression settled on Jung Bin's gentle face as he spoke decisively.\n\"Yes, the Pado Guild has been managing the West Sea rift and the surrounding area ever since. Even now.\"\nThe streetlight flickered erratically. With his hands thrust into his jacket pockets, Cha Eui-jae silently pondered.\nThe boy, Lee Sa-young, was taken to the Prometheus research facility after J's death and awakened there.\nWho, how, and why? What had happened to Lee Sa-young during that one year? The research facility where he had been was melted down, and even Jung Bin, who knew the most, was unaware of what happened during that one-year gap.\nOnly Lee Sa-young would know.\n'I need to have a proper conversation with him...'\nIn the end, the key to the story lay with Lee Sa-young.\nHe wanted to know everything. He needed to know everything. All that had happened while he was gone. All the things he had to make amends for. Everything Lee Sa-young had endured alone. He knew he couldn't possibly make up for that time or dare to console him.\nAnd...\nCha Eui-jae bit his lip. No matter how hard he tried to calm himself, the turmoil in his chest that had been simmering throughout the long story refused to settle.\nWas it anger, sorrow, or perhaps...\nA pale face came to mind. A place where white ashes were falling, the ground trembling precariously, and Lee Sa-young stood with his back to the crumbling ruins. His eyes shone brightly as he spat out a single sentence.\n\"What if I said I've been waiting for you?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had received the ownership of the West Sea rift from the government. Lee Sa-young, who had sought to reopen the West Sea rift that had closed without a trace.\nWhy on earth?\n\"I'm going to make a map for someone who's lost.\"\nCha Eui-jae steadied his trembling arm. He thought everyone had forgotten him. After all, he was supposed to be a dead man.\nFrom the moment he woke up in a pile of trash and realized he was already dead in this world, to the moment he rescued people from the rift and resolved to move forward. An anxiety, like that of someone who had arrived uninvited, had taken root in a corner of his heart. But...\n\"I'll be back.\"\nExcept for one person.\n\"Will you wait for me?\"\nWho didn't believe in his death and had kept waiting for him.\n\"...\"\nIf he had kept that selfish promise.\nAt that moment, slow footsteps echoed across the green floor of the playground. A lazy voice, tinged with laughter, said,\n\"You two seem pretty close.\"\nJung Bin rubbed his forehead with a troubled expression. The footsteps stopped right behind Cha Eui-jae. An arm reached out without hesitation, coiling around Cha Eui-jae's shoulder like a snake. Soft hair brushed against his ear and cheek. A firm chin rested on the other shoulder, and a low voice rumbled.\n\"Are you two having a secret meeting or something?\"\nGloved fingers playfully brushed Cha Eui-jae's cheek before withdrawing. Standing upright, Lee Sa-young tilted his head.\n\"But... for a secret meeting spot, this place is pretty childish.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 124: Short\nA look of sudden fatigue appeared on Jung Bin's face. He seemed to have a lot to say, but he tried his best to come up with a moderate response.\n\"A secret meeting? Anyone who hears that might misunderstand.\"\n\"If it's not a secret meeting...\"\nThe hand that was wrapped around Cha Eui-jae's shoulder tightened slightly.\n\"...then what could two people possibly be doing alone at this late hour?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Did you talk bad about me or something?\"\nCha Eui-jae knew from experience that if he let this continue, Lee Sa-young would definitely lose his temper. He couldn't let that happen— he still had things to hear from Jung Bin! Urgently, Cha Eui-jae grabbed the hand that was wrapped around his shoulder. The black-gloved fingers flinched slightly. Cha Eui-jae, with difficulty, called out his name.\n\"Lee... Lee Sa-young?\"\n'Shit.'\nHis voice came out more strained than he expected. It was hard to act like usual after realizing that Lee Sa-young was the boy he had been looking for, and that he had kept the selfish promise even after coming back from the brink of death. All his past experience seemed useless in front of Lee Sa-young.\nHowever, Lee Sa-young, who had been called by name, responded as if he had been waiting for it, moving his body slightly. He raised the corners of his lips like a satisfied cat and tilted his head.\n\"Mmm... Why?\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae didn't respond, Lee Sa-young playfully tapped his shoulder with his gloved fingers.\n\"If you call me, you should say something, J.\"\n\"I contacted Jung Bin first because I had something to ask. So, stop talking nonsense... no.\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae tried to speak harshly as usual, the image of young Lee Sa-young lying bandaged up flashed before his eyes, and he trailed off awkwardly. Instead, he adjusted the mask that had been slightly lifted by the fingers that had slipped under it.\n\"Aha...\"\nDrawing out the last syllable, Lee Sa-young asked in a voice laced with amusement.\n\"Is it something you can't ask me?\"\nCha Eui-jae had a lot to say about that. After all, who was it that always evaded questions like a slippery eel? Cha Eui-jae pinched Lee Sa-young's fingers tightly.\n\"You, damn it, you never answer when I ask. You think I don't notice how you always dodge the question?\"\n\"Because it's something you don't need to know. And do you think Jung Bin would give you a straight answer? He's even better at dodging questions than I am.\"\n\"He gave me a good answer, though? We were close back in the day. We had camaraderie. Right?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, yes, of course. We were comrades.\"\nCaught off guard while watching the two of them talk, Jung Bin hastily answered. Lee Sa-young's voice dropped ominously.\n\"Oh... really?\"\nJung Bin quickly changed the subject.\n\"By the way, Lee Sa-young-ssi, you arrived much sooner than expected. Were you nearby?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young narrowed his eyes instead of answering, as if to say, 'You think I'll fall for that weak trick?' At that moment, Cha Eui-jae quickly joined Jung Bin in asking.\n\"I'm curious about that too.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Are you not going to answer?\"\n\"...No.\"\nFinally responding briefly, Lee Sa-young gestured behind him. Near the entrance to the playground, Cha Eui-jae noticed a familiar wooden door. He hadn't noticed it, overshadowed by Lee Sa-young's presence.\nThe owner of the door, Romantic Opener, was slumped on the seesaw, looking like a soaked sponge. His fingers twitched sporadically, as if to signal that he was still alive. Next to him, a squeaking sound echoed ominously.\n\"...\"\nThe source of the sound was a pig-shaped spring rider. The flickering streetlight illuminated the bouncing rider and the person perched on it. The lenses of a pair of sunglasses glinted.\nPerched precariously on the small, narrow rider, A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi bowed his head.\n\"Greetings, customer.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hmm, the spring seems to be rusty. I'll need to remove the rust and apply some lubricant. The streetlight is flickering too. It's not a suitable environment for the children who are the future of our country to play in.\"\nSeo Min-gi jumped lightly off the rider, pulled out a nitrile glove and began inspecting the spring with a flashlight. The rusty spring creaked and groaned.\nCha Eui-jae looked down at his feet awkwardly. Though their shadows overlapped, they were still. Normally, shadows don't move on their own, but when Seo Min-gi was inside, the shadow would sometimes move differently from its owner. Jung Bin muttered.\n\"I knew you were in the shadow, but I didn't expect you to bring everyone along.\"\nBoth Jung Bin and Cha Eui-jae had noticed but pretended not to. Seo Min-gi replied earnestly.\n\"I was just watching. The Guild Leader dragged everyone here.\"\n\"Yeah, that's right.\"\nLee Sa-young chimed in casually.\n\"Not only were J and Jung Bin meeting secretly... they were talking about me.\"\n'So you were pretending not to know while asking?'\n\"I was curious, so I just had to come... at this hour.\"\nLee Sa-young emphasized \"this hour.\" Cha Eui-jae glanced sympathetically at Romantic Opener, who was slumped on the seesaw. The playground wasn't far from the Pado Guild building, close enough for hunters and even ordinary people to walk to. And yet, to get here quickly, Lee Sa-young had knocked someone out.\n'Isn't that a waste of manpower...?'\n\"Blagh.\"\nAt that moment, Romantic Opener let out a groan and slumped further. The dark wooden door slowly disappeared. As the creaking of the rusty spring continued, Lee Sa-young leaned his head against Cha Eui-jae's, whispering softly.\n\"So... did you hear everything you were curious about?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't answer. Lee Sa-young didn't seem to expect one, as he turned his attention to Jung Bin.\n\"And you.\"\n\"Yes, Lee Sa-young-ssi.\"\n\"Weren't the details of my awakening classified? Since when did you start speaking so freely?\"\n\"It is classified. However, I judged it was appropriate to tell J.\"\nStanding up straight, Jung Bin met Lee Sa-young's gaze without flinching. He spoke firmly but gently.\n\"I'm in a position where I can make such discretionary decisions.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head skeptically. Jung Bin, with a soft smile, held his gaze. Finally, Lee Sa-young's eyes curved into a grin.\n\"Seeing the distance between you two... it seems my judgment wasn't wrong. You seem quite close. I don't know when, where, or how you became close.\"\n\"...\"\nThe black hand on Cha Eui-jae's shoulder tightened. Jung Bin continued in a relaxed tone.\n\"Well, I'm sure there are things between you two that I'm not aware of, just as there are secrets you haven't told J.\"\n\"That's enough.\"\nLee Sa-young growled lowly. Jung Bin shrugged.\n\"But I've learned that having too many secrets isn't good. I'd recommend opening up a bit more.\"\n\"Why don't you just leave?\"\n\"I was planning to. Well then... I believe your questions are answered.\"\nBzzz... a long vibration rang out. Jung Bin pulled out his phone, checked the screen, and let out a small sigh.\n\"...It seems you've created more work for me, Lee Sa-young.\"\nLee Sa-young replied coldly.\n\"You should be diligent. You're a public servant, after all.\"\n\"I was going to handle it anyway... Should I thank you?\"\nJung Bin rubbed his face briefly before looking up to meet J's gaze. Lee Sa-young stepped forward, as if to shield J. Jung Bin smiled wryly but addressed Cha Eui-jae with a gentle tone.\n\"J.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I should say this now.\"\nClearing his throat, Jung Bin spoke firmly.\n\"I'm really glad you're back.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you ever need anything, feel free to contact me. I'll do my best to cooperate.\"\nIt was the moment when a former comrade became a current one. Cha Eui-jae was about to say something when Lee Sa-young cut in coldly.\n\"That's enough. Leave.\"\n\"Yes, yes. I have to deal with the task Lee Sa-young has given me. I'll be off then.\"\nJung Bin bowed politely, then said goodbye to Romantic Opener, who was still slumped on the seesaw, and Seo Min-gi, who was still repairing the spring rider. As he left the playground, his figure seemed much stronger than the weary image Cha Eui-jae remembered from the past. His back looked far more resolute.\nAfter Jung Bin's presence had completely faded, Lee Sa-young spoke with a sullen face.\n\"Hyung...\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"I think you like me more than I thought.\"\n\"What?\"\nCha Eui-jae stared at Lee Sa-young with wide eyes. Lee Sa-young grinned and reached out to adjust the black mask.\n\"I didn't expect you to contact Jung Bin right away...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 125: Short\n\"Hey... why would that mean I like you, no, wait...\"\nCha Eui-jae swiftly swallowed the curse that was about to escape. He wanted to treat Lee Sa-young as kindly as possible, but it was proving difficult. Lee Sa-young, who had stepped forward to face Cha Eui-jae, blinked and tilted his head slightly.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Move your... face out of the way.\"\n\"Do you not like me?\"\nHis long eyelashes fluttered. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth. In his mind, the rude Lee Sa-young and the kind bandaged boy were clashing violently. He knew they were the same person, that Lee Sa-young had gone through many things, and had waited a long time for his return. He was grateful and touched by the promise kept without any certainty. But...\n'Lee Sa-young's first impression... was not great.'\nThe memory that floated to the surface was of Lee Sa-young in a gas mask, beating up people in an alleyway. Not to mention the image of him flipping his middle finger with attitude, persistently following him.\n'This is why they say first impressions are important...'\nCha Eui-jae looked at Lee Sa-young with an ambiguous expression. Of course, he wasn't looking too good back then either, so their first impressions of each other must have been equally terrible. A meeting of crazy people, perhaps. Cha Eui-jae found himself starting to self-reflect. And then,\nWhen no answer came, Lee Sa-young's lips twisted slightly. He murmured in a gloomy tone.\n\"No answer, huh...\"\n\"No, I do like you. Of course I like you.\"\nIt was a response that came out mechanically, like a customer service line. Of course, there was no way Lee Sa-young would be satisfied with such a robotic answer. He glared at Cha Eui-jae with a defiant posture.\nBut with the mindset of a well-meaning part-timer like Cha Eui-jae, there was no way he could keep up with Lee Sa-young's logical leaps. Lee Sa-young was someone who, with a single word, could completely disorient a long-awaited reunion with an old colleague.\n'Damn, he really is multi-talented.'\nAlright, let's calm down. Cha Eui-jae took a short, deep breath. This was the boy he had been searching for. He must have gone through a lot of tough times. Cha Eui-jae decided to exercise a little patience. He grabbed Lee Sa-young's black hand, which was fidgeting with his mask, and asked a question, doing his best to soften it.\n\"What kind of thought process leads to that conclusion?\"\nOf course, despite his efforts, it didn't soften much.\n\"Huh? Ah...\"\nLee Sa-young withdrew his glaring gaze and shrugged his shoulders.\n\"You didn't plan on meeting Jung Bin like this, did you? Even if you did, it wouldn't have been now, right?\"\nThat was true. If Lee Sa-young hadn't been avoiding conversations like a slippery fish, he wouldn't have had to face Jung Bin alone. He would have gone to see him after more time had passed. Lee Sa-young slowly continued speaking.\n\"But despite that, you went out of your way to contact Jung Bin, and not just for any reason... you asked about me.\"\nHis violet eyes stared intently at Cha Eui-jae. Then, his eyes narrowed into a sly smile.\n\"That means you were curious about me. Right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"And that curiosity came from interest...\"\nLee Sa-young slightly tilted his chin up as if to say, \"Am I right?\" He looked like a cat proudly showing off a prey it had caught. Cha Eui-jae lightly patted him on the back, then clasped his hands behind his back.\n\"Yeah, well... let's say that's true. And also...\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced behind Lee Sa-young. The creaking sound of the spring had quieted down. It seemed that the repairs had been successfully completed, and Seo Min-gi was now lounging on the pig-shaped rocking horse, tapping away on his phone. Sensing the gaze, Seo Min-gi looked up, and their eyes met.\n\"Oh.\"\nSeo Min-gi let out a short exclamation and pulled out a pair of headphones from his inventory, putting them on. He nodded slightly.\n\"Think of me as if I'm not here and continue your conversation. I'm about to embark on a journey into the world of rock.\"\n\"Ah, yes. Please go ahead.\"\n\"Then I'll see you later. If you have any instructions, please contact me via phone.\"\n\"Alright. You can go.\"\n\"By the way, just so you know, dear customer, Romantic Opener is completely knocked out, so you don't have to worry about him. See you.\"\nAs if to prove his words true, Seo Min-gi started nodding his head rhythmically to the music. Soon, he seemed to melt into the shadows. Romantic Opener was left slumped over on the seesaw. He looked so lifeless that one might have thought he was dead, but the steady rise and fall of his back indicated he was still alive.\n'...Yeah, if he's knocked out, I guess it doesn't matter.'\nCha Eui-jae turned his gaze away, pretending not to see, and looked at Lee Sa-young again. Lee Sa-young still hadn't taken his eyes off him. When their eyes met, a smile appeared on his delicate face.\nAfter choosing his words carefully, Cha Eui-jae let out a deep sigh.\n'As expected, I'm no good at beating around the bush.'\nIn the end, he decided to be straightforward.\n\"Let's just talk openly. Every time I ask you something, you dodge the question, and we're not getting anywhere.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't avoid it this time.\"\nLee Sa-young didn't respond. The shadows on his face shifted with every flicker of the streetlight. The orange glow of the streetlamp flared for a moment, deepening the shadows. The shaded, handsome face took on a somber hue. Cha Eui-jae slowly continued speaking.\n\"Jung Bin gave me a rough idea, Lee Sa-young, from the moment you awakened until now. But there are things that only you know.\"\nLee Sa-young, despite having dodged conversations before, nodded calmly.\n\"Well... that's true.\"\n\"We have a lot to talk about. There's a lot I want to say, and a lot I need to hear.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Tell me everything that happened to you after I went into the rift.\"\nIf Lee Sa-young had been waiting for Cha Eui-jae all this time.\nHe wanted to hear everything that had happened. He wanted to know all about the past eight years he hadn't been there for. He wanted to share the burden and pain that Lee Sa-young had carried alone, hoping it might serve as a small atonement for not being there to protect him.\nBut Lee Sa-young...\n\"Why?\"\n\"What?\"\nLee Sa-young's expression was genuinely puzzled.\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. It was an entirely unexpected response. Lee Sa-young, with his arms crossed, stared at Cha Eui-jae intently. His eyes narrowed. Then he sighed lightly and tapped his arm with his fingers.\n\"I expected this from you, Hyung, but...\"\n\"...\"\n\"But actually seeing it happen...\"\nLee Sa-young muttered, deep in thought.\n\"It doesn't feel good.\"\nWhy?\nHis chest tightened. Cha Eui-jae had heard plenty of insults to his face and behind his back, but this wasn't harsh at all, and yet his heart sank like a stone. Unable to overcome the mysterious emotion, Cha Eui-jae clenched his fist. His short nails dug into his palm.\nLee Sa-young slowly began to speak.\n\"If you had told me to listen to your story... I would have gladly listened.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I would've liked it. I'm curious about the time you spent in the rift.\"\n\"But then why...\"\nThe words slipped out before he could stop them. Lee Sa-young raised an eyebrow.\n\"Let me ask you something instead.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"Why are you curious about my past? I'm not being sarcastic; I really want to know the reason.\"\nLee Sa-young spread his arms wide.\n\"The person you were looking for is right in front of you.\"\n\"Well...\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been dragged into Prometheus' research facility during the time Cha Eui-jae was in the West Sea rift. They must have subjected Lee Sa-young to all sorts of experiments to turn him into an artificial awakener. Even the files from the Odaesan research facility gave him a rough idea of the kind of experiments he must have undergone.\nIt was unforgivable.\nCha Eui-jae opened his mouth to speak.\n\"While I was in the West Sea rift...\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Sa-young cut him off firmly.\n\"That premise is wrong.\"\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\"\nCha Eui-jae snapped back sharply. Lee Sa-young ran his fingers through his hair, exposing his pale forehead through his parted bangs. He muttered almost to himself.\n\"I knew it would come to this...\"\n\"Speak clearly. Don't beat around the bush.\"\n\"My past isn't something you need to worry about, Hyung.\"\nIt was an absurd claim. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth. And then, spitting the words out one by one, he asked.\n\"Why isn't it something I should care about? While I wasn't there, you...\"\n\"It's something that happened a long time ago...\"\nLee Sa-young took a step closer. His black hand reached out as if to cover Cha Eui-jae's face. Cha Eui-jae neither pushed the hand away nor dodged it. His body instinctively knew that the hand posed no threat to him. The hand gently removed the mask. Now, their eyes met with nothing between them. Lee Sa-young's lips parted slightly.\n\"It's not something you need to take responsibility for. I told you that in the dungeon too.\"\nIn the shaking and crumbling dungeon, what had Lee Sa-young said back then? Fortunately, it came to him quickly.\n\"You act as if you have to take responsibility for everything and solve all problems by yourself.\"\nBut this is different, isn't it? Cha Eui-jae muttered only to himself. Lee Sa-young was Cha Eui-jae's only success. The person he had saved, the person he had kept alive. The one he had resolved to protect, no matter what.\nA special person.\n\"You're telling me not to take responsibility for you? When I...\"\nOnly now could he understand the nature of the strange emotion he was feeling. Cha Eui-jae was...\n\"For you...\"\nHe was hurt.\nThen, a black hand gently cupped Cha Eui-jae's cheek.\n\"It's really nice that you think about me and are curious about me, but...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I don't want that to turn into a responsibility.\"\nA soft voice whispered.\n\"A relationship where one person takes responsibility for the other isn't equal, is it?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I want an equal relationship, J.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 126: Short\n\"I want an equal relationship, J.\"\nCha Eui-jae frowned.\n\"An equal relationship?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLee Sa-young nodded lightly. His thumb gently brushed under Cha Eui-jae's eyes as if telling him not to frown, then let go. Cha Eui-jae bit the inside of his mouth.\nEven if he understood the meaning of the words, there were still things that didn't resonate with him. An equal relationship. To Cha Eui-jae, that phrase didn't sit well. For him, taking responsibility for Lee Sa-young was a given. He had saved him, revived him, and failed to save him once again...\n'But why does Lee Sa-young...'\nHis thoughts were abruptly interrupted. Noticing Cha Eui-jae's expression, Lee Sa-young spoke softly, as if to soothe him.\n\"Even if I explained it in detail here... it probably wouldn't resonate with you.\"\nThough it was the first time hearing this tone from Lee Sa-young, it felt strangely familiar. Cha Eui-jae, even in his dazed state, quickly found the answer. It was similar to the tone he used when dealing with the bandaged boy.\n\"You've lived half your life like that, thinking it was only natural, so of course, it's hard for you to understand.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So think about it yourself. What kind of equal relationship I want, and why I want it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"When you find your answer, I'll tell you.\"\nLee Sa-young emphasized his last words.\n\"I'll tell you directly.\"\nAfter finishing his sentence, he extended his pinky finger. Cha Eui-jae stared blankly at the black finger. The boy, Lee Sa-young, who once struggled to intertwine his finger with Cha Eui-jae's, despite his weak fingers. Cha Eui-jae hesitated but eventually touched his pinky finger to Lee Sa-young's. The familiar sensation of warm leather met his skin.\nLee Sa-young, who had entwined their fingers quickly, added in an annoyed voice.\n\"Until you find your answer, don't think about asking someone like Jung Bin. As you said, the one who can best tell you about me is me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You should answer.\"\n\"...Alright.\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded slowly. Lee Sa-young's violet eyes, which had been watching him suspiciously, narrowed into a slight smile.\n\"Oh, by the way...\"\n\"...Yeah?\"\n\"Do you even know what an equal relationship is? You might not. I understand.\"\n\"This guy...\"\nCha Eui-jae instinctively spat out the rough words and swallowed hard. The moment those rude words left his lips, the feeling of bitterness that had been weighing him down vanished, and a surge of emotion welled up in him. This wasn't an unconscious reaction. It was a conditioned reflex he had developed after his time with Lee Sa-young post-escape from the West Sea rift!\nHow frightening are human habits? Even when he consciously tried to be kind, Cha Eui-jae's body operated based on the accumulated data from their past. Moreover, in his mind, the bandaged boy and the smirking Lee Sa-young were still tilting their heads side by side.\nLee Sa-young raised the corners of his lips.\n\"Oh... 'this guy'?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Isn't it strange...? Wasn't I supposed to be your 'only success'?\"\n\"...\"\nThere was no room for excuses. How could it be so difficult to be kind? Cha Eui-jae's head slowly lowered to the floor. He tried to distract himself by searching for an ant crawling on the ground with his widened eyes, but it was in vain. Only a few lonely blades of grass were swaying pathetically among the soft floorboards.\nLee Sa-young, who had been watching Cha Eui-jae's round crown, asked in a voice tinged with laughter.\n\"Oh... is it a new nickname?\"\n\"...Sa-young.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nLee Sa-young stifled a laugh with his hand, but soon he leaned back and burst out laughing.\n\"Hahaha!\"\nAt the sound, Seo Min-gi, who had vanished into the shadows, reappeared, peeking out and staring at them. His eyes, hidden behind his sunglasses, were wide open in surprise. It seemed that Lee Sa-young laughing out loud was a rare occurrence. But Cha Eui-jae didn't care.\n'Look away.'\nCha Eui-jae tilted his head slightly to the side. Seo Min-gi obediently turned his head. Meanwhile, Lee Sa-young was still laughing out loud. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and whispered.\n\"Hey, stop laughing.\"\n\"Haha... Are you trying to make an effort right now?\"\nCha Eui-jae responded calmly but seriously.\n\"I'm really trying, so stop interrupting. Let me try to be kind.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nLee Sa-young, who was trying to stop laughing, took a deep breath and snickered. His voice, still tinged with amusement, asked.\n\"Confused?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't answer. Lee Sa-young smirked knowingly.\nThe time he spent with the boy he had saved was so precious that he would never forget it. He had endured a long time just with those memories. However...\n\"Hyung.\"\nCha Eui-jae's life was split in two by the great wall known as the West Sea rift. Before the wall, he had lived with his aunt and the bandaged boy; after the wall, he lived with his grandmother, Park Ha-eun, and Lee Sa-young.\nCha Eui-jae opened his palm. The scar that remained like a fine crack shimmered with a soft golden light. The moment he cut his palm with a dagger was still vividly etched in his memory.\nFrom the moment he first faced Lee Sa-young after escaping the rift until now, he had spent a considerable amount of time with him. So much so that it was impossible to describe that time without mentioning him.\nHe knew well that the bandaged boy and Lee Sa-young were the same person. However...\nLee Sa-young's thick lips curved into a smile. His lazy voice whispered.\n\"You know it's the same person, you're grateful he's alive, you feel sorry for him, and now that you know, it's hard to treat him the same as before... So you want to treat him well, but it's not working out.\"\nEach word pierced Cha Eui-jae like a dagger.\n\"Well... I had acted pretty nicely before.\"\nLee Sa-young's violet eyes, devoid of light, stared at Cha Eui-jae. He spoke playfully but sharply.\n\"Yet, you're not even ready, Hyung.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You haven't even decided how you should treat me... so what are you going to do?\"\nCha Eui-jae let out a short sigh. Lee Sa-young was right. From the moment he suddenly realized that Lee Sa-young was the bandaged boy until now, he hadn't looked back at his own emotions. He had only been running around trying to learn about Lee Sa-young's hardships and his past. Ignoring the subtle sense of dissonance that gnawed at him.\nLee Sa-young, with a mask in his hand, crossed his arms.\n\"If you're only moving out of guilt, then stop.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It would be wiser to spend that time thinking about the task I gave you.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been standing still listening to his words, snatched the mask from Lee Sa-young's hand and put it on his face. The slightly twisted expression on his face disappeared behind the black mask. His altered voice grumbled.\n\"You're so disrespectful to Hyung.\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head.\n\"So, do you dislike it?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't answer. Instead, he suddenly reached out and tousled Lee Sa-young's hair. Lee Sa-young, who let out a short, annoyed sound, glared at him.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"I don't dislike you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"How could I dislike you?\"\nLee Sa-young slightly opened his mouth. His violet eyes widened. Cha Eui-jae scratched his head awkwardly and turned around abruptly.\n\"Fuck it... I'm leaving.\"\n\"...Wait, Hyung!\"\nThe moment Lee Sa-young reached out his hand, the wind blew. A low voice mingled with the wind.\n\"I'll think about what you said.\"\nThe wind died down. By then, Cha Eui-jae had already vanished. Lee Sa-young, staring blankly at the empty playground, clenched his fist. At that moment, he heard rustling sounds from behind.\n\"Guild leader.\"\nSeo Min-gi approached with his headphones around his neck. Lee Sa-young glanced back at him. Romantic Opener was still draped over the seesaw like a half-dried squid.\nSeo Min-gi stood two steps behind Lee Sa-young and cautiously asked.\n\"Are you sure it's okay to let him go? Based on our experience so far, it doesn't seem like just talking will make him stop. I'm worried he might head to another lab or something...\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Sa-young's foot came to a sudden halt. The streetlight that had been flickering finally went out. His lips curled up in the darkness.\n\"He won't be able to move. Not for a while...\"\n\"Pardon? Why...\"\n\"Because he made a promise.\"\nLee Sa-young slowly began walking again. Seo Min-gi snapped his fingers, and the shadow under the seesaw gathered into the shape of a small person. It then began dragging the unconscious Romantic Opener along.\n\"He'll be too busy thinking about me.\"\n\"Is there even an answer to that problem?\"\n\"Who knows...\"\nLee Sa-young stuck out his black tongue and lightly bit its tip. It was a playful gesture.\n\"I think it's only fair to cause a bit of trouble.\"\n\"Yes, well. I doubt our customer would agree, though.\"\nSeo Min-gi let out a short sigh. As they approached the exit of the playground, Lee Sa-young suddenly spoke up.\n\"I do regret it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If I had known he was J... I wouldn't have let him get close.\"\nHis sighing voice faded into the wind. Soon, the three figures melted into the shadows and disappeared.",

      "content": "Chapter 127: Watching From the Gaps\nThe white ash drifted like snow.\n\"...\"\nA stillness as if even the air had stopped. Her tangled brown hair fluttered messily. The girl in the school uniform, Yoon Ga-eul, looked around. The familiar sight of ruins greeted her.\nYoon Ga-eul checked her outstretched hands. Both were glowing with a rainbow light. Her face flushed with panic as she quickly patted down her body.\n\"...What the hell?\"\nJust moments ago, she had been in the classroom, attending a lecture. Yoon Ga-eul frantically surveyed her surroundings. A space utterly silent, devoid of any sign of life. A place where destruction had arrived. It was a landscape she had seen countless times as she traveled through the fragments of worlds.\nBut something was wrong. Until now, Yoon Ga-eul had only seen these fragments when she fell asleep on her bed. She had never experienced it while dozing off or taking a short nap at school. So then...\n'Why am I here?'\nA side effect of her ability? A new power? Or perhaps her control over the ability had slipped? Every possibility that came to mind was the worst-case scenario. Cold sweat broke out. Eventually, Yoon Ga-eul slapped her cheeks with both hands. The sharp sting helped her regain her focus.\n'...Calm down. Think.'\nYoon Ga-eul pulled out the necklace hidden under her shirt. Attached to it was a white shard and a name tag with \"HYS\" written on it.\nYoon Ga-eul clenched the shard tightly. A few black tendrils of light coiled around the white shard like snakes. It was a fragment she had brought out from the eroded dungeon.\nA fragment shard from the body of a golem in a suddenly reconstructed eroded dungeon. It was the first time she had found a shard in reality, not in a dream. Normally, she would have reported it to Jung Bin immediately upon acquiring it, but Jung Bin had lost consciousness after suffering severe injuries while protecting them... Yoon Ga-eul bit her lip awkwardly.\n'I've ended up not saying anything until now... I'm really sorry.'\nThe only difference between then and now was this shard. Perhaps the cause of this situation and the hint to escape this place lay in the shard.\n'Staying here any longer could be dangerous.'\nThe place she had been was her school. She couldn't let her friends get caught up in something strange. Yoon Ga-eul took a deep breath and squeezed the shard in her hand. The shard was enveloped in a radiant light like mother-of-pearl. And in the next moment,\nKKIEEKKK!\nSomething pure white shot up from the ground and enveloped her whole body.\n\"Ahh!\"\nYoon Ga-eul screamed as she stumbled backward. The white ash, piled like snow, hungrily devoured the sound of her footsteps. The white substance was tightening around her body. She began to suffocate. Yoon Ga-eul tightly shut her eyes and opened her mouth wide.\n\"Help...!\"\nIt was then.\nA cold hand gripped Yoon Ga-eul's neck. Damn it, I'm going to die like this. Yoon Ga-eul gritted her teeth. But instead, she found it easier to breathe. As she slowly opened her blurry eyes, she saw something black standing before her, starkly out of place in this world of pure white ruins.\nYoon Ga-eul strained to move her eyes. The thing gripping her neck was an eerily black hand. Not just the hand, but the wrist connected to it— everything was pitch black. The white substance that had risen from the ground now whimpered as if it had never been there.\n'It' spoke.\n—Look at me.\n\"...\"\n—Look at me.\n\"...\"\n—Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"Yoon Ga-eul!!\"\nCrash! The sound of something breaking echoed loudly. Yoon Ga-eul gasped for breath as she quickly sat up. She was back in the familiar classroom. With a dazed expression, Yoon Ga-eul looked around. Her friend, Da-yeon, was staring at her with a startled face.\n\"What happened... Are you mad?\"\n\"Huh? What?\"\n\"Are you mad because I yelled in your ear?\"\n\"Yelled? You yelled?\"\n\"What... You dropped your study book.\"\nAh. Yoon Ga-eul, still in a daze, picked up the fallen [Complete Study Guide for CSAT] from the floor. The crashing sound must have been from the book and her pencil case falling. Da-yeon asked with a worried look.\n\"You've been acting weird lately. Is something wrong?\"\n\"Huh? No... nothing's wrong.\"\n\"Is it something you can't tell your friend?\"\n\"No, really, it's nothing. I'm fine.\"\n\"Then why do you keep... You know your eyes have been looking a bit strange lately, right?\"\nDa-yeon mumbled with a frown.\n\"Sometimes, you look at us like you're seeing a dead person.\"\n\"What are you talking about...\"\nYoon Ga-eul brushed off the comment and looked around.\nThere was no one else in the classroom except for the two of them. She glanced at the clock. It was already ten minutes past lunchtime. Normally, they would have rushed to the cafeteria as soon as the bell rang!\nYoon Ga-eul tidied her fallen hair and asked.\n\"Why are you still here? Aren't you going to eat?\"\nDa-yeon sighed and propped her chin on her hand.\n\"You were lying there like someone who'd taken some bad drugs, so where would I go? And today's lunch menu wasn't great anyway. The teachers have been cracking down on deliveries... Min-ji and Su-yeong went to the snack shop, but they'll be back soon.\"\n\"Why just those two?\"\n\"They lost at rock-paper-scissors.\"\nJust then, the front door of the classroom swung open. Two girls, their arms full of drinks and snacks, grumbled as they walked in.\n\"Everyone must be thinking the same thing. The snack shop was so packed, it was crazy.\"\n\"The pizza bread was already gone.\"\nDa-yeon looked impressed.\n\"Are you guys hunters? That was fast.\"\n\"Yeah~ I'm going to take the hunter exam and join the Pado Guild.\"\n\"I'm going to join HB Guild. Oh, Yoon Ga-eul is up?\"\n\"Are you okay? You were sleeping like the dead. Good thing it was during the homeroom period.\"\nMin-ji, who had been observing Yoon Ga-eul's face, handed her a bag of bread. It was the hamburger bread Yoon Ga-eul often ate. Wisps of white steam rose from the small tear in the bag. Yoon Ga-eul smiled as she took the bread. It was warm.\nShe wasn't even sure if she was smiling properly. Judging by her friends' unchanged expressions, she could only guess that she was. She forced her stiff mouth to move.\n\"Thanks.\"\n\"Come on, you need to put more feeling into it when you say thanks.\"\n\"Leave her alone, she's not feeling well.\"\n\"Shouldn't you go to the nurse's office?\"\n\"What's the next class?\"\n\"No idea.\"\n\"Do you even know anything?\"\nHer friends' friendly chatter, the sound of laughter, and the gentle breeze seeping through the slightly open window. Yoon Ga-eul let out a silent sigh of relief. She then carefully tore open the warm bread bag.\nIt was at that moment.\n\"...But Ga-eul.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\nYoon Ga-eul looked up. Su-yeong was staring at her with a strange expression.\n\"What's that on your arm under your sleeve?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I mean, there's a strange mark...\"\n\"...\"\nYoon Ga-eul hurriedly rolled up the sleeve of her school shirt.\nA red mark, as if something had bound her wrist, was visible.\nThud.\nAh!\nCold sweat trickled down her face.\n'No.'\nThe familiar scene in front of her was starting to blur. The classroom and her friends' faces began to shift into shades of green, orange, blue, red, yellow, and white. Her friends' faces split into many. Two, four, eight, sixteen...\nThe bread she held slipped from her hands and fell to the ground.\nHer friends, with 108 heads, tilted their heads. The 256 mouths asked.\n\"...?\"\n\"...\"\nThe overlapping voices couldn't convey any clear meaning, turning into a mumbling noise. Cold sweat streamed down her face, and her stomach churned. Her chest felt tight. Yoon Ga-eul clamped a hand over her mouth.\n'I feel like I'm going to be sick...'\nWith a grinding sound, the hand gripping the desk crushed its edge. The \"Study Guide\" and her pencil case spilled to the floor.\nYoon Ga-eul staggered as she stood up. The countless shattered pieces of a mirror reflected her distorted image. Her friends were so fragmented that she could no longer recognize them.\nA sound, like a scream, echoed in her ears. Everything in her sight shone brilliantly like a kaleidoscope. The world spun around her.\nYoon Ga-eul clutched her head with both hands. Ahhh, it felt as if she was screaming.\nHer next memory was...\n***\n\"She's gone.\"\nA hand in a white glove set a small magnifying glass down on the tray. A boy holding the tray quickly shuffled away. The owner of the hand, Nam Woo-jin, crossed his arms and sighed. The person standing behind him, Jung Bin, cautiously asked.\n\"Gone? What do you mean? Is she unconscious?\"\nYoon Ga-eul lay silently on the operating table in Nam Woo-jin's research lab in the Seowon Guild. The girl in the school uniform was unconscious, even though she had no visible injuries. Her rolled-up sleeves revealed red marks on both arms as if something had bound them.\nHer chest rose and fell slightly as she breathed, revealing a glimpse of the necklace she was wearing. The fragment attached to the necklace was an ordinary white color. After a moment of silence, Nam Woo-jin suddenly asked,\n\"What was her condition when you first found her? Has she been acting strange lately?\"\nJung Bin sighed, pulled out a notebook from the inner pocket of his suit jacket, and began reading from it.\n\"When I arrived at the school after receiving a call from her homeroom teacher, she was already lying in the nurse's office. I spoke with Yoon Ga-eul's friends, and they said she had been sleeping like the dead all day, and only woke up during lunchtime, screamed suddenly, and then collapsed. Recently...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, they said she's been a bit strange. Sometimes she'd look startled when she saw her friends. According to them, it was almost like...\"\nJung Bin's expression darkened.\n\"Like she suddenly saw a dead person...\"\nNam Woo-jin, who had been staring intently at Yoon Ga-eul's pale face, asked another question.\n\"When this girl sees the fragments, does she normally... pass out like this?\"\n\"No. I've observed her before, and she usually just appears to be in a deep sleep.\"\n\"Then it's almost certain...\"\nNam Woo-jin suddenly turned around, his white coat fluttering as he did so. He dragged his crocs across the floor as he moved towards the corner of the lab. Jung Bin watched him closely and asked,\n\"Could she have been attacked mentally?\"\n\"No. It's something entirely different.\"\nNam Woo-jin cut him off firmly and yanked away a white cloth covering something. What was revealed looked similar to a globe, but instead of a map of the world, there was a softly glowing, mother-of-pearl-like mass of light.\nNam Woo-jin reached out to the mass. His eyes, burned white, gleamed brightly.\n\"I know this well, considering I ended up like this from observing the world's rift.\"\n\"...\"\n\"My soul was dragged into another world. Though I have no idea what happened...\"\nJung Bin's mouth slightly opened in shock.\n\"In that case...\"\n\"Considering Yoon Ga-eul has been seeing fragments of a destroyed world...\"\nNam Woo-jin, peering into the mass of light, muttered in a chilling tone,\n\"She must have been dragged into that destroyed world.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 128: Watching From the Gaps\n\"Wait a moment. I need a more detailed explanation. What do you mean by the soul being dragged away...\"\nJung Bin glanced nervously at Yoon Ga-eul, lying on the operating table. Nam Woo-jin, poking at the orb of light with his finger, replied indifferently.\n\"Literally, the body here is just an empty shell.\"\n\"But...\"\nJung Bin, who trailed off, stared at Yoon Ga-eul's chest, which slightly rose and fell. He then stepped closer to the operating table and cautiously checked the wrist that bore a red mark. There was a pulse. She was alive. According to Nam Woo-jin's words, yes, even without a soul.\n\"If that's the case... how is this body being maintained? I mean, how is it continuing its life functions? It's breathing on its own without being attached to an oxygen respirator.\"\n\"That's beyond my understanding. It's the first time a soul has been entirely pulled into that realm. We'll have to research it from now on.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't look at me like that. I'm just someone who barely managed to observe a tiny fragment...\"\nNam Woo-jin tapped his temple with his index finger. Jung Bin sighed.\n\"Yes, that's true.\"\n\"Well, I have a guess... it's over there.\"\nAs he looked around, Nam Woo-jin noticed a whiteboard shoved into a corner and dragged it over. He also kicked away the books piled up in his path. Jung Bin started to say something but closed his mouth.\nThe whiteboard was covered with faded writing, barely legible. Nam Woo-jin quickly erased it with a cloth and uncapped a black marker. He paused as if to scribble something, then switched to another marker. Nothing came out. With a furrowed brow, Jung Bin finally spoke up.\n\"How long has it been since you used the whiteboard?\"\n\"Don't ask. Not long, I think.\"\n\"Master.\"\nA boy approached with quick steps, offering a box of markers. Nam Woo-jin took the box and roughly patted the boy's head.\n\"Thanks.\"\n\"You're welcome, Master.\"\nThe boy smiled as if painted on and disappeared from sight. Jung Bin shook his head.\n\"Can you even live without that marionette?\"\n\"Don't ask. Now, let's get back on topic.\"\nWith a pop, Nam Woo-jin opened a fresh marker and started drawing something that resembled a person, adding a small circle above the round head. Jung Bin squinted and asked,\n\"Is that supposed to be Yoon Ga-eul?\"\n\"You got it.\"\nJung Bin glanced at Yoon Ga-eul. Though slightly disheveled, she was sporting what people commonly call a \"messy bun.\"\n\"From the beginning, Yoon Ga-eul's ability has been peculiar among all the abilities. It's closer to the system than any other. In a world governed by the system's laws... that's quite a significant power. And it's exceptional.\"\n\"That's... true.\"\n\"Moreover, she was allowed by the system to see the fragments of the world.\"\nNam Woo-jin started twirling his long white hair with his fingers. A faint smile appeared in his burnt-white eyes.\n\"Unlike me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Anyway, her soul has been dragged into another world. The question is, did the system foresee this?\"\nJung Bin couldn't easily answer. Nam Woo-jin, as if expecting that, tapped the whiteboard with the back of the marker.\n\"Probably not. It was likely a sudden occurrence.\"\n\"How can you be so sure?\"\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\nThe boy appeared silently, offering a small dagger about the size of an adult's palm to Jung Bin. Surprised, Jung Bin asked,\n\"What's this?\"\n\"Stab her. Yoon Ga-eul.\"\n\"What?\"\nJung Bin's voice grew louder. Nam Woo-jin frowned and clicked his tongue.\n\"Do you think I'm some kind of trash? I'm not telling you to stab her in the neck or anything. Just prick the tip of her finger. Like a blood test before donating blood.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Can't do it? Shall I do it?\"\n\"...No, I'll do it.\"\nJung Bin approached Yoon Ga-eul slowly, taking a deep breath. Then, he carefully lifted his hand and pricked her index finger with the dagger.\nAt that moment,\n\"Ugh!\"\nFlash—\nA bright white light burst forth. Jung Bin covered his eyes and took a step back. When the light subsided, he saw that her finger, though pricked, bore no wound. Jung Bin widened his eyes.\n\"This is...\"\n\"That might be why her life functions continue despite her soul being absent.\"\n\"...Are you saying the system is taking care of Ga-eul's body?\"\n\"It won't last long, though.\"\nNam Woo-jin briefly answered, closing the marker cap.\n\"The world is vast, and there's a lot to manage. Even if she's close to the system, it can't focus all its attention on her. It's only temporary.\"\n\"...You're saying there's a time limit. Can we go and rescue her?\"\n\"I don't know. She's the only one who's been to that world. We only heard about it, but we have no connection to it. Unless someone else has seen that world...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, it's all speculation at this point. The one who could explain it in detail...\"\nNam Woo-jin sighed.\n\"Is lying there like that.\"\nIn the heavy silence, only soft breathing could be heard. She was still breathing, but even that could stop at any moment. Nam Woo-jin muttered, his white eyes shining eerily.\n\"Why Yoon Ga-eul? Why her...\"\nJung Bin looked at Yoon Ga-eul with concern. Then he noticed the necklace around her neck. Are students these days allowed to wear accessories like this? Jung Bin tilted his head in curiosity and examined the necklace more closely. He saw a silver, rectangular object hidden behind her neck. Reaching out, he checked it.\n[HYS]\nJung Bin's expression hardened.\n\"...I'm sorry, but I'll need to borrow this necklace.\"\nJung Bin carefully supported the back of Yoon Ga-eul's head and removed the necklace. Nam Woo-jin, lost in thought as he stared at the whiteboard, looked up. He pushed up his slipping glasses.\n\"What is it? Did you find something?\"\nFiddling with the necklace, Jung Bin gave a short reply.\n\"I'm about to find out. Please take care of Ga-eul.\"\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"...\"\nJung Bin gripped the necklace tightly. His voice, as if gritting his teeth, answered.\n\"Bukhansan.\"\n***\nCha Eui-jae opened his eyes.\nHe found himself slumped over a table, his upper body resting on it, in a dark hangover soup restaurant. Slowly, he raised his torso.\n'What's going on?'\nHad he fallen asleep for a moment? For some reason, his body felt sluggish and heavy. Has there been something exhausting? No, business had been as usual. Cha Eui-jae blinked, trying to shake off the drowsiness.\n\"...\"\nThough everything seemed familiar, the atmosphere felt off. An instinctual sense of unease crept up on him. He clenched and unclenched his fists for no reason. His palms were clean.\nThere were no golden scars shining there.\nThe mark of his contract with Lee Sa-young.\nWhat should have been there, was gone.\n\"...\"\nThe moment Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened, someone gently knocked on the door. Knock, knock, knock, Cha Eui-jae immediately stood up and scanned his surroundings. As he glanced at the table, he noticed a dented ladle. Without further hesitation, he grabbed it.\nMeanwhile, the knocking continued persistently.\nA situation where speaking up could be dangerous. Cha Eui-jae, tense, kept a wary eye on the door. Through the glass panel on the iron door, he caught a glimpse of curly brown hair.\n\"...\"\nAmong the people he knew, there was only one with that hairstyle.\n'But...'\nCha Eui-jae bit his tongue.\nIt didn't hurt.\nThen, the knocking stopped. Instead, a small voice was heard.\n\"...J.\"\nBoth the hair and the voice were familiar. But he couldn't open the door hastily. Cha Eui-jae tightened his grip on the ladle.\nAfter a long silence, the small voice whispered again.\n\"I'm sorry for coming like this. But... this was really the best I could do. I really tried.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh, you don't have to respond. Just... please listen...\"\nHesitantly, the voice continued.\n\"Do you remember? The fragment of the world I showed you, uh, I mean... the world where you... yes, that world. The fragment that came from that destroyed world...\"\n\"...\"\n\"The thing is, I think... I ended up in that destroyed world. I don't know what happened... but this... I tried to go to the others, like Jung Bin-nim, but this... you're the only one I could reach. Damn it, why do I keep...\"\nAs the voice grew longer, it started to tremble with tears. Eventually, there was a long sniffle. After the sound of wiping away tears with a sleeve, a hesitant voice said cautiously,\n\"I'm really sorry, but... can you help me?\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's too... quiet here...\"\nThe presence outside the door vanished. Only then did Cha Eui-jae carefully open the door. On the paving stones where wet footprints were left, a small white fragment lay alone, stained with a black smudge.\nCha Eui-jae stared at the fragment in silence. The last words spoken, tinged with sobs.\n\"It's too... quiet here...\"\nThe silence that descended upon the ruined world. He could painfully understand the quiet she spoke of. In truth, the only one who could truly grasp it was Cha Eui-jae.\nAnd so, Cha Eui-jae grasped the shard without hesitation.\nA small light flickered within his grasp.",

      "content": "Chapter 129: Watching From the Gaps\n2 PM. Shoes so clean they didn't have a speck of dust on them stepped onto the dirt. A large stone wall had a space in the middle, with a signboard hanging above it that says,\n[Bogungmun]\nBogungmun used to be a popular route for hikers climbing Bukhansan. However, shortly after Hong Ye-seong moved into the Jang-in Village on Bukhansan, he blocked off access to the area, using restoration work as an excuse. Jung Bin took a yellow talisman out of the inside pocket of his suit. Then, without hesitation, he stepped towards the space under the stone wall.\nSoon, a completely different landscape appeared. Beyond several layers of ropes with sacred charms, a courtyard with lush green grass came into view. In one corner of the yard was a large kiln, and beyond the yard stood a traditional straw-roofed house. It was the place where Hong Ye-seong, exiled to Bukhansan, was staying.\nJung Bin ducked under the sacred ropes and entered. A chicken chirped clearly.\n\"Hong Ye-seong-ssi. Are you here?\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nA brown lump that had been lying on the porch like a blob of slime slowly lifted its head. Despite not being in exile for long, Hong Ye-seong already looked like a wreck. Dressed in a green tracksuit, he rolled over and looked at Jung Bin. His eyes, which had been hazy, began to sparkle.\n\"Could it be? Is the exile already over?!\"\n\"No.\"\nJung Bin cut him off firmly, clasping his hands behind his back.\n\"I came to ask you something. Do you have a moment to talk?\"\n\"Eh... I'm busy.\"\nHong Ye-seong repositioned himself more comfortably, stretching out. Jung Bin shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Weren't you just sprawled out like a blob of slime?\"\n\"That was all part of the thinking process, Official-nim.\"\n\"Oh dear...\"\nJung Bin sighed loudly, making sure Hong Ye-seong heard. Then, he half-pulled out a warm chicken box from the air.\n\"If you're that busy, I guess you won't have time to eat the chicken I brought. That's unfortunate.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I guess I'll just have to give it to the team members at the Awakened Management Bureau...\"\n\"No!\"\nHong Ye-seong sprang up like a bolt of lightning, slipped his feet into his slippers, and quickly crossed the yard to Jung Bin. He hunched over and whispered urgently.\n\"Quick, hide it before Kkokko sees!\"\n\"Is your busy schedule a bit more manageable now?\"\n\"It's manageable now, so hurry!\"\nHong Ye-seong pushed Jung Bin towards the straw-roofed house, practically shoving him inside as soon as Jung Bin took off his shoes. After both were inside, he slammed the door shut. Pressing his ear against the door, listening for any sounds outside, Hong Ye-seong finally sighed in relief.\n\"Phew, that was close.\"\n\"Then I'll ask you a few questions.\"\n\"Chicken first?\"\n\"I'll give it to you if you answer.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nHong Ye-seong grumbled loudly, but Jung Bin ignored him. He pulled out a necklace from his coat pocket and held it out.\n\"This necklace... it looks like you made it. Is that correct?\"\n\"...Huh? What is this?\"\nHong Ye-seong squinted and stared intently at the necklace. He tilted his head, as if struggling to remember. Jung Bin pointed to the spot where the initials were engraved with his finger.\n\"HYS. You engraved this, didn't you?\"\n\"...Ah! Oh, right! I remember. Yes, I made that.\"\nNodding quickly, Hong Ye-seong rubbed his chin and rolled his eyes.\n\"You know, that student wearing pajama pants found some kind of fragment in a golem. It was a piece of... a piece of... what was it called? Anyway, she was fidgeting with it in her pocket, so before the government official took her to the Seowon Guild, I made it into a necklace for her.\"\nWith a face that seemed to say, \"Didn't I do well?\" he looked up at Jung Bin with sparkling eyes. Jung Bin closed his eyes tightly, overwhelmed by the flood of information contained in that one sentence.\n\"A piece of... was it a Fragment of the World, by any chance?\"\n\"Yep! That's it. This piece here... oh? It looks a bit different now, but anyway, this.\"\nHong Ye-seong pointed to the white piece attached to the necklace. What he had thought was an ordinary gemstone fragment was actually a Fragment of the World. And it wasn't something that only appeared in Yoon Ga-eul's dreams. Jung Bin stared at the necklace, his face a mix of confusion. But he quickly regained his composure. The situation was urgent.\n\"Then, by any chance, have you heard anything more from J about the rifts or eroded dungeons? It would be even better if you could contact him, but I doubt that's possible...\"\n\"Huh? Oh~ of course I can!\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Contacting J!\"\n\"...How is that possible?\"\nJung Bin had asked the question with no real expectations, so he was surprised by the confident answer. What on earth was happening that he didn't know about? Jung Bin's mouth opened slightly. Hong Ye-seong grinned mischievously, his lips twitching.\n\"That's because we're really, really close. Aren't you curious? Aren't you curious?\"\nHe didn't want to know. He didn't care about their friendship.\n\"...\"\nBut actually, he was a bit curious. No, he was very curious. Not only was there a connection with Lee Sa-young, but also with Hong Ye-seong? Why? How? Where did they meet? Why, of all the top-ranked hunters, did they have connections with the ones most people avoided? Jung Bin began to genuinely worry about his former colleague J's social life.\nHowever, he knew that if he asked about it, Hong Ye-seong would only become more boastful and insufferable. So, with superhuman patience, he kept his mouth shut. Like a dog seeking attention, Hong Ye-seong circled around him, but when he saw that Jung Bin wasn't interested, his shoulders slumped.\n\"What, you don't need it? You're not curious?\"\n\"...Just please contact him.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nPouting like a duck, Hong Ye-seong cracked the door open slightly. Then he shouted toward the yard.\n\"Kkokko!\"\nA chicken perched on a roost lifted its head. Its round white body gleamed in the sunlight. Cupping his hands around his mouth, Hong Ye-seong yelled.\n\"Go to J! When you get there, turn on the communication device!\"\n\"Bawwk...\"\n\"Oh, I know it's hard. This place is on a cliff, so it'll be even tougher. But please, I'm asking you. Okay?\"\n\"Bawk.\"\nThe chicken hopped down from the roost and sadly trotted out the gate. Could this really work? As Jung Bin skeptically watched the chicken disappear, Hong Ye-seong suddenly made a sound of realization and got up.\n\"Oh, right. I made some sikhye, want to try it?\"\n\"Aren't there more important things to do... And this isn't the time to be...\"\n\"Oh, come on.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, Hong Ye-seong dashed to the kitchen and returned with a clear plastic bottle, pouring the sikhye into a paper cup and offering it to Jung Bin. With a dubious expression, Jung Bin accepted the cup and took a sip. His eyes widened.\nIt was delicious.\n\"Good, right? It's good, isn't it? Amazing, right? Maybe I should start selling sikhye when I retire.\"\nWithout a word, Jung Bin continued sipping the drink, lost in thought.\n'Please, stop using your skills for things like this...'\n***\nAt 3 PM, Cha Eui-jae was sweeping the floor as usual. After sweeping away all the dust, he straightened his back and let out a deep sigh.\nAfter Yoon Ga-eul's fragment disappeared, early in the morning, Cha Eui-jae woke up in his small room. It was as if everything he'd just heard— the trembling voice— had been a dream. He blinked at the dark ceiling. Just as he was about to get up, he realized there was something in his hand.\nIt was a white fragment, stained with a black smudge. It was proof that what he experienced wasn't just a dream.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't know how, but he wanted to save Yoon Ga-eul. He knew what it was like to be alone in a place where there wasn't even a hint of human presence. But even if he were to go to the world Yoon Ga-eul had vanished into, he didn't know what he could do with this fragment. Even if he clenched it tightly or tried to infuse it with power, the fragment only flickered sporadically.\nThen, something knocked on the door.\nCha Eui-jae swung the door open. No one was there. But when he looked down, something white and round was looking up at him. Cha Eui-jae greeted it warmly.\n\"Kkokko!\"\nBut instead of a cute cooing sound, a mundane message came out.\n—Target confirmed. Preparing to connect you to the master via communicator. Please be ready.\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened as he quickly picked up the chicken and closed the door. Instinctively, he pulled out a mask from his inventory and put it on.\nA moment later, a familiar voice came from the chicken's beak.\n—...Ah, can you hear me? This is Jung Bin from the Awakened Management Bureau.\n'Shit.'\nCha Eui-jae steadied his breath and responded in an altered voice.\n\"So suddenly? What happened?\"\n—Ah, J. Thank goodness.\nThere was a sigh of relief in the voice.\n—I wanted to ask you something. You mentioned that the cause of the dungeon's restructuring was you, right? Is that correct?\n\"...Yes, it is. But it's just a guess.\"\n—Then, by any chance... do you know anything about the fragment Ga-eul picked up in the dungeon?\n\"What?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Jung Bin spoke in an anxious voice.\n—Ga-eul has collapsed. According to Hunter Nam Woo-jin, it seems her soul has been pulled into another world.\nAs Jung Bin explained further, Cha Eui-jae quietly listened while pulling out the fragment from his apron pocket. The one Yoon Ga-eul had left behind in his dream. After Jung Bin finished his long explanation, he murmured,\n—I'm sorry to bother you with this, but... I was wondering if you knew anything that could help.\nCha Eui-jae answered briefly.\n\"I do.\"\n—Excuse me?\n\"I think I now know how to bring her back.\"\nAs he fiddled with the fragment, Cha Eui-jae made eye contact with the chicken.\n\"Don't worry too much. I'll take responsibility and bring Ga-eul back.\"\n—Wait, J! What do you mean by that?\nCha Eui-jae set the chicken down outside the door. Jung Bin's frantic voice was still coming from the chicken's beak. After flipping the sign to indicate it was time to prepare ingredients, Cha Eui-jae carefully locked the door and turned off all the lights in the restaurant.\nWasn't he taking the long way around when there was a simpler option?\n'It means it's a situation where I could die at any time.'\nThen there was no time to hesitate. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath and held the small fragment between his thumb and index finger.\nThen,\nSnap, the fragment crumbled to pieces between his fingers. Brilliant light began to pour out from it.\n...Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes.\nIt looked like the hallway of a house. Strangely familiar. A photograph of a bright blue ocean hung on the wall.\nWarm sunlight streamed through the large window in the living room ahead. The white curtains gently swayed in the breeze coming through the slightly open window. He felt assured that this place was safe. Strangely so. The tension melted away sweetly in an instant. Cha Eui-jae took a step forward.\nThe wooden floor, warm from the sunlight, was pleasantly warm under his bare feet. Without thinking, he wiggled his toes. As he walked further, the sounds of rustling and clattering grew closer.\nCha Eui-jae reached the kitchen— a dark brown wooden table, the savory smell of eggs cooking, the slight warmth of a toaster browning bread, and a tall young man standing with his back to him. The man, standing in front of the induction stove, spoke without even turning around.\n\"Late again, aren't you, Hyung?\"\nHis voice was mixed with a bit of laughter. It was strangely familiar. The voice, the black, curly hair that nearly covered his neck, and the tall build— all familiar. The young man, who seemed both in place and out of place in the warm home, was wearing a thin white T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows.\nHis scar-free hands moved skillfully. The shoulder blades that stood out on his back, and the light blue checkered apron tied around his waist in a familiar knot— something about it made Cha Eui-jae's throat tighten. His mouth moved on its own.\n\"I've been up for a while. Just didn't get out of bed.\"\n\"Always making excuses.\"\n\"A guy finally gets a break and decides to sleep in, and you've got something to say about it.\"\nWords came out of his mouth as if he were an automatic answering machine. But Cha Eui-jae didn't find anything strange about it. He was simply immersed in a feeling of nostalgia, a warmth he hadn't felt in a long time.\nWithout hesitation, Cha Eui-jae approached the young man and rested his chin on his broad shoulder. He could smell the scent of fragrant fabric softener.\n\"What're you making, a rolled omelet?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Omelet and toast? Shouldn't you be frying the eggs?\"\n\"For someone who can't cook, you sure talk a lot.\"\n\"Oh, look at you...\"\nCha Eui-jae subtly lifted his eyes to look at the young man's face. Plump lips, a slight smile at the corners of his mouth— everything was familiar. His black eyes, sitting under long eyelashes, glanced at Cha Eui-jae and narrowed into a gentle curve.\n\"Hyung.\"\nHis voice was affectionate.\nCha Eui-jae's mouth moved on its own.\n\"Yeah, Sa-young.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 130: Watching From the Gaps\nThe smell of toast browning filled the air. Lee Sa-young, who chuckled softly, spoke kindly.\n\"Go sit down, Hyung. It'll be done soon.\"\n\"Is there anything I can do?\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nInstead of replying, Lee Sa-young gave him a playful look. Cha Eui-jae narrowed his eyes in mock suspicion.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Then, could you set the table with some plates and forks?\"\n\"Sure.\"\nHis body moved on instinct. Glancing over, he noticed that Lee Sa-young was skillfully rolling the omelet. The way he poured the egg mixture was pretty impressive. Cha Eui-jae took out two plates from the cupboard. At that moment, Lee Sa-young put down the spatula and pressed the back of his hand against his eyes.\nOnce again, Cha Eui-jae's mouth moved on its own.\n\"...Are your eyes hurting again?\"\nAgain? Had Lee Sa-young's eyes hurt before?\n\"Yeah...\"\n\"The medicine?\"\n\"Not yet. I was planning to take it after eating.\"\n\"At least use some eye drops. I'll handle this.\"\n\"...Are you sure? You're not going to burn it again, right?\"\n\"If I can't manage, I'll just hold onto it, I guess.\"\nWhat a lame response. Where was his pride as a part-timer in a hangover soup restaurant? Cha Eui-jae felt his pride as a hangover soup restaurant part-timer being pricked and was about to correct himself indignantly when—\nLee Sa-young replied in a voice that sounded like a groan.\n\"Okay...\"\nSuddenly, Lee Sa-young's curly hair brushed against Cha Eui-jae's shoulder. The warmth of his solid body filled Cha Eui-jae's arms. Cha Eui-jae gently stroked Lee Sa-young's straight shoulder blades and back.\n\"Let me know if it still hurts after using the drops, okay?\"\n\"Got it...\"\nLee Sa-young set down the square frying pan and stumbled out of the kitchen. Cha Eui-jae watched his retreating figure with a sense of pity.\nLee Sa-young was Cha Eui-jae's weakness.\nOh.\nCha Eui-jae had saved Lee Sa-young, who was dying from poison, and completed the detoxification. He even researched dungeon monster by-products to heal Lee Sa-young's melted skin. To take responsibility for the life he saved, they had been living together. Everything was almost perfect. Except for one thing—\nWhat's that?\nJust one thing— Cha Eui-jae hadn't been able to fully cure Lee Sa-young's eyes. Not only was his vision poor, but he also suffered from periodic pain. Like now.\nWas that so? That doesn't quite match my memory.\nQuestions that didn't make sense kept disrupting his train of thought. They were infuriatingly persistent.\nAnyway, Cha Eui-jae was working with the Awakened Management Bureau, searching for dungeon by-products or treatments that could cure Lee Sa-young's eyes.\nThe Awakened Management Bureau?\nAlthough he was taking a break today because there were no special tasks, he had to be ready to rush out if a call came in.\nWait, why?\nSuddenly, the white curtains fluttered violently. Cha Eui-jae blinked. He was holding a square frying pan in one hand and two plates precariously in the other. He carefully placed the frying pan on the induction stove, which was turned off, and set the plates on the table. The plates were decorated with violet flowers.\nViolet?\nCome to think of it, why are Lee Sa-young's eyes black? His eyes were such a vivid purple that they could be seen even through the thick lenses of a gas mask...\n\"Oh.\"\nIt felt like a splash of cold water jolted him awake.\n'Shit.'\nBang! Cha Eui-jae gripped the table with both hands and lowered his head, his eyes wide open. Once he regained his senses, everything felt unfamiliar. Cold sweat trickled down his temples.\n'Where the hell am I?'\nWhy had he taken everything so for granted? A shiver ran down his spine. Cha Eui-jae racked his brain, trying to recall his last memory.\nThe sudden appearance of Kkokko, the call from Jung Bin. The news that Yoon Ga-eul's soul had been pulled into another world, and that her life would be in danger if this situation dragged on. Yoon Ga-eul, who appeared in his dream, left behind a fragment, and then disappeared. And then...\nCha Eui-jae had unhesitatingly shattered the fragment.\n'Am I crazy...?'\nLooking back, it had been a hasty action, as if he were possessed. He could have at least finished his work before breaking it! He didn't even know how long it would take, and he did it right in the middle of the restaurant. To top it off...\n'Wasn't I wearing a mask?'\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly at the wood grain patterns on the table before running his hands through his hair in frustration. A silent scream escaped his lips. How was he supposed to deal with the aftermath?\nJust then, a white rectangle appeared in his vision. The white screen blinked as if greeting him.\nIt was a system window he hadn't seen in a long time.\n[Welcome, J!]\nNot happy to see you.\nCha Eui-jae ignored the system and continued to think. This place was probably the world that had been destroyed, where Yoon Ga-eul's soul had been pulled in. Of course, it made sense since she had left the fragment herself to him.\nThen, what about the timeline? Cha Eui-jae quickly went to the window and looked outside. In the middle of the blue sky was a swirling black hole. This was the point in time after the Day of the Rift.\n'But the fragment Ga-eul showed me... wasn't it at a point where the destruction had already happened, and they were trying to prevent it?'\nMoreover, in that fragment, Lee Sa-young had already awakened, so this place must be set in the past compared to that.\nSo why was he dropped into this specific time? And how could he escape from here?\nJust then, the white screen barged into Cha Eui-jae's view.\n[Would you like to check your current location?]\nIt was a tempting offer. Cha Eui-jae narrowed his eyes and read the message slowly.\nCurrent location. It was information he needed... Yeah, nothing to lose. After all, anyone who knew J's survival or that he was J already knew. Besides, he had very little information about this place.\nCha Eui-jae nodded.\n\"Tell me.\"\n[Location: Memorial Dungeon (Creator: ???)]\nMemorial Dungeon?\nCha Eui-jae blinked and quickly looked around. This was supposed to be a dungeon? But it didn't feel like a dungeon at all— there was no sign of monsters.\nWhat could \"Memorial\" mean? Was it the name of the dungeon? But usually, dungeons had distinct names, so that didn't seem to be the case. And the fact that it mentioned the creator's name afterward... Cha Eui-jae crossed his arms. It would be faster to ask the system directly.\n\"What's a Memorial Dungeon?\"\nA new screen appeared.\n[Memorial Dungeon: A space recreated based on someone's memories.]\nCha Eui-jae tapped his arm. So, it was a dungeon created based on someone's memories. If this was a dungeon, there must be a way to clear it.\n'Like killing the dungeon's master...'\n\"What's the clear condition?\"\nBut the system's answer was unhelpful.\n[It varies depending on the dungeon.]\nWho doesn't know that? Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth. The system was just as uncooperative as ever, never giving him the important details. His head began to heat up with frustration. He leaned against the window frame and stuck his head outside to cool off.\nIt looked like there was a park in front of the house. The laughter of people taking a walk echoed in his ears. Cha Eui-jae propped his chin on his arm as he leaned on the window.\n'The information that just popped into my head was different from what I knew before.'\nCha Eui-jae and Lee Sa-young were living together, Lee Sa-young's treatment was successful, and Lee Sa-young hadn't awakened yet. His eyes were black. All these details— it must be the memory of the person who created this dungeon. And,\n'The memories probably don't last more than a few days.'\nHuman memory isn't perfect. The creator of this space wouldn't have perfect memory either. So, this dungeon shouldn't last long. Cha Eui-jae counted his fingers and then sighed.\n'...I guess I'll just have to get through the day somehow.'\nAt that moment, the system window blinked.\n[Would you like to receive your first-place reward?]\n[Claim]\nFirst-place reward? Cha Eui-jae searched his memory and then widened his eyes. Ah, that. It was what he received on the day the rankings were updated, after doing something he shouldn't have at a funeral. Of course, Cha Eui-jae didn't have any say in the matter.\nHe still clearly remembered the thrill of being resurrected after almost being disposed of like trash, so why was that window appearing now? Cha Eui-jae asked indifferently.\n\"What's the reward?\"\nFor a while, the system didn't answer, only showing a blank screen. Always all talk and no action. Cha Eui-jae scoffed and turned his head away.\nBut then,\n[We will give you what you need most right now.]\nThe black text appeared cautiously.\nIt sounded like a cheap advertisement. What Cha Eui-jae needed most right now. What, were they going to give him an escape pass or a weapon? Cha Eui-jae, still propped up by the window, reached out toward the system window.\nHe didn't trust the system. He hadn't before, and he still didn't.\nBut, the sudden change of heart was...\n\"Alright...\"\nWas it because this place felt too comforting, or because of the anxiety? Or maybe...\nCha Eui-jae pressed the \"Claim\" button with his fingertip.\n\"Let's see what you've got.\"\nPerhaps it was Cha Eui-jae's intuition.\nAt that moment,\nThunk!\nHe heard a heavy object fall. The sound came from the direction where Lee Sa-young had disappeared within this dungeon. Lee Sa-young, who had complained about eye pain.\n'Did he collapse from the pain?'\nCha Eui-jae quickly crossed the hallway and stood in front of the firmly closed door. His heart was racing. He bit his dry lips hard.\n'...No, he'll be fine.'\nThe Lee Sa-young in the fragment Yoon Ga-eul showed him had awakened safely. He wouldn't have any serious health issues here. But...\nCha Eui-jae flung the door open.\n\"Lee Sa-young!\"\nIt was a bathroom with white tiles. Lee Sa-young was sitting on the floor, leaning over the sink. His eyes were tightly shut, and his furrowed brow and the cold sweat running down his pale skin hinted at his pain. Cha Eui-jae gently cupped Lee Sa-young's cheek.\n\"Hey, are you okay? Open your eyes!\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been groaning, slowly opened his eyes. The color of his irises, peeking through his narrowed gaze, was rapidly changing.\nBlack, purple, black, purple, black, purple, black...\nPurple.\nCha Eui-jae held his breath for a moment. The space around Lee Sa-young darkened. Like a broken graphic, something was shattering and distorting. And then, the sky-blue checkered apron Lee Sa-young was wearing began to darken. Finally, appearing on his chest was...\n'The toad from the soju brand!'\nThe soju brand apron that should be hanging in the hangover soup restaurant! Cha Eui-jae's mouth dropped open as he took a step back. He instinctively sensed it.\n'I'm fucked.'\nStrength suddenly returned to the limp body. Lee Sa-young blinked slowly. His unfocused purple eyes scanned the surroundings before finally landing on Cha Eui-jae, who was clinging to the bathroom wall like a lizard.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nA heavy silence hung between them. Cha Eui-jae slowly peeled himself off the wall, faced Lee Sa-young, and cleared his throat. He felt like he needed to say something.\n\"...Uh, hi? Sa-young?\"\nUpon hearing the gentle greeting, a devilish expression crossed Lee Sa-young's delicate, pretty face. He spat out in a low, seething voice.\n\"...Again.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"What did you do this time, you bastard?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 131: Watching From the Gaps\nAs soon as he came to his senses, Lee Sa-young cursed under his breath and immediately grabbed his head, grimacing. His complexion was pale, as if he still had a headache.\n\"...Where is this? Why...\"\n\"...That's what I'd like to know too.\"\nCha Eui-jae was about to speak, hesitating. Lee Sa-young pinched the apron he was wearing between his thumb and forefinger, lifting it slightly. A sky-blue toad was pitifully squashed.\n\"And what's with this apron?\"\nCha Eui-jae had no idea what the apron was either, so he couldn't answer. He just clasped his hands behind his back and shifted his eyes nervously.\n\"...I have no idea either.\"\n\"...Hah.\"\nLee Sa-young leaned his arms and forehead on the sink and let out a long sigh. Cha Eui-jae cautiously approached and squatted beside him. A blunt voice slipped out.\n\"Go away.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"...You're annoying.\"\nCha Eui-jae leaned against the white bathtub and glanced at Lee Sa-young. Thankfully, after saying he was annoyed, he didn't respond further. Cha Eui-jae listened to his gradually calming breath, thinking to himself.\n'When Ga-eul's soul transferred, they said she collapsed as if fainting.'\nDid Lee Sa-young's body and Cha Eui-jae's body in the real world also collapse as if they fainted? His mouth went dry. What if, just before being pulled here, Lee Sa-young had entered a dungeon? That would be a disaster.\n'This damn system, how can they just yank us out like this?'\nWiggling his toes, Cha Eui-jae asked carefully.\n\"What were you doing?\"\n\"...What was I doing?\"\nLee Sa-young slightly lifted his head and glanced at Cha Eui-jae. He twisted his lips.\n\"I was in a meeting with the guild members...\"\n'Damn it.'\n\"We were talking a lot about the eroded dungeon.\"\nCha Eui-jae bowed his head solemnly. In some ways, this was worse than being in a dungeon. No wonder he asked what the hell was going on as soon as he saw him! He had been in a large conference room with his guild members, and suddenly he was yanked into a small bathroom to face Cha Eui-jae. Of course, he would react like that.\nLee Sa-young, tilting his head back and covering his face with his hand, muttered.\n\"...Are you okay?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I asked if you're okay.\"\n\"Me? Yeah. I'm fine.\"\nMaybe it was because the Cha Eui-jae in his memory had awakened. His body didn't seem much different from reality. But what about Lee Sa-young? He was still sweating coldly. Cha Eui-jae brushed Lee Sa-young's hair away.\n\"Are you okay? Does anything hurt?\"\n\"I have a headache, but... it'll go away soon.\"\nLee Sa-young slightly moved his fingers aside, narrowing his violet eyes.\n\"What is this place?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why are you here, how did you get here, and why was I dragged here?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Explain, now.\"\nThe sweet, lazy atmosphere that had filled the house had long disappeared, replaced by a menacing tension. Cha Eui-jae had expected this. He squeezed his eyes shut. Ever since those eyes turned violet, he knew this was coming. But it was a story that couldn't be avoided.\n\"...It's a long story, so listen carefully.\"\nThis place is a Memorial Dungeon, which is a dungeon created from someone's memory, and we don't know how to clear it. It's also somewhere in a destroyed world, and our souls were dragged here.\nI rushed to save Yoon Ga-eul, so my body is probably lying in the middle of the hangover soup restaurant wearing a J mask, and your body probably collapsed in the middle of the conference room too.\nWhile Cha Eui-jae summarized, Lee Sa-young's expression remained unchanged. That expression, to be precise, was one of glaring at Cha Eui-jae as if he wanted to devour him.\nHaving completed his summary, Cha Eui-jae asked.\n\"Let's leave it at that for now, have any questions so far?\"\n\"...You're asking if I have questions?\"\nLee Sa-young scoffed and muttered coldly.\n\"Too many.\"\nThis was bad. Cha Eui-jae quickly drew a line.\n\"Let me just say, I don't know much either. I just came to my senses.\"\n\"Ah... Then let me ask you just one thing.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Are you out of your mind?\"\n'Damn it.'\nBut he had no rebuttal, so instead of arguing, Cha Eui-jae just pouted his lips. Maybe he really had been bewitched by the light coming from that shard. Lee Sa-young, resting his temple against the sink, muttered.\n\"So you'd be lying in the hangover soup restaurant. Wearing a mask. And I'd have collapsed too.\"\n\"...Yeah.\"\n\"...Well, that's a relief. Seo Min-gi will handle it.\"\n\"What? How?\"\n\"I told him to check on you first if anything happened to me.\"\n\"Me? Shouldn't he check on you first? What about you?\"\n\"Who knows.\"\nLee Sa-young curled his lips and slowly stood up, leaning on the sink. The apron with the misplaced soju brand logo fluttered. Why did that apron get dragged here? It belonged on the wall of the hangover soup restaurant. He looked down at Cha Eui-jae, still squatting against the bathtub.\n\"Get up.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Weren't you preparing food?\"\n\"Well, yeah, but... shouldn't we figure out how to clear the dungeon first?\"\nAt that moment, a loud rumble echoed through the bathroom, coming from Cha Eui-jae's stomach. He grimaced.\n'Damn it, since when did I start feeling hunger so regularly?'\nLee Sa-young smirked, slightly raising his chin as if to say, 'See?'\n\"Looks like someone's very hungry.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Let's talk over a meal.\"\nLee Sa-young stepped aside, signaling him to go ahead. Cha Eui-jae sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck and shuffled out into the hallway. It wasn't until he had taken a few steps that Lee Sa-young followed him.\nBut soon, the footsteps following him came to a stop. Curious, he turned around to see Lee Sa-young standing there, rooted to the spot, staring blankly at a picture of the sea hanging in the hallway. The sight was like a painting.\nNot in a good way, but in a bad way. As if...\nHe was a person trapped in that very spot.\n\"...Sa-young.\"\nCha Eui-jae called him abruptly. Lee Sa-young slowly shifted his gaze to Cha Eui-jae. His face was as indifferent and languid as ever. He shrugged his shoulders.\n\"What are you doing? Let's go.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Aren't you hungry?\"\nHe motioned with his chin, urging him to go. Cha Eui-jae forced himself to move his heavy feet toward the kitchen.\nThe once neatly organized kitchen was a mess. The bread had popped out of the toaster, half-burnt, the rolled omelet was left half-cooked and cold, and there were just two empty plates sitting on the table. And the spatula Lee Sa-young had left behind...\n\"...It turned into a ladle?\"\nIt had turned into a ladle. And not just any ladle, but a dented one. Lee Sa-young, who had been looking around the kitchen with his hands behind his back, tilted his head slightly.\n\"That looks like a set with this apron.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Should I take it off for you?\"\n\"No...\"\nCha Eui-jae turned on the sink and washed his hands clean. He could toast new bread to replace the burnt ones, and he could resume rolling the half-cooked omelet. Anything that's interrupted can be continued.\nLee Sa-young, who had been looking around the house, turned on the radio placed next to the sofa in the living room. A scratchy noise came out, and it was questionable whether it would work properly, but then soft music began to flow from the speaker. It was a tune he had never heard before, but it was pleasant enough to listen to.\nCha Eui-jae took two slices of bread out of the bag and put them in the toaster. With his back turned, he called out to Lee Sa-young.\n\"Sa-young, come finish rolling the omelet.\"\n\"I don't know how to make an omelet.\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened in surprise, then rolled. Right, the Lee Sa-young in this memory knew how to make omelets. And didn't the Cha Eui-jae in this memory also not know how to cook?\nSo, they just had to do what they could now. In their own way. Cha Eui-jae turned on the induction cooktop and picked up the frying pan. Hearing the sound, Lee Sa-young half-turned around.\n\"Then I'll handle this. When the toast is done, take it out for me.\"\n\"...There are no gloves.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Do you have tongs?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I can't let any poison get on it.\"\nCha Eui-jae stared at Lee Sa-young, slightly slack-jawed. Lee Sa-young still had his hands behind his back, as if his hands were weapons. Even in this peaceful and safe memory, everything about him was cautious.\nSuddenly, a surge of emotion welled up in Cha Eui-jae's throat. He set down the frying pan with a thud and quickly walked toward him. Lee Sa-young's eyes widened as he tried to take a step back, but Cha Eui-jae was faster. He grabbed the hand Lee Sa-young had behind his back, and Lee Sa-young grimaced.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Stay still.\"\nLee Sa-young's hands, untouched by poison, were straight and large, and most importantly, they were clean without a single black stain. If Cha Eui-jae had stayed by Lee Sa-young's side, these were the hands he could have had. The hands he should have had.\nEight years had passed since their promise. He knew there was no point in regretting it now. He didn't regret going into the West Sea rift to save people. However,\n\"I'm not your responsibility.\"\nWhen he thought about Lee Sa-young, who went through everything alone, keeping that promise...\nCha Eui-jae bit down hard on Lee Sa-young's clean, unblemished fingers, as if to prove a point. Lee Sa-young gasped, inhaling sharply. He tried to push away, his free hand hovering near his shoulder.\n\"What are you...!\"\nBut Cha Eui-jae didn't care and bit down harder, with just enough force to leave a mark but not enough to sever the finger.\nEventually, with a crunch, the taste of blood filled his mouth. As he licked the blood from Lee Sa-young's fingers, Cha Eui-jae glared up at him.\n\"Don't talk nonsense.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 132: Watching From the Gaps\nEvery time his tongue touched the bitten finger, it slightly recoiled. Cha Eui-jae relaxed the hand that had been gripping Lee Sa-young's wrist. However, Lee Sa-young's hand remained frozen in place.\nHe was literally staring blankly at Cha Eui-jae. But only for a moment— then Lee Sa-young shifted his gaze to the floor. Cha Eui-jae wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\"For waiting for me, keeping a promise that was just words... No, even more than that.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm going to repay you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Even if you don't want it.\"\nBlood beaded along the clear bite mark on the first knuckle of his left ring finger. At a glance, it looked like a red ring. Cha Eui-jae added firmly,\n\"If you ever say again that you're not my responsibility or that I shouldn't care, I won't let it slide.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Lee Sa-young, look at me. Did you understand?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been staring at the floor as if counting the patterns, slowly lifted his head. At that moment, Cha Eui-jae unconsciously parted his lips slightly.\n\"You...\"\nLee Sa-young's face...\n\"...\"\nWas tinged with a soft red, as if he were embarrassed!\nTheir eyes met only briefly before Lee Sa-young shyly averted his gaze. He covered his mouth with the back of his hand as an added gesture. It was a terribly unfitting metaphor for Lee Sa-young, but only one comparison came to mind. Yes, it was the bashful gesture of a new bride.\nCha Eui-jae froze where he stood.\n'...Why?'\nA shock, like being struck on the head with a hammer, reverberated through his body. The reaction Cha Eui-jae had anticipated was not this embarrassing one. He had been prepared for another endless argument, starting with something like 'Oh, really?' That was why he said and did what he did.\n'Seriously, why?'\nHis sharp instincts, which had saved his life many times, were always off the mark when it came to Lee Sa-young. By this point, even Cha Eui-jae felt wronged. Isn't it strange for someone to be embarrassed after being bitten on the finger like that? Shouldn't he be angry?\nAt that moment, blood even redder than his flushed face trickled down from the wound on his finger. If this were the home of Cha Eui-jae in this ruined world, he would've surely had a first-aid kit. Cha Eui-jae bit the inside of his mouth and turned his head.\n\"...Let's treat this first.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young quietly nodded. Those plump lips that usually had so much to say and were always ready with a sarcastic remark were now firmly shut. Moving stiffly like a wooden puppet, Cha Eui-jae added,\n\"Also... maybe take off that apron.\"\nLeaving Lee Sa-young standing there, Cha Eui-jae practically fled into the nearest room, slamming the door behind him. Fortunately, the first-aid kit was right there on top of the drawer. Of course— it'd be useless if it was hidden somewhere hard to find in an emergency.\nInside the kit, essential medicines, a familiar-looking purple antidote, and hard-to-find potions were neatly organized. Except for the bandages, most of the items were new.\n'...This kind of neatness doesn't seem like something I'd do.'\nDid Lee Sa-young from this world organize this? Cha Eui-jae tucked the first-aid kit under his arm and took a quick glance around the room, using his slow steps as an excuse.\nA bed that was quite large for one person was prominently placed in the center of the room. It was odd that there was a lamp on each side of the bed, and it was even stranger that, clearly, two different people's belongings were on the small drawers underneath them.\nOn the left drawer was an Awakened Management Bureau pager, and on the right drawer, a pair of glasses.\n'Glasses.'\nCha Eui-jae cautiously picked up the glasses and held them to his eyes. His vision blurred so much that it made him dizzy just from holding them up.\nLee Sa-young of this world, whose vision had deteriorated due to the aftereffects of poisoning.\nNow that he thought about it, didn't the Lee Sa-young he knew also wear glasses at one point? Just once, though. The one time he had seen him wearing glasses was right after they were stranded at Incheon Port.\nA strange and unsettling feeling pricked at the back of his mind.\n'...Could it be?'\nCha Eui-jae froze, holding the glasses.\n'Do we... sleep in the same bed?'\nHe and Lee Sa-young?\nCha Eui-jae's face paled. He felt that if he kept thinking along these lines, something irreversible would happen.\n'No, there was no such story in the memories that were crammed into my head earlier!'\nBut there was enough evidence in plain sight to arrest him on the spot.\n'...No, it can't be. Definitely not.'\nHaving finished his self-hypnosis, Cha Eui-jae flung the door open with such force that it nearly broke and stepped out into the living room. Lee Sa-young, who was still standing there, looked up. The apron he had taken off was draped over his arm. Thankfully, his face had returned to its usual pale complexion.\nAs Cha Eui-jae walked past him to the sofa, he said,\n\"Sit on the sofa so I can disinfect and bandage this.\"\nLee Sa-young nodded slightly and sat on the sofa, extending his hand. Cha Eui-jae sprayed disinfectant on a piece of gauze and cleaned the area around the bite mark. Fortunately, the bleeding wasn't severe. As Lee Sa-young silently watched Cha Eui-jae work, he spoke.\n\"...You're pretty good at this.\"\nCutting the gauze with a small pair of scissors, Cha Eui-jae replied flatly,\n\"What, did you think I'd just pour disinfectant all over it?\"\n\"Hmm. I thought that might happen... I was prepared for it.\"\n\"What do you take me for? I've treated enough wounds myself...\"\n\"...Aha.\"\nSensing the discomfort in Lee Sa-young's tone, Cha Eui-jae added defensively.\n\"Well, there were no healers back then, so we had no choice.\"\n\"There must have been regular medical staff, at least.\"\n\"After closing a rift, you get flooded with injured people and corpses. Those who can still move have to treat themselves.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young's expression showed displeasure, but fortunately, he didn't say anything further. After applying a dressing bandage to the wound, Cha Eui-jae removed his hand.\n\"Done, all finished.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nLee Sa-young moved his finger and shrugged.\n\"It's a new experience, getting hurt on my hand.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And to think, it was because someone bit me...\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes narrowed. Lee Sa-young covered his mouth and laughed softly.\n\"I thought you were a dog.\"\n\"You cheeky...\"\nCha Eui-jae glared at him. A moment ago, Lee Sa-young was almost endearing when he was embarrassed, but now, as he returned to his usual calm self, it was as if he had been waiting for this moment to scratch at Cha Eui-jae's nerves. Lee Sa-young stretched out his hand and murmured lazily,\n\"Well, still... It's fortunate that I don't have any venom in this body.\"\n\"...None?\"\n\"You said it yourself, right? My soul crossed over to this world, but my body is still collapsed in the original world.\"\nLee Sa-young tugged at the loose collar of his clothes with his thumb and forefinger.\n\"I did feel sluggish and heavy when I first woke up.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And most importantly, you're fine, right? This body must be pre-Awakening.\"\n\"How many times do I have to tell you, your venom doesn't affect me...\"\n\"Sure, whatever you say.\"\nJust when Cha Eui-jae thought he had finally cleared up the misunderstanding! It turns out the basilisk's venom hadn't worked; he had just drunk some blood. Cha Eui-jae, now practically a vampire, clenched his fist.\n\"I'll bite you again when we get out of here. Then we'll see.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nDrawing out the sound, Lee Sa-young responded with a teasing tone.\n\"Fine. Besides... this.\"\nHe wiggled his bandaged finger.\n\"Left me wanting more.\"\nLee Sa-young got up from the sofa and headed lightly to the kitchen. Cha Eui-jae sighed softly as he put the contents of the first-aid kit back in order. There was the sound of clattering, then it stopped. Lee Sa-young peeked his head out from the kitchen.\n\"Oh, and.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"You said 'let's leave it at that for now' earlier.\"\n\"Let's leave it at that for now, have any questions so far?\"\nLee Sa-young's lips curved into a smile.\n\"I was wondering if there was more to it. I get why you came here, but why did I end up here... that sort of thing.\"\n'Shit.'\n\"Maybe we should finish the conversation over a meal?\"\nLee Sa-young's memory was nothing short of excellent.\n\"Hurry up and come over. We need to eat first.\"\nThe half-cooled and now cold rolled omelet, as well as the bread that was so burnt it was hard to tell if it was even properly toasted, were placed on the table one after the other. After confirming that he was indeed not poisonous, Lee Sa-young moved even more diligently.\nHe pulled out apricot jam, strawberry jam, and cream cheese from somewhere in the fridge and laid them out on the table. It wasn't a perfect meal, but it was enough to fill their stomachs. Neither of them were particularly picky eaters anyway.\nCha Eui-jae glanced over at Lee Sa-young, who was frowning slightly while chewing on the rolled omelet. This was the perfect moment, with his mouth full. Cha Eui-jae, pretending to spread cream cheese on his bread, started speaking.\n\"As I was saying earlier, after I came to my senses and was trying to figure out the situation... the system said it would give me what I needed the most at that moment.\"\nLee Sa-young nodded. Cha Eui-jae's voice grew quieter.\n\"...So I agreed to receive it.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nLee Sa-young's eyes sharpened. He looked like he was ready to devour someone. Cha Eui-jae avoided his gaze and pouted slightly. After swallowing the omelet, Lee Sa-young put down his fork and let out a long sigh.\n\"You just took their word for it? Without checking what the cost would be?\"\n\"No, I—\"\n\"You're really...\"\nLee Sa-young paused, choosing his words carefully before speaking.\n\"Make sure you don't get scammed wherever you go.\"\n\"I've never been scammed in my life.\"\n\"Sure, if you say so. So, what happened?\"\n\"Well...\"\n\"And then?\"\n\"You... ended up here.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nThis time, Cha Eui-jae averted his eyes, trying to act nonchalant.\nThe thing Cha Eui-jae needed most was Lee Sa-young. Though he wasn't sure why. Cha Eui-jae smothered the innocent bread with cream cheese. Then, a low voice came from across the table.\n\"So, the thing you needed most was me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, that's...\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's good to hear.\"\nFollowing that, there was a rustling sound.\n\"Of all the things I've heard since coming here, that's the best one.\"\nSomething warm suddenly nudged his foot. Cha Eui-jae, pretending not to notice, froze mid-bite. The tickling sensation on the top of his foot was likely...\n'A foot?'\nCha Eui-jae sneaked a glance at Lee Sa-young, who was now resting his chin on his hands, staring directly at him. The bandaged finger lightly tapped his cheek playfully. When their eyes met, Lee Sa-young's gaze narrowed into a slight smile.\nMeanwhile, the foot that had been tickling the top of Cha Eui-jae's foot was now gently rubbing against the ankle bone. The unfamiliar sensation made his toes curl. Hastily swallowing the bread, Cha Eui-jae spoke.\n\"...Hey.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slightly, wearing an angelic smile.",

      "content": "Chapter 133: Watching From the Gaps\n\"You, your foot...\"\n\"What about it?\"\nLee Sa-young asked calmly, as if enjoying himself. His violet eyes, narrowed slightly, were filled with Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae unconsciously tightened his grip. The foot that had been rubbing against his ankle lightly brushed against the hem of his pants. Cha Eui-jae quickly put down the bread.\n\"Hey, wait a minute.\"\n\"It's not 'hey.'\"\nAs the foot moved, the hem of his pants swayed helplessly, tickling his ankle. Cha Eui-jae, with his eyes tightly shut, gave the answer that was wanted.\n\"...Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Yes. I'm right here.\"\n\"Why are you touching my foot?\"\n\"Well...\"\nLee Sa-young smiled gently.\n\"Because I want to.\"\n\"You think you can do anything just because you want to?\"\n\"But.\"\nJust as Cha Eui-jae thought the foot that had been lingering at the hem of his pants was about to withdraw, it slid up, softly filling the hollow of his sole as if it belonged there.\nLee Sa-young slightly lifted his chin.\n\"You'll accept it, won't you?\"\n'This guy, why is he so restless with his foot?'\nWas the strange feeling because of the scenery he'd seen in the room earlier, or was it because of Lee Sa-young's face that had flushed red? He couldn't tell. His foot curled up.\n\"What kind of nonsense is this... Hey, get your foot off.\"\nJust as Cha Eui-jae was about to hide his foot under the chair,\n\"Can't handle even this? After biting my finger like that.\"\nLee Sa-young raised his finger, with a bandage still wrapped around it, showing it off. Seeing the bandage on his left ring finger, Cha Eui-jae was left speechless. Now, Lee Sa-young would bring up his finger whenever he got the chance. With a conflicted expression, Cha Eui-jae picked up the bread again. The soft skin rubbed against the hollow of his sole. Lee Sa-young, resting his chin on his hand, muttered lazily.\n\"It seems like... the versions of us in this world are pretty close.\"\nClose... Cha Eui-jae coughed lightly, covering his mouth. The memory of a bed large enough for two people and two items clearly belonging to different people was vivid. The heat rising in his cheeks and ears was unmistakable. Even if it wasn't as much as Lee Sa-young, he was probably blushing quite a bit.\n'Damn, why doesn't my poker face trait activate in times like these?'\nCha Eui-jae, who had been coughing sporadically, suddenly paused.\n'...Now that I think about it, it's like it disappeared entirely at some point...'\nBut before he could continue his thoughts, Lee Sa-young smirked, lifting the corner of his mouth.\n\"What on earth were you thinking... Your face is bright red.\"\n\"...I just choked on something.\"\n\"Oh, I see...\"\n\"I'm serious.\"\n\"Sure, sure. But I was talking about us as family...\"\nLee Sa-young shrugged and gestured toward the living room with his eyes.\n\"...There was a picture of us together.\"\n\"Picture?\"\n\"You didn't see it? You must've been really out of it... Take a look later.\"\nLee Sa-young said, then picked up a piece of egg roll with his fork and started eating it, nibbling slowly. He had been smiling just a moment ago, but as soon as the food went into his mouth, he frowned. It was odd.\n\"Is the egg roll not good? If you don't like it, don't eat it.\"\n\"No...\"\nLee Sa-young grimaced slightly.\n\"I just thought... it's been a while.\"\n\"What's been a while?\"\n\"Well...\"\nLee Sa-young mumbled as he slowly chewed and swallowed the egg roll.\n\"Eating while actually tasting the food.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"Oh, don't worry about it. It's nothing.\"\nLee Sa-young, who answered dismissively, started spreading jam on his bread. Cha Eui-jae pressed his lips together.\nHad he not been able to taste his food all this time? But he seemed to enjoy the food at the hangover soup restaurant.\nThen, suddenly, a memory surfaced. The day Lee Sa-young first came to the hangover soup restaurant, the first time he ate hangover soup. Cha Eui-jae remembered clearly because he watched intently from the moment Lee Sa-young took the first bite, just to see how he would react.\nCome to think of it...\n\"The broth is hot.\"\n\"The meat is tender.\"\nThere was no evaluation of the taste.\n'This damn poison.'\n\"Why, do you feel sorry for me?\"\nCha Eui-jae lifted his head. Lee Sa-young took a deliberate bite of the jam-covered bread and chewed it slowly. His Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he swallowed, and he wiped the crumbs from the corner of his mouth with his thumb.\n\"If you feel sorry for me.\"\nThe soft skin rubbed against his foot again. Lee Sa-young smiled gently.\n\"Don't push me away.\"\nCha Eui-jae stayed silent. In truth, both of them knew. That Cha Eui-jae didn't truly pity Lee Sa-young, and that he wouldn't push Lee Sa-young's foot away. This was just...\n\"...\"\nAn excuse. An excuse for Cha Eui-jae.\nSometimes, there are things that must be left unsaid, even when understood.\nThere are also emotions that one doesn't know how to name.\nThat's why Cha Eui-jae didn't avoid the warmth pressing against him. Instead, he lightly tapped Lee Sa-young's ankle with the tip of his foot. Pretending it was an accident.\n***\nCha Eui-jae picked up the small frame placed in the living room drawer. It was a photo of Cha Eui-jae and Lee Sa-young, warmly embracing each other around the shoulders and waist, smiling at the camera. A world where the West Sea rift had not occurred.\nIf the West Sea rift hadn't happened, could they have lived like this? Like a family.\nAt that moment, the phone in his pocket buzzed. Cha Eui-jae put down the frame and hesitated as he checked the phone screen. It was a text message.\n[Our Cha Eui-jae, have a good lunch! Are you getting along well with Lee Sa-young? Let's have a call tonight~^^]\nThe message, suffocating with its lack of spacing and a smiley face at the end, was from...\n'Aunt.'\nPark Hye-kyung. Cha Eui-jae pressed the familiar number and checked the message box. There were countless texts exchanged, and the call history showed a call at least every two days.\n'So, Aunt is alive in this world too...'\nCha Eui-jae rubbed the screen as if he could physically touch the words in the message. The sunlight pouring in from the large window was bright and warm, almost blinding.\nThis place is perfect and peaceful, as if it was crafted from only the best memories.\nSwish... The sound of water flowing from the sink filled the air. Cha Eui-jae looked up. Lee Sa-young stood straight in the kitchen, rinsing the bubbles off the dishes. Perhaps sensing the gaze, Lee Sa-young turned his head. Their eyes met, and there was a puzzled look in Lee Sa-young's violet eyes.\n'...'\nCha Eui-jae turned off the phone screen and shoved it back into his pocket. The immediate issue had been dealt with, so it was time to find a way to escape the dungeon.\nThe view outside the window hadn't changed much since before. Surely the answer lay outside. This house must be a kind of safe zone, or perhaps a base camp.\nHe headed towards the front door. The door was unique in that it wasn't equipped with a digital lock but rather opened with a key. He unlocked it and cautiously grasped the handle.\n'Let's just check what's outside the door.'\nCha Eui-jae was prepared to face a monster the moment he opened the door. He gripped the doorknob firmly and turned it. Then,\n\"...What the...\"\nHe was met with an empty void.\nThud, roll... A single shoe, kicked by his foot, rolled past the threshold and into the endless darkness beyond. No sound of it hitting the ground was heard. Outside the door was a sheer cliff, and everything around was pitch black. It was literally 'void.' Faced with this bottomless darkness, Cha Eui-jae froze, still holding the doorknob. A voice called out from afar.\n\"Hyung?\"\n'What is this?'\nThis couldn't be right. If the outside looked like this, then what was the scenery reflected in the window? Where was the dungeon's master? What were the boundaries of this dungeon?\nAt that moment, the sound of hurried footsteps approached, and damp hands and arms wrapped around his waist like a snake. Thud, a firm chest pressed against his back. Then a large hand covered the one holding the doorknob.\nBang!\nThe door slammed shut. Cha Eui-jae heard slightly heavy breaths near his ear. Only then did he snap out of it. With a long exhale, Lee Sa-young rested his head on Cha Eui-jae's shoulder before quickly lifting it.\n\"Are you crazy?\"\n\"No, just now... Did you see that?\"\n\"I did. If it looks like that outside, the first thing you should do is shut the door. What were you standing there dazed for?\"\nLee Sa-young snapped sharply. However, Cha Eui-jae stared blankly at the firmly closed door.\nThis place was a memorial dungeon, created based on someone's memory. The range of the dungeon...\nCha Eui-jae murmured.\n\"This house is...\"\n\"What?\"\n\"The range of the dungeon, I think it's this house.\"\nOnly this house... A creeping sense of unease slithered up from his feet. The dungeon was this house. Most dungeons are cleared by killing the dungeon's master.\nIf that's the case, the dungeon's master is inside this house...\n'No, no.'\nHe needed to break his habit of always assuming the worst. Cha Eui-jae bit the inside of his cheek and tightened his grip on the doorknob. At that moment, something caught on his fingertips. His eyes widened. Lee Sa-young, still holding his waist, tugged at him impatiently.\n\"What are you doing, still hanging on to the door?\"\n\"Wait, just a second.\"\nThere was something like a scratch under the doorknob. Cha Eui-jae released Lee Sa-young's arms from around his waist and squatted in front of the door to inspect the area under the doorknob.\nThe clearly etched scratch was...\n[HYS]\nIt looked like letters. Cha Eui-jae traced the scratch with his fingernail and muttered softly.\n\"HYS...?\"\n\"HYS, you say?\"\n\"Yeah. It's carved right here, under the doorknob.\"\nAs soon as Lee Sa-young heard the letters, he clicked his tongue.\n\"Why the hell would that guy's initials be here...\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"...You said this place is a dungeon, right? Created based on someone's memory.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"...Hong Ye-seong could create dungeons too. Since he can manipulate his own space, it's not impossible...\"\n\"Hong Ye-seong?\"\nHong Ye-seong's face, smiling brightly with a thumbs-up, floated vividly in Cha Eui-jae's mind. Annoying as he was, his abilities were top-notch. Lee Sa-young responded with a dissatisfied expression, arms crossed.\n\"That guy has a strong sense of narcissism... He leaves his signature on most things he touches. He carves Chinese characters on works he considers masterpieces, and uses English initials for things he made for fun.\"\n\"So, does that mean he made this too...\"\n\"If it's not just the doorknob... then it's likely Hong Ye-seong made this dungeon too.\"\nLee Sa-young murmured while pressing his fingers to his temple.\n\"More precisely, the Hong Ye-seong of this world.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Watching From the Gaps\nIt was hard to believe. Cha Eui-jae, who was still fiddling with the doorknob, asked seriously.\n\"Is that even possible? For a human to create a dungeon?\"\n\"Well...\"\nLee Sa-young shrugged.\n\"It's just a possibility. I'm not sure. The chances are low.\"\n\"...I suppose so.\"\n\"But... among the people I know with that much narcissism...\"\nHe glanced at the doorknob and continued.\n\"There's only Hong Ye-seong.\"\nCha Eui-jae also knew Hong Ye-seong's abilities, having used the window he created. His skills were indeed impressive. But no matter how skilled an artisan is, creating a dungeon seems like something within the system's domain.\nThe image of Hong Ye-seong getting slapped by Kkokko flashed through his mind, along with him giving a thumbs-up. And that time he trembled like a newborn alpaca while holding Jung Bin.\n'...Him?'\nCha Eui-jae looked around.\n'This?'\n...No way. It seemed more plausible that he had only created the doorknob. Cha Eui-jae shook his head to dismiss the thought. Just then, Lee Sa-young muttered.\n\"If by any chance, this was really made by Hong Ye-seong...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Then it's actually not so bad. There's no need to worry.\"\n\"Huh? Why?\"\nShouldn't that be something to worry about? Cha Eui-jae looked up at Lee Sa-young with a puzzled expression. Lee Sa-young lowered his gaze, seemingly lost in thought as he fiddled with his lower lip.\n\"Because... even though he's a bit out of his mind, he's not a bad guy.\"\nWas he serious?\nCha Eui-jae's face was filled with doubt. Lee Sa-young let out a small laugh.\n\"I probably know Hong Ye-seong better than you do, Hyung.\"\n\"...That's true.\"\n\"Trust me, just this once. He doesn't have bad intentions. And besides...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Good things will happen, more than you think.\"\nLee Sa-young extended his hand to Cha Eui-jae, who was still squatting.\n\"Get up.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nCha Eui-jae took the offered hand without hesitation. Lee Sa-young pulled him up with force, and Cha Eui-jae brushed off his pants.\nThen, looking at Lee Sa-young, who had his hands on his hips and was squinting, Cha Eui-jae instinctively knew. The interrogation was about to begin.\n\"I just took my eyes off you for a moment, and... why did you open the door?\"\n\"Well... I need to figure out how to clear the dungeon. We can't stay stuck here forever.\"\n\"You could've done it with me.\"\n\"No, you haven't awakened yet. You're just a normal person right now, and I can handle things immediately if something happens.\"\n\"Oh, here we go with the excuses again.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You always do this.\"\nLee Sa-young twisted his lips. His displeasure was obvious, but Cha Eui-jae couldn't back down on this issue. If he were in his original body, maybe, but he couldn't let an unawakened person face the dangers of the dungeon. Especially if that person was Lee Sa-young.\n\"Fine, that aside. But why were you just staring blankly out the door, as if you were about to fall off?\"\n\"That was because I was startled.\"\n\"If it happens again, you might actually fall.\"\n\"It won't happen next time.\"\n\"How can I believe that?\"\nCha Eui-jae hesitated and looked up. Lee Sa-young's delicate face was shadowed with a faint gloom. His lips moved slightly.\n\"How can I believe you, how can I?\"\nThere were many things he wanted to say, things he was about to say. But at that moment, seeing that face, it was like someone had spilled white paint all over his thoughts, and all his words disappeared. He could only stare blankly at Lee Sa-young.\nLee Sa-young, glaring at Cha Eui-jae, let out a frustrated sigh.\n\"Now I see why you awakened.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It must've been out of frustration and anger.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Because you couldn't do anything.\"\nLee Sa-young snapped sharply before turning and disappearing down the hallway. Left alone, Cha Eui-jae looked down at his empty hands. In this body, there were no cracks on his palms, no shimmering golden chains.\nThe sound of footsteps stopped, and the sound of water ceased. Silence filled the space. Cha Eui-jae stood in the entranceway, staring at the empty hallway.\nWhy did I think Lee Sa-young would be okay?\nIn the midst of the silence, he heard a faint sound of breathing. As if in a trance, Cha Eui-jae began to move. He stepped onto the wooden floor and crossed the long hallway. A blue sea photograph passed by his vision.\nAt the end of the hallway, Lee Sa-young was standing by the sink, his head bowed. Without hesitation, Cha Eui-jae approached and wrapped his arms around the broad back. The body in his arms flinched, and the breathing became slightly rougher. He pressed his ear against the back. The heart was beating rapidly. Cha Eui-jae murmured softly.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I wasn't thinking clearly.\"\nCha Eui-jae was a mess. He had been since the moment he entered the West Sea rift, up until now. It had become too normal for him. But there was someone for whom it wasn't normal. Someone who worried about him.\nCha Eui-jae tightened his grip around Lee Sa-young's waist.\nJust because someone says it's okay, doesn't mean everything will be okay.\n\"You were worried, weren't you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nA knot in his heart that he didn't even know was there began to dissolve. Lee Sa-young placed his hand on top of Cha Eui-jae's, gently pushing him away. When Cha Eui-jae loosened his grip, Lee Sa-young turned around.\nCha Eui-jae couldn't see his face. He was immediately pulled into an embrace. A large hand cradled the back of his head and his waist. Long fingers tangled gently in his hair.\nAre you listening to my heartbeat right now?\nCha Eui-jae blinked and wrapped his arms around Lee Sa-young's neck, resting his head on the sturdy shoulder.\nI hope he can't hear it.\nBoth of their hearts were pounding, all over the place.\n***\nLet's assume that this space was created by Hong Ye-seong. Hmm... it's hard to believe, but even the almighty Hong Ye-seong seemed to have no control over the TV program schedule.\n'Or... did he mess with it and this is the result?'\nIgnoring the hair tickling the back of his neck, Cha Eui-jae pressed the remote control buttons firmly.\nOnly documentaries were playing on the TV. A smart octopus teacher, the daily life of penguins, a panda lazily napping in a tree, a family of elephants, and so on. Even the entertainment channels were showing videos of tigers yawning.\n'I was hoping to watch a movie.'\nCha Eui-jae put down the remote on a channel where penguins were sliding across the ice on their bellies. From nearby, he could hear soft, steady breathing. Cha Eui-jae pulled the person closer by their shoulder. Lee Sa-young, with his eyes closed, mumbled softly.\nHugging and apologizing? That was nice. Holding him? That was nice too. Though it seemed like situations that required an apology kept happening. Anyway,\nLee Sa-young didn't let go of Cha Eui-jae for a long time. Even when Cha Eui-jae tried to move away by loosening his arms around Lee Sa-young's neck, Lee Sa-young growled in protest. But they couldn't stay like that forever. The sun was slowly setting outside, as seen through the window. It seems that time flows differently in this space.\n'Who knows? Maybe spending a day here is the clear condition.'\nFor once, he entertained an optimistic thought. So, patting Lee Sa-young on the back, who clung to him like a koala, he suggested they watch a movie on the sofa after finishing the dishes. Only then did Lee Sa-young finally release him from his embrace.\nAnd now, here they were. No movie, just animal documentaries on TV, and Lee Sa-young taking a nap beside him.\nThough Lee Sa-young didn't show it, he must have been very stressed or tired because as soon as he settled next to Cha Eui-jae, he began nodding off. Feeling sorry for his head bobbing around, Cha Eui-jae let him rest against him...\n'It might be better to just put him to bed.'\nWhile he was wrestling with the TV, darkness had already taken over where the sunset had faded. Looking out into the dim light outside, Cha Eui-jae turned off the TV and gently shook Lee Sa-young awake.\n\"Wake up. Let's go to bed.\"\n\"...Huh? Mmm.\"\nLee Sa-young slowly lifted his head. Cha Eui-jae stood up and offered his hand.\n\"Come on, get up.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young obediently took his hand. As Cha Eui-jae led him to the bedroom, he was confronted with the king-sized bed he had momentarily forgotten about. A slight headache began to creep in, but Lee Sa-young came first. Cha Eui-jae pulled back the covers, and Lee Sa-young quietly climbed into bed. After tucking the blanket up to his neck, Lee Sa-young slowly opened his eyes.\n\"...What about you, Hyung?\"\n\"Me?\"\n\"Aren't you going to sleep?\"\n\"...\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae hesitated without answering, Lee Sa-young's sleepy eyes sharpened.\n\"Don't start talking nonsense about sleeping on the sofa again... lie down next to me.\"\n'Damn.'\n\"There are even two pillows...\"\nWhy is he so sharp, even when he's sleepy? With his lips tightly pressed together, Cha Eui-jae lay down next to him. Lee Sa-young quickly pulled the blanket over him. Cha Eui-jae turned on the nightlight on his side and stared blankly at the ceiling.\nThe soft orange light, the sound of breathing right next to him, the cozy mattress, and the warm blanket.\n\"...\"\nIs it okay for things to be this perfect?\nThis place feels like a box filled only with precious and good things. So sweet and perfect that I don't want to break it.\n'Ah.'\nCha Eui-jae's mouth opened slightly. Is this why Lee Sa-young was needed?\nHe turned his body toward Lee Sa-young, who had also shifted his head in his direction as if sensing the movement.\nSleepy violet eyes looked at Cha Eui-jae. He propped himself up on his elbow and observed Lee Sa-young.\n\"...Hyung?\"\nLee Sa-young called out to him in a slightly hoarse voice. Instead of answering, Cha Eui-jae reached out and held the hand hidden under the blanket. He could clearly feel the band wrapped around the first knuckle of Lee Sa-young's finger. As stiff fingers intertwined with his, they fit together without a gap. His thumb gently stroked the back of Lee Sa-young's hand.\nHe knew instinctively.\nThe owner of this memory is Cha Eui-jae. After all, this place is a collection of everything Cha Eui-jae is vulnerable to.\nIf that's the case, the way to clear it should be exactly as Cha Eui-jae thinks.\nI've always wanted to say this.\nIt might have been an ordinary part of everyday life. But not for the two who visited this place now. That's why they had to bear the anxiety about the unknown and take a longer journey back.\n'But it's okay.'\nCha Eui-jae smiled. He reached out and covered Lee Sa-young's eyes. Just before they were hidden, he saw Lee Sa-young's eyes widen. Cha Eui-jae sat up and placed his lips on the back of his hand, whispering softly.\nDoing what seems obvious but isn't.\n\"Good night.\"\nAt the same time, a bright white window appeared.\n[Dungeon Clear!]\nThe thick, soft blanket, the plush mattress, the gentle bedroom light— everything began to turn into white ash and scatter. But the warmth felt from the touch of skin and the grip of hands remained tangible.\nThat alone was real.",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Watching From the Gaps\nThe bed where they had lain, followed by the frame and walls that had formed the house, disappeared, leaving a pure white void in its place.\nIn the midst of the swirling white ash, like a small storm, Cha Eui-jae pulled the hand he was holding, embracing the large body as if to protect it. The large body was drawn in without resistance. But it was only for a moment— soon, the warmth that had been in his arms gradually faded.\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. He released the arms that had been wrapped around his back and opened his hands to check. They were empty— his arms, his hands.\nCha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and shouted.\n\"Lee Sa-young!\"\nIn that instant, Cha Eui-jae's eyes opened wide. In the emptiness where there had been nothing, someone dressed in black was kneeling, leaning their upper body against something black. It was a familiar yet unfamiliar figure from behind. Of course, seeing one's own back is rare, but he could tell.\nThat was 'me.'\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly at the figure's back. Eventually, 'he' lifted his head. Slowly rising, 'he' looked down at what he had been leaning on. It was a black coffin. He spoke softly, tenderly.\n\"It's okay.\"\n\"Just sleep a little longer.\"\nThe next moment, 'Cha Eui-jae' was walking. He crossed a yard filled with dry, dead grass. In one corner of the yard, flames roared fiercely from a kiln, and a harsh smell stung his nostrils. 'Cha Eui-jae' roughly slid open the tightly shut sliding door.\nIn the middle of the workshop, cluttered with tools and materials, Hong Ye-seong, wearing a magnifying glass that protruded like a lens, straightened his hunched body. His dirt-covered three-stripe slippers slapped against the floor.\n\"Hey, wipe off the blood before you come in.\"\n'Cha Eui-jae' roughly wiped the blood on his mask with the back of his hand. His lips twitched.\n\"It's not my blood.\"\n\"Of course it isn't. Is it still that bad outside?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's too late.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I didn't come here just to talk about this... Hong Ye-seong, you said you could manipulate space, right?\"\nHong Ye-seong blinked and shrugged.\n\"Huh? Well, as you can see, it's nothing grand. Just enough to arrange my little nest.\"\n\"I need you to do one thing.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Create a space using my memories. It can be very small.\"\n\"What? All of a sudden?\"\n\"Can't you?\"\n\"Hey, what do you take me for... well, it might not work, but I think I can give it a try.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But why all of a sudden?\"\nHong Ye-seong's face filled with unease.\n\"Don't tell me... Lee Sa-young... hmm, are you planning to follow him?\"\n\"...You've noticed too, but this world is on the brink of collapse. It's already past the limit.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I can't do it alone. Even with you, it's not enough.\"\nHong Ye-seong rubbed his cheek with a gloomy expression.\n\"...Fortunately, there's still one last resort.\"\n'Cha Eui-jae' abruptly rolled up the sleeve of his battle uniform. Then he boldly showed his left wrist. A sleek silver watch, without a single scratch, gleamed. An ethereal golden aura began to rise like smoke over the watch's glass.\nThen, he took off his mask. His face was marked with exhaustion, and his eyes were swollen and red. But his eyes still shone with a vivid blue light.\n\"I'm going to turn back time. To before the end happens.\"\n\"But to use that, you need... a pivot, don't you?\"\n\"I'll be the pivot. I've experienced it once before, so I won't fail next time. I'll have time to prepare.\"\nHong Ye-seong gulped. He asked in a low voice.\n\"Is that really the only reason?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Aren't there other reasons...\"\n'Cha Eui-jae' didn't answer and kept his lips tightly shut. By now, Cha Eui-jae had separated from 'him,' watching them from a step back.\nCha Eui-jae doesn't give up. Not when there's something to protect.\nAnd yet, he gave up.\nCha Eui-jae thought of the black coffin. He felt he knew who the owner of that coffin was. No, he might have realized it the moment he saw it. The owner of that coffin...\nA face with narrowed eyes and a smile came to mind. The voice that softly called out to him.\n\"Hyung.\"\nLee Sa-young. His mouth went dry. He muttered as if spitting out the words.\n\"I won't lose again.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Never.\"\nHong Ye-seong looked at 'Cha Eui-jae' with a face full of pity, but he didn't say anything more. Instead, he brought over a box from the corner and began rummaging through it. The box was filled with magic stones of various colors and sizes. He held up a violet magic stone to the light from the ceiling and asked.\n\"Alright. So why do you want to leave the memories? What good will that do?\"\n\"...\"\nA rumbling... the ground shook. The materials piled on the shelves clattered and tumbled to the floor.\nHong Ye-seong screamed, scrambling to pick up the fallen materials. 'Cha Eui-jae' looked out the door. The sky was covered in a white vortex. It could no longer be called the sky— it was something else entirely. White ash swirled like snow.\nCha Eui-jae's lips moved. 'Cha Eui-jae's' and Cha Eui-jae's voices overlapped.\n\"Because it'll help me endure.\"\nIf I gather up the best and kindest things, even if a day comes when I can't endure life any longer...\nAt least, for a moment, I can breathe there.\nSuddenly, everything around him turned black and white. The flow of the air, the falling and swaying materials, even 'Cha Eui-jae' and Hong Ye-seong— all froze like a scene in a black-and-white photograph. No one was alive; no one breathed. Eventually, everything began to crumble like dust.\nAt that moment, he felt a gaze from somewhere. In the crumbling, collapsing black-and-white photograph, something was still moving. The golden Eyes of Appraisal shone brightly. Countless overlapping patterns were alive, breathing.\nThe Eyes of Appraisal stared intently at Cha Eui-jae. Was that a signal? The frozen Hong Ye-seong creaked and twitched. He slowly raised his hand. Then, with a stiff, doll-like motion, he pointed precisely at Cha Eui-jae. A chill ran down his spine. His dazed mind cleared.\nHis lips moved.\nThis is the third and final chance.\nYou can't hold out any longer. Neither can he, nor can you.\nDon't fail this time.\nWhat does that mean? He tried to ask, but his mouth and body wouldn't move. A strong gust of wind swept Cha Eui-jae away. The lips below the golden Eyes of Appraisal curved into a long arc.\nI'm watching.\nExplain what you mean right now! With superhuman effort, Cha Eui-jae managed to raise his arm. He reached out to Hong Ye-seong, but he was already too far away. The doll-like Hong Ye-seong in the black-and-white photograph waved stiffly.\nGoodbye, my friend.\nYou bastard! Overcome with anger, Cha Eui-jae managed to move his stiff hand to flip him off. Haha... The hearty laughter faded.\nFlash!\nA blinding light, like a camera flash, burst forth. Cha Eui-jae shut his eyes tightly.\n***\nWhen Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes, he found himself floating in a vast, white void. It felt as if he had become a glass bottle drifting aimlessly on the sea. However, while his body was at peace, his mind was in turmoil. The third time, failure, Lee Sa-young... His mind, overwhelmed by the sudden flood of information, screamed in protest.\nDidn't Cha Eui-jae die first in the fragment that Yoon Ga-eul showed him?\nWhy was he alive in the scene he just witnessed?\nIs Yoon Ga-eul okay? Is this even the same world that Yoon Ga-eul was pulled into?\nWhy am I friends with Hong Ye-seong?\nSetting that aside, why did I turn back time, and why don't I have any memories?\nWho was that Lee Sa-young sitting alone in the dark space?\nDamn it, where is Lee Sa-young now?\nAs his thoughts swirled like a vortex, the last image that stood out was Lee Sa-young, who had been in his arms but suddenly vanished. Cha Eui-jae frowned. Did he return to the original world? After all, he had come over due to the system's reward. It would be better if that were the case...\nAt that moment, the empty space around him began to hum.\n...\n\"...Huh?\"\nCha Eui-jae looked up. The hum grew louder and more distinct.\n...Hyung.\nFinally, he recognized the voice. It was Lee Sa-young's. What the hell? Where are you? Cha Eui-jae stretched his neck out like a turtle. Then,\nCha Eui-jae!\nLee Sa-young called his name loudly. Overcome with emotion, Cha Eui-jae started to get up. Is he calling hyung's name—?\n\"Just recklessly—!\"\nCha Eui-jae opened his eyes. The white void was gone, replaced by familiar ruins where white ash drifted in the air. He blinked slowly. His heart suddenly races.\nThe scene looked too similar to the interior of the West Sea rift. No, this might actually be the West Sea rift. Perhaps he had finally been dragged there...\nJust then, he felt a strong pressure against his upper body.\n\"Shit...\"\nAt the same time, he felt the soft sensation of hair brushing against him. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath. He was being embraced by Lee Sa-young. The warmth of their bodies and the sound of two rapidly beating hearts filled the space.\nLee Sa-young, gripping the fabric of his shirt as if he might tear it, muttered,\n\"You wouldn't wake up...\"\nCha Eui-jae gently patted Lee Sa-young's back.\nA deep, resonant sound echoed around them. Still held in Lee Sa-young's embrace, Cha Eui-jae looked up.\nHis blue eyes quickly scanned the surroundings. Nearby, he saw a familiar flicker of flames. It was Yoon Ga-eul. But soon, a massive shadow engulfed the flames. Cha Eui-jae raised his gaze, searching for the source of the sound.\nBeyond the white horizon, from the sea of white ash, a giant whale breached.",

      "content": "Chapter 136: Watching From the Gaps\n'...A whale?'\nWith the hand that had been patting Lee Sa-young's back, Cha Eui-jae pressed down on his head, gently encouraging him to lean on him. A sweet fragrance filled the air.\nThe whale with a pure white body was enormous. Just from its appearance, it didn't seem to be a monster, but he couldn't be sure. There was too little information. Was it a hostile entity, a creature residing in the sea of a ruined world, or maybe...\n\"...Hyung.\"\nLee Sa-young whispered. Cha Eui-jae snapped back to reality. The whale that had leapt so high had already disappeared into the sea. The surroundings were silent, as if the whale had never appeared. Cha Eui-jae let out a small sigh before answering.\n\"Yeah, Sa-young.\"\n\"...Are you okay?\"\n\"I'm okay.\"\n\"...Really?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm really okay.\"\nLee Sa-young's grip on Cha Eui-jae's clothes loosened. Cha Eui-jae patted Lee Sa-young's back a couple of times and gently pushed him away. Lee Sa-young's face was even paler than usual. Sweat had matted some strands of hair to his forehead. He mumbled,\n\"You wouldn't wake up...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I tried waking you for a long time, but you just wouldn't get up. Hyung...\"\nHis muttering was as if he were entranced. His violet eyes, lacking their usual light, stared off into the void, not at Cha Eui-jae. A dark aura flickered in his eyes. Then, Lee Sa-young roughly rubbed his face, small curses slipping through his fingers.\n\"Damn it...\"\n\"I told you, I'm fine. Calm down.\"\n\"Ah, ugh...\"\nBut Lee Sa-young clutched at the front of his clothes as if in pain. He let out a small groan. His breath quickened, his clothes wrinkling as he gripped them tighter. It wasn't the usual annoyance or irritation. This was different. This was...\n\"What kind of hero are you if you can't even save us!\"\nSomeone had once screamed those words in a tearing voice. Cha Eui-jae couldn't remember who it was. He bit his tongue, tasting the metallic tang of blood. Yeah, it was the behavior of hunters whose mental strength had reached its limit. And J had seen many such hunters.\n...So many.\nLee Sa-young was now hunched over, struggling to breathe. His breathing grew faster with no sign of calming down. His breathing cycles became shorter, and the veins stood out on the back of his hand as he gripped his chest. It was hyperventilation.\nCha Eui-jae scanned the area with his Tracker's Eye. Yoon Ga-eul was still in the same spot he'd seen earlier, not far away. Judging by the intensity and movement of the flames around her, she didn't seem to have been hurt.\nIf that was the case...\nGritting his teeth, Cha Eui-jae cupped both of Lee Sa-young's cheeks.\n\"Lee Sa-young, look at me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm right here.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Lee Sa-young!\"\nViolet eyes wandered through the empty air, unable to focus on Cha Eui-jae right in front of him. His pale face grew even more ashen. A chill ran down Cha Eui-jae's spine.\n\"...\"\nCould it be because he had seen 'those' memories?\nCha Eui-jae climbed onto Lee Sa-young's lap, supporting the back of his neck with one hand and covering the hand gripping his clothes with the other. He gently rubbed the veins protruding from Lee Sa-young's hand, trying to soothe him. Lee Sa-young's head lolled backward. His mouth hung open, gasping for air sporadically.\nWas it because the memories inside the Memorial Dungeon, those of 'Cha Eui-jae,' were so sweet?\nSlowly, Cha Eui-jae leaned down.\nNo, those were just excuses.\nA sweet scent filled the air,\nAnd maybe, just maybe, Cha Eui-jae...\nTheir soft lips met.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae tilted his head, deepening the kiss as warmth spread between them. He exhaled all his breath into Lee Sa-young's slightly parted lips, then inhaled again before kissing him once more. He could feel the strength slowly leaving Lee Sa-young's grip on his clothes.\nHow much time had passed? Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes.\nThe violet eyes, now focused, were filled with nothing but Cha Eui-jae.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae slowly pulled away from the kiss, his hand releasing Lee Sa-young's grip. But just as he began to move, a large hand grabbed his wrist tightly. Their eyes met.\nCha Eui-jae spoke.\n\"...I told you, I have skills.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I don't lie like someone else.\"\nThe warmth of Lee Sa-young's hand crept between Cha Eui-jae's fingers. His strong arms wrapped around Cha Eui-jae's waist. The violet eyes gleamed fiercely, as if they would devour him, and the lips, swollen and red, parted. A cracked voice sweetly whispered, almost as if in seduction.\n\"Not yet.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just a little longer.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young.\nCha Eui-jae's only success.\nAnd...\nCha Eui-jae slowly leaned down. Something soft slipped between Lee Sa-young's slightly parted lips, their tongues tangling as a wet sound echoed between them. Each time Lee Sa-young's dark tongue rubbed against the roof of his mouth, Cha Eui-jae's body jolted.\nHe wrapped his arms around Lee Sa-young's neck, their chests pressing tightly together, leaving no space between them. Their hearts were beating wildly. This time, surely, Lee Sa-young could hear it all too. After all...\n[Trait: Basilisk's Venom (S+) activated.]\n[Due to the effect of Basilisk's Venom (S+), you have developed resistance to toxins you've already detoxified.]\n[The detoxification speed has increased.]\n[You will not suffer physical damage.]\n[Detoxifying...]\nThere's no way an S-grade Awakener wouldn't hear it, right?\nIgnoring the barrage of system messages, Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes. Their lips parted with a soft sound. A quiet laugh slipped out, barely audible.\n\"You're right.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You weren't lying...\"\nLee Sa-young sighed, the sound so sweet it seemed to melt the air. He lowered his head, pressing his lips to Cha Eui-jae's neck. Cha Eui-jae glanced down at Lee Sa-young's tousled black hair, then gently rested his cheek against it.\nA burning heat enveloped them both. In the stillness of the ruins, Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes and listened to the sound of their hearts.\nLee Sa-young tasted sweet.\n***\nCrunch, crunch... The white ash piled high on the ground was softer underfoot than snow. Behind the two figures, long footprints trailed like a tail on the white ash.\nBlue eyes quickly scanned the surroundings. The place where the flames flickered most violently was a ruined house, with its skeleton and some structure still intact. Cha Eui-jae peered behind a wall.\n\"Yoon Ga-eul!\"\nIn a corner of the room, untouched by the ash, was a black lump. It seemed to be Yoon Ga-eul.\nCha Eui-jae hurriedly ran towards the lump. The closer he got, the louder the sound of labored breathing became. Upon closer inspection, the black lump was actually a black leather coat, worn and aged, having lost its original luster.\nHe carefully lifted the coat. Underneath was Yoon Ga-eul's face, eyes closed peacefully as if asleep. She was dressed in a school uniform. He placed his hand under her nose and felt the breath of life.\n\"Ah...\"\nThank goodness. Although he knew she was alive, feeling and confirming it with his own body was another matter entirely. Cha Eui-jae gently shook Yoon Ga-eul's shoulder.\n\"Ga-eul, wake up. Ga-eul!\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nYoon Ga-eul frowned and groaned. Lee Sa-young, who was standing beside them with his arms crossed, tilted his head sideways with a smirk.\n\"Wouldn't it be faster to just slap her awake?\"\n\"Hey, why would you hit a student?\"\n\"I slapped Bae Won-woo to wake him up.\"\n\"Like that's something to brag about, idiot.\"\nWhile Cha Eui-jae bickered with Lee Sa-young, Yoon Ga-eul, who had been stirring, slowly opened her eyes.\n\"What...\"\n\"Oh, you're awake?\"\n\"Uh, uh, uh, J! It's J, you're here!\"\nYoon Ga-eul screamed and quickly sat up. But she must have moved too fast because she immediately grabbed her head, groaning in pain.\n\"Ah, ow...\"\n\"Calm down. There's nothing dangerous around here. I checked the area on the way in, and it's really just us.\"\n\"Y-yes...\"\nStill clutching her head, Yoon Ga-eul looked at Cha Eui-jae and Lee Sa-young and began to tear up.\n\"Oh, really, sniff, I'm really sorry. Sob... You came all the way here because of me...\"\n\"No, don't think like that.\"\n\"But... sniff.\"\nYoon Ga-eul pouted her lips like a duck, trying to hold back her tears. She roughly rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand. Cha Eui-jae squatted in front of her, watching her, and then smiled.\n\"Still, I'm glad you're safe, Ga-eul.\"\nAt that moment.\n\"...Sniff.\"\n\"...Hmm?\"\n\"Waaah! Really, sniff, huuuh...\"\nYoon Ga-eul suddenly burst into loud sobs. Why, why is she crying all of a sudden? Cha Eui-jae turned around to look at Lee Sa-young with a bewildered expression. Lee Sa-young curled his lips into a grin.\n\"Hyung made her cry.\"\n\"...Me?\"\n\"Waaahhh!\"\n\"Maybe you should comfort her? I don't think we can talk until she stops crying.\"\nLee Sa-young nodded with a smile. Cha Eui-jae fumbled in his pocket, then his gaze fell on the coat in his hand. It was old and worn, but strangely familiar.\n\"...\"\nWhere had he seen it before?\nCha Eui-jae frowned as he fiddled with the coat, and then suddenly, a memory flashed through his mind.\n\"Ah!\"\nCha Eui-jae thrust the coat at the crying Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"Ga-eul! Ga-eul!\"\n\"You're not seriously giving that to her to wipe her tears, are you? ...It's filthy.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young, just hold on a second. Ga-eul!\"\n\"Sniff... Yes?\"\nYoon Ga-eul, still hiccuping, looked back and forth between Cha Eui-jae and the coat. Cha Eui-jae pointed at the coat in his hand, his eyes shining.\n\"This, isn't this the one from the fragment? That one!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 137: Watching From the Gaps\n\"Sniff, sorry. Just a moment... Wh-what is it?\"\nYoon Ga-eul roughly wiped her eyes with her sleeve and then looked over the coat. Though she still occasionally shuddered as if holding back tears, she seemed much calmer.\nCha Eui-jae lightly tapped the surface of the coat with his fingertip. Their eyes met. Without making a sound, he mouthed the words,\n\"Fragment, Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"...Ah, gasp!\"\nYoon Ga-eul's eyes widened. She scrambled to her feet and asked hurriedly,\n\"Could you spread it out a bit more?\"\n\"Just a moment.\"\nCha Eui-jae stood up, spread the coat out on the floor like laying down a blanket, and squatted in front of it. Upon closer inspection, the coat was even more tattered than it had appeared at first glance. There were scratches and tears all over, and the left sleeve was more worn out than the right.\nBut what was certain was...\nCha Eui-jae glanced back. Lee Sa-young was narrowing his eyes as he looked down at the coat.\n'It looks like the coat Lee Sa-young was wearing in the Fragment...'\nThe Lee Sa-young in the Fragment had worn a black leather coat that reached his knees. The design was similar, and even the size looked about the same. Considering Cha Eui-jae was taller than the average man, the coat was only slightly roomy on him.\nYoon Ga-eul, who had been sitting quietly against the wall to avoid getting in the way, tilted her head with a puzzled expression.\n\"Um, J seems to be right... but.\"\nShe looked uncertainly between Cha Eui-jae and Lee Sa-young, who stood behind him. She silently mouthed,\n\"He's right here.\"\nCha Eui-jae gave a small nod. Yes, the Lee Sa-young he knew had been brought here by the system and was right beside him. But...\nCha Eui-jae bit down on the inside of his cheek. The black coat Yoon Ga-eul had been covered with was the same one Lee Sa-young had worn in the Fragment. And perhaps, the original owner of the \"Basilisk Fang\" they had found in the West Sea rift was that Lee Sa-young as well.\nA ruined world is silent and familiar. Like the West Sea rift.\nIf that 'Lee Sa-young' were here... if the West Sea rift and this world were somehow connected...\nCha Eui-jae asked quietly,\n\"Do you remember who gave you this?\"\n\"Huh? I never got anything like this...\"\nYoon Ga-eul answered, still looking bewildered. Lee Sa-young chimed in from beside her.\n\"You were covered with it, though.\"\n\"Huh? I was?\"\n\"Like a cocoon.\"\n\"Sa-young.\"\n\"What...\"\nLee Sa-young shrugged. Yoon Ga-eul fidgeted with the coat. Tilting her head, she muttered,\n\"Was I alone?\"\n\"Yes. You were lying down with the coat over you, alone.\"\n\"...I didn't receive it from anyone, but... I think I might know who left it. I'm not certain, though.\"\nSomeone. Cha Eui-jae frowned slightly. When Yoon Ga-eul had asked for help...\n\"Ga-eul, didn't you say there was nothing here when you appeared in my dream?\"\n\"I wasn't lying! There really was nothing. Really. But...\"\n\"Then explain properly.\"\nA cold voice cut in. Lee Sa-young was glaring at Yoon Ga-eul, arms crossed.\n\"You probably know more than we do.\"\nYoon Ga-eul, who had been hesitating, hung her head low.\n\"You're right... I'm sorry.\"\n\"Hey, she must have been scared. She was all alone in this place... You should give her time to calm down.\"\n\"Oh, right...\"\nLee Sa-young smirked.\n\"It's just that you two were having your little secret conversation... It annoyed me a bit. Sorry?\"\nCha Eui-jae lightly punched Lee Sa-young's thigh, not hard enough to hurt. Lee Sa-young leaned down and whispered in his ear.\n\"You have a lot of secrets, don't you, Hyung?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well... I trust you'll tell me everything now.\"\nOne long finger brushed the back of Cha Eui-jae's neck lightly, like pressing a piano key, then rubbed the hidden part of his ear between his hair before withdrawing. The ticklish and lukewarm sensation sent shivers down his spine. Cha Eui-jae grabbed his ear and clenched his teeth.\n'This bastard, now that he knows his poison doesn't work on me, he's just touching me freely.'\nLow laughter tickled his ear. Lee Sa-young tilted his head toward Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"Explain everything in detail. Including whatever you were whispering about.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The one who brought me here didn't bother to explain much...\"\nThe fingers that had left returned, tickling the back of Cha Eui-jae's neck. He shivered involuntarily.\nYoon Ga-eul looked at Cha Eui-jae with anxious eyes. 'Did you bring him here?' was roughly the meaning he understood. Cha Eui-jae lowered his head. He hadn't meant to bring him here, but it had happened that way. And...\n'Damn it.'\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his lips with the back of his hand and spoke up.\n\"Right, it would be helpful if you could tell us everything in detail. From the beginning, when you first got here... step by step.\"\nAs if praising him for doing well, the fingers behind his neck lightly scratched at his skin. The feeling was unsettling, strange, and made him stutter his words, but fortunately, Yoon Ga-eul seemed to have remembered something, as her gaze dropped.\n\"When I came to, I was here. I walked for a long time, but there was nothing. Really... everything was silent... everything was destroyed, broken, I felt like I was the only living thing, I couldn't even see any monsters, and the more I thought about the Fragment, the more anxious I got, I missed my mom and my friends... It was like that.\"\nYoon Ga-eul sniffled and continued quickly.\n\"I didn't know why I was here or how to get back... But I couldn't live here forever. That's when I thought of contacting Jung Bin-nim and J. Since I can see the Fragments through dreams, I thought I could find my way if I tried hard enough...\"\n\"So that's why you came into my dream.\"\n\"Yes. I didn't actually think it would work. I couldn't even find the path to Jung Bin-nim's dream...\"\n\"...\"\n\"After finding J's dream... I just walked for a long time. I thought maybe I'd find something if I kept walking. Ah, I-I know you're supposed to stay put when you're lost...\"\nShe fidgeted with her fingers and muttered.\n\"But if I didn't do anything, well, I felt like I'd go crazy...\"\nHe understood.\nCha Eui-jae knew the fear of the silence that comes when all life has vanished. There was probably no one who knew it better.\nThe dread that comes when all you can hear is your own heartbeat and breathing. When no matter how much you shout, there's no reply. When, despite your heightened senses, you can't detect any trace of life... the encroaching helplessness. The loneliness.\nIsolation.\n\"I understand.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You did well.\"\nAnd so he could offer comfort sincerely. The fingers on the back of his neck weaved through his hair and moved as if stroking him.\nCha Eui-jae didn't swat the hand away. He simply welcomed the warmth. Yoon Ga-eul seemed to be holding back tears again, but this time she didn't break down crying like before. Instead, she roughly wiped her eyes and continued speaking.\n\"...After walking for so long, my legs started to hurt. So I looked for a place to sit down.\"\n***\nCrunch, crunch, crunch... Her footsteps cutting through the silence gradually slowed. Her breaths grew ragged and heavy. Strangely, she wasn't hungry, but her legs hurt as if they were about to give out. Yoon Ga-eul kicked at the ground out of frustration. Ash scattered in the air.\n\"If I'd known it'd be like this, I would've worn my gym pants, damn it...\"\nWords she would usually keep to herself slipped out. It made her feel a little less lonely.\nIt would be nice to find something, anything. Even if it were just a monster's corpse. But then she shook her head vigorously. What a terrible thought! Eventually, she came to a halt. Her legs hurt so much she couldn't take another step. Yoon Ga-eul began muttering whatever came to mind.\n\"...I miss Mom.\"\nI shouldn't have been so annoyed when she tried to wake me up in the morning. Yoon Ga-eul sniffled. By now, she missed not only her mom but even her \"Study Guide\" book. She never thought she'd long for that dreadful thing.\n\"I wonder if the others are okay...\"\nThey must've been really scared. I wonder if they found out I'm an Awakened? Well, nothing I can do about that. Actually, it would be pretty cool if people found out an ordinary high school girl was an Awakened. I want to go to karaoke with my friends. I want to eat tteokbokki1. And...\nHer idle thoughts suddenly cut off. Yoon Ga-eul tightly gripped her school skirt. Her hands were drenched in cold sweat. She couldn't hear the rustling of grass, the leaves swaying in the wind, or the murmurs of people.\nThe end of the world is silent.\nCold sweat trickled down her temples, and her face turned pale. Her body trembled uncontrollably.\n\"I'm so fucking scared...\"\nThere was no response. That made it even scarier, even more frightening.\nAnd then.\nPlod, plod... Her sharp ears picked up the sound of someone's footsteps. Yoon Ga-eul jerked her head up and looked around frantically. But the presence soon vanished. Silence settled over her again. Have I finally lost it? Am I hearing things? Yoon Ga-eul was idly rubbing her ears when—\nPlod, plod, plod...\nThe footsteps were getting closer. For real? Yoon Ga-eul spun around toward the sound.\n\"...\"\n\"...Gasp.\"\nYoon Ga-eul gasped. In the middle of the desolate white ruins stood something large and black. Normally, she would've run away immediately, but after wandering alone in the silence for so long, she was no longer afraid.\nOn closer inspection, it looked human. A person wearing a black cloak that obscured their form entirely. The black fabric fluttered. Yoon Ga-eul cautiously asked,\n\"...A-are you a person?\"\n\"...\"\nUnder the deep hood, she glimpsed a pale, sharp jaw. Cracked, dry lips moved.\n\"Follow me.\"\nThe voice was hoarse and rough, as if it hadn't been used in a long time.",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Watching From the Gaps\n\"Follow me.\"\nWith those brief words, he turned and began walking away.\n\"Wait, hold on a second!\"\nYoon Ga-eul hurriedly moved her feet to follow him, forgetting any suspicions that he might be a bad person and the throbbing pain in her legs. She was simply relieved to have encountered someone. Through the grayish-black cloak, she could see worn-out boots, with ashes scattered around. Footprints were left in the ash as they walked.\nOddly enough, the more she tried to keep up with the footprints, the further the distance grew. Huff, huff... Her breaths became labored, and a sweet taste filled her mouth. The cloak that had been fluttering just ahead of her was now far in the distance. Is he fast, or am I just slow?\n'Is he using some kind of teleportation? He's really fast...'\nYoon Ga-eul sniffled, trying to steady her breathing. Then, the footsteps that had been gradually distancing themselves suddenly stopped.\n\"...\"\nHe was standing far ahead, quietly watching her. Yoon Ga-eul, feeling guilty, mumbled to herself.\n\"S-sorry... My legs hurt.\"\n\"...\"\nThe black-cloaked figure didn't respond but instead tossed something to her. It was an old leather pouch. Yoon Ga-eul, who barely caught it, fumbled to open it. Inside, she found all sorts of potions, and they looked exceptionally valuable at first glance!\nIs he telling me to drink this? Yoon Ga-eul hesitantly pulled out a red potion and glanced at him. He responded,\n\"We have to keep going.\"\nDoes he have a condition where he'll die if he speaks too much? Fortunately, he waited patiently as Yoon Ga-eul drank the potion and slowly caught up to him. As she approached, a sweet scent mixed with the bitter smell of ash filled the air. The sweetness was so intense that it felt like sugar had been heavily dissolved somewhere.\n'What is that?'\nShe sniffed the air, but the sweet scent quickly disappeared. Did I smell it wrong? Yoon Ga-eul rubbed the tip of her nose. Meanwhile, the cloaked figure had started walking again. Yoon Ga-eul followed him, swinging the leather pouch. Though he seemed suspicious, she was now convinced that he wasn't a bad person, and she began to talk.\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Um... Are there no monsters around here?\"\n\"...\"\n\"How much further do we have to go?\"\nIt seemed miraculous that she'd heard him speak at all earlier. She threw out several questions, but no answers came back. She felt like a fool talking to a wall. Yoon Ga-eul grumbled to herself and glanced at the cloak. After they resumed walking, the distance between them never grew too large.\nThe surroundings began to change. The street, lined with the remnants of collapsed buildings, gave way to relatively flat ground. Was this once a road? Before long, they came upon a dilapidated structure with only its frame and a few walls left standing. Calling it a building seemed a bit of an overstatement.\nThe cloaked figure entered first. Yoon Ga-eul followed, glancing around as she did. He spoke briefly.\n\"Rest.\"\n\"Huh? Oh, okay...\"\nYoon Ga-eul slowly sat down on the floor. Finally, she felt like she could breathe. As she lightly tapped her legs, she looked up at the man. He was leaning against the wall. She abruptly asked,\n\"Um... Why are you helping me?\"\n\"...\"\nOf course, she hadn't expected an answer. Yoon Ga-eul mumbled to herself again, lowering her head, when suddenly—\n\"Because you called him.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nYoon Ga-eul snapped her head up. His sharp, dry jaw was pointed directly at her. \"Because you called him.\" Who? There was only one person Yoon Ga-eul had called.\nJ.\n'No way.'\nA chill ran down her spine. Cold sweat trickled down. Yoon Ga-eul cautiously clenched her fists. Should she warn him not to come? But how could she with this man right here? And if J doesn't come, then in this world where the apocalypse has arrived, I'll be all alone...\nSomething white slithered up from between the cracks in the floor, wrapping around her legs. It looked and felt just like what had coiled around her neck right before she was dragged here. Gasping, Yoon Ga-eul held her breath.\nA cold voice pierced the top of her head.\n\"Stop.\"\n\"...Ugh, ah.\"\n\"Don't think.\"\n\"...Ugh.\"\n\"Don't think about anything.\"\n'How am I supposed to do that?'\nYoon Ga-eul squeezed her eyes shut. If someone tells you not to think about an elephant, of course you're going to think about an elephant! The white tendrils had already climbed up her arms. Haah... She heard a long sigh.\n\"Hey.\"\nYoon Ga-eul cautiously opened her eyes. She couldn't see clearly through the white tendrils coiled around her, but she could tell that he was squatting right in front of her in a relaxed posture. Just as she inhaled sharply, he reached out and roughly pulled back his hood. Black hair tumbled out.\n\"I'm...\"\n\"...\"\n\"All I can do is watch. Watch the inevitable end that will come. From here.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But the reason I helped you...\"\nThrough the long hair that covered his eyes, she caught a glimpse of sharp, faintly violet eyes.\n\"...is because he would want it that way.\"\nEven though they seemed to burn white-hot, those eyes reflected nothing.\nYoon Ga-eul's eyes widened. The fleeting glimpse of his eyes felt strangely familiar. Where had she seen them before? The gloomy glint in his eyes quickly faded from view. If she could just see a little more, maybe she could remember.\nSuddenly, something black appeared in her vision. There was a faint glint of silver— then darkness enveloped her sight.\n'At least let me finish talking!'\nHer consciousness slowly faded, and her eyes closed. The white tendrils that had bound her body began to loosen and unravel. The tension in her body melted away. A low voice rumbled.\n\"Tell him this; everything will flow to where it's meant to go... so he shouldn't worry too much.\"\nYoon Ga-eul struggled to stay conscious as she asked,\n\"Why... don't you... tell him... yourself?\"\n\"...What a stupid question.\"\nHe scoffed.\n\"The reason is...\"\nThere was the sound of him rising, and a rustling noise filled the air. His low laugh echoed.\n\"If I were to meet him...\"\n***\n\"...And when I woke up, I was here. I think the coat belongs to that man.\"\n\"Do you know what he said at the end?\"\n\"No... I only heard up to that point, I didn't catch the rest. I'm sorry.\"\nYoon Ga-eul let out a deep sigh, her hands fidgeting with her skirt, revealing her anxiety. She glanced at Cha Eui-jae, then looked at Lee Sa-young standing behind him before lowering her head again.\nCha Eui-jae was troubled by what he heard as well. The owner of the black leather coat, the violet eyes that remained even though they had burned white, and the unmistakable rudeness in his brief words. Cha Eui-jae covered his mouth with his fist, frowning.\n'...Fuck, isn't that Lee Sa-young?'\nThis place was a world that had met its end. And Cha Eui-jae had \"seen\" the Lee Sa-young of this ruined world. In Yoon Ga-eul's fragment, where Lee Sa-young was buried in darkness, unmoved even when Honeybee and Bae Won-woo came looking for him.\n\"...\"\nThe black-cloaked figure had said he was here to witness the end that would come. Cha Eui-jae absentmindedly touched the coat spread out on the floor. The worn leather was soft, lacking its former stiffness. The sweet scent lingered in the air.\n'The third chance.'\nIf the world they lived in was the third chance, it meant that two apocalypses had already occurred, and time had been turned back twice. Even though they didn't remember it. But Cha Eui-jae had glimpsed the other two worlds.\nAccording to what Hong Ye-seong showed him in the Memorial Dungeon, Cha Eui-jae had turned back time. Lee Sa-young had died, and with no way to prevent the impending apocalypse, he decided to rewind time— for the second chance.\nIn the world Yoon Ga-eul showed him, Cha Eui-jae had died first. Lee Sa-young had lost him and became a wreck. So who had turned back time in this world?\nTo turn back time, a \"pivot\" was needed.\nIn the world where Cha Eui-jae had died, who became the pivot?\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae suddenly looked up. A puzzled voice came from behind him.\n\"Hyung?\"\nCha Eui-jae clenched his fist.\n'It must have been Lee Sa-young, damn it...'\nCha Eui-jae knew his own power. He didn't know exactly what it meant to become the \"pivot,\" but he knew it was something even he couldn't stop with ordinary resolve. And considering the strictness of the system, there's no way he could have used such an item twice! Cold sweat formed on his clenched palm.\n'If Lee Sa-young turned back time...'\nWhy was Lee Sa-young, who had become the pivot, still wandering around the ruined world like a ghost?\n'Is it a side effect? Was his power insufficient? Or is there some other issue? Or is that just how it is?'\nIt would be great if he could look at that watch and read the description. Then all these speculations would be confirmed. Cha Eui-jae wiped his palm on his pants instead of the apron, then his mouth fell open.\nThe apron and the battered ladle that had been dragged along with Lee Sa-young when he was pulled in— where should they be? The hangover soup restaurant. Park Ha-eun and Grandmother. The first place he went after escaping the West Sea rift.\nThe hangover soup restaurant.\nGrandmother didn't kick out the battered Cha Eui-jae; she served him a warm bowl of soup. But Cha Eui-jae had nothing to repay her kindness with. All he had was an empty potion bottle and his body. In a desperate attempt to give her something, he rummaged through his belongings...\n\"Ah.\"\nHe took off the silver watch that he didn't even know he was wearing and handed it over.\nThe same watch that the time-rewound Cha Eui-jae showed to Hong Ye-seong!\nCha Eui-jae's mouth hung open as he suddenly screamed and jumped to his feet.\n\"Aaaaah!\"\n\"Hyung?\"\n\"J?\"\n\"Holy shit!\"\nLee Sa-young and Yoon Ga-eul looked at him with puzzled expressions. But there was no time to care about their stares. His heart was pounding. Cha Eui-jae was frantic.\n\"We– we have to go. Right now.\"\n\"Go where?\"\nThe key to all these problems lay at the hangover soup restaurant.\n\"The hangover soup restaurant!\"\nIt's been there for a long, long time!",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Watching From the Gaps\n\"The hangover soup restaurant? All of a sudden?\"\nLee Sa-young looked at Cha Eui-jae with a bewildered expression. Yoon Ga-eul was also staring at him with a puzzled face. But Cha Eui-jae wasn't in the right mind to respond. He was holding his head in his hands.\n'Damn it, how could I forget that?'\nOne thing was certain— it was the watch he had since the very first moment he awakened. After all, it was a gift from the system, given to the first awakened individual!\nBut at the time, it didn't seem special, so he just thought the system handed out souvenirs.\n'Shit, I thought it was just for showing off.'\nMoreover, for someone like Cha Eui-jae, who lived a rough life, an accessory that wasn't even a high-performance item was a luxury. That's why he had shoved it into his inventory and...\nForgot about its existence entirely. Life has been too hectic!\nSo why, after escaping from the West Sea rift, was Cha Eui-jae wearing the watch he had buried in his inventory?\n'Why did you do that?'\nI don't know.\nEven when he asked himself, he couldn't come up with an answer. When he solved one question, another would arise, one after another. It was driving him crazy. Cha Eui-jae let out a low scream.\nMeanwhile, the only person who knew why they had to go to the hangover soup restaurant was too busy pulling his hair out, so the other two had no idea what to do. They could only watch. But they couldn't stand watching him torment himself.\nLee Sa-young clicked his tongue softly and clapped his hands loudly on purpose.\n\"Alright, let's just assume we need to go to the hangover soup restaurant. Either way, we have to go back.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Is there a way to return to the original world?\"\nCha Eui-jae froze in place, still clutching his head. Lee Sa-young's gaze sharpened.\n\"...Ah, did you come here without figuring that out? Just like that?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Isn't it a bit too careless to not have any plan? Securing an escape route is the bare minimum—\"\n\"...I'm sorry.\"\nCha Eui-jae mumbled an apology. Lee Sa-young, who had been scolding him sharply, hesitated. Cha Eui-jae, whose hair was now disheveled from his own pulling, lowered his head deeply.\n\"It's my fault. I didn't expect you to get involved.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have let you get dragged into this...\"\nSeeing him with his head bowed stirred something in Lee Sa-young. It felt like a dull ache near his heart. This was the second time he felt this way, the first being when Cha Eui-jae showed up in that miserable state at Incheon Port.\nLee Sa-young clenched his teeth and suddenly grabbed Cha Eui-jae's arm. Cha Eui-jae looked at him with wide eyes. In his bright blue eyes, Lee Sa-young was fully reflected.\nLee Sa-young muttered through gritted teeth.\n\"Don't apologize.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Don't apologize.\"\nCha Eui-jae hadn't wronged Lee Sa-young. Not at all.\n\"But, still...\"\nLee Sa-young reached out and tousled Cha Eui-jae's messy hair roughly, just enough to provoke him. As expected, Cha Eui-jae reacted like the old man he was and grabbed Lee Sa-young's hand.\n\"Hey, what are you—\"\n\"Yoon Ga-eul.\"\n\"Yes?!\"\nIgnoring Cha Eui-jae's attempts to brush off his hand, Lee Sa-young nodded towards Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"Do you know anything?\"\n\"Uh, can I take a moment to think?\"\n\"Is that all you're gonna do?\"\n\"You'd better think quickly.\"\nIgnoring Cha Eui-jae's fingers trying to push his hand away, Lee Sa-young started to tidy up the messy hair.\n\"It seems like only our souls have crossed over here... It wouldn't be good to remain separated from our bodies for too long.\"\n\"...Ah, right. Jung Bin also said that. We need to move quickly.\"\n\"Hmmm... Ah! Then, maybe... J, in that eroded dungeon...\"\n\"Huh?\"\nSoon, Cha Eui-jae's hair was back to its original neat appearance. No, it was a bit different. Lee Sa-young narrowed his eyes. The color of Cha Eui-jae's hair was slightly lighter. Like black hair with white paint splashed on it.\nOr as if the color had faded.\n\"...\"\n\"You mentioned to Hong Ye-seong-ssi that the dungeon's reconstruction was caused by J.\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"What made you so sure of that?\"\n\"There is something, but...\"\nCha Eui-jae trailed off. A strand of pale gray hair fell across his face.\n\"When you and I saw the fragment, the reconstructed dungeon resembled a world that had faced destruction. Just like this place.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I had a feeling that something was connected. If you know anything, please tell me. It might be the key, J.\"\nAn uneasy gaze brushed against his cheek. What made him so anxious? It was hard to know. Lee Sa-young wanted to dig up the root of Cha Eui-jae's anxiety. To thoroughly expose, lick, and devour it. So that he would never feel anxious again. So that he could live a somewhat carefree life, only doing what he wanted.\nLee Sa-young smiled deliberately at Cha Eui-jae, who was staring at him. Then he gently coaxed him.\n\"Why don't you tell me?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae scratched his head and finally spoke.\n\"...Ever since Yoon Ga-eul first showed me the fragment, I thought that this... world that faced destruction and the eroded dungeon... they're incredibly similar to the West Sea rift. No, I could even say they're identical.\"\n\"...\"\n\"When Yoon Ga-eul mentioned the eroded dungeon, I didn't refuse because... just hearing about it reminded me so much of the West Sea rift.\"\nCha Eui-jae muttered in a low voice.\n\"They're so similar... It can't be a coincidence. I thought there must be a reason.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae had clenched his fists tightly without realizing it. His fists were trembling slightly.\n\"So you're saying the West Sea rift, the eroded dungeon, and further... this world that has faced destruction could all be connected?\"\n\"...Yeah. It's just a hypothesis, though.\"\n\"If we go by that hypothesis.\"\nCha Eui-jae raised his head. Lee Sa-young glanced around.\n\"Then the cause of the erosion might be here.\"\nThe gray-haired man nodded silently. His once vibrant face had turned pale. Did he realize it? That all his emotions were showing on his face. Lee Sa-young turned his head to look outside the wall.\nIn the world that has faced destruction, the sun never sets. There is only endless daylight. If you stay in such a place for too long, only seeing white, your eyes would burn out. Like Nam Woo-jin's. If the West Sea rift had been like this, it was a miracle that Cha Eui-jae's eyes hadn't burned out. Lee Sa-young folded his arms and gestured towards the outside with his chin.\n\"Then let's move, assuming that hypothesis is true.\"\n\"...You believe me?\"\n\"Why wouldn't I?\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head in confusion.\n\"After all, the world's been a mess since the Day of the Rift, and my soul got dragged here by some Memorial Dungeon or whatever.\"\n\"Oh, right. I also needed to talk to you about the Memorial Dungeon...\"\n\"Another thing?\"\nAt that moment, a hand shot up from out of Lee Sa-young's sight. Finally, Lee Sa-young looked down. Yoon Ga-eul was looking up at them with a determined expression.\n\"Excuse me... I'm really, really sorry to ask, but...\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"...What is a Memorial Dungeon?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nThe three exchanged glances in the air. It was a moment when they needed to sort out and share information. Cha Eui-jae was a really good person, but the problem was that he would bounce around unpredictably like a rubber ball. It was hard to tell if he could even manage the restaurant work. Lee Sa-young irritably rolled up his white sleeves to his elbows.\n\"Everyone, come out.\"\nA moment later, the three of them were standing on a flat plain covered in soft white ash. To be precise, two of them were standing, while Lee Sa-young was squatting on the ground, scribbling something. After a while, Lee Sa-young blew the ash off his black fingertips and stood up.\n\"...To summarize.\"\nThe ground, covered in white ash, was filled with letters written by Lee Sa-young's finger.\n\"We didn't know, but apparently the world has faced the end twice. Not just once.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Yoon Ga-eul has only seen one fragment so far. And that's...\"\nThe world where Cha Eui-jae died. Lee Sa-young swallowed his words. Why did the Lee Sa-young of that world let Cha Eui-jae die? What was he doing while someone as strong as Cha Eui-jae died? He couldn't understand.\nAnd what Lee Sa-young couldn't bring himself to say, Cha Eui-jae spoke too easily.\n\"The world where J died first. Right?\"\nIt sounded horrifying. Lee Sa-young twisted his lips. A light touch nudged his side, but he ignored it, folding his arms and closing his eyes.\n\"Yes... that's right. I've seen countless fragments, but I've never seen a world where Hong Ye-seong-ssi and J exist together. Every one of them was a world where only Lee Sa-young survived. But there's something odd about it.\"\n\"What's odd?\"\n\"Why is it that... let's call it the first world for now. Why didn't anyone know about it? In both worlds, J turned back time using the watch, right? So why is there a difference?\"\n\"I'm curious about that too, but that bastard Hong Ye-seong just spouted strange words and disappeared.\"\n\"The watch is at the hangover soup restaurant, right?\"\n\"Yeah? Yeah.\"\n\"So we have to move after all.\"\nIf the mysterious figure in the cloak is indeed the Lee Sa-young who lost Cha Eui-jae, would that version of him do something to harm the living one?\nIn that case, it isn't Lee Sa-young.\nThat much was certain.\nThere must be a reason Yoon Ga-eul was brought to this place. Lee Sa-young opened his eyes. It must be to guide Cha Eui-jae's actions. He would definitely search for Yoon Ga-eul as soon as he came to his senses. There's something nearby.\n\"Follow me.\"\n\"Did you figure something out?\"\n\"Maybe.\"\nThe sound of two sets of footsteps followed. With his keenly developed sense of smell, it didn't take long to detect a strange scent. Soon, instead of a flat surface, the ground became uneven. The difference in height was too extreme. That's when a scream came from behind.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nCha Eui-jae caught Yoon Ga-eul's arm as she almost stumbled forward. Yoon Ga-eul bit her lip and nodded. She bent down and pulled out what had tripped her.\nIt was a bone.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young brushed away the ashes on the ground with his foot. Eventually, beneath the ash, a skull with a cracked forehead appeared, as if opening its mouth wide.\n\"This is... No, this place... Wait, wait a minute.\"\n\"J? What's wrong?\"\nThe muttering voice was trembling uncontrollably. A dull thud was heard as someone collapsed to the ground. Lee Sa-young quickly turned his head.\nCha Eui-jae was crawling on all fours, sweeping the ash off the ground. Wherever his hand moved, countless bones were revealed.\n\"Oh, oh...\"\nA drop of water fell onto the bones.\nCha Eui-jae was crying.",

      "content": "Chapter 140: Watching From the Gaps\n\"...Hyung?\"\nHis mind went blank. Lee Sa-young was frozen in place as if he were nailed to the ground. He couldn't breathe. Cha Eui-jae, still on his hands and knees, was staring at the bones covering the floor.\n\"This can't be happening...\"\nHis voice was weak and hollow, sounding almost dazed. It was a tone Lee Sa-young had never heard before, to the point where he could hardly recognize it as Cha Eui-jae's.\nBefore long, Cha Eui-jae wobbled as he stood up and began to walk. The palms of his hands and the knees of his pants were smeared with white stains from the ashes on the ground. His expression was empty, devoid of any emotion, except for the tears that kept falling.\nHe's crying. Cha Eui-jae is crying.\nThe trembling voice pierced through the fog in Lee Sa-young's mind.\n\"Wait, if this whole floor is made of bones...\"\nYoon Ga-eul approached a small mound and brushed away the accumulated ashes, revealing what appeared to be ribs. She let out a small shriek. Their eyes met, filled with anxiety.\n\"Here, over here. Could it be... could all of this be...\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young turned his head to follow Cha Eui-jae's retreating figure. Cha Eui-jae was staggering toward something. His movements seemed strangely familiar.\nThe terrain here was uneven, with small mounds scattered all around. If all of this were really bones, as Yoon Ga-eul suggested... and if Cha Eui-jae's behavior was as familiar as it seemed... a world destroyed, resembling the West Sea rift... and the only survivor of that rift...\nCha Eui-jae.\nLee Sa-young urgently gestured to Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"Follow him!\"\n\"What? Oh, okay!\"\nLee Sa-young began to run, chasing after Cha Eui-jae, who was now far ahead. He couldn't let Cha Eui-jae be alone. He had a strong feeling about it. Strangely, the closer he got to Cha Eui-jae's retreating figure, the more his anxiety grew. Lee Sa-young clenched his teeth. As he finally closed in on Cha Eui-jae, he found himself stopping in his tracks. Before them loomed the tallest mound they had encountered so far, and entwined around it were smooth bones.\nAt the top of the mound, a massive skull with its mouth wide open was faintly visible.\nCha Eui-jae was staring up at the mound. His face, drained of all color, remained expressionless, save for the unending stream of tears. He muttered,\n\"I was... too late.\"\n\"No, you weren't.\"\nLee Sa-young instinctively denied it. But Cha Eui-jae wasn't listening.\n\"No... even before this... there were so many bones here.\"\nHis muttering continued. Relentlessly.\n\"I killed the basilisk and tried to gather the bodies of my comrades... but they were all mixed up with the monsters, and I couldn't find them all. The bodies were all in pieces.\"\nLee Sa-young had seen it too. The ground covered in bones, soaked in blood, with no distinction between monsters and humans, everything tangled together in a horrific mess. And in the midst of the scattered bodies and pools of blood, there was someone huddled, drenched in blood, muttering to himself as he stared at a few human limbs laid before him.\nCha Eui-jae.\n...Me?\nLee Sa-young winced and clutched his head. It felt like his skull was splitting open. The sea of bones covered in white ashes and the sea of bones drenched in red blood overlapped and flickered before his eyes.\nHe had never seen it.\nBut he had seen it.\nLee Sa-young doubled over, clutching his head. He felt as if he were about to vomit from the dizziness.\n\"Ugh...\"\n\"Are... are you okay?\"\nMeanwhile, Cha Eui-jae took another step. His white, ashen hand reached out to touch the mound. The spot where his palm touched was wiped clean, revealing what lay hidden beneath.\nIt was all bones.\n\"Everything was mixed together... I couldn't tell them apart.\"\n\"J! Wait...\"\n\"I... I tried to do something, anything. But in the end, I couldn't save anyone.\"\nCha Eui-jae knelt down in front of the mound. His trembling hands brushed away the ashes on the ground. Mixed in with the bones of non-humans were human bones. Clear tears fell, drop by drop. A small, trembling voice escaped from his frail figure.\n\"I was too late... and now, everyone is like this...\"\nNo.\n\"All of it...\"\nNo!\n\"It's all my fault...\"\n\"Cha Eui-jae!\"\nHis name pierced through the ringing in Cha Eui-jae's ears like a lightning bolt. Startled, Cha Eui-jae lifted his head and turned toward the voice that called his name. Lee Sa-young, clutching his head, was glaring at him. His violet eyes were blazing with intensity. Amidst the sea of white, they were the only things...\n\"Don't say something so stupid.\"\n\"What?\"\nLee Sa-young gestured urgently to Yoon Ga-eul, who was nervously pacing behind him.\n\"Yoon Ga-eul. Look around for anything unusual. I think this place is connected to the West Sea Rift.\"\n\"Oh... okay! I'll call you if I find anything.\"\nYoon Ga-eul nodded, then closed her eyes and opened them again. Her eyes began to shine brilliantly with a golden light. Before she left their side, she looked at Cha Eui-jae one last time. Her gaze was resolute, as if to say that everything would be okay.\nThe sound of light footsteps faded into the distance. Cha Eui-jae stared blankly at Lee Sa-young. Without hesitation, Lee Sa-young knelt on one knee in front of Cha Eui-jae. His warm, large hands cupped Cha Eui-jae's cheeks and ears. The cries that had been echoing around him melted away in the warmth. Lee Sa-young's lips moved.\nStop thinking about it.\n\"But...\"\nHyung did your best.\n\"All these people ended up like this...\"\nLook at me, Cha Eui-jae.\nTheir eyes met. In Lee Sa-young's violet eyes, Cha Eui-jae was wholly reflected. His thumb, darkened from the ash, gently wiped away the tears from Cha Eui-jae's eyes. It was damp. Only then did Cha Eui-jae realize that he had been crying. Lee Sa-young's face drew closer. His forehead brushed against Cha Eui-jae's, warm and soft. His lips moved gently.\nI'm right here.\nThe only one who can deny Cha Eui-jae,\nis the person you saved, who stands right in front of you.\nSa-young.\nIt's okay.\nCha Eui-jae swallowed the sob rising in his throat. Their foreheads parted, and soon after, a comforting warmth washed over him like a wave. It was what he had longed for. Cha Eui-jae wrapped his arms around the warmth's neck and buried his face in it. Only then did a small sob escape him.\nA large hand gently stroked his back.\n***\nSniffling, Cha Eui-jae blinked his swollen eyes. Even just blinking made him aware of how puffy they were. Suddenly, a hand appeared in his field of vision, covering his eyes. Cha Eui-jae mumbled,\n\"I'm okay now.\"\n\"Of course, you are.\"\n\"No, really. I've calmed down.\"\n\"Then just pretend I'm doing this because I want to.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae fell silent. A small laugh tickled his ears. Just then, light footsteps approached, accompanied by a gloomy voice.\n\"I'm sorry. I went around the whole area, but I couldn't find anything. It's all just...\"\nHer voice trailed off, but they all knew what she meant to say. It's all just ashes and bones. Yoon Ga-eul coughed softly. Upon closer inspection, her neck was damp with cold sweat, and her complexion didn't look good. Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"Ga-eul, are you okay? Are you feeling sick?\"\n\"Oh, no... my stomach is a bit queasy, but it's bearable.\"\nYoon Ga-eul didn't have much time left. She had been the first one dragged here, had wandered around this place the longest, and had been separated from her soul and body for the most extended period.\n\"...\"\n\"...We need to go back quickly.\"\n\"But...\"\nYoon Ga-eul hesitated, looking down at the ground. Lee Sa-young, sitting beside her, asked,\n\"Hyung, do you remember the last thing you killed in this place?\"\n\"The last thing I killed?\"\n\"Even though this place is connected to a destroyed world, it's still a type of rift. In that moment, it would have followed the system's rules. If that's the case, there must be a master of the rift. We need to kill the master to get the rift stone...\"\nAnd open the closed rift. Cha Eui-jae removed the hand covering his eyes and answered.\n\"Oh, that would be...\"\nCha Eui-jae looked up at the top of the mound. Even after a long time had passed since its death, the flexible bones wrapping around the mound still belonged to it. The basilisk. Lee Sa-young, who had also looked up at the mound, narrowed his eyes. Cha Eui-jae gave a brief answer.\n\"I stabbed a sword into its head.\"\n\"Really? Then let's try stabbing it again.\"\n\"What? But it's already dead.\"\n\"Well, we have to try something. We need to get back quickly. What sword did you use? Any sword?\"\n\"No... I still have it.\"\nCha Eui-jae pulled out the Basilisk's Fang, which had been buried in the deepest corner of his inventory. The black sword twitched in his grip like a freshly caught fish.\n['Basilisk's Fang' wants to have a chat]\n[Fang's Thoughts: To think you'd neglect me like this, you're bound to be cursed!]\n[Fang's Thoughts: Do you even know how long it's been since you took me out?]\n[Fang's Thoughts: Not only did you neglect me, but you even placed other weapons beside me!]\n['Basilisk's Fang' looks a bit lonely]\nSo swords can feel loneliness too. But it was true; it had been a long time since he last took it out. Probably not since the Artisan Exhibition. He had even used a spear when fighting the golem.\n'...Should I feel guilty?'\nWith a slightly awkward expression, Cha Eui-jae thrust the sword towards Lee Sa-young. The fang twitched again.\n[Fang's Thoughts: How dare you hand me over to someone else right after finally taking me out! You're asking for a curse!]\n[Fang's Thoughts: ...Huh?]\nThe restless movement in his hand suddenly stopped.\n[Fang's Thoughts: Master?]",

      "content": "Chapter 141: Watching From the Gaps\nMaster?\nCha Eui-jae glanced around and spotted the person who had drawn out the Basilisk' Fang. It was Lee Sa-young, standing slouched in the same clothes he had worn in the Memorial Dungeon.\n'No way...'\nThe Basilisk's Fang wriggled like a live fish, as if to confirm that this was indeed the answer.\n[Fang's Thoughts: Finally, I've met my master!]\n[Fang's Thoughts: This person only neglects me and is boring! I want to go back!]\nHowever, the so-called master, Lee Sa-young, simply nodded with a disinterested expression.\n\"What are you doing, Hyung? If you've drawn it out, drive it into the skull.\"\n\"Ah, no...\"\n\"...Huh?\"\n[Fang's Thoughts: Master?]\n[Basilisk's Fang seems shocked.]\nEven without saying anything, it was clear. The writhing in his hand had suddenly stopped. Instead of recognizing or greeting it, the so-called master was suggesting fratricide. Although Cha Eui-jae had no affection for the Basilisk's Fang, he had formed a camaraderie with it while escaping from the West Sea rift. Cha Eui-jae glanced at the Basilisk's Fang, which had fallen silent, despite usually being so talkative.\n\"...Are you okay?\"\n\"Shouldn't you be asking that question to yourself...?\"\n\"No, not you. This guy.\"\nThe Basilisk's Fang remained silent. Despite feeling uncertain, Cha Eui-jae agreed that escaping from this place was the first priority, as Lee Sa-young had suggested. He adjusted his grip on the Basilisk's Fang. A sense of déjà vu washed over him, but there was no confusion. He had people to protect now.\nYoon Ga-eul didn't have much time left. He had to return. He looked down at the bones beneath his feet, likely mingled with those of his comrades. However...\n\"...\"\nWould he be able to come back here?\nWould he be fleeing again, leaving them behind?\nThis might be his last chance.\n\"You can come back, J.\"\nA voice filled with certainty spoke. Cha Eui-jae raised his head. Yoon Ga-eul, who had swallowed a cough, was looking at Cha Eui-jae with her golden, shining eyes.\n\"Our souls would have remembered the way back here. We might not be able to come back many times, but we can still move. Just like how I found you, J, after being dragged to this place.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But, you probably want to find them right now...\"\nYoon Ga-eul lowered her head and fiddled with her hands.\n\"I'm sorry I can't help you find them here. I wish we had more time...\"\nDespite being told they could return, a small unease remained. The guilt of not being able to save them would forever haunt Cha Eui-jae. But.\n\"...No, because of you, I now know there are comrades here.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If it weren't for you, I would have kept wandering near the West Sea rift, unable to do anything.\"\nCha Eui-jae met the gaze of Lee Sa-young, who was standing behind Yoon Ga-eul. Seeing his only success, Cha Eui-jae smiled defiantly.\n\"Thank you.\"\nYoon Ga-eul pursed her lips and nodded, roughly rubbing her eyes with her sleeve. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath and then jumped high into the air.\nPop—\nCha Eui-jae landed lightly on the bones. A gigantic skull of a snake with its mouth wide open appeared. Sharp teeth and the lower jaw were covered in white ash. In the center of the skull was a black mark— a spot he had pierced with the Basilisk's Fang.\n'It's really the same place.'\nAs the West Sea rift.\nHis heart pounded. Anxiety gripped him, fearing the silence that might come again. The wounds that had scarred Cha Eui-jae's soul would not easily fade. However, doubt was unnecessary. He just had to do everything he could.\nCha Eui-jae gripped the Basilisk's Fang with both hands. Then, he raised the sword high—\nThud, he drove it into the scar.\n\"...\"\nWooong... Cha Eui-jae looked up. The still air began to vibrate as the flow reversed. A white vortex appeared behind the Basilisk's Fang.\n\"Ah, it worked...\"\nA sigh of relief escaped him. Cha Eui-jae clung to the fang, letting out a long breath. Squeak! A small scream was followed by a light landing. Lee Sa-young stood there with Yoon Ga-eul, who was wrapped in a black coat, tucked under his arm. Yoon Ga-eul, pale-faced, covered her mouth, muttering.\n\"The, the poison... I shouldn't touch you...\"\n\"Stand on your own now.\"\n\"Yes, yes...\"\nYoon Ga-eul wobbled as she stood on her two feet. They stood silently before the vortex. But there was no time to hesitate. Cha Eui-jae signaled the other two with his eyes. Then, he drew out the Basilisk's Fang and was the first to throw himself into the vortex.\n...Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes.\nA dark ceiling greeted him. Cha Eui-jae bolted upright. After blinking a few times to adjust to the darkness, he could finally make out his surroundings. He was lying in a bed, in an unlit room. A sharp pain throbbed on the back of his hand.\n\"What the...\"\nThere was an IV line stuck into the back of his hand. Was it Seo Min-gi who had taken care of it? Cha Eui-jae carefully removed the IV and glanced around. There was another bed right beside him. He pulled back the curtain around the bed. Lee Sa-young was lying there as well, with an IV in his hand.\n\"...Lee Sa-young.\"\nHe called his name cautiously, and his delicate eyebrows twitched slightly. Ugh... A small groan was followed by Lee Sa-young's eyes fluttering open.\n\"...Ah ...Where is this?\"\n\"I don't know. Maybe a hospital room?\"\n\"...Ugh.\"\nLee Sa-young grabbed his head.\n\"Wait, does your head hurt? I'll go get someone.\"\nCha Eui-jae hurriedly opened the door. A strangely familiar space appeared. A desolate area, so barren it made one doubt whether anyone actually lived there. A familiar sofa was placed in the living room. It was Lee Sa-young's home.\nAnd...\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly out the large window.\nWhite ashes were falling from the sky.\n\"...Why?\"\nAt that moment, a beeping sound echoed through the quiet living room. The source was an intercom.\n—Guild Leader, this is Seo Min-gi. Since it's not something that requires direct reporting, I'm leaving a recorded message. The situation outside isn't good. The black hole suddenly turned white, and debris keeps falling from the hole. Moreover, countless infected individuals are roaming the streets, attacking both civilians and awakened alike, as if they've been waiting for this moment.\nWhy?\n—Currently, Pado Guild has entered emergency mode and, under Vice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo's orders, is focusing on rescuing civilians and dealing with the infected. That concludes my report.\n—...\nAfter a long pause, a final sentence was added.\n—I sincerely hope you return quickly, J, and Guild Leader.\nBeep, beep, beep... The intercom shut off. Cha Eui-jae placed his cold hand on the window and stared blankly outside. This scene was from a world that had been destroyed. Such a thing should not have happened in this world. What went wrong? Something must have triggered it.\nAt that moment, he felt a vibration from the empty air. Cha Eui-jae reached into his inventory as if drawn by a trance. The Basilisk's Fang was vibrating.\nWhen he drew out the Basilisk's Fang, its thoughts surfaced.\n[Fang's Thoughts: It's because Master is gone.]\n\"What? What do you mean?\"\n[Fang's Thoughts: ...Don't you know? Idiot.]\n[Fang's Thoughts: Master was holding the collapsing, destroyed world, keeping it from merging with your world.]\nMaster.\nConsidering the reaction and glimpses of the Basilisk's Fang, its original master was likely Lee Sa-young. The Lee Sa-young who had wandered alone in the destroyed world they had visited.\n[Fang's Thoughts: Master was both the warden and the shackle by their very existence.]\nHolding them apart, preventing them from merging. A shackle. White ash and remnants from the destroyed world were falling from the now-whitened white hole. The West Sea rift, which had been connected to the destroyed world, and the rapidly increasing eroded dungeon phenomenon. If the eroded dungeon was also caused by the destroyed world encroaching upon them...\nFang's thoughts continued.\n[Fang's Thoughts: But with Master gone...]\nThe white hole flashed. Soon, something huge and white began to slowly emerge from the white hole.\n[Fang's Thoughts: The destroyed world is coming.]\nIt was a massive whale, just like the one they had seen in the destroyed world.",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Watching From the Gaps\nBwoo...\nA pure white whale lifted its head and let out a roar. The once-calm atmosphere shook. Finally, the entire body of the whale emerged from the white hole, from head to tail. It swam leisurely through the air as if the sky were the sea.\nEach time its tail gently moved, debris falling from the white hole shattered into pieces and scattered everywhere. Thud, thud... Even beyond the soundproof glass, the crashing and breaking noises were clear.\nHe hurriedly searched his pockets. Thankfully, his phone was still in his pants pocket. He turned it on. The battery was low. There were only two numbers in his contacts— Park Ha-eun and Lee Sa-young.\nCha Eui-jae entered Park Ha-eun's number and pressed the call button. The dial tone dragged on and on. Could the communication lines have already been cut? That couldn't be. Just as cold sweat began to form on the hand holding the phone, the dial tone abruptly stopped.\n—...Uncle? Is that you, Uncle?\nA whispering voice asked. Cha Eui-jae squeezed his eyes shut. Though his hand trembled uncontrollably, his voice fortunately did not.\n\"Yeah, it's me, Uncle... Are you okay? Where are you now? Where's Grandma?\"\n—Grandma's with me. We're... um... at a shelter, I think.\n\"A shelter? Which shelter?\"\n—I don't know. A strange man with black glasses brought us here. He said he was a friend of yours. Is that true?\nOnly one person came to mind when she mentioned 'black glasses.' Seo Min-gi, who always wore sunglasses. Cha Eui-jae vividly recalled Seo Min-gi's face, expressionless but throwing up a peace sign. Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"Was that man wearing a black suit?\"\n—Huh? Yeah. And his eyes looked like a panda's!\n...It was definitely Seo Min-gi. The tension eased. Cha Eui-jae replied, his voice mixed with a sigh of relief.\n\"Yeah... He's a friend of mine.\"\nAt that moment, there was a rustling sound. Then, a familiar voice came through.\n—Excuse me. Hello? I'm called Romantic Opener. Can you hear me? Do you remember me? I hope I'm talking to the right person?\nOf course, he remembered. Although their last encounter wasn't exactly a pleasant one. Romantic Opener, who had been draped over the seesaw like laundry, seemed to have recovered well. Cha Eui-jae's anxiety calmed somewhat after confirming the safety of Park Ha-eun and Grandmother. Pressing his forehead against the glass, Cha Eui-jae responded,\n\"Yes, it's me.\"\nRomantic Opener let out a deep sigh.\n—Phew... I've been waiting for you for so long. You've finally come back! Park Ha-eun and your grandmother are at the Pado Guild shelter. Seo Min-gi brought them there right after things went down.\n\"Is that place safe?\"\n—The Pado Guild members are guarding it, so it's safe. You don't have to worry.\n\"...\"\n—But by any chance, has the Guild Leader awakened...?\nGive it back! Huh? Can't I talk a little longer? Hand it over!\nAfter a brief scuffle, it seemed that Park Ha-eun had won the right. Her cheerful voice chimed in.\n—I'm okay, Uncle! Grandma's asleep on the bed.\n\"...\"\n—Your friend said you had to go somewhere for something urgent. That's true, right?\n\"...Yeah, that's right.\"\n—Will it take long?\nOoooo... The whale's tail brushed against a low building. The building crumbled to pieces. Cha Eui-jae's eyes, glowing blue, followed the whale.\n\"...Yeah. Quite a while.\"\n—Oh...\nThough her voice trailed off, Park Ha-eun answered resolutely.\n—That's okay! You can take your time. I'll wait.\n\"...Alright. Don't go anywhere, and if you get bored, ask the guy next to you to play with you. Tell Grandma that Uncle is okay and that he's sorry he can't come.\"\n—Okay, Uncle.\nWithout waiting for her reply, Cha Eui-jae ended the call and took a deep breath. Then he asked the Basilisk's Fang,\n\"...Is there a way to stop this?\"\n[Fang's thoughts: This isn't the end. It's a problem caused by a world that should have vanished but remained.]\n[Fang's thoughts: We just need to endure until it vanishes...]\n[Fang's thoughts: That's what Master said.]\n\"...\"\nBut Lee Sa-young, who lived as a shackle, couldn't endure and disappeared. Or perhaps...\n\"Tell him this; everything will flow to where it's meant to go... so he shouldn't worry too much.\"\nMaybe even that was anticipated. To find a clue, he needed to go to the hangover soup restaurant and check the clock. Perhaps mistaking Cha Eui-jae's silence for something else, the Basilisk's Fang began chattering loudly.\n[Fang's thoughts: The end comes for those who dwell on it.]\n[Fang's thoughts: Don't let fear consume you, foolish human.]\n[Basilisk's Fang comforts you.]\n[Fang's thoughts: This is not comfort! Foolish one.]\n[Basilisk's Fang is embarrassed.]\nThe Basilisk's Fang began thrashing around in rage. It was better when it was noisy. Ironically, the Basilisk's Fang's serious demeanor didn't suit it at all. Cha Eui-jae averted his gaze from the glass and asked the Basilisk's Fang,\n\"...Where did your former master, Lee Sa-young, disappear to?\"\nThe thrashing stopped. The Basilisk's Fang, which had been so noisy, suddenly clamped its mouth shut. No answer came. Instead, footsteps approached. Cha Eui-jae slowly turned around.\nLee Sa-young, with a grimace on his pale face, was walking toward him, clutching his head. A large hand reached out, grabbed Cha Eui-jae's shoulder, and pulled him into an embrace. A warm heat enveloped him.\nA hushed voice muttered.\n\"...If you went out looking like that...\"\n\"...\"\n\"They must have figured out you're the part-timer right away... am I right?\"\n\"...Seems so.\"\nHe was still dressed in a gray hoodie and jeans. Anyone who frequented the hangover soup restaurant would immediately recognize that the part-timer and J were the same person based on the outfit. Lee Sa-young, who was rubbing his hair against Cha Eui-jae's cheek, whispered.\n\"I'll lend you some clothes. Wear them before you go.\"\n\"Your clothes might be a bit big for me.\"\n\"You can just roll up the sleeves.\"\nLee Sa-young released Cha Eui-jae from his embrace and took his hand, leading him. His retreating figure struck Cha Eui-jae as oddly new.\nLee Sa-young entered the dressing room and began sorting through the neatly arranged clothes. After a moment, he handed over a plain black crew-neck t-shirt. Just as Cha Eui-jae grabbed his hoodie to take it off, Lee Sa-young pulled out some kind of armor.\n\"I've got armor too, if you want it?\"\n\"Wearing something I'm not used to might just get in the way.\"\n\"Yeah... I guess you're right.\"\nCha Eui-jae slipped off his hoodie. Although his well-toned muscles were revealed, the first thing that caught the eye was not his build but the countless scars that covered his upper body.\nAs he moved, the scars seemed to come alive. Cha Eui-jae had just folded his hoodie and placed it on the dresser when something warm and soft touched the back of his neck. He froze. Lips pressed against the nape of his neck.\n\"...Aren't you being a little too defenseless?\"\n\"What? Hey, wait... urgh.\"\nCha Eui-jae unconsciously held his breath. The lips that had been tickling his neck began slowly moving down his skin. A shiver ran down his spine. It was a strange sensation. The lips stopped at a scar on his prominent shoulder blade. A languid voice chuckled.\n\"Even after kissing someone...\"\n\"Hey, now's not the time...\"\n\"Of course... I know that.\"\nA sharp pain settled on his shoulder blade. Lee Sa-young was baring his teeth and biting down on the flesh. Cha Eui-jae covered his mouth with his hand and swallowed the sound. Compared to all the pain he had endured, this was only ticklish, but the sensation was strangely vivid. Lee Sa-young licked the red teeth marks on the shoulder blade.\n\"Even if I tell you not to go, you'll still go, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Still...\"\nA light kiss was placed over the stinging pain.\n\"If it gets too hard, it's okay to run away.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll always be waiting for you. For you, Hyung.\"\nCha Eui-jae turned to face Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young was smiling gently. The only success that Cha Eui-jae had finally achieved shone brightly in that smile.\nCha Eui-jae reached out and grasped the soft hair at the back of Lee Sa-young's head, pulling him close. Their lips met. Neither of them closed their eyes, so they could see each other perfectly in their gazes. A whispered promise melted into their kiss.\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\"...Okay.\"\nA small laugh was swallowed between their lips.\nLee Sa-young's clothes were still a bit big on Cha Eui-jae. After he rolled the sleeves up to his elbows, Lee Sa-young suddenly extended a finger toward him, raising a small pinky. Lee Sa-young wiggled his hand, pinky raised.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae chuckled and extended his hand. Their pinkies intertwined briefly before parting. However, Cha Eui-jae's hand was gripping something else— Hong Ye-seong's teleportation scroll. His eyes widened as the scene before him began to change. The last thing he saw was Lee Sa-young's smiling face.\nLee Sa-young waved his hand gently.\n\"Come back soon, Hyung.\"\n...And then Lee Sa-young was left alone in the house, where Cha Eui-jae's warmth had vanished. He walked across the empty hallway to the bathroom. With a click, he turned on the bathroom light. His face reflected in the mirror looked especially pale today, more unfamiliar than usual. Suddenly, the light went out with a snap.\nWhen it flickered back on—\nThe reflection of Lee Sa-young in the mirror was grinning with eyes that had burned completely white.\nStaring straight at the grimacing Lee Sa-young—\nHe gripped the sink and bowed his head. His vision wavered dizzyingly. A trickle of black blood dripped from the corner of his mouth.\nThe Lee Sa-young in the mirror tilted his head. He raised his hand and tapped his lips. His fingers, his hand, and even the wrist peeking out from his sleeve— everything was stained as black as if he were wearing gloves. His pale violet eyes narrowed slightly.\nA lazy voice whispered:\n'I waited a bit... for the occasion. Sending someone off is important. Keeping promises is important too...'\n\"...\"\n'Well then, now...'\n\"Ah...\"\nVeins bulged on the back of his hand. A bead of cold sweat ran down his temple. Lee Sa-young sneered.\n\"This is seriously messed up...\"\nThud—\nThe blackened body collapsed helplessly.",

      "content": "Chapter 143: Watching From the Gaps\nCha Eui-jae opened his eyes.\nHe was standing in the middle of the familiar dining hall of a hangover soup restaurant. The warmth that had touched his hand had vanished like a mirage. Cha Eui-jae absentmindedly fiddled with his now empty hand. Despite being in a place that felt like home, his heart felt strangely hollow.\nHe wished he could have stayed just a little longer. Just 10 minutes, even 5 minutes would have been enough. It had been a long time since he felt such regret.\nWhat should he call this feeling of regret?\n\"...\"\nThud... The ground trembled. It seemed like debris had fallen nearby. The framed autograph on the wall shook and then fell with a thud. It was Jung Bin's autograph. Cha Eui-jae blinked. Now wasn't the time to be thirsting for some unknown emotion. He dusted off Jung Bin's autograph and placed it back on the table.\nHe then strode over to the counter. Beneath the POS machine lay J's mask, and a small yellow memo was stuck to it. Written in neat, elegant handwriting, it said;\n[I'm leaving it here because I know you'll definitely return to the hangover soup restaurant. You don't need to thank me. —A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi]\nDoes this guy see the future or something? Either way, Cha Eui-jae was grateful. He put on the mask and skillfully opened the drawer beneath the cash register. Neatly placed were the ledger, a dusty bouncy ball that seemed like Park Ha-eun had put it there, a few colored pencils, and then,\n\"...\"\nA watch.\nCha Eui-jae carefully lifted the watch. Rattle... The silver watch was a mess, unlike how it had looked in his memory. The glass was cracked and shattered, it was worn out as if it could crumble at any moment, and it was rusted in spots. The minute and second hands weren't moving.\n'It seemed perfectly fine when I gave it as payment for the meal.'\nMoreover, upon closer inspection, the watch had a unique design. There were three small circles inside the watch, two of which were covered with something white, making them invisible. It looked like oil paint had been smeared over them. The last circle was a small clock within the watch, and,\nTick.\nIt was moving. The only thing that was.\n'This is your third and final chance.'\nJust as 'Hong Ye-seong' had said. Cha Eui-jae stared at the slowly moving second hand. The only working clock pointed to 10 o'clock. Soon, a white window appeared.\n[ Wristwatch ()]\n[Modified by a recluse artisan living in to extend the number of uses.]\n[But it could not escape the flow of time and silver.]\n[It can no longer be used.]\n[This is your final chance.]\n[Creator: ]\n'Why does the item description feel so ominous?'\nMoreover, he felt a strange sense of déjà vu while reading it. The phrase \"a recluse artisan.\" He was sure he'd seen it somewhere before...\n\"Ah!\"\nCha Eui-jae put down the watch and pulled out the Basilisk's Fang. The Basilisk's Fang had remained silent ever since it invoked its right to remain silent. As he grasped the sword and shook it wildly, the information window popped up.\n[Basilisk's Fang (S)]\n[A sword forged from the Basilisk's Fang by a recluse artisan living in . Only those deemed worthy are permitted to wield it.]\n[Creator: ]\nRecluse 'artisan.' The Basilisk's Fang, which called Hong Ye-seong its father, bore an engraving by Hong Ye-seong on its blade. However, the Hong Ye-seong he knew said he had never made the Basilisk's Fang.\n'When he kidnapped me, I thought he was talking nonsense, but...'\nHong Ye-seong was innocent. Both the Basilisk's Fang and this watch appeared to be the work of the 'Hong Ye-seong' he encountered in the Memorial Dungeon. Cha Eui-jae clicked his tongue.\nHong Ye-seong, who was a bit dull but not a bad guy, was quite different from the sly and suspicious 'Hong Ye-seong.' At least his desires and inner thoughts were as clear and straightforward as the bottom of a pristine lake.\n'Should I treat him better next time...'\nCha Eui-jae grabbed the watch with the hand that had been holding the Basilisk's Fang.\nAt that moment,\n[Condition fulfilled.]\n[Entering .]\nHis vision turned black. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth.\n'What now, damn it!'\n***\n\"This isn't perfect on its own...\"\nA man's voice echoed from within the pitch-black darkness.\n\"Though the person who was the pivot was powerful, leaving behind some residual strength... It's not enough on its own. It's like a single-use battery with a bit of charge left. The fact that there's any left is a miracle in itself, but if you try to turn back time with just this, it'll fail before you even get started.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Then... is it unusable?\"\nGradually, the darkness receded, revealing the surroundings. They were inside a cluttered workshop. The first person to come into view was Hong Ye-seong, who was scrutinizing a watch in his hands, magnifying glass perched over his eyes. After a moment of groaning, he let out a long sigh.\n\"...This is J's item, you said? J used this to turn back time? Before?\"\n\"Yes, according to what I remember.\"\nThe clear voice belonged to Yoon Ga-eul. Yoon Ga-eul, who had grown since Cha Eui-jae's last memory, murmured softly.\n\"I would appreciate it if you could give us a clear answer. Can we use this to turn back time? Just like J did.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You know what happened. We succeeded in driving out the apocalypse, but we suffered too much damage. This world won't recover. It'll slowly edge towards destruction.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nHong Ye-seong glanced out a small window.\n\"Please, Master Artisan. We need hope...\"\nYoon Ga-eul mumbled with a trembling voice. A heavy silence fell over the room. Finally, after another deep sigh, Hong Ye-seong scratched his disheveled hair.\n\"It might be possible, but someone will have to make a sacrifice... Maybe even more people will have to sacrifice themselves...\"\n\"Sacrifice?\"\n\"It would be more accurate to say that the lacking power of the item would be supplemented by human strength. Honestly, I can't say for sure if it's possible. I don't know what kind of side effects might occur or how long you'd have to endure it. It's completely uncharted territory... But are you still willing to try?\"\n\"—One thing.\"\nA low, raspy voice interrupted. The voice belonged to someone leaning against the corner of the workshop with arms crossed. His pale complexion, sharp, sensitive features, and long black coat with a black sword strapped to his waist made him stand out. Violet eyes glinted sharply through his disheveled hair.\nIt was Lee Sa-young.\n\"If you succeed in turning back time with that...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Will it guarantee that they'll come back to life?\"\nThere was no need to specify who he was talking about; everyone knew, even Cha Eui-jae, who watched as a bystander. Yoon Ga-eul slowly, but firmly, nodded.\n\"Yes. Because J did it... that's why we're here now.\"\n\"...I see.\"\nLee Sa-young uncrossed his arms.\n\"That's enough for me.\"\nHis black hand grasped the watch without hesitation.\nAt that moment.\nThe surroundings turned completely black and white, and everyone froze. Having experienced it once before, Cha Eui-jae didn't panic this time. As he waited calmly, a golden pattern appeared in Hong Ye-seong's eyes. The fast-spinning Eyes of Appraisal connected with Cha Eui-jae, and amidst the threads of wisdom that wriggled within the Eyes of Appraisal, an inexplicable compassion was found. He muttered softly.\n\"It seems it's your turn this time.\"\n***\nCha Eui-jae blinked. The cash register and the POS machine of the hangover soup restaurant greeted him. It seemed his consciousness had been drawn away while he was standing.\n\"Now it's your turn?\"\nWhat the hell did that mean? Anyway, 'Hong Ye-seong' sure had a knack for speaking in vague riddles.\n\"At least there's something to be gained from this...\"\nHe fiddled with the watch, thinking hard. Let's break this down. Originally, the watch was a one-time-use item, but because the first pivot, Cha Eui-jae, was so powerful, the item didn't disappear after turning back time. So, when Yoon Ga-eul and Lee Sa-young faced a second apocalypse, they used the watch that the late J had left behind to turn back time.\nThey used a one-time-use item for a second time, and in an imperfect situation, so of course, there were bound to be side effects. Lee Sa-young bore all those consequences alone as a \"shackle\" to contain the situation...\n\"Was it too much for one person's power?\"\nIn the end, the destroyed world influenced the current one, causing erosion. Frustrated, Cha Eui-jae ran his hands through his hair. He felt uneasy. No one understood the loneliness of being left behind better than Cha Eui-jae did.\nWandering through an empty world, enduring a loneliness that might never end.\n\"What a ridiculous...\"\nMoreover, there was still something bothering him. 'That' Lee Sa-young had disappeared, and the ruined world had started to seriously impact the current one. Why did he disappear, and where did he go?\nAt that moment, voices chatting nearby floated in through the door. Cha Eui-jae instinctively crouched down behind the counter. A tired voice spoke.\n\"Let's finish up here and move to another area. Check if there are still people who haven't evacuated, clear out any debris, and if you see any of those addicts, wipe them out. Once we're done, contact Team Leader Jung.\"\n\"Got it. But, Vice-Guild Leader, is the Guild Leader still in that state?\"\n\"Seems like it. I left a message for him to call when he wakes up... Still nothing though.\"\n\"He's not just ignoring it like usual?\"\n\"The situation is serious. Sa-young's not the type to ignore it in times like this.\"\nIt was two regulars of the soup restaurant, Bae Won-woo and Kang Ji-soo. Cha Eui-jae held his breath and listened to their conversation. Something was off. Didn't Lee Sa-young wake up earlier? He didn't look too well, but did he fall asleep again? Cha Eui-jae switched his phone to silent mode and called Lee Sa-young.\nNo answer.\nIn the meantime, the conversation shifted. Kang Ji-soo grumbled.\n\"Did you see the messages from the authorities? They say the addicts are getting even more aggressive since the whale appeared. The debris falling has increased, and the speed is off the charts. Shouldn't we be focusing on catching the whale first?\"\n\"You think Jung Bin hasn't thought of that? But it's a pain to catch something that flies around like that. And if we mess up, the buildings will get wrecked. There aren't any high-ranking awakened ones with flight abilities. They're probably pulling their hair out over it too. Ugh.\"\n\"What about throwing a spear at it?\"\n\"Spear-throwing isn't easy. Unless you're someone like J—... Wait a minute.\"\nBae Won-woo's voice dropped. His tone turned sharp as they stared at the soup restaurant. Damn, had they noticed him? But Cha Eui-jae quickly reconsidered.\n'No... We need to catch that whale anyway.'\nThat was why he had left Lee Sa-young's side. He needed to take care of this quickly and get back to check on Lee Sa-young with his own eyes. Ever since that warmth left his hand, he couldn't shake the feeling of unease.\n'I hope it's just unnecessary worry...'\nGiven that Cha Eui-jae's bad premonitions were usually right, he couldn't calm down. He stood up abruptly. With his mask on, there was nothing to worry about.\n\"Worst case, I can call on Seo Min-gi.\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae mentally summoned the master key Seo Min-gi, he slid open the door wide.\nScreech?\nThe addict who had been facing off with the two members of the Pado Guild turned its head 180 degrees to look at Cha Eui-jae, and—\nSmack—!\nCha Eui-jae instinctively kicked the addict. A beat later, he regretted it. His body usually moved faster than his brain in most situations.\n'Damn it.'\nThe addict let out a bizarre noise as it flew back, crashing into the wall with a thud.\nSoon, its twitching body went still. The menacing spikes receded. Bae Won-woo and Kang Ji-soo stared at Cha Eui-jae with stunned expressions. Bae Won-woo's mouth silently repeated, \"J, J, J...\" but Cha Eui-jae decided to ignore it.\n\"I don't know either. Let's just get this over with.\"\nCha Eui-jae pointed to the sky with his index finger. Their eyes followed the direction of his finger.\nMoooo... A whale perched at the tip of his finger let out a long, resonant cry. A distorted voice, without pitch or tone, spoke.\n\"I'm going to try and catch that thing. Could you cooperate?\"\nBae Won-woo gulped.\n\"W-what kind of cooperation?\"\nCha Eui-jae, or rather J, gestured toward the tall building with his chin. The one he had just been in, where Lee Sa-young was.\n\"Could you lend me the rooftop of the Pado Guild building?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Watching From the Gaps\nBzzz... The phone on the white table vibrated. A hand with a callus on the first joint of its index finger set down a teacup next to the phone. Steam rose in gentle swirls.\n\"Even serving me tea, how kind of you.\"\n\"It's noisy outside. Is it okay to ignore it?\"\nThe man in the white coat slightly lowered the blinds covering the window with his finger to peek outside. White ash was falling. A firm but wrinkled hand grasped the teacup.\n\"It must be a call for support. For some reason, that snake remains coiled and refuses to move.\"\n\"Still, you should go if you don't want to raise any suspicions.\"\n\"If you know that, then let's wrap this up quickly. Ivan.\"\n\"S-sure.\"\nThe man called Ivan turned around. Though he was hunched over in his white coat, he was quite large. Beneath his messily tousled brown hair, his glasses gleamed.\n\"Song Jo-heon-ssi, you've been a great help to our research, and I'm always grateful for that.\"\n\"I've also received a lot of help from you.\"\n\"Yes, so... in honor of today, I'd like to share with you our true purpose.\"\n\"We, Prometheus and the Prophets, have always... awaited the coming apocalypse. We've seen it in our dreams. The scene of the world covered in white ash.\"\nIvan turned to gaze at the screen covering one side of the wall. On the screen, a whale floated above the city. Ivan's eyes gleamed with ecstasy as he followed the whale's trajectory. His trembling voice muttered,\n\"Finally, finally the time of the apocalypse has arrived.\"\n'What nonsense.'\nAs if the time had really come. Song Jo-heon swallowed his sneer and nodded with a kindly smile, pretending to agree. Ivan continued talking without pause.\n\"The last apocalypse couldn't be stopped by the pure power of the Awakened. It was because we lacked strength.\"\n'Delusions of grandeur.'\n\"The problem was with the unfair selection process of the System. We need to develop the ability to free ourselves from the System's grasp...\"\n'Inferiority complex.'\nHe was saying this in front of someone chosen by the System. But Song Jo-heon, still feigning graciousness, agreed with him. Ivan's pale eyes sparkled.\n\"...We are going to save humanity.\"\n'A desire for self-justification.'\nHere comes the hero. His forced smile was beginning to ache. Song Jo-heon rubbed the rim of his teacup with the tip of his finger. The calloused scholar's hand slid a transparent pouch next to the teacup.\n\"And we are...\"\nInside the pouch was a white powder.\n\"...on the same side.\"\nA deep smile creased the corners of the wrinkled mouth. The firm hand took the pouch away. Soon, the powder dissolved completely in the lukewarm tea, leaving no trace.\n\"Of course, Professor.\"\nHe had no interest in the delusions of these psychopaths. After all, he was a first-generation Awakened chosen by the System. But he was definitely interested in the drugs they provided.\nThe whale, floating serenely in the air, let out a roar. Ivan turned sharply to the screen, his face filled with alarm, and zoomed in with the remote control. A black figure had appeared on the white whale.\nIn that figure's hand was...\nA giant spear.\nThe black figure raised the spear high. Song Jo-heon frowned and downed the tea. The veins on his temples and the back of his neck bulged before quickly subsiding. He muttered softly,\n\"The great hero... always knows how to steal the most critical moments.\"\nThe teacup clattered as it was carelessly set down on the table. Soon, the screen turned bright blue. Song Jo-heon closed his eyes, displeasure evident on his face.\nTap...\n***\nTap, tap, tap— busy footsteps scurried around. Reports and requests for support poured continuously through the earpiece. Ever since the black hole turned into a white hole, it had been a struggle to stabilize the situation, and just as things were beginning to calm down, the sudden appearance of a giant whale sent everything back to square one. No, it had actually made things worse. Jung Bin pressed his fingers to his temples and asked,\n\"Still no response from the Samra Guild?\"\n\"No, no reply yet.\"\n\"What's the situation with the Seowon Guild?\"\n\"Guild Leader Nam Woo-jin is doing his best, but it seems they've reached their limit on how many people they can accommodate.\"\n\"Do you know how many buildings that thing destroyed?\"\nA sharp voice cut through the stream of reports. Blonde hair tied up in a high ponytail swayed. It was Honeybee. When Jung Bin greeted her with a nod, she expertly wiped the blood off her rapier. Jung Bin shrugged.\n\"According to the reports, around twenty buildings so far. And the number's still growing.\"\n\"Make that one more. It just smashed an outdoor billboard. It was showing my face!\"\n\"I'll add it to the damage report.\"\n\"...Where is Lee Sa-young, and what is he doing?\"\n\"Not sure. I don't have any information on that.\"\n\"Unbelievable. If the first-ranked isn't going to show up, at least the second-ranked should be trying harder. These rankers are getting soft.\"\n\"Are you struggling?\"\nHoneybee closed her mouth tightly. Then she looked up at the sky. Jung Bin also lifted his head. The street they were on was shrouded in the shadow of the whale, making it dark even though it was daytime. Honeybee muttered,\n\"...This feels strange.\"\n\"What does?\"\n\"Ever since that black hole turned into this... I keep having these strange thoughts. Damn it, it's just making me overthink.\"\nHoneybee bit her lip hard and then suddenly glared at Jung Bin.\n\"Don't die on me.\"\n\"Excuse me? What's this all of a sudden?\"\n\"Just saying!\"\nWith that sharp retort, Honeybee suddenly disappeared from view. Before long, she was running so far away that she was just a yellow dot in the distance. Did she really come all this way just to say that? Jung Bin scratched his cheek, then looked back up at the sky. At the whale filling the heavens.\nIf only J were here.\nJung Bin shook his head, trying to dismiss the thought. He couldn't expect help from someone who went to rescue Yoon Ga-eul at his request. It was shameless, beyond unreasonable. But...\n\"...\"\nHe couldn't help but think of him in moments like this. Perhaps, in every crisis, he would always think of him. Jung Bin had lived in the same era as him, knew his goodness, and his strength well.\nMaybe that's why he tried so hard to erase those thoughts. He was sick of living off someone else's sacrifice.\nAnd then it happened.\nBwooo—\nA colossal roar echoed out. The shadow that had covered the street shook violently. The air currents shifted. Instinctively, Jung Bin looked up. The whale, which had been swimming leisurely in the sky, was now thrashing about. It looked as if it were in pain. Jung Bin unconsciously muttered,\n\"...No way.\"\nBoom—\nA burst of blue light erupted from the whale's body. Immediately after, a fierce storm swirled around the whale. Jung Bin covered his face with his arm, barely managing to stay on his feet. When the storm, mixed with ash, finally subsided, he cautiously lifted his head.\nA pillar of bright blue light had pierced through the whale's body, connecting the sky and the earth.\n\"Ah...\"\nFloating in the air, skewered by the pillar of light, the whale burst apart like fireworks, scattering into white ash. It was as if blue light particles were raining down. It was a breathtakingly beautiful and awe-inspiring sight, capable of captivating anyone. There was only one person in this world who could have done such a thing. Jung Bin swallowed his overwhelming emotions.\nSomeone whispered,\n\"J is back...\"\nHis name spread like a wave.\n***\nA week had passed since the black hole had transformed into a white hole. The white hole hadn't reverted back to black, and although white ash still occasionally fell on cloudy days, the frequency had noticeably decreased. Nonetheless, people made sure to have a broom handy to sweep away the ash.\nSome called it the \"Second Day of the Rift,\" but the damage wasn't severe enough to compare to the original Day of the Rift, so that nickname quietly faded away. There was significant property damage, but the loss of life was minimal. Moreover, people's attention was focused elsewhere.\n—In our next story: Hunter J, ranked number one in South Korea and presumed dead, reappeared after eight years, only to vanish once again...\nThe nation's hero, whom everyone believed to be dead. J, who had appeared in the rankings but was never actually seen by anyone, had returned at a critical moment to save the country once again before disappearing. It was the perfect story to calm people's anxieties. Every day, the news showed a photo of J wearing his mask, along with his hunter name.\nQuestions about what the white hole was or why this situation had suddenly occurred remained unanswered. News about an increase in people visiting psychiatrists, claiming to suffer from memories that weren't their own, also failed to attract much attention and quickly disappeared.\nAnd from that day on, the door to the hangover soup restaurant remained firmly shut.\n\"Still closed today, huh?\"\nA chilly wind brushed through his hair. Team Leader Han, hands buried in his coat pockets, muttered to himself. Beside him, Honeybee, arms crossed in her leather jacket, furrowed her delicate brow. Her hand tightly gripped her arm.\n\"Do you think it's because of what happened last time?\"\n\"If it were, the name would be on the casualty list. I've gone through the entire list, but it's not there.\"\n\"...\"\nTeam Leader Han took out a cigarette and placed it in his mouth, though he didn't light it. Honeybee sniffled.\n\"How can someone just disappear without a trace?\"\n\"That's what I'm saying.\"\n\"When he took his grandmother to the hospital, he posted a notice explaining why the restaurant was closed.

Honeybee stared at the red \"hangover soup\" sign, tracing the letters with her eyes before pouting slightly.\n***\nThe only light in the room, where thick blackout curtains blocked out every ray of light, came from the dim, amber glow of a bedside lamp. The shadow of a man sitting still on a chair against the wall was cast on the floor. The man was...\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae.\nHe was sitting with his legs crossed on the makeshift chair beside the bed, still wearing the clothes he had on when he left the house. His gaze never wavered from the person lying on the bed. Cha Eui-jae reached out and gently tidied the messy black hair. Lee Sa-young lay on the bed as if in a deep sleep.\nHe hadn't woken up in a week.\nWhen Cha Eui-jae found Lee Sa-young collapsed after killing the whale, he couldn't remember clearly what state of mind he was in or exactly what he had done. By the time he came to his senses, his entire body was bound by shadows, and all he could see was the limp and crumpled form of Seo Min-gi in the wreck.\nCha Eui-jae muttered softly.\n\"So, this is how you must have felt... when I didn't come back.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Did you want to teach me a lesson in empathy?\"\n\"...\"\nThere was no response. In fact, it was better this way than hearing from Lee Sa-young.\n\"Since you waited for me...\"\nCha Eui-jae gently took Lee Sa-young's hand, clasping it with both of his and pressing it to his forehead as if in prayer. His eyes, hidden behind his eyelids, slowly opened. His ocean-blue eyes gleamed.\n\"Now it's my turn to wait for you.\"\nWas this what you felt, too?\nIt feels like my heart is being torn apart, and I want to destroy everything.\n\"Sleep well.\"\nThe words were full of sorrow. After brushing the messy hair aside, Cha Eui-jae pressed a kiss to the exposed forehead of the person who had denied him.\nThe Hunter's Gonna Lay Low, Part 1 End.",

      "content": "Chapter 145: Day of Change\nMultiple screams intertwined in chaos, but there was no room to hear them properly. His feet pounded the ground relentlessly. His breath grew ragged. His heart, pushed to its limits, pounded as if it would burst. Even as nausea surged, he couldn't stop.\nBoom—!!\nThe ground rumbled as if an earthquake had struck. He staggered, unable to keep his balance. A massive explosion sounded right behind him. Sharp screams continued to echo beneath it all. Even though he knew he shouldn't look back, curiosity overpowered his fear.\nAnd then,\n\"Aaagh!\"\nA massive fist came flying straight at him. The man screamed and quickly rolled to the side. Dust and ash covered him, but that wasn't important. Thud! The fist, missing its target, slammed into the center of the pavement.\nCreaking, the giant golem's head slowly turned toward him. A colossal shadow loomed over the man's head.\nThe man squeezed his eyes shut, tears streaming down his face.\n'I shouldn't have looked back, I should've taken a different route, no, I shouldn't have left the house today at all.'\nThe thought didn't continue further. The man curled up, praying that the coming pain would be brief.\nAt that moment,\nFwip! Thud!\nInstead of the pain he expected, there was the sound of something being pierced. The man's head jerked up. The golem was frozen mid-punch, something protruding from the center of its chest. The tip was blunt, covered in black plastic...\n'...An umbrella?'\nAmazingly, what had pierced the golem's heart seemed to be a plain black umbrella, the kind sold at convenience stores.\nThe man gaped as he watched the umbrella leave a circular hole in the golem before vanishing. Perched on the golem's shoulder, which had stopped moving, was a figure shrouded in black. Even at a glance, it was clear the figure was a tall young man.\nThe figure in black raised the stick he was holding—\nWhack!\nAnd struck the golem's head.\nSlowly, the golem's body, which had been teetering, collapsed, sending up a cloud of dust. Coughs echoed here and there. After what seemed like a while, when the air finally cleared, the man craned his neck to look around, but the black figure was already gone. It felt like he'd seen a ghost.\nSoon, the sound of footsteps approached. Hunters in fluorescent vests appeared. One of them walked up to the man, who was still sitting on the ground.\n\"We're from the Rift Management Bureau. Are you okay?\"\n\"...It was J.\"\n\"Sorry?\"\nThe hunter, puzzled by the muttered reply, asked again, and the man responded louder.\n\"It was J!\"\n\"He was wearing a mask, so I couldn't see his face, but I'm sure it was J. He disappeared too fast to get a good look, but I'm certain it was J. He was all in black, so I couldn't see clearly, but it had to be J... Why do all these testimonies sound like this?\"\nThe hunter, reading through the statements, shrugged and turned off the tablet screen. The fluorescent 'Safety' armband on his arm shifted with the movement.\n\"All the witness statements are like this. He disappeared so quickly that they couldn't get a good look. But at least they're consistent.\"\nAnother hunter, crouched in front of the golem, rested his chin on his hand and replied.\n\"Judging by the clean way the core was pierced, it probably was J. Did he use a spear?\"\n\"According to the testimony... He pierced it with an umbrella.\"\n\"What, is this some sort of praise song? Did he also teleport?\"\n\"It was a life-or-death situation, so... it could be that the witness was mistaken.\"\nClap, a sharp sound of applause drew everyone's attention. The source was a woman in a fluorescent vest over a white shirt. She was Yang Hye-jin, an A-grade hunter from the Rift Management Bureau.\n\"Enough chit-chat. What about the witnesses?\"\n\"Yes! Due to the risk of additional monster appearances, they were escorted to a nearby shelter.\"\n\"Good job. Now, control the area and clean up the golem. It caused quite a ruckus appearing in the middle of the sidewalk.\"\nClicking her tongue, she shoved her hands into her pockets and hopped onto the collapsed golem.\nA breeze mixed with white ash blew. The fluorescent safety vest fluttered behind her. The fallen golem had a square head with a large dent in the middle. Somehow, the shape felt...\n\"...What is this?\"\nA strange sense of déjà vu hit her. Why does this seem familiar? It looks like something she's seen before. Yang Hye-jin furrowed her brow and stared intently at the dented head, even inserting her hand into the crevice. A hunter, controlling the scene, leaned in.\n\"Senior, they're transferring the golem to the Seowon Guild. They've requested it for research purposes.\"\n\"Perfect timing. Rookie, why does this seem familiar to me?\"\n\"What seems familiar?\"\n\"This head.\"\nRecently, both the Awakened Management Bureau and the Rift Management Bureau had been struggling with a manpower shortage. As a result, the rookie, who still hadn't escaped his position as the youngest, tiptoed to inspect the head. Yang Hye-jin muttered seriously.\n\"I'm sure I've seen it somewhere.\"\n\"...Is that so? I don't see it.\"\n\"Really? Ah, what is it?\"\nYang Hye-jin ruffled her hair in frustration. At that moment, a beep sounded from the walkie-talkie on her waist. A hunter repairing the damage called out.\n\"Senior! Team 2 is requesting support!\"\n\"Dammit...\"\n\"Ah, Team 1 is on their way.\"\n\"Nice. Hunter Jung Bin is the best.\"\nYang Hye-jin responded absentmindedly and brought the walkie-talkie to her ear. Come to think of it, the surroundings looked familiar. If you went down that alley, there was a hangover soup place she really liked. It had suddenly closed, though...\nThe thought made her even more depressed. She missed the spicy broth, tender meat, and the fragrant perilla powder. Not only was the food good, but the part-time worker was also so polite and efficient. His neat face floated in her mind. After just three months of not seeing him, his features had become a bit blurry.\nRegulars had cooperated to confirm the safety of the shop's owner and her granddaughter. However, the part-timer seemed to have vanished into thin air, leaving no trace behind.\n'He'd better be okay.'\nIt was hard not to worry since the shop had closed right after 'that day.' Yang Hye-jin murmured weakly.\n\"Ah, I really want some soju and hangover soup right now...\"\n\"Uh, Senior, the walkie-talkie is still on.\"\n\"What? Ah, crap!\"\n***\nThree months ago, after the Day of the Rift, the black hole that had settled in the sky turned white, and through that gap, a massive whale appeared. The media named the day the whale appeared in the sky as;\nThe Day of Change.\nIt was quite a grand name. Some, with a hint of humor, referred to it as the \"Day of Bleaching.\"\nFortunately, the Day of Change didn't cause as much damage as the Day of the Rift.\nThe falling debris from the hole gradually decreased in frequency, and after J dealt with the whale, no monster of that size appeared again. Of course, compared to the past, unobserved rifts and monsters started appearing more frequently, but people had already experienced this once and were quick to adapt to the changes.\nWith that, the seasons changed, winter passed, and the thaw of spring arrived. However, people didn't feel the arrival of spring as much as they used to. Not because of yellow dust or fine dust...\n\"I can't wear black clothes anymore.\"\nIt was because of the white ash falling like snow from the sky.\nPeople started calling the massive hole in the sky a \"White Hole.\"\nA news video was playing on a screen installed atop a building.\n—Guild Leader Mok Tae-oh of the HB Guild has stated that he will prioritize the safety of the public, while Guild Leader Song Jo-heon of the Samra Guild has announced that he will cooperate with the HB Guild to overcome this crisis...\n—Meanwhile, Guild Leader Lee Sa-young of the Pado Guild remains missing. The Pado Guild continues to maintain its previous stance that Guild Leader Lee is unable to appear in public due to health issues. However, with the frequency of unobserved rifts increasing, the public is growing more anxious about the absence of Hunter Ranking No. 2, Lee Sa-young...\nAmid the anchor's composed voice, a beep and a mechanical sound cut through.\n—A rift has been observed in Shinwol 5-dong, Yangcheon-gu. Any available teams, please respond.\n—Response Team 1 is en route.\n—Confirmed.\n\"Ugh.\"\nOn a rooftop covered with thick green waterproof paint, there was a large black umbrella fully open. Under the shade created by the umbrella, a small figure named Seo Min-gi was crouching and listening to the radio. He let out a sigh of admiration as he adjusted the radio channels with a delicate touch.\n\"You don't need to worry about this area. Let's check somewhere else.\"\nThe radio beeped again.\n—Ah, I really want some soju and hangover soup right now...\n—Uh, Senior...\nHangover soup. Behind the dark sunglasses, black eyes briefly glanced towards the edge of the rooftop. A tall man in a black jacket was leaning over the railing, his head slightly bowed. His face was hidden, completely obscured by a black mask that lacked even eye holes.\nAs the wind blew, his ashen hair lightly fluttered. It was almost the same color as the cloudy sky. Seo Min-gi suddenly asked,\n\"Aren't you going to dye your hair again?\"\n\"Is there a need to...\"\nA half-hearted response returned. It seemed the topic wasn't particularly welcome. Seo Min-gi pretended to focus on the radio, diverting the conversation.\n\"By the way... it's getting harder to stop the rumors. Recently, there's been a lot of pressure from the Samra Guild and the HB Guild. The Vice-Guild Leader is pretending to be oblivious and stalling them, but I wonder how long they can hold out...\"\n\"Pretending? Maybe he really is oblivious.\"\n\"Well, that's true.\"\nBetween his firm fingers, a half-burned cigarette rested. From beneath his feet, a shadow rose up, forming a round bowl shape. He flicked the ashes into the shadow bowl.\n\"It looks like they're trying to secure their position as the top guild once and for all.\"\n\"Good grief...\"\nA voice, modified to be unrecognizable, murmured.\n\"You've got to know where to extend your reach before you do.\"\nAt the end of the dry voice, there was a tinge of displeasure. Seo Min-gi didn't respond immediately, instead casting a glance up at the sky. The falling ash was gradually subsiding.\n\"Shall we call it a day and head back?\"\nThe ashen head slowly nodded. Seo Min-gi got up, holding the umbrella.\n\"Do you really have to use that umbrella?\"\n\"I don't like getting ash on my suit. And didn't the umbrella play a big role today?\"\n\"...That's true.\"\nThe shadow slowly engulfed his shoes.\n\"Then, I'll escort you to the door, sir. Please send my regards.\"\nThe man in the mask pinched the burning end of the cigarette between his thumb and forefinger and pressed it firmly. He didn't seem to feel the heat as he did so without hesitation. There wasn't a single mark left on his fingers once the ember was extinguished.\n\"Will do.\"\nOnly a bit of ash remained.\n***\nBefore he knew it, the man was standing in the entrance of a bleak and dark house. After removing his dusty shoes, he opened the inner door and gazed down the long hallway stretching ahead. The place was dim and silent. His altered voice broke the stillness as he spoke calmly.\n\"I'm home.\"\nNo reply came. But he was used to this silence following his greetings. Thankfully.\nHis feet moved soundlessly as he headed to the deepest part of the house. He opened a firmly closed door. The darkness welcomed him. Along with the sound of soft breathing.\nClick. He pressed a button, and a gentle amber nightlight flickered on. The bed was already occupied by someone. Black, curly hair was scattered across the pillow.\nA strong hand reached up to grasp the black mask and removed it. A neat face but sharp as a well-honed blade was revealed. J— Cha Eui-jae, leaned over, gripping the headboard, and quietly gazed at the person lying in the bed. Despite his best efforts, a tender voice escaped his dry lips.\n\"I'm back.\"\nThree months had passed since the Day of Change, and much had changed.\nBut Lee Sa-young remained asleep, unchanged.\nSince that day, and still now.",

      "content": "Chapter 146: Day of Change\nTwo and a half months ago.\nIt had been about two weeks and two days since Lee Sa-young had fallen asleep. Bae Won-woo, who not only sported a dark bruise around his eye but was also covered in bandages, gathered some people together. Among them, though he didn't remember it, was Cha Eui-jae— J, the one responsible for giving the 11th-ranked hunter and regular customer at the hangover soup restaurant, that bruise.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nA small group of people gathered together, invited by Bae Won-woo. Even though he had carefully selected them, an awkward silence filled the Pado Guild's meeting room. The attendees sat sparsely around a large table.\nJ, Bae Won-woo, Jung Bin, Seo Min-gi, Yoon Ga-eul, and Hong Ye-seong...\nDespite his usual shamelessness, Cha Eui-jae uncharacteristically bowed his head. It was understandable, considering that he had beaten up more than half of the hunters present in the room. Not that he remembered it. He was glad to be wearing his mask. He glanced over at Jung Bin.\nJung Bin had bandages wrapped around his head...\nCha Eui-jae cautiously asked, \"Are you okay?\"\n\"Hm? Oh, yes. I'm fine. I received treatment from Nam Woo-jin.\"\nJung Bin smiled softly, as if to reassure him. However...\n\"Why does the Shield Guy have a bruise around his eye? Who hit you?\"\nEven the usually calm Jung Bin couldn't maintain his composure when faced with the overly innocent but borderline malicious question from Hong Ye-seong. Cha Eui-jae pretended not to notice the slight flinch in Jung Bin's shoulders. Bae Won-woo, who had been rolling an egg over his bruised eyelid, grumbled.\n\"Keep it down.\"\n\"Wait, you really got hit?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Alright, enough with the jokes.\"\nAs the meeting room door suddenly swung open, the previously awkward atmosphere became tense in an instant. A sharp, suffocating killing intent filled the room. Nam Woo-jin, who bore the full brunt of this hostility, tilted his chin up without changing his expression.\n\"Is this how hunters greet their guests these days? I don't mind, but the student over there looks like they might pass out.\"\nAll eyes turned to Yoon Ga-eul, who sat in the corner, her face pale and drenched in sweat. Bae Won-woo hurriedly reined in his energy with a flustered expression.\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. It wasn't intentional. I've just been on edge lately...\"\n\"It's, it's okay...\"\n\"Here, would you like some juice? How about we all have a drink? I think we need something sweet.\"\nBae Won-woo quickly stood up and opened a refrigerator in the corner of the meeting room. Hong Ye-seong curiously peered inside.\n\"Why is there a fridge in here?\"\n\"Some people get angry when their blood sugar drops.\"\nGrape juice and orange juice were placed in front of everyone. After taking a sip of orange juice, Nam Woo-jin spoke briefly.\n\"Lee Sa-young has fallen asleep.\"\n\"Wait, really? Are you sure he's just sleeping?\"\nNam Woo-jin crossed his legs and turned in his seat, responding curtly to the bewildered Bae Won-woo.\n\"There are no signs that suggest brain death. On the contrary, his condition is identical to someone in a deep sleep.\"\n\"But is it okay for him to sleep this long?\"\n\"Black holes turned into white holes, and whales flew in the sky. Is it really that strange for someone to sleep a bit longer? It's entirely possible.\"\n\"But...\"\nNam Woo-jin raised a hand, cutting off Bae Won-woo.\n\"Of course, it's not normal. His body remains perfectly preserved without any need for external nourishment. There's no muscle atrophy. He simply exists there. As if time has stopped.\"\nTime stopped. Cha Eui-jae bit his lip. Bae Won-woo murmured sullenly.\n\"That's right...\"\n\"He's not just any hunter; he's a guild leader. We can't hide his absence for too long. First, think about how to handle this.\"\n\"The secret...\"\n\"Will be kept. I'll cooperate as much as I can, but...\"\nNam Woo-jin clicked his tongue in annoyance.\n\"The moment his absence is discovered, that old cunning fox won't sit idly by. Make sure you have a plan.\"\n\"Yes, thank you.\"\n\"...\"\nNam Woo-jin's cold, white eyes scanned the meeting room, his gaze finally settling on Cha Eui-jae. After briefly observing Cha Eui-jae with a mysterious expression, he turned and left the room.\nSilence returned.\n\"...\"\nBae Won-woo, who had been rubbing his temples, looked at Yoon Ga-eul.\n\"I heard from Jung Bin that our guild leader went to rescue you. Do you have any idea why? We need to know the reason to try anything.\"\n\"Ah, actually, I do have a theory...\"\nYoon Ga-eul swallowed nervously.\n\"But it's just a hypothesis, so don't take it too seriously.\"\nHer glasses glinted as they caught the light.\n\"I met Lee Sa-young-ssi from that ruined world. For whatever reason, he saved me. And not long after, J and this world's Lee Sa-young-ssi came to rescue me in that destroyed world.\"\nBae Won-woo cast a cautious glance at J, Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae nodded slightly to confirm. Yoon Ga-eul, biting her lip, asked,\n\"But can two versions of the same person exist in one world?\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"The person I met was wandering that world, waiting for the end to come. He chose not to leave that ruined world of his own will. But then this world's Lee Sa-young appeared, meaning there were two Lee Sa-youngs in one world.\"\nTwo Lee Sa-youngs in one world. The system's rules were absolute, and it demanded balance and order. Cha Eui-jae murmured in his altered voice,\n\"One has to disappear...\"\nOr they have to merge.\nWhen something splits into two, it must become one again. That's likely the conclusion the system came to. Yoon Ga-eul looked between Jung Bin and Cha Eui-jae.\n\"This is a bit off-topic, but haven't the occurrences of falling debris from the white holes decreased since Lee Sa-young-ssi fell into his deep sleep?\"\n\"...\"\nJung Bin answered with a troubled expression.\n\"We'll have to investigate that.\"\n\"Both the Lee Sa-young from that world and the one from this world are fundamentally the same person.\"\nIt was then that Seo Min-gi, who had been silently listening from the shadows, raised his hand.\n\"Wait, how can you be so sure of that?\"\n\"What's this all of a sudden?\"\n\"Because nothing is certain. I've heard the general story from Jung Bin, but that world has already been destroyed, hasn't it? We should consider the possibility that the essence we know might have been altered while he was alone there.\"\n\"That's...\"\nYoon Ga-eul's gaze wandered around the room before settling on Cha Eui-jae. Noticing her stare, Cha Eui-jae widened his eyes and pointed at himself, mouthing,\n'Me? Why?'\nYoon Ga-eul's expression turned awkward. She clenched her skirt over her tracksuit pants and averted her eyes.\n\"...I just felt they were the same person. No, I'm sure of it.\"\n\"Do you have any basis for that?\"\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\"Could you tell us what that is? For the sake of trust.\"\n\"...\"\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Yoon Ga-eul lowered her head and muttered,\n\"...Obsession.\"\n\"...Pardon?\"\nSeo Min-gi, who had been retracing Yoon Ga-eul's line of thought, covered his mouth in shock. Cha Eui-jae, too, was left speechless, staring at Yoon Ga-eul. Why on earth would she say that while looking at him? At that moment, someone filled the silence.\n\"Then their souls must have merged.\"\n\"What?\"\nEveryone's attention turned to Hong Ye-seong. He blinked as he folded and tossed a paper airplane made from scrap paper.\n\"If they're fundamentally the same, that means their roots are the same.\"\n\"What exactly are you trying to say?\"\nBae Won-woo asked bluntly. Hong Ye-seong clicked his tongue in annoyance, then suddenly stood up.\n\"Alright, let this genius explain it so even you can understand. Can someone lend me their cup? Oh, I'll use this. You're done drinking, right? Excuse me.\"\nHong Ye-seong grabbed the cups from Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo, placing them side by side on the table. The two, whose juices had been snatched, looked baffled, but he paid them no mind. Both cups contained grape juice, though in different amounts. Hong Ye-seong pointed to the left cup.\n\"What do you see?\"\n\"A glass.\"\n\"That's the container. What's inside?\"\n\"Grape juice.\"\n\"And this one?\"\n\"That's grape juice too.\"\n\"Alright then...\"\nHong Ye-seong poured all the juice from the right cup into the left cup. The juice filled the glass to the brim, almost overflowing. He pointed at the glass again.\n\"Now, what happens if two grape juices are forced to combine, regardless of their own will? What does that become?\"\n\"Grape juice...\"\n\"Exactly. When you combine the same juice, it doesn't suddenly turn into wine. Now, let's imagine this grape juice is Lee Sa-young's soul.\"\nCha Eui-jae uncrossed his arms. It made sense. Jung Bin, too, widened his eyes in surprise.\n\"That Lee Sa-young was holding onto an entire world, right? Then, their soul isn't ordinary. And the Lee Sa-young we know is also no ordinary person...\"\nHong Ye-seong lightly tapped the glass with the tip of the paper airplane. The surface of the fully filled juice wobbled dangerously, as if it would spill any moment.\n\"Now, two such souls have been poured into one body, filling it up just like this cup. That's why it's an emergency, so they've gone to sleep for now.\"\n\"Wow...\"\nClapping loudly with his large hands, Bae Won-woo jumped up from his seat.\n\"Hong Ye-seong, you're a freaking genius. That's crazy.\"\nHong Ye-seong's lips began to curl into a smile. Seo Min-gi, who had been standing like a reaper in the shadowy corner, also joined in clapping.\n\"You managed to make the Vice-Guild Leader understand at once... truly, you're a genius.\"\n\"What? Me, the world's greatest genius, the divine artisan blessed by the heavens, Hong Ye-seong?\"\n\"I didn't quite say it like that.\"\nIgnoring the comedy act unfolding before him, Cha Eui-jae tapped on the armrest of his chair. So far, this was the most reasonable and convincing theory. But soon, his suspicions crept in, and he glared at the artisan.\n'Is this guy the same Hong Ye-seong from the Memorial Dungeon?'\nIt was understandable. That Hong Ye-seong seemed far more intelligent than the one he knew. Sensing his confusion, Jung Bin leaned in, covering his mouth with his hand, and whispered in his ear.\n\"I call this his intermittent genius state.\"\n\"Is he always like this?\"\n\"Very rarely.\"\nMaybe it was like a broken clock being right twice a day. Just then, Bae Won-woo, who had been clapping, asked with concern.\n\"Then, is there no way to wake him up other than waiting? Can't we wake him up somehow?\"\n\"Hmm? If Lee Sa-young's state really is like this cup...\"\nHong Ye-seong tapped the edge of the table. The table creaked, and the cup shook with it. Eventually, some drops of juice spilled out of the cup.\nHong Ye-seong shrugged as he looked at the juice pooling below the cup.\n\"Even the slightest disturbance could ruin everything.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 147: Day of Change\nIt was a mess. Everyone's eyes were fixed on the grape juice slowly spilling out. It was clear that no one intended to forcibly wake Lee Sa-young. Bae Won-woo asked urgently.\n\"Then, do we have any idea when he'll wake up?\"\n\"How would I know! I'm not some fortune-teller, this is about Lee Sa-young's soul. It's up to him.\"\n\"Even though you're a god-given genius, the best artisan?\"\n\"La~la~la~, I can't hear you.\"\nHong Ye-seong plugged his ears and fled to the corner of the conference room.\n\"...So, the best course of action is to just leave things as they are now.\"\nAfter Jung Bin's words, silence fell over the conference room again. According to Hong Ye-seong, all they could do was wait. Without being able to do anything, overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness.\nI should have stayed closer.\nIf only I had delayed dealing with the whale a bit longer.\nCha Eui-jae clenched the hand that had been resting on the table. Though his grip was weak, the already unstable glass overflowed with juice. The juice spilled out of the glass and began spreading wider and wider. As he watched the purple trail, he closed his eyes. Between the darkness that engulfed his vision, a pair of purple eyes emerged.\nWhen did it start? The once detached and observing eyes now held warmth.\n\"Come back soon, Hyung.\"\nDid Lee Sa-young know his own future back when he farewelled me like that? He probably did. Didn't he hand me the transfer scroll while pretending to make a pinky promise?\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae's life had always been a series of choices. Until now, he had always chosen the path where he could save the most people.\n\"...\"\nBut.\nThe image of Lee Sa-young lying helplessly in the bathroom flickered in front of his eyes. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth. Just then,\nClap!\nA sharp clap echoed in his ears. Startled, Cha Eui-jae snapped back to reality and looked up. Standing beside him, Jung Bin was staring at him quietly.\n'How long have I had my head down?'\nAs Cha Eui-jae straightened his hunched body, Jung Bin smiled softly and patted his back.\n\"Now it's time to think about what we can do.\"\n\"We?\" It felt strangely unfamiliar. Cha Eui-jae looked around at the people sitting in the conference room. Come to think of it, Cha Eui-jae wasn't alone right now. Jung Bin continued speaking slowly.\n\"We need to find other ways to fill the void left by Lee Sa-young. Fortunately, he's not a hunter whose every move is under scrutiny, and here...\"\nHis gaze shifted to J.\n\"...Thanks to J, who suddenly appeared and handled the whale excellently, the attention will be on him for a while. The sudden emergence of a number-one hunter is a big deal. Still...\"\nJung Bin gestured toward the window with his eyes. White ash was still gently falling from the sky.\n\"The situation being what it is, someone is bound to come looking for Lee Sa-young. A few unanswered calls are fine, but continued silence will raise suspicions.\"\nBae Won-woo, who had been pondering with his head down, muttered.\n\"...Can we just say he's abroad for a bit?\"\nSeo Min-gi burst out.\n\"Are you trying to make him become a traitor in this situation? Even Hunter Gyu-Gyu is in Korea right now!\"\n\"Damn it, why is Gyu-Gyu still in Korea when it's not even Chuseok? What do we do?\"\n\"No matter what, we can't hide Lee Sa-young's absence for long. The other guilds will be eager to seize this chaos as an opportunity to expand their power. They'd want to take the national hero's place.\"\n\"Is there... anything you could do to help us? After all, we've been through so much together, like chopping firewood and blowing on our hands to warm them in that run-down hut with Lee Sa-young, right, Captain?\"\nBae Won-woo put on a pitiful expression, clasping his hands and furrowing his eyebrows in a pleading manner. But Jung Bin shook his head.\n\"I've already factored my cooperation into what I'm saying.\"\n\"Oh no...\"\n\"If.\"\nThe voice, altered and emotionless, caught everyone's attention. The voice belonged to J, who was sitting with his legs crossed. He rubbed the table with his index finger and tilted his head slightly.\n\"If I start to act properly.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Could I cover up Lee Sa-young's absence?\"\nA serious expression settled on Jung Bin's previously startled face. He stroked his chin and muttered.\n\"...For a while.\"\n\"Not for long?\"\n\"Public interest shifts easily. But we could hold out for a month or two.\"\n\"Then let's do that.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Two months.\"\nJ held up two fingers, forming a V.\n\"I'll be active on the front lines for the next two months, so leak the story to the media and get all the attention focused on me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If Lee Sa-young still hasn't woken up by then, we'll figure out another way. Anyone opposed?\"\nNo one responded. But it was familiar. Being on the front lines, the lack of response. And...\n\"Then it's settled.\"\nBecoming a hero.\nWith those words, he stood up without hesitation and walked straight to Hong Ye-seong, who was folding cranes in the corner.\n\"Hey, you.\"\nHong Ye-seong blinked up at him.\n\"Huh? What? Oh, right. Are you here to tell me how the mission went? How was it? I worked really hard—\"\nEnough was enough. Cha Eui-jae clamped his hand over the mouth that was spewing words like a waterfall. Hong Ye-seong's bright brown eyes widened in protest.\n\"Mmph! Mmph!\"\nThe altered voice gave a short command.\n\"Turn it on. The one... where your eyes turn gold.\"\n\"Mmph?\"\n\"Hurry up. We don't have time.\"\nHis eyes blinked blankly, and then golden patterns began to emerge and rotate in his eyes. It was undoubtedly the Eye of Appraisal, but...\n'It's different from the one I saw in the Memorial Dungeon.'\nThe Eye of Appraisal he saw there was more complex, chaotic, and vivid.\n'Are they entirely separate entities?'\nCha Eui-jae removed his hand from Hong Ye-seong's mouth. Hong Ye-seong tilted his head.\n\"Why the Eye of Appraisal all of a sudden? Got something you need analyzed?\"\n'But... it's not clear yet.'\nCha Eui-jae held onto a sliver of possibility. If, like Lee Sa-young, the two shared the same soul origin, there must be a connection somewhere.\n'You said this was the last chance.'\n'Hong Ye-seong' had helped the Cha Eui-jae of the first world when he turned back time. And, likely, he'd been watching over him ever since. Watching his struggles to prevent the end.\n'He's probably watching even now.'\nCha Eui-jae pulled out his phone with the cracked screen and handed it over.\n\"Put your number in.\"\nHong Ye-seong's eyes sparkled with an overwhelming brightness.\n\"Wow... Are you asking for my number?\"\n\"Just put it in.\"\n\"Can I text you whenever I'm bored?\"\n\"Don't.\"\nAs soon as the number was entered, Cha Eui-jae snatched the phone back and briskly opened the conference room door. He gave a quick bow to the people who stared at him with dumbfounded expressions.\n\"Well then, I'll be off. If you need to get in touch, do it through Seo Min-gi.\"\nClick.\nOnce the conference room door closed, silence settled in. He let out a short sigh. The tightness in his chest showed no signs of easing. Cha Eui-jae started walking, casually tapping his chest near his heart with his fist. Then it happened.\n\"Hey, wait a minute!\"\nA familiar, deep voice stopped him in his tracks. It was the voice he'd heard morning, noon, and night at the hangover soup restaurant.\nHabits are truly frightening. Without thinking, Cha Eui-jae instinctively turned around, slipping his hand into his pocket, ready to pull out an order pad and pen. Of course, there was no pen. He was wearing his combat uniform, after all!\n'Damn it, fuck.'\nCha Eui-jae stood awkwardly and faced Bae Won-woo. Fortunately, Bae Won-woo seemed distracted and didn't pay any attention to the strange posture in front of him. Bae Won-woo hesitated for a moment before speaking.\n\"Uh, by the way.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"That... do you...\"\nHis heart pounded with guilt. Could it be about the hangover soup restaurant? Surely he hadn't figured out that Cha Eui-jae was the part-timer. Cha Eui-jae clenched his fist behind his back, ready to resort to memory-erasing (by force) if necessary. But what Bae Won-woo said next was entirely unexpected.\n\"Did you know that Sa-young had been looking for J all this time?\"\n\"...What?\"\nCha Eui-jae's mouth opened slightly. Bae Won-woo scratched his head.\n\"Ah... I wasn't going to mention this. Please don't pretend you know about this even if Sa-young wakes up later. I'm serious. Promise me.\"\nBae Won-woo clasped his hands together and made a pleading gesture. Watching him, Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath and stepped back.\n\"No, it's okay.\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"You don't need to tell me.\"\n\"But still...\"\n\"I already know.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I know that Lee Sa-young was waiting for me, that he was searching for me.\"\nHis heart pounded chaotically every time he mentioned Lee Sa-young's name. Cha Eui-jae paused for a moment before lowering his head.\n\"I appreciate it, but I'll hear it directly from Lee Sa-young when he wakes up.\"\n\"Oh, okay...\"\n\"Goodbye.\"\nOnly after the black figure disappeared and the sound of footsteps faded completely did Bae Won-woo let out a big sigh. Cold sweat was beading on his forehead. He exhaled and glanced back slightly.\n\"...Did it show? That I was nervous?\"\nSeo Min-gi, who had appeared from Bae Won-woo's shadow, pushed up his sunglasses.\n\"He's not that much of a psycho. Probably.\"\n\"I know, man. But what can I do if my body tenses up after getting beaten up so badly?\"\n\"...\"\nSeo Min-gi didn't respond, just shrugged his shoulders. Indeed, that day, J...\n\"Was like a ghost.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Nothing. Hunter Jung Bin is calling for you.\"\n\"Ah, okay.\"\nBae Won-woo trudged back into the conference room. Seo Min-gi rubbed the back of his neck as he stared down the empty hallway. Cold sweat had soaked him before he realized it.\nOn the Day of Change, J lost his mind and went on a rampage in the house of Guild Leader Lee Sa-young, only to be subdued by A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi, Shield Guy, and Jung Bin. In truth, saying he was subdued isn't accurate. To be precise...\nHe 'allowed himself' to be subdued. Probably...\n\"...\"\nEven while losing his mind, he was concerned about causing harm to Lee Sa-young.\n'It seems he doesn't clearly remember what happened that day...'\nSeo Min-gi rubbed his mouth, letting out a rare sigh. Being personally singled out by J meant that he was in for a grueling time ahead.\nOf course, as the ultimate workaholic, Seo Min-gi secretly welcomed the emergence of his new master.",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Day of Change\nFor two and a half months, Cha Eui-jae did his best, with Seo Min-gi at his feet, the Pado Guild at his back, and the support of top civil servant Jung Bin. He tackled dungeons, rifts, and monsters without discrimination.\nDuring this time, he also witnessed how Jung Bin skillfully manipulated public opinion using his well-known face. There was indeed a reason he monopolized all the public service advertisements. Eight years was more than enough time to turn a diligent colleague into a sly fox.\nHowever, it seemed that the makeshift solutions like \"A hero who reappeared after 8 years to save the country again!\" were starting to lose their effect. Especially with articles beginning to question Lee Sa-young.\n'I wish a giant monster would show up.'\nThe public, who had once cheered J's return, was gradually starting to take J's efforts for granted. After all, he was a hero. If a problem arose, they assumed he would naturally come to the rescue. Bae Won-woo, whom Cha Eui-jae occasionally ran into, often muttered with a displeased expression.\n\"It's absolutely not something to be taken for granted. Everyone is just too complacent about safety.\"\nCha Eui-jae would just shrug his shoulders. He had experienced it too many times to be surprised anymore.\nHis thumb busily swiped across the screen. Cha Eui-jae mechanically skimmed through the news headlines until he suddenly stopped. On the screen was a photo of a middle-aged man with a tiger-like face and streaks of white in his hair. Song Jo-heon. The title of the article featuring his photo read;\n[Why is the Hero Silent? The Mystery of the West Sea Rift]\n\"...\"\nHe tossed his phone into the drawer next to the sofa.\n\"This is such a headache...\"\nTap, tap, tap... The sound of his fingers drumming on the leather sofa ceased.\nLee Sa-young's house was silent. According to Seo Min-gi, Lee Sa-young was a light sleeper who would be disturbed by even the slightest noise at night. That's why they had installed thorough noise-canceling equipment.\nIn truth, it wasn't something Cha Eui-jae was particularly happy about. He needed noise to sleep soundly. Ever since he escaped from the West Sea rift.\nCha Eui-jae rolled up the loose sleeve of his shirt. On his left wrist was a badly broken silver watch. Among the three pairs of small clock hands, only one was crawling along slowly.\n'The last chance.'\nWhen all the clock hands stopped, had he succeeded or failed?\nCha Eui-jae took off the watch and placed it on the sofa's armrest, then played an eight-hour rain sound video on his phone before using a cushion as a pillow and closing his eyes. Perhaps it was the knowledge that Lee Sa-young was just beyond the wall that made him feel not so lonely.\nHis consciousness slowly began to sink.\nEventually, Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes. The surroundings were familiar. It was the hallway of the former Awakened Management Bureau building, which he had frequented more often than his own home. The murmuring sounds were clear.\nHis feet carried him across the hallway without hesitation. The faces of the people he passed were mostly blurry. If he tried to focus on them, they would quickly blur into black smudges. Then, the only person with a clear face appeared— a woman sitting with her legs crossed, looking prim. It was Honeybee. She rested her chin on her hand when she saw Cha Eui-jae.\n'What are you doing here?'\n\"It's not strange for me to be here. What's strange is you being here.\"\n'I'm here to meet Jung Bin, so don't give me a hard time.'\nHoneybee added curtly.\n'I heard you were out in the mountains of Gangwon-do.'\n\"That was yesterday. You're behind on the news.\"\n'Tsk.'\nShe turned her head sharply, her long, tied-up blonde hair swaying. Cha Eui-jae stubbornly asked.\n\"How have you been lately?\"\n'Same as usual. By the way...'\nHoneybee nodded towards the end of the hallway and stood up. It was the direction of the emergency stairs. Cha Eui-jae followed her, pretending not to notice as he pulled out a cigarette pack from his pocket. Bang, the door closed. Honeybee glanced around, lowering her voice to a whisper.\n'So, I talked to Matthew like you said. It's true that the frequency of rift occurrences has increased recently. There are also several rifts where the existence of the rift has been concealed to alleviate public anxiety, and Matthew found it strange too.'\n\"...\"\n'The frequency of monsters bursting out of the rifts has also increased. I contacted Gyu-Gyu, and he said it's the same overseas. The situation is looking ominous.'\n\"Got it.\"\nHoneybee frowned and crossed her arms.\n'If you find out anything, share it, okay? You're not doing this just to save yourself.'\n\"...Sorry. I don't have anything certain yet.\"\n'Hey, J.'\nHer bright brown eyes gleamed sharply.\n'Please don't... try to... do it alone...'\nHoneybee's voice and face began to blur as they stared at each other. Soon, the entire scene around him started to distort. Cha Eui-jae muttered.\n\"Another dead end today.\"\nAnd shortly after, Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes again. The familiar, dark ceiling greeted him.\nThe sound of rain continued endlessly. Cha Eui-jae reached for the watch and phone beside his bed. Only 30 minutes had passed. He slowly got up and started walking. He opened the firmly closed door.\nFinding the chair next to the bed in the darkness, he sat down and looked at the faintly visible profile next to him. Cha Eui-jae then lay down, resting his head on the bed.\n***\nAfter Lee Sa-young fell asleep, Cha Eui-jae occasionally saw things in his dreams. In these dreams, he became \"Cha Eui-jae,\" moving, traveling, and conversing with people— some familiar, some unfamiliar. He met Lee Sa-young multiple times.\n'Hyung.'\nIn that place, Lee Sa-young had black eyes, was good at cooking, and was kind. It wasn't until after Cha Eui-jae had eaten the meal that Lee Sa-young had prepared for him that he realized.\n'This isn't a dream.'\nAfter all, it's impossible to taste something in a dream, right?\nWhat Cha Eui-jae was seeing was a vivid memory, likely the memory of the first Cha Eui-jae, judging by the black eyes and the layout of the house.\nThe phenomenon of seeing something every time he slept was something only Yoon Ga-eul, a specialist in such matters, could understand. So he sought her out first for advice. They met on the rooftop of the high school she attended. Cha Eui-jae chose to break the lock on the rooftop door to ensure a quiet conversation.\nSniffling as she listened, Yoon Ga-eul tilted her head.\n\"You say this never happened before, but it started after the Day of Change?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Is there anything different from before? If it appeared suddenly, there must be a cause.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been pondering for a while, mumbled.\n\"There's too much.\"\n\"Can you pick just a few really important ones?\"\nCha Eui-jae began folding his fingers one by one.\n\"First, I quit my part-time job at the hangover soup restaurant. Instead, I started working as J.\"\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young fell asleep...\"\nBy the time Cha Eui-jae had folded about five fingers, Yoon Ga-eul, who had been quietly listening, spoke.\n\"Everything you've mentioned so far is mostly changes in your environment, right? What about changes that happened to you personally?\"\n\"Me?\"\n\"Yes. For example...\"\nYoon Ga-eul fiddled with her hair.\n\"Your hair turning ashen gray... or that watch on your wrist. Come to think of it, we were so focused on Guild Leader Lee Sa-young collapsing that we haven't investigated the watch yet, have we?\"\n\"Ah.\"\nCha Eui-jae hurriedly rolled up his jacket sleeve, revealing the worn-out watch that looked like it could break at any moment. Yoon Ga-eul spoke with concern.\n\"This seems like it could be the cause. Why not try sleeping with the watch far away from you first?\"\nIt was quite a reasonable suggestion. Cha Eui-jae had Seo Min-gi leave the watch at the hangover soup restaurant before going to bed. That night, instead of dreaming of a kind Lee Sa-young, he dreamt of the West Sea rift. The moment it became clear the watch was the cause.\nThere was another expert when it came to items— Hong Ye-seong, the self-proclaimed and widely recognized world's greatest artisan.\nHis latest secret hideout was at the end of Inwangsan. With Jung Bin's help, Cha Eui-jae entered the quiet house where the artisan was staying, only for Hong Ye-seong to come running out on all fours, clinging to Cha Eui-jae's pants.\n\"I was bored to death! You didn't even text me! I hate you!\"\nJung Bin, who had been watching with his hands behind his back, smiled warmly.\n\"You wouldn't have seen it even if he sent one.\"\n\"But still!\"\nApparently, every time he was confined to a remote location, Lee Sa-young would restore the internet for him, but this time, Lee Sa-young had fallen asleep, leaving him truly disconnected from the world. As Hong Ye-seong recounted this while grilling seaweed with the fire emitted by Kkokko, he suddenly spoke up.\n\"You said that watch was used to turn the world, right? That... first version of you.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Then it must have gathered a tremendous amount of energy. And you said you became the pivot.\"\n\"I did.\"\n\"When something needs a pivot, it means that the item alone can't do anything. The pivot and the item have to come together and become one for it to finally work.\"\n\"Become one?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nKkokko, who had just spat out a small ember, began to busily scurry around Cha Eui-jae. As he cut the seaweed with scissors, Hong Ye-seong mumbled.\n\"Maybe that watch has fused with part of the 'Cha Eui-jae' who became the pivot? It didn't suck in your body, but... hmm, maybe your memories or... strong desires were embedded in it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And now, meeting with the same Cha Eui-jae is causing some sort of reaction. If it's not harmful to your body, wouldn't it be good to keep experiencing it? You might find some clue.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Of course, I didn't make it, so I can't say for sure!\"\nOnce again, a hint of wisdom began to creep into Hong Ye-seong's words. It was too frequent to be just an intermittent occurrence. Cha Eui-jae, eyeing Hong Ye-seong suspiciously, suddenly smacked him on the back.\n\"Ow!\"\n\"Squawk!\"\nBoth Hong Ye-seong and Kkokko screamed simultaneously...\n***\nBeep beep beep beep beep—\nCha Eui-jae woke up again. His phone was flashing red and ringing loudly. Cha Eui-jae quickly sat up. It was an emergency call from Jung Bin.\n—An eroded dungeon has appeared in Mokpo. It's larger in scale than before.\nAn eroded dungeon. It might be connected to the West Sea rift. He was instantly wide awake. Without further thought, Cha Eui-jae urgently got up and dashed out of the room. As the door shut behind him, silence returned to the large house.\nThe silver watch left in the darkness gleamed.",

      "content": "Chapter 149: What’s Reflected in the Mirror\nDrip, drip, drip... Water droplets fell from the stalactites and pooled on the ground. The puddle gradually spread and met a red liquid. The clear water quickly turned crimson. The air inside the cave was damp and reeked of blood. Blood was dripping from the stacked bodies of monsters in the corner.\nCha Eui-jae was sitting on a flat rock, hunched over, with an unlit cigarette in his mouth. He quietly listened to the sounds outside. Whooosh...\n\"It seems to have a cycle, doesn't it?\"\nSeo Min-gi, who was standing like a shadow in a secluded corner of the cave, responded.\n\"Yes. It seems to come in bursts and then stop, following a certain pattern.\"\nOutside the cave, white ash was swirling like a blizzard, making it impossible to move freely. To be precise, if Cha Eui-jae were alone, he would have already braved the ash and finished the investigation. However, thanks to Seo Min-gi's excuse of not wanting to dirty his suit with white ash, they were waiting together inside the cave. Cha Eui-jae grumbled.\n\"How dangerous can ash be...\"\n\"It may not be dangerous to you, but it could be to the next investigation team. We need to check all potential hazards.\"\nThat left him with little to argue. Cha Eui-jae also knew well the importance of investigation. Didn't he once make something akin to a monster encyclopedia? After smacking his lips, he glanced at the shadow. Seo Min-gi was timing something with an analog stopwatch.\nClick. Seo Min-gi, pressing the button, asked without looking at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"How is the guild leader? Just to clarify, this question is not from me, but from Vice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae propped up his chin and answered indifferently.\n\"Same as usual.\"\n\"No changes at all?\"\n\"None. He just keeps sleeping. No change in his complexion either.\"\n\"Usually, in these cases, a kiss filled with love is what wakes them up.\"\nCha Eui-jae doubted his ears. Did he really understand that correctly? Have I pushed Seo Min-gi too far? Has he finally gone mad? Cha Eui-jae straightened up from his hunched position, looking at Seo Min-gi with a shocked expression. Seo Min-gi, still serious, added.\n\"Just to clarify again, that was Vice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo's opinion, not mine. If you have anything to say, please address it directly to him.\"\n\"You relay other people's words just fine, but why not mine?\"\n\"Relaying curses goes against my principles.\"\n\"It's not a curse, so relay it.\"\n\"I'll listen.\"\n\"Tell him if he has time to watch a Disney movie, he should be working hard instead.\"\n\"That's a reasonable opinion, and I agree with it, so I'll relay it.\"\nCha Eui-jae, glaring at Seo Min-gi, chewed on his cigarette.\n'A kiss to wake him up?'\nDoes he think I haven't tried it? Does he think I haven't done it?\nNow that he thinks about it, anger rises. Before the Day of the Rift, Cha Eui-jae was just an ordinary teenager in South Korea, exposed to countless stories and visual media about sleeping princesses waking up from a prince's kiss filled with love. Having grown up watching and listening to such stories, it was impossible not to think of it when he saw Lee Sa-young sleeping.\nBut, nothing changed just by kissing!\nLooking back now, Cha Eui-jae must have been out of his mind, staying up for days on end. Of course, the person out of their mind never realizes it themselves. Cha Eui-jae had sat by the sleeping Lee Sa-young's bed, leaned over as if mesmerized, and kissed him...\nNaturally, Lee Sa-young did not wake up.\n'Fuck.'\nFor the next two days, Cha Eui-jae didn't enter Lee Sa-young's room. Cha Eui-jae squeezed the cigarette so hard it broke in two, then tapped the floor with his foot. However, Seo Min-gi seemed to interpret his embarrassment differently.\n\"Are you anxious?\"\nAm I anxious?\nCha Eui-jae stopped his foot, which had been tapping like a metronome.\n\"...\"\nProbably.\nThe kiss he gave to the sleeping Lee Sa-young, and the uneasy feeling in his chest, all stemmed from anxiety. How did Lee Sa-young wait, for eight years? Even this fleeting time compared to eight years makes him so anxious.\nLee Sa-young may be asleep, but he's still breathing, alive. In a place where Cha Eui-jae can see him. That's why Cha Eui-jae could hold on. Seeing him made him sure.\nBut Lee Sa-young endured all this time, not even knowing whether Cha Eui-jae was alive, holding on solely to faith. Faith in Cha Eui-jae's return, something even Cha Eui-jae himself was unsure of, believing that he was still alive.\n\"...\"\nI know. I know that safety is the most important thing. But the anxiety that makes my heart stir is something I can't control. What if something happens to Lee Sa-young while I'm wasting time like this? What if another problem arises? What if something happens that I can't handle?\nWhat if I lose him again?\nCrack. His fingers, gripping tightly, bent.\nCha Eui-jae put down the cigarette and put on his mask. Behind the black mask, all expression vanished, and the emotions that had been stirring settled down. His fevered head cooled down.\n'But nothing changes by doing this.'\nNow was the time to move forward. More than anything, Cha Eui-jae wasn't alone now. Cha Eui-jae lifted his head. Seo Min-gi was still looking at him with an indifferent expression. Surprisingly, that was quite comforting.\n\"Have you timed it all?\"\n\"Yes. Although the sample size is small, it seems that after five minutes of the storm, there's a twenty-minute break. We'll have to check if the ash is still accumulating outside.\"\n\"It's like a Pomodoro.\"\n\"You know about that?\"\n\"I saw it on YouTube. Then it should stop soon...\"\nCha Eui-jae, who was getting up, hesitated. Seo Min-gi, who had been tiptoeing to avoid the pool of blood as he moved out of the shadows, looked at him curiously.\n\"Is there a problem, sir?\"\n\"No...\"\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his left wrist. He thought something felt off, but he didn't even realize his watch was missing. He had been so focused on the word \"eroded dungeon\" that he grabbed Seo Min-gi by the back of the neck and used Hong Ye-seong's scroll to rush straight to Mokpo.\n\"...\"\nI must have left it at Lee Sa-young's house. No one else could enter there, so no one would take it, but...\n'I'm worried about every little thing now...'\nCha Eui-jae tapped the floor with the tip of his boot and clicked his tongue.\n\"I need to hurry. I'll handle the dungeon's master, so please investigate the dungeon in the meantime.\"\n\"Hmm, understood. Please specify the targets.\"\nAn eroded dungeon is a dungeon that has been corrupted by a ruined world. It also means that the dungeon is partially connected to that world they once visited. If that's the case...\n\"First, the point connected to the West Sea rift. And second...\"\n\"Traces of 'Lee Sa-young,' who stayed in that ruined world.\"\nThere must be traces left somewhere of the time Lee Sa-young spent wandering that place. If he follows those traces, he might eventually find a key to solving Lee Sa-young's situation.\n'They say leaving it alone is the best course of action...'\nBut he couldn't just stand by and do nothing. Cha Eui-jae himself couldn't allow that.\nSeo Min-gi put away the stopwatch and pushed his sunglasses up the bridge of his nose.\n\"Understood. I'll summon you through the shadow as soon as I find it.\"\nThe swirling ash gradually subsided. Cha Eui-jae gripped a massive spear and stepped forward, ready to face the encroaching, stark silence.\n***\n...Lee Sa-young opened his eyes.\n\"...\"\nA vast sea stretched out before him. The sea wasn't blue; only black and white existed there. As black waves surged, white foam shattered. Lee Sa-young looked up at the sky. There was no hole where it should have been. So, this place wasn't reality.\nHe began to walk slowly along the boundary where the waves met the sand. No footprints were left on the fine white sand. He walked endlessly. With each step, it felt as though his mind was being washed away. All thoughts crumbled and reformed.\nLee Sa-young thought absently.\n'I need to go back.'\nWhy?\n'They'll be waiting.'\nWho?\n'Hyung...'\nWho is Hyung?\n'...'\nI don't know.\nSplash...\nAt that moment, a wave touched his bare feet. Strangely, it wasn't cold. Instead, it felt soft, like the touch of human skin. So much so that he regretted the wave retreating. Lee Sa-young shifted his gaze toward the sea, where the wave was returning. In the middle of the black sea, there was a massive hole.\n\"...Ah.\"\nLee Sa-young's eyes widened. That hole looked exactly like the spot where the West Sea rift had disappeared. He couldn't not know. He had watched it for eight years, endlessly. That sea, while waiting for Cha Eui-jae.\n\"You finally came here. With your mind intact.\"\nThen, a familiar voice echoed. It was familiar, of course.\n\"Though I don't know why...\"\nBecause it was his own voice.\nThrough the disheveled black hair, lavender eyes glowed brightly. 'Lee Sa-young' was standing opposite him. They were both standing on the boundary between the waves and the sand.\nIn a low voice, Lee Sa-young asked.\n\"Where is this place?\"\n'Lee Sa-young' tilted his chin slightly upward in a way that was eerily similar to his own mannerisms, causing Lee Sa-young to frown.\n\"A place where lost and forgotten things gather.\"\nThe lavender eyes looked far out at sea, toward the hole. Just as he said, the black sea water was pouring into the hole like a waterfall.\nAfter a moment, 'Lee Sa-young' laughed softly.\n\"We should've merged into one, not knowing of each other's existence...\"\n\"...\"\n\"That means something went wrong. The fact that we're facing each other like this.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Where did it go wrong, I wonder...\"\n\"You don't know?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh... I know all too well.\"\nLee Sa-young dragged out his words with a twisted smirk. A gleam of amusement flickered in the lavender eyes.\nA giant clock appeared in the stark white sky. Inside the clock were three smaller clocks. Of the four dials, only one was moving.\n\"The one who messes up my plans and comes to get me...\"\nLee Sa-young laughed.\n\"There's only one person like that in this world.\"\n\"...\"\n'Lee Sa-young' closed his eyes with a deep sigh.\n\"Of course...\"\nAs the clock's second hand moved busily, the sea began to surge. Soon, a black wave rose high. A dark shadow loomed over them.\n\"However, you won't be able to simply enjoy it.\"\nThe lavender eyes disappeared behind the closing eyelids. The black wave crashed down upon them. Swoosh—\nThe voice shattered into the wave.\n\"...Because I'll be chasing him...\"\n***\nIn a dark room.\n\"...\"\nLong eyelashes that had been closed slowly lifted.",

      "content": "Chapter 150: What’s Reflected in the Mirror\nAs his eyes blinked a few times, his thin eyelids trembled slightly. His unfocused eyes stared blankly into the darkness. The first thought that came to him was nothing significant.\n'Am I blind again...?'\nJust that.\nFortunately, as his senses gradually adjusted to the darkness, he began to distinguish the objects around him. He slowly propped himself up on his elbows from the mattress. The sensation of the blanket covering his body felt familiar. It was probably his bedroom at home.\nHe reached out and turned on the bedside lamp. The room filled with a crimson glow, casting a reddish hue on his pale face.\n...\nIt felt like he had a very long dream.\n...\nBut was it really a dream?\nSomething glittered on the soft blanket. Without hesitation, he grasped it and got out of bed. With each step, his body wobbled. Moving felt unfamiliar, as if it wasn't his own body.\nHe opened the door. His bare feet touched the cold wooden floor several times as he made his way to the large window.\n\"...\"\nHis clouded eyes turned toward the sky beyond the window. The massive hole in the middle of the sky was now white, and white ash was drifting down. It was a scene he had witnessed countless times over an agonizingly long period.\nThe landscape of the apocalypse.\nSlowly, he lowered his gaze. Ash was settling on the shattered remains of buildings. Everything was white. There was no trace of life anywhere. A dull ache throbbed in his head. The hand resting on the windowpane was blackened up to the wrist.\nThe apocalypse was always silent and...\nThud.\nHe shook his head and looked at the street again. A high-rise building covered in cloth as if under repair, the busy traffic on the roads, the small people walking along the streets, and the faint sounds of car horns. Everything was in its place. The hand on the glass was now only blackened at the tips of the fingers.\nFor now.\n\"Ah...\"\nHe let out a small sigh and roughly rubbed his face with both hands. His forehead and nape were already drenched in cold sweat.\n\"Damn it.\"\nThrough the blackened fingers, his lavender eyes gleamed intensely. In those arrogant eyes, a hint of anxiety surfaced.\n\"What the hell is this now...?\"\n***\n\"Why...\"\nClick.\n\"...won't it...\"\nClick.\n\"...light?\"\nA firm hand wrestled with an old-fashioned, neon green gas lighter. Cha Eui-jae was pressing it down against the ground, struggling to light his cigarette. Seo Min-gi glanced at him.\n\"Should I prepare a new lighter for you?\"\n\"No, there's no need for that... It's strange, though. There should still be some gas left.\"\nCha Eui-jae held the lighter up to the light, finally noticing the words written on its surface. Below the strange white text that read \"Noryangjin Fish Market,\" there was a phone number. He must have just picked up any old lighter left behind by customers at the hangover soup restaurant. He could never understand the tastes of hunters.\nSeo Min-gi raised his head.\n\"Ah... I do have an item that can light things up, if you want to try it.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nHe rummaged through his inventory and pulled out something that looked like a gun. When he pulled the trigger, a bright blue flame flared up. Cha Eui-jae stared at the blazing pillar of fire with a dumbfounded expression.\n\"...A flamethrower?\"\nSeo Min-gi said, with a strangely proud look on his face.\n\"I swiped it from the confiscated items warehouse when we raided the Awakened Management Bureau. It seemed useful. It's made with the magic stone of a flame monster, they say.\"\nCome to think of it, it did seem like Hong Ye-seong's pet chicken always breathed blue fire. No way. Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"Don't tell me Hong Ye-seong...?\"\n\"Yes, the master artisan made it.\"\nHe really did make all sorts of strange things. Cha Eui-jae hesitantly reached out and held the cigarette to the flame. But then,\nWhoosh!\n\"Sir?\"\nThe blue flame engulfed both the cigarette and Cha Eui-jae's hand at once. Seo Min-gi quickly pulled the trigger again to extinguish the flame. Cha Eui-jae casually dusted off his hand, which was now slightly singed.\n\"The flame's too strong. I can't use it.\"\n\"...Understood. I'll have a lighter sent to your house.\"\n\"I told you it's not necessary...\"\nCha Eui-jae smacked his lips and put on his mask.\n\"So, it was another waste of time this time too.\"\nThey were standing atop the ruins of a collapsed building inside an eroded dungeon. The ash that had regularly fallen ceased after they killed the dungeon's master.\n\"Yes. We explored as much as possible, but nothing stood out. We didn't find anything unusual compared to the other eroded dungeons. Except, over there.\"\nHe gestured with his eyes to something beyond. Beyond the black waterway, there was another vast expanse of land.\n\"It's possible there might be something over there. It would be good to investigate now, but...\"\nSeo Min-gi put away the flamethrower and began scribbling something rapidly on his tablet, then shrugged.\n\"You don't have time for that right now, do you?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't reply. His silence was an affirmation. Seo Min-gi paused his writing.\n\"There is the option of sending in the Pado Guild's investigation team, but that's a bit tricky. It's probably not feasible.\"\n\"Which guild owns this dungeon?\"\n\"It belongs to a guild called Sanyeong, which is affiliated with HB Guild. Essentially, it's owned by the HB Guild.\"\nSeo Min-gi scratched his temple with the end of his pen.\n\"You're able to go anywhere because you're the number one ranked hero and have a government official's verification, but...\"\n\"...\"\n\"If I get caught being here, it'll be a big problem.\"\nCha Eui-jae needed to check on Lee Sa-young's condition and retrieve the clock quickly. But he couldn't leave Seo Min-gi behind. Cha Eui-jae kicked some concrete debris with his boot. Fortunately, he was quick to accept and move on.\n\"There's no choice. Let's go.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nSeo Min-gi melted into Cha Eui-jae's shadow with a quiet sigh.\nSplash...\nAs they exited the dungeon, the salty scent of the sea tickled his nose. Gentle waves crashed against the cliff, eroding it and breaking into white foam. The eroded dungeon in Mokpo had formed below a cliff that met the sea.\nThe sea.\nThey had promised to go to the sea together, but now Cha Eui-jae was here alone, just like before.\n'When will we finally get to go together?'\nWithout dungeons, monsters, or the system interfering— just the two of them.\n'Now, everything seems to remind me of Lee Sa-young.'\nIt was as if the whole world had been reconstructed around Lee Sa-young. A bitter taste lingered in his mouth. Just as he stepped onto the sandy beach, a sharp presence sent a chill down his spine. Cha Eui-jae tightened his grip on his spear and focused on the source of the feeling. A cool voice pierced his ears.\n\"Finally noticing me, huh? Isn't the number one ranked hero a bit too careless?\"\nHer long, blonde hair, tied high, fluttered like a flag in the cold sea breeze. Cha Eui-jae recognized her well. She was, after all, a constant figure on TV, both before and after the Day of Change...\nAnd a regular at the hangover soup restaurant.\n\"Well, we're both busy, so let's keep this brief.\"\nHoneybee tucked her fluttering blonde hair behind her ear and stared directly at Cha Eui-jae. Fortunately, there was no real malice in her gaze.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae lowered the spear he was holding in a threatening manner and replied,\n\"I have permission to enter this dungeon. There's no need for the HB Guild to make an issue out of it.\"\n\"That's not my concern. I'm here for something else.\"\nNormally, he would have just ignored her and left. The more he ran into other hunters, the more the risks increased.\nBut perhaps it was the memories the clock had shown him, or maybe their connection through the hangover soup restaurant, that made him want to listen to her story. He couldn't say for sure.\nHoneybee spoke,\n\"Do you know about the drug that turns Awakeners into husks?\"\nHe knew. It was because of that drug that he had met Lee Sa-young again. But Cha Eui-jae didn't respond and instead observed Honeybee's reaction. Perhaps taking his silence as confirmation, she continued slowly.\n\"The reason I sought you out specifically is because... I think you can help.\"\nShe twirled a strand of her hair around her finger. There was a hint of hesitation in her demeanor, but soon, she spoke firmly.\n\"I need help, J. I need you to deliver a message.\"\n\"What message?\"\n\"We need to cure Matthew.\"\nHe had encountered Matthew before during the Artisan Exhibition. If he remembered correctly, Matthew was currently ranked third in South Korea and was the guild leader of HB Guild. Cha Eui-jae asked indifferently,\n\"Shouldn't you be looking for a healer to treat him?\"\n\"We already did. They said it couldn't be done. Even Nam Woo-jin failed. Fuck...\"\nHoneybee began to bite her thumbnail, her anxiety evident.\n\"Do you know that HB Guild has formed a partnership with Samra Guild?\"\n\"Recently, yes.\"\n\"...I think that's when it all started. After that, Matthew's condition gradually worsened. Someone who had always been calm and indifferent suddenly became emotionally volatile, always anxious, unable to control his powers...\"\nHer eyes glinted ominously.\n\"Damn it, did they think I wouldn't notice...\"\n\"...And?\"\n\"Oh.\"\nShe snapped back to attention and looked up. Then, she lowered her gaze and muttered,\n\"...Nam Woo-jin told me. Matthew's symptoms are the early stages of addiction to that drug that mutates Awakeners. The organization behind the drug's distribution is Prometheus, but while he knows the drug well, the one who truly understands the organization is Pado Guild... So he said we should ask the Pado Guild for help.\"\n\"...\"\nThe fact that Nam Woo-jin had shared such classified information with Honeybee likely meant that Matthew's condition was that severe. Cha Eui-jae recalled the glimpse he'd seen of Honeybee, collapsed and sobbing, in one of the fragments Yoon Ga-eul had shown him.\nThe Honeybee standing before him now, though her eyes were red, was not crying.\n\"You've been working with Pado Guild recently, haven't you? So can you pass a message to Lee Sa-young? The Shield Guy can't deliver it himself since he's been stuck in a dungeon lately.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young too...\"\nHis throat tightened for a moment. Cha Eui-jae cleared his voice and shook his head.\n\"Lee Sa-young won't be of any help either. You know that, right? Due to health issues...\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nHoneybee frowned.\n\"It's no secret that the health excuse was just a cover. Everyone's already shared in the Hunter's Channel that Lee Sa-young was spotted around Incheon just a few hours ago...\"\nThud. Honeybee's eyes widened as J abruptly grabbed her shoulders and leaned in close.\nThe black mask that hid his expression, and the distorted voice that carried no emotion, growled in a low, biting tone.\n\"What did you just say?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 151: What’s Reflected in the Mirror\nHoneybee, who had her shoulder grabbed, spoke with a bewildered expression.\n\"Just like I said. It was about four hours ago. There was a sighting of Lee Sa-young in Incheon. Well, you know Lee Sa-young. He often went to Incheon and moved around as he pleased. I thought he was just using it as an excuse to do something else again, but...\"\nWatching Cha Eui-jae's reaction, she raised her eyebrows.\n\"Could it really be that he had a health problem?\"\n\"Do you have a photo?\"\n\"It's from the Hunter's Channel, so no photo...\"\n\"Seo Min-gi!\"\n\"I was already listening.\"\nSeo Min-gi suddenly poked his head out from Cha Eui-jae's shadow. Honeybee was shocked.\n\"What the— why is that person here?\"\n\"Right now, the customer is my master. I'll check the Hunter's Channel and rumors, so please check your phone, sir. If Honeybee is correct, you should have received some messages.\"\nSeo Min-gi, half-submerged in the shadow, stretched out his arm and handed over a phone. It was a contact phone Seo Min-gi had retrieved. As soon as it was powered on, a flood of missed call notifications appeared. Every one of them was from...\nJung Bin.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae bit his lip. It felt like the ground beneath his feet was spinning. After a moment of hesitation, he pressed the call button. The dial tone echoed for a long time, and Cha Eui-jae's thoughts followed, one after another.\n'Is it true that Lee Sa-young woke up?'\nSuddenly?\nOf course, no one knew how long it would take for him to wake up. They had said that waiting was the best option. But waking up without any prior signs, and then, on top of that, going straight to Incheon without contacting anyone?\nWithout contacting me?\n\"...\"\nBeep. The call connected at that moment.\n\"Jung Bin.\"\n—Ah, J... Have you left the dungeon? Are you hurt anywhere?\nJung Bin's voice sounded exhausted. Cha Eui-jae unconsciously rubbed his shoe against a rock.\n\"I just heard. Lee Sa-young...\"\n—Ah, so you heard. Then I'll get straight to the point.\nJung Bin cleared his throat.\n—Lee Sa-young was first spotted in Incheon city 4 hours and 30 minutes ago and seems to have been on the move since then. According to the Pado Guild's report, he was last seen near the West Sea area. Um. More specifically, near the West Sea Rift Memorial.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae's grip on the phone tightened slightly.\n—I was supposed to go, but I'm unable to move right now... I apologize. I also can't mobilize anyone from the Awakened Management Bureau.\nThe moment the Awakened Management Bureau moves, all eyes will be on Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae absently rubbed the ends of his hair and muttered.\n\"No, thank you for letting me know. I'll go.\"\n—Yes, then...\nJung Bin hastily ended the call. Cha Eui-jae held the phone for a moment before roughly running his hand through his hair.\nFrom Mokpo to Incheon?\nIf he had Hong Ye-seong's scroll, he could move instantly, but the one scroll he had was already used to come to Mokpo. Cha Eui-jae glanced around and made eye contact with Honeybee. She must have come from Seoul. Realizing this, Cha Eui-jae quickly asked.\n\"Honeybee, what did you take to get to Mokpo?\"\n\"I came by guild helicopter... but it still took quite a while. Hmm, whatever it is, isn't it urgent?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You won't be satisfied with the helicopter's speed, will you?\"\nShe was right. If there wasn't an immediate way to move, the frustration would only grow. This situation was all because Hong Ye-seong was too exceptional. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth.\nSuddenly, something tapped Cha Eui-jae's ankle. It was Seo Min-gi, who had half-emerged from the shadow.\n\"Fortunately, the transportation issue seems to be resolved, sir.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"As soon as the sighting was reported in the Hunter channel, Romantic Opener went to find the guild leader. And it just so happens he's nearby now.\"\nRomantic Opener. His ability was to open doors leading to other places. Seo Min-gi casually pushed up his sunglasses, which gleamed as they caught the light.\n\"A talented individual should be used in the right place.\"\nCha Eui-jae gave him a thumbs-up in approval.\n***\n\"Yes, then...\"\nJung Bin ended the call and let out a long sigh. His face, usually calm and composed, was now flushed with heat, with patches of redness blooming across it. He took off his suit jacket and rolled up the slightly singed sleeves of his shirt to his forearms, revealing scars that marred his right arm.\nHe was standing in a blackened room. No, to be precise, it was an ordinary room, but it had lost its original color due to flames and soot. The only things retaining their original appearance were Jung Bin and another man.\nAt the far end of the room, a man was kneeling, bound tightly with black chains. A pair of crooked glasses was visible beneath his lowered head. A low groan escaped his lips. Jung Bin brushed back his disheveled hair.\n\"Are you starting to come to your senses?\"\nThe man slowly raised his head.\n\"Matthew.\"\nA curious expression crossed his stern face.\n\"...Where is this?\"\n\"This is the basement of the Seowon Guild. Honeybee brought you here. She said she brought you here because she was worried about information leaking if you were taken to the Awakened Management Bureau. Nam Woo-jin said it would be too much for him to handle alone, so he called me.\"\nJung Bin gave a bitter smile.\n\"Unfortunately, I can't deny the risk of information leaking...\"\n\"Is that so...\"\n\"You didn't regain your composure despite all our efforts, so we had to restrain you. I apologize.\"\nMatthew, whose real name was Mok Tae-oh, blinked tiredly and tilted his head back slightly. He slowly nodded, and his crooked glasses fell to the floor.\n\"...Thank you. I'm starting to regain my senses.\"\n\"Don't bother thanking me. I'll make sure you pay me back for this tenfold.\"\nA displeased voice interrupted, accompanied by the sound of the door being kicked open. It was Nam Woo-jin, wearing a white lab coat. His pale eyes were filled with irritation.\n\"If that government employee hadn't shown up in time, you would've burned down the entire building. Including the valuable books. It'll take a while to get rid of the smell of burning.\"\n\"...\"\nMok Tae-oh nodded silently. Jung Bin asked,\n\"What happened all of a sudden? Did you suddenly have trouble controlling your abilities?\"\nUntil now, Jung Bin had known Mok Tae-oh as someone who was more obsessed with controlling his abilities than anyone else. Even roasting marshmallows and squid had been part of his ability control training. Nam Woo-jin, who had taken a stance beside Jung Bin with his arms crossed, chimed in.\n\"That's what I came here to ask you. Matthew, did you take some kind of drug?\"\nJung Bin's eyes widened.\n\"A drug? You don't mean...\"\n\"Yeah. The one we've been investigating all this time. He's addicted to that drug. I know you wouldn't willingly take it yourself.\"\nMok Tae-oh, who had been blinking wearily, asked,\n\"Honeybee... where is she? Is she hurt?\"\n\"She dumped you here and left, saying she had something to find. She's not hurt. She was fully wrapped up in flame-resistant gear.\"\nNam Woo-jin, who had been answering smoothly, narrowed his eyes and pointed a finger.\n\"Answer my question first. Someone like you— where did you get your hands on the drug? To lose control to this extent, you must have taken a significant amount. Didn't you notice anything strange?\"\nBehind Nam Woo-jin, a small boy appeared, pushing a cart. On the cart were various syringes and medicines neatly arranged. Jung Bin asked worriedly,\n\"Can you detoxify him?\"\n\"I don't know. I'll have to try to find out. Hey, Matthew! Don't lose focus and answer my question.\"\n\"That...\"\nMok Tae-oh exhaled a long, heated breath. Then, just as his eyes were about to roll back, he suddenly flipped them completely.\nJung Bin shouted,\n\"Damn it, get back!\"\nBoom—!!\n***\nBoom—!!\nA black shoe violently kicked open the dark brown door. The door separated two different worlds— one side led to the open sea, while the other was lined with neon-lit seafood restaurants. Romantic Opener, who had been holding the doorknob, weakly swayed.\n\"Be... be gentle with the door... Ugh.\"\nBut Cha Eui-jae didn't have the luxury to check on Romantic Opener's condition. Grabbing his fluttering shoulder, he demanded,\n\"Hey. Where's Lee Sa-young? Where is he?\"\n\"T-The West Sea rift... the memorial... ugh...\"\nUpon hearing the answer he needed, Cha Eui-jae let go of Romantic Opener and started running. Seo Min-gi picked up the collapsed Romantic Opener and looked toward the door leading to Mokpo.\n\"Will you be using the door as well, Honeybee?\"\n\"...No, I'm fine. I need to head back by helicopter.\"\nHoneybee brushed her blonde hair aside and turned away.\n\"Make sure to pass on the message to Lee Sa-young.\"\nThud, thud, thud. The seafood restaurants lining the road by the beach started to disappear with each step Cha Eui-jae took. The neon signs that had clouded his vision and the love songs that had pierced his ears gradually faded away. The surroundings grew increasingly silent, with only the pounding of his heartbeat echoing in his ears. Cha Eui-jae clenched his teeth, his gray hair whipping wildly in the wind.\nThud.\nI can't be late again.\nThud.\nPlease!\nThud!\nFinally, Cha Eui-jae slowed down, catching his breath. Before him was a towering stone monument, a memorial to the victims of the West Sea rift. It was his first time seeing it in person.\nThe name at the top of the monument was...\nJ.\n\"...\"\nInside the safety railing surrounding the memorial, a dark figure was huddled. The hem of a black coat lay haphazardly on the ground. Cha Eui-jae cautiously called out to him.\n\"...Lee Sa-young?\"\nThe dark figure slowly raised its head.\nDisheveled black hair, violet eyes peeking through the strands, a face drained of color, and lips bloodied from being bitten repeatedly. It was Lee Sa-young. Overwhelmed, Cha Eui-jae couldn't hold back his words.\n\"If you woke up, you should have contacted me, or at least reached out to the other guild members...\"\nBut he couldn't finish his scolding. He stopped in his tracks. Lee Sa-young, still pale, was staring blankly at him. And that face looked as if...\n...as if he had seen a ghost.\n\"S-Sa-young?\"\nCha Eui-jae cautiously called his name again. As if that was the signal, Lee Sa-young slowly stood up and staggered toward him. Cha Eui-jae quickly jumped over the railing and rushed to support his wavering shoulders. Their eyes seemed to meet.\nA cold, blackened finger touched Cha Eui-jae's cheek. Lee Sa-young continued to grope, feeling the left side of Cha Eui-jae's forehead, his temple, and through his hair. His fingertips were trembling uncontrollably. Cha Eui-jae carefully clasped his hand over Lee Sa-young's.\n\"What's wrong with you?\"\nAt that moment,\nPlop...\nA tear slid down his pale cheek and fell.",

      "content": "Chapter 152: What’s Reflected in the Mirror\nTears that started to trickle down, drop by drop, soon began to fall rapidly. Cha Eui-jae froze, still holding onto Lee Sa-young's hand.\n'Is he crying?'\nLee Sa-young?\n'Why?'\nWhat could possibly make him cry as soon as he saw me? A flood of thoughts bubbled up in his mind.\n'Because I wasn't there when he woke up?'\nThere's no way Lee Sa-young would cry over something like that. Cha Eui-jae dismissed the first possibility. Lee Sa-young would be more likely to get annoyed or angry, but crying? No way. Or maybe...\n'Did he have a dream about me dying?'\n...\nCha Eui-jae lifted his gaze from the hand he had been staring at and looked at Lee Sa-young. He gasped softly.\nThe pale face staring back at him was shockingly devoid of emotion. The expression that had once looked like he'd seen a ghost was long gone. It was as if that had been the last remaining emotion.\nHe was just staring. At Cha Eui-jae. As if nothing else mattered, those violet eyes, once brimming with so many emotions, now reflected only one person like a mirror.\nCha Eui-jae alone.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae opened his mouth to say something but then closed it again.\nThere was something 'off' about Lee Sa-young standing before him. If it weren't for the constant flow of tears and the warmth emanating from the hand he held, Cha Eui-jae might have thought he wasn't alive at all— like he was somehow...\n...separated from this world.\nAs that thought crossed his mind, his vision swam. A throbbing headache hit him. Cha Eui-jae winced, clutching his head. The hand that had been holding his slipped away like a snake.\nBlood-stained lips, red from biting, parted.\n\"Cha Eui-jae.\"\nHearing his name, Cha Eui-jae's body tensed up. It was an instinctive reaction. The blackened hand that had touched him earlier wrapped around Cha Eui-jae's hand again, gently pulling it closer. Then, it slowly traced the long scar on his palm. A shiver ran down Cha Eui-jae's spine.\n\"...I thought it was all meaningless.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Everything I did...\"\nA short sigh escaped. Long, tear-laden lashes trembled. Through the mirror-like eyes, a faint hint of tenderness emerged.\n\"I'm glad.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You look alright...\"\nHe lowered his head near Cha Eui-jae's hand, stopping just short of touching it. His lips moved, leaving a tiny gap.\n\"...Did I protect it?\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"Of course... I probably didn't.\"\nLee Sa-young released Cha Eui-jae's hand and took a step back. Left behind in Cha Eui-jae's hand was the watch he had forgotten. The second hand ticked away. Lee Sa-young, with his hands shoved into his coat pockets, nodded toward the watch with his chin.\n\"Take good care of that watch... It's important.\"\nCha Eui-jae grasped the watch tightly and looked up. As the wind blew, Lee Sa-young's black hair and coat fluttered. A strange sensation crept up from Cha Eui-jae's feet.\n'That' Lee Sa-young wasn't the Lee Sa-young he knew. Yet, he was also the 'Lee Sa-young he knew.'\nSuddenly, his vision blurred.\nEverything was red. The metallic scent of blood wouldn't fade. His body was numb. His dry throat burned with pain, but he kept muttering. He knew he couldn't bear the silence.\nThere was no one to make noise for him. The physical pain had dulled, but the scene that pierced his heart was inescapable...\nFlap,\nSomething black covered his head and upper body. The red scene disappeared, and darkness fell. Cha Eui-jae slowly stopped muttering. He sensed the presence of something alive.\n'...'\n'...'\n'...'\nA lukewarm warmth touched him through the coat. Someone whispered.\n\"Come back... Quietly... please.\"\nHis dazed mind suddenly snapped awake. The sound of waves crashing against the breakwater and retreating back into the sea sharpened his senses. But it still felt like a heavy stone was pressing down on his head.\nFrowning, Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"You... What are you? Why...\"\n\"Ah...\"\nHe muttered,\n\"I can't hold on much longer...\"\nLee Sa-young, who had blinked a couple of times, closed his eyes. At that moment, his large body lost its balance and collapsed. Cha Eui-jae quickly extended his arms to catch him. The heavy weight fell onto him, but he didn't stagger. Soon, a faint groan escaped from Lee Sa-young in his arms.\n\"Damn it...\"\nThe voice was laced with irritation. Cha Eui-jae glanced down at the black-haired head nestled in his arms. Lee Sa-young blinked, as if trying to grasp the situation, then widened his eyes when he saw Cha Eui-jae holding him. His eyes were swollen and red, and his long eyelashes were still wet with tears.\n\"...Hyung? What's going on?\"\nLee Sa-young, realizing it was Cha Eui-jae holding him, straightened up and looked around. Then, noticing the memorial stone behind them, he scowled.\n\"...Incheon? Why are we here?\"\n\"That's what I want to know.\"\n\"What do you...\"\n\"You were the one here. I came looking for you.\"\nCha Eui-jae sighed and patted Lee Sa-young's back soothingly. Lee Sa-young, who had been staring at him in confusion, soon wiped his face with his hand. But then he froze, seeing the tears on his hand. His expression twisted in frustration.\n\"Ah, damn it, what the hell...\"\nLee Sa-young rubbed his eyes with his fingers, but the tears wouldn't stop falling. He roughly rubbed his face again.\n\"Why is this happening...\"\nThe more he rubbed, the redder his eyes became. Cha Eui-jae took Lee Sa-young's hand and gently wiped away the moisture with his jacket sleeve. But the tears wouldn't stop. The more he wiped, the more they flowed.\n\"Why are you still crying? ...Are you hurt? Are you feeling sick?\"\nThe violet eyes glared at Cha Eui-jae from beneath the sleeve. Cha Eui-jae could sense the relief hidden beneath the irritation and discomfort.\nEyes filled with warmth.\nNot the empty eyes that had mirrored only Cha Eui-jae earlier.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young slightly lowered his head to make it easier for Cha Eui-jae to wipe away his tears, then murmured.\n\"...I'm not the one crying.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"It's not my will. I don't know why this is happening... Damn it...\"\nHis tone was like a child throwing a tantrum, except for the curses that followed.\nLee Sa-young grabbed Cha Eui-jae's hand that was wiping his eyes and pressed it against his cheek. He let out a small sigh, burying his tear-soaked cheek and face into Cha Eui-jae's firm hand. It was almost like a big beast seeking comfort. The wet eyelashes brushed against Cha Eui-jae's palm, tickling it. Then, a small whisper followed.\n\"How annoying...\"\nWait, is he saying he's annoyed at me? Cha Eui-jae was about to retort indignantly when Lee Sa-young, as if sensing his reaction, glared sharply at him.\n\"Not you.\"\n\"...\"\nThis guy's like a ghost, Cha Eui-jae thought, feeling a bit awkward as he gently stroked Lee Sa-young's eyes with his thumb. Lee Sa-young, who had been biting his lips, spoke.\n\"...Hug me.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Hurry.\"\nLee Sa-young urged. The guy, who was usually relaxed and leisurely in most situations, was now acting impatient, leaving Cha Eui-jae flustered. Cha Eui-jae looked at Lee Sa-young, who was rubbing his cheek and nose against his hand as if anxious, and asked suspiciously.\n\"Are you really okay—\"\n\"Haaa...\"\nLee Sa-young let out an exasperated sigh. Then, he grabbed Cha Eui-jae's hand and pulled it toward him. Cha Eui-jae didn't resist. His vision flipped upside down. The gray pier and sea spun around, and soon his view changed to the ashen sky.\nThud, Lee Sa-young's black fingers lightly pushed against his shoulder. Something cold and hard touched the back of Cha Eui-jae's neck. He glanced up and behind him. Somehow, he had ended up almost lying down with only his shoulder propped against the memorial stone.\nLee Sa-young was hovering above him, supporting himself with both arms and legs. His hands were pressed into the ground near Cha Eui-jae's shoulders. His black coat and hair covered Cha Eui-jae. Lee Sa-young lowered his head. The familiar sweet scent tickled Cha Eui-jae's nose, and he unconsciously held his breath.\nLee Sa-young's brilliant violet eyes drew closer, almost as if they were about to devour him.\n\"For the love of everything...\"\n\"...\"\n\"When someone says something... just listen the first time.\"\nSomething lightly brushed against Cha Eui-jae's mask and then pulled back. The heavy weight pressed down on him again, and something soft and ticklish touched the back of his neck. It was Lee Sa-young's hair. Lee Sa-young buried his face in Cha Eui-jae's neck, wrapping his arms tightly around his waist as he lay on top of him.\nCha Eui-jae was honestly dumbfounded.\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"Don't sigh; just say my name.\"\nLee Sa-young growled. Judging by how the back of his neck was still wet, it seemed the tears hadn't stopped yet. Cha Eui-jae glanced around. Thankfully, there didn't seem to be any CCTV cameras around... Well, even if there were, Seo Min-gi would probably erase the footage. With that thought, he ran his fingers through Lee Sa-young's soft hair and whispered.\n\"...Lee Sa-young.\"\nThe ragged breathing calmed down a bit. Maybe he was trying to gather himself. Lee Sa-young, who had no problem talking about anything else, always clammed up when it came to things related to himself. That's why it was so hard to figure him out.\nWhat had happened, what kind of dreams he had while asleep, what he had seen, what he was thinking. There were so many things Cha Eui-jae was curious about. He felt like if he could just hear everything and dig down to the bottom, this anxiety would go away. The fear of losing him again.\n\"Sa-young-ah.\"\nYet, as he faced the myriad emotions in his eyes, as he felt the breath on his palm and saw every movement of him being alive, Cha Eui-jae's anxiety began to subside.\nDoes Lee Sa-young even realize? That it's not just his reaction that's precious.\nHow much time had passed? The wind that had been blowing suddenly died down. The sound of waves had calmed, and the breathing in Cha Eui-jae's arms had also steadied. It was the familiar sound of breath he'd heard every time Lee Sa-young slept. Cha Eui-jae gently pushed the hair away from his face with the hand that had been stroking him. The tears had finally stopped. At last.\nLifting his head, Cha Eui-jae looked around and spotted a black van parked at the end of the pier. He flicked his finger at the shadow cast by his hand. A shadowy figure the size of a finger stood up from the van, struggling to its feet. Cha Eui-jae twisted a strand of Lee Sa-young's hair around his finger and whispered.\n\"Tell your master.\"\nThe Lee Sa-young who had wandered through the second world— only Yoon Ga-eul had seen him in person. The Lee Sa-young whose eyes had mirrored only Cha Eui-jae with all his emotions seemingly stripped away, and the Lee Sa-young who now couldn't hide his emotions, pouring out his anxiety and unease. They were different.\nHe had to figure out what was going on. The black mask tilted slightly.\n\"I need to go see Ga-eul.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 153: The One Hidden in the Gaps\nThe light green metal fence around the school wobbled slightly. Someone wearing a deep navy hood was shaking the fence. After taking a deep breath, they nimbly climbed the fence and lightly jumped to the other side. As if waiting, the door of a black van slid open with a clatter.\nA figure leaning out of the passenger-side window casually gave a thumbs-up.\n\"You're quite the expert at climbing fences. Seems like it's not your first time.\"\n\"N-no, it's not like that.\"\nThe student, clearing their throat, climbed into the van and removed the hood. Their untied brown hair cascaded down. The door closed, and the van started smoothly. Yoon Ga-eul adjusted her slightly askew glasses.\n\"Why did you call me? Is there a problem?\"\n\"It's not that.\"\nA distorted voice suddenly echoed, causing Yoon Ga-eul to jump and turn around. Something dark was draped over the long rear seat. It looked like leather rather than a blanket.\nWhat's that? As Yoon Ga-eul tilted her head in confusion, a gray-haired figure with a black mask suddenly emerged from behind the seat.\n\"Thanks for coming out right away. But aren't you supposed to be in evening study? Is it okay for you to be out?\"\n\"It's fine. I made it look like I'm still there with a long padded coat like this...\"\nYoon Ga-eul mimicked making a snowman with her hands.\n\"I made it look like a person and slipped out, so it'll be fine for a while. The teacher on duty today isn't strict either.\"\n\"Good. That's a relief.\"\nSeo Min-gi, who was waiting, added with a smile,\n\"We'll circle around the school area, so don't worry.\"\nThe inside of the car soon fell silent. Yoon Ga-eul awkwardly rolled her eyes and spoke to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Uh, how have you been? I've seen you often on TV. You've been on a lot.\"\n\"Good to hear. I've been on a lot.\"\nYoon Ga-eul fidgeted with the hem of her tracksuit pants. Perhaps because Cha Eui-jae's expression was hidden behind the mask, she found herself being extra cautious.\n'Even though I know he's not that kind of person...'\nCha Eui-jae, with the mask on, felt like a completely different person. In fact, his hair color was different too. His once jet-black hair had faded to an ashen gray.\nThe atmosphere was entirely different as well. There was a palpable tension, a sharp aura that seemed to reject any approach. It was hard to believe this was the same person who had casually greeted her in a baggy hoodie and apron while working part-time.\n\"Yoon Ga-eul, can I ask you something?\"\n\"Yes? Oh, sure! Go ahead!\"\nYoon Ga-eul straightened her slouched posture. Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"You said you met another Lee Sa-young in the ruined world. That person brought you to a safe place, right?\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"Do you remember anything about him?\"\n\"Uh, suddenly?\"\n\"No, just now...\"\nCha Eui-jae pointed to the black leather draped over the seat. Upon closer inspection, the leather was slightly moving up and down. Yoon Ga-eul leaned forward and then widened her eyes.\nThe pale face peeking out from the black curly hair was Lee Sa-young. He was lying down, using Cha Eui-jae's lap as a pillow. Of course, his legs were awkwardly folded up.\nCha Eui-jae absentmindedly stroked the mask.\n\"Lee Sa-young woke up, but... something seems off.\"\n\"In what way?\"\n\"There are two of him. In one body.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"What?!\"\nThe second \"What?!\" came with a sudden screech of brakes. Squeal! The black van stopped abruptly, and the weight shifted forward. Cha Eui-jae quickly cradled Lee Sa-young's head and glared at the driver's seat.\n\"Hey, watch your driving.\"\n\"How can you drop such a bombshell on us and not share it right away? The guild leader is two people? Even one is scary... Ahem. He is just sleeping, right?\"\n\"Probably.\"\n\"Ahem. I wish him sweet dreams.\"\nSeo Min-gi cleared his throat. Cha Eui-jae rested his arm on the window ledge and continued.\n\"I've talked to him, and it's clear they're two different entities. As Hong Ye-seong suggested, it's likely the Lee Sa-young from the ruined world, but you're the only one who has actually met him, Yoon Ga-eul.\"\n\"Ah, that's right...\"\n\"So, what was he like? It doesn't have to be something grand, just tell me everything you remember.\"\n\"Um...\"\nYoon Ga-eul hesitated, sneaking a glance at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"He was, um, can I say this? He is really sleeping, right?\"\n\"Yes, yes, anything's fine.\"\n\"Well...\"\n\"Well?\"\n\"He was really rude.\"\nSilence filled the car. Yoon Ga-eul nervously rolled her eyes, gauging everyone's reactions. Seo Min-gi was slumped over the steering wheel, his shoulders shaking intermittently. He seemed to be laughing.\nCha Eui-jae, neither crying nor laughing, gently played with the soft curls.\n'Lee Sa-young is rude, but...'\n\"And, um...\"\nShe looked up. After hesitating for a long time, Yoon Ga-eul muttered,\n\"He seemed strangely... even though we talked and I looked at him... I could tell he was rude.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But somehow, he didn't feel... alive.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae held his breath for a moment.\nLee Sa-young from the ruined world, who didn't seem alive. Without the tears and warmth, it was hard to believe he was living. Something important had been connected. Could it be that some problem caused the two souls to not merge?\nAt that moment, Yoon Ga-eul raised her hand.\n\"Oh, and I should tell you this. It's not directly related to Lee Sa-young, though.\"\nYoon Ga-eul clenched her fist and spoke.\n\"Actually, ever since I first awakened, I've been hearing a voice. The voice was the one that told me to find J at the hangover soup restaurant... when we first met.\"\nCha Eui-jae blinked. Now that she mentioned it, he recalled something.\n\"Am I really going in? Really? I'm really going in? This is so extreme...\"\n\"What? Look behind me? No way, don't joke like that. I hate that...\"\nShe had wandered back and forth in front of the shop, looking like some kind of caterpillar, weighed down by a long padded coat and a heavy backpack, talking to someone though she was clearly alone.\nAt that time, only Lee Sa-young and Seo Min-gi knew that Cha Eui-jae was J. Yet, Yoon Ga-eul had suddenly shown up late at night, claiming to know that he was J.\nYoon Ga-eul fiddled with her fingers.\n\"It felt like a friend, and it gave me a lot of helpful advice. It comforted me too.\"\n\"Do you know whose voice it was?\"\nSeo Min-gi interjected from the driver's seat. Yoon Ga-eul slowly shook her head.\n\"I'm not sure. It feels familiar, but when I try to think about it, it hurts my head, so I stopped.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Anyway, that voice always said one thing. That I must stop the apocalypse. And...\"\nYoon Ga-eul and Cha Eui-jae's eyes met. Her eyes were glowing a golden hue, just like the first time they met.\n\"That I must not let J die. No matter what.\"\n\"...\"\nThey all knew what happened when Cha Eui-jae died.\nIn the second world, Cha Eui-jae had died fighting the monsters that poured in. The world met its end, they failed, and Lee Sa-young rewound time by becoming the pivot...\nThey had failed.\nYoon Ga-eul shrunk her shoulders.\n\"But... after I returned from the ruined world, I haven't heard that voice again. I thought about it. The master artisan said it, right? That the same soul would merge together...\"\n\"You mean that the owner of that voice was another version of you from another world? And that it merged with you, like what happened with the guild leader?\"\nSeo Min-gi asked. Yoon Ga-eul nodded slowly.\n\"After returning from that world, the fragments I see in my dreams have become more vivid.\"\n\"...That confirms it then. Something has definitely gone wrong with Lee Sa-young.\"\nCha Eui-jae muttered as he stroked Lee Sa-young's hair.\n\"Yoon Ga-eul's soul merged without a problem, but why are two souls coexisting in one body with Lee Sa-young...?\"\nSomething was definitely out of place, but it was impossible to figure out what that 'something' was. Asking the person in question would be the quickest way, but the Lee Sa-young from the ruined world...\n'Didn't seem like he'd be cooperative.'\nThe thought of those eyes reflecting him like a mirror brought on a headache. Cha Eui-jae leaned his head against the window and groaned. Yoon Ga-eul asked,\n\"How about asking the artisan?\"\n\"...What would he know?\"\nThere was disbelief in the distorted voice. Yoon Ga-eul blinked.\n\"Uh... isn't he really smart? A bit impulsive, but he was the first to realize something was wrong with Lee Sa-young.\"\n...That was true.\nRight, even if he's annoying, we need all the help we can get. Cha Eui-jae took out his phone and dialed Hong Ye-seong's number, hoping he was in one of his rare genius phases.\nBut.\nHong Ye-seong didn't answer the phone.\nThe veins in Cha Eui-jae's hand suddenly stood out.\n'This guy... he complains about being bored because I don't call, and now he doesn't pick up?'\nThe indignation was intense. Cha Eui-jae decided to break his promise to send a text. It seemed inevitable that he'd have to reach out to Jung Bin instead.\n'I really didn't want to bother him.'\nHe thought he might as well take this chance to get a talisman that would serve as a pass to Jang-in Village, and dialed Jung Bin's number.\nRinging...\nRinging...\nThe basic connection tone, without any special ringtone, stopped just before it went to voicemail. Then, there was a beep, and someone answered the call.\n—Who is this?\nThe voice was familiar, though it sounded much rougher than he remembered. Before Cha Eui-jae could say anything, the person on the other end snapped at him.\n—I don't know who you are, but Jung Bin isn't here, so call back later.\n\"Wait!\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly exclaimed, making the other side fall silent. After a moment, there was a rustling sound as if the person was adjusting the phone. Then, a voice filled with suspicion asked,\n—...J?\nIt was Nam Woo-jin.",

      "content": "Chapter 154: The One Hidden in the Gaps\n—...J?\nCha Eui-jae responded with a voice full of suspicion.\n\"Hunter Nam Woo-jin? Why are you answering the phone?\"\nNam Woo-jin seemed taken aback as well, but Cha Eui-jae was even more surprised. His mind, conditioned by numerous experiences, quickly jumped to negative conclusions.\nJung Bin must be in a situation where he couldn't answer the phone, and Nam Woo-jin, a healer, had answered instead. This definitely meant that something was wrong, and there was a possibility that Jung Bin was injured.\nInjured?\n'But we talked not long ago in Mokpo?'\nJust as Cha Eui-jae clenched his teeth in frustration, he heard a faint murmur of voices whispering beyond the phone.\n—Should I tell him? ...Can I? Shouldn't I? What?\nThe murmuring continued, and then a voice snapped.\n—Hey, wait. Who do you think you're using as a messenger? Hold on, let me talk directly.\nAfter a brief silence, a calm voice came through.\n—J, I'm sorry. I couldn't answer your call right away.\n\"Jung Bin, did something happen?\"\n—Ah... It's nothing serious. Did Lee Sa-young-ssi really wake up? Is he in good health?\nCha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young, who was curled up with his head resting on his knee. The red flush in his face had lessened, but his eyes were still puffy. He covered his eyes with his hand and responded.\n\"Yes, he seems to be in good health... but there's an issue, so I need to go to Hong Ye-seong.\"\n—An issue? What do you mean...\nCha Eui-jae tried to organize his thoughts, but his overworked brain, deprived of proper sleep for days, could only produce a summary like, 'There are two Lee Sa-youngs.' He must have been more exhausted than he realized. The tension that he hadn't even noticed until now suddenly released the moment he saw Lee Sa-young.\nIn the end, he sighed and replied.\n\"...It's a bit too complicated to explain over the phone.\"\nHe absentmindedly tugged at Lee Sa-young's cheek, causing his delicate brow to furrow slightly.\n—I won't be able to leave my spot for a while either. Hmm...\nJung Bin seemed to be pondering something, and then spoke again.\n—It can't be helped. I'll hear the story later. In the meantime, would it be okay to deliver the pass to Seo Min-gi-ssi?\n\"Is that okay?\"\nJung Bin replied warmly.\n—If it's J, that's fine. I'm currently handling some matters at Seowon Guild. That person must have already marked the coordinates for Seowon Guild. Do you remember where Jang-in Village is?\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\n—Then I'll be waiting.\nThe call ended. Cha Eui-jae glanced over at the driver's seat. The driver was also on the phone with someone, and judging by the loud voice echoing through the earphones, it seemed to be Bae Won-woo. He and his direct team had been visiting various dungeons to fill in for Lee Sa-young's absence.\n'Must have just gotten out of a dungeon.'\nSeo Min-gi, noticing Cha Eui-jae's gaze through the rearview mirror, blinked behind his sunglasses as if to ask what was going on. Cha Eui-jae waved his phone.\n\"Seo Min-gi, they said to go pick up the pass at Seowon Guild.\"\n\"Vice-Guild Leader, hold on a moment...\"\nSeo Min-gi removed one earphone and looked puzzled.\n\"Excuse me? Suddenly?\"\n\"He said you must have already marked the coordinates for Seowon Guild. Isn't that right?\"\n\"Is that what that civil servant said?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nSeo Min-gi slammed the steering wheel in frustration.\n\"Damn it! They know me too well.\"\n'Is it something to be that upset about?'\nThe stealth and infiltration specialist, A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi, grumbled to himself as he smoothly parked the van in front of the wall where autumn had begun to settle in. Just as she was about to get out of the van, Yoon Ga-eul suddenly handed something to Cha Eui-jae. It was a yellow post-it note with a personal number written on it. Yoon Ga-eul smiled sheepishly.\n\"Uh, if you need to contact me, just text me at that number.\"\n\"Oh, I will. Thanks.\"\n\"Hehe... See you next time!\"\nAfter getting out of the van, Yoon Ga-eul waved her hand toward the window and then climbed over the wall like a flying squirrel, heading back to school. Cha Eui-jae fiddled with the post-it note, then looked up at the sound of a click. Seo Min-gi had parked the car in an empty lot and was now unbuckling his seatbelt with a grim expression. He grumbled as he spoke.\n\"I'll go get the pass, so please talk to Vice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo in the meantime. He's probably going crazy with curiosity since the report got cut off.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who was obediently searching for Bae Won-woo's number, asked.\n\"Why don't you do it yourself?\"\n\"Because I don't have the time.\"\nSeo Min-gi, who was about to disappear into the shadows, stuck his face out and muttered.\n\"You probably don't know since he's polite to customer, but that civil servant has a notorious reputation among hunters for being very nitpicky.\"\n***\nJung Bin rubbed his itchy ear before putting down his phone. He was dressed in a typical surgical outfit— a light blue gown and white gloves.\n\"By the way...\"\nThe mixed smell of antiseptic and burnt air was unpleasant. Jung Bin adjusted his mask. On the operating table lay Mathew, bound by black chains, connected to numerous machines. The quiet operating room was filled with the steady beeping of machines.\nOn a nearby makeshift bed was a small, charred figure, burnt beyond recognition, with deep, sunken areas across its body. However, its gem-like green eyes remained untouched by the flames, shining brightly. Jung Bin approached the makeshift bed and looked into the green eyes.\n\"...We survived thanks to this little one. Didn't you say the Puppeteer gave it to you as a gift?\"\nNam Woo-jin, who was checking the machine's readings, nodded slowly.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Can it be fixed?\"\n\"I don't know. We'll have to contact them and see.\"\nAt the moment Mathew had suddenly started convulsing, the marionette had stepped in front of Jung Bin. The marionette had shielded them from the flames and thorns that rained down, only to collapse like a puppet with its strings cut.\n\"...\"\nJung Bin covered the marionette's face with a white cloth before approaching the operating table.\nNam Woo-jin was drawing blood from Mathew's arm. The syringe filled with dark red blood.\nMathew had definitely been trying to say something. But at that moment, he lost his sense of self and showed signs of \"mutating.\" Despite being bound by black chains that should have prevented him from using his powers, Mathew had unleashed thorns and flames.\n'Was it the drugs?'\nIt seemed almost like... something outside the system's laws. Jung Bin swallowed slowly.\n\"...Was it a curse or a binding spell?\"\n\"We'll find out soon enough. We also need to detoxify him to avoid another episode. Since my assistant ended up like that, I'll need the civil servant's help.\"\nNam Woo-jin picked up a scalpel. A faint white aura began to surround the blade. He muttered coldly.\n\"There better be some reward for my assistant's sacrifice...\"\nWith a soft sound, the scalpel pierced the skin.\n***\n\"Kkokko! Bring me some sikhye!\"\n\"Bawk!\"\n\"Oh, and I have some brown rice nurungji1 ready. I'll bring that too! Wait a moment.\"\nKkokko lifted one wing, wobbled its neck back and forth, and disappeared through the door. Hong Ye-seong also vanished in a flash, like a fire had been lit under him. Smoke was rising from the cauldron in the yard. This was the Jang-in village in Inwangsan where Hong Ye-seong resided.\nSeo Min-gi seemed utterly drained, as if his very soul had been squeezed out of him, just from the brief moment it took to get the pass from Jung Bin. With dark circles reaching down to his chin, he declared that he would stay at the base of the mountain. So, Cha Eui-jae climbed the mountain alone, carrying Lee Sa-young.\nA warm breeze tickled his hair. He looked around. The tranquil thatched house, built solely for Hong Ye-seong, felt like it was separated from the world. But it wasn't unsettling. Perhaps it was because of the loud crashing sounds that came from inside.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young, who was lying on the bedding in the master room, then readjusted his posture. After Seo Min-gi had left to get the pass, Cha Eui-jae called Bae Won-woo to inform him that Lee Sa-young had woken up.\nBut Bae Won-woo's response was unexpected.\n\"Did he give you any trouble, J? Like... did he get angry at you? Maybe even try to punch you?\"\n\"...Punch me?\"\nHe had been irritated, but he hadn't thrown any punches. Cha Eui-jae quietly waited for Bae Won-woo to continue, staring at the peacefully sleeping Lee Sa-young. Bae Won-woo hesitated before speaking again.\n\"Well, you see... when he can't control his body, he gets really... anxious and upset, you know? His temperament changes a bit. That's what the psychological evaluation showed after the rescue.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I can't quite remember what it was... TMA? Something like that. PTSD?\"\n\"Trauma?\"\n\"Yes, that's it. The guild leader guessed that being restrained and experimented on might have caused the trauma. Anyway, when it gets bad, he... Oh, I'm sorry.\"\nCha Eui-jae thought of the young boy surrounded by machines, unable to move. A boy who struggled to even lift a finger by his own will.\nLee Sa-young had been particularly sensitive when bound by black chains in the Artisan Exhibition. He had complained that his tears weren't of his own will. If all of that stemmed from trauma—\nIf that was why he had clung so tightly. Why he had asked for his name to be called. If it was all to regain a sense of control.\nThrough Cha Eui-jae.\nCha Eui-jae reached up to touch his mouth, forgetting he was wearing his mask, but he stopped. It was a strange feeling.\nNo, it was—\n\"...\"\nWas he... satisfied?\nSatisfied that he was the one Lee Sa-young relied on?\nIt was a sudden realization. The moment he realized it, Cha Eui-jae slammed his head against the table. Fortunately, it was a sturdy artisan-crafted table made by Hong Ye-seong, so it didn't break. In the distance, he heard Hong Ye-seong's startled scream.\n\"What was that? Did something explode? Don't break the house!\"\nCha Eui-jae, with his face still pressed against the table, responded in a dry, distorted voice.\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\"Huh? Okay then.\"\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his masked face against the table and let out a sigh.\n\"Ah...\"\nHis ears, peeking through his faded ash-gray hair, were burning red.\n\"This is messed up...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 155: The One Hidden in the Gaps\nAfter the embarrassment and shame subsided a bit, the first thing that came to mind was guilt. Thankfully. Cha Eui-jae absentmindedly ran his hand through his hair.\n'Is it okay to have such thoughts about someone who's unwell?'\nThere was no worse thought than this. Cha Eui-jae rubbed his mask roughly. But the sensation of that firm body clinging to him was still vivid.\nArms that wrapped around his waist as if they'd never let go again, a back rising and falling as if to catch its breath, and that breath, mixed with a faint sob. How could he not welcome it? Cha Eui-jae didn't know how to reject warmth.\nEspecially if it came from his only success.\n\"Ah, this is driving me crazy!\"\nBut isn't this trashy?\nHe was ruffling his hair wildly when he heard something shuffle across the wooden floor. Cha Eui-jae poked his head out of the door. Kkokko was walking over, balancing a wooden tray on its head.\nOn the tray were two ceramic cups filled with sikhye, a traditional Korean sweet rice drink, and not a drop wavered as the ceramic chicken reached the door's threshold.\n'That's comfort-level bed service.'\nKkokko stepped over the threshold and stopped in front of Cha Eui-jae. It then rolled its little bean-like eyes up to look at him. Cha Eui-jae took the tray and placed it on the table, remembering to thank Kkokko.\n\"Thanks.\"\n\"Bawk.\"\nKkokko's smooth chest puffed up proudly. When Cha Eui-jae looked back at the tray, he noticed that one of the cups had \"For Hong Ye-seong\" written on it. He felt a sudden urge to intrude on Hong Ye-seong's territory out of sheer stubbornness, but since he was here for help, he suppressed the thought.\nCha Eui-jae picked up the unmarked cup, but he couldn't bring himself to drink the sikhye.\n'The stare... it's constant...'\nAfter finishing the serving, Kkokko had curled up on its cushion and was staring at Cha Eui-jae with its round, black eyes. It was as if it was demanding something. What more did it want? Cha Eui-jae glanced at Kkokko and then tried to strike up a conversation.\n\"...What?\"\n\"Bawk.\"\nKkokko tilted its head. Cha Eui-jae could manage most tasks, but understanding what a ceramic chicken was saying was beyond him, unfortunately. With a puzzled expression, he lifted the cup and pretended to drink.\n\"...You want me to drink this?\"\n\"Bawk, bawk.\"\nKkokko shook its head vigorously and then lowered it, letting out a deep sigh. A chicken sighing! And not just any sigh, but one that grated on his nerves.\n'This thing... it's not just a chicken, is it?'\nCome to think of it, there was something rather intelligent about those bean-like eyes. Cha Eui-jae stared into Kkokko's beady black eyes. Kkokko didn't look away.\nJust as an unintended staring contest was about to continue, Hong Ye-seong entered the room, swinging a plastic bag. Perhaps it was the green tracksuit, but he looked even more laid-back than usual.\n\"Have you tried the sikhye?\"\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\"Give it a try! I made it myself. Even the government official acknowledged its taste. Have some nurungji too. Oh, should I bring you some dongchimi1 as well?\"\n\"I appreciate the thought, but can we get to the main point?\"\n\"Will you leave after we finish?\"\nHong Ye-seong's eyebrows drooped into a sad arc.\n\"I'm bored...\"\nCha Eui-jae glared at him from behind the mask. With a pout that rivaled Kkokko's beak, Hong Ye-seong reluctantly straightened his posture. Then, as he snapped a piece of nurungji, he asked,\n\"Alright, alright. So, since you carried in Lee Sa-young, this must be about him, right?\"\n\"Yeah. He woke up.\"\nHong Ye-seong's eyes brightened as he chewed on his nurungji.\n\"That's good! He woke up sooner than expected.\"\n\"But there's a bit of a problem.\"\n\"What problem?\"\n\"You told me that since two souls are housed in one body, we should leave them alone until they stabilize. That there's nothing we can do but wait.\"\n\"I did say that.\"\nCha Eui-jae fidgeted with his cup and asked,\n\"At the time, I was too out of it to ask, but what exactly did you mean by 'stabilize'?\"\nAfter some thought, Hong Ye-seong downed his sikhye, then set the empty cup down with a clink.\n\"Well... think of it like juice. Over time, what's inside evaporates, right? And if there's no external stimulus, it won't shake. It's something like that. I expected that if we waited until the souls fully fused, they would naturally stabilize on their own.\"\n\"...So, did he wake up too soon?\"\n\"What?\"\nHong Ye-seong blinked, pausing mid-motion as he placed a piece of nurungji on Kkokko's head.\n\"Wait, from the way you're talking... don't tell me...\"\n\"He hasn't fused.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Lee Sa-young. There's two of him. Inside.\"\n\"What, seriously?!\"\nHong Ye-seong's eyes widened. Cha Eui-jae rubbed his forehead and muttered,\n\"I'm sure. It's the same guy we saw in the ruined world. But it's not just him— our Lee Sa-young is there too...\"\n\"That's really strange... Two souls with their own identities in one body? That's... yawn.\"\nHong Ye-seong, who had been rambling as if possessed, suddenly yawned and squinted his eyes. His eyelids drooped as if they were about to close any second.\n\"So... what I want to say... is... hmm.\"\nHe kept yawning and bobbing his head like a sick chicken. It was disconcerting to see someone who had been chattering nonstop suddenly about to doze off.\n'What's going on with him?'\nCha Eui-jae reached out to steady Hong Ye-seong's swaying shoulders.\n\"Hey, what's wrong with you?\"\n\"Huh? Ah... I don't know.\"\nHe rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand, but his drooping eyelids slowly began to close.\n\"Why am I so sleepy all of a sudden...\"\n\"What nonsense is this? Hey!\"\n\"Mmm.\"\nWith that final word, Hong Ye-seong slumped over, still held by Cha Eui-jae's hand. From the soft snores coming from him, it seemed he had really fallen asleep. Did this guy have narcolepsy2 or something? Cha Eui-jae was bewildered. Growing anxious, he shook Hong Ye-seong's shoulders more forcefully.\n\"Hey, you're just going to fall asleep without properly explaining anything?\"\nBut a voice spoke from somewhere other than Hong Ye-seong's mouth.\n\"I'll answer instead.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Don't be surprised, friend. I just put him to sleep for a bit. I can only intervene this way.\"\nCha Eui-jae slowly turned his head with a creak. Kkokko was sitting there, staring right at him. Its shiny beak moved.\n\"You remember, right? There can't be two of the same person in one world. Likewise, this guy and I can't exist at the same time. This is just a minor trick, but it doesn't violate the system's rules. As long as you perceive me as Kkokko, it works.\"\nKkokko was talking!\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Even after rubbing his eyes, it was clear the voice was coming from Kkokko's beak. And it was a familiar voice. After all, it was the same voice he had been speaking with just moments ago— Hong Ye-seong's! Golden patterns began to spin rapidly in Kkokko's small, black eyes.\nIt was the Eyes of Appraisal. But it was far more complex and intricate than the one he knew.\n\"You...\"\n\"Wait.\"\nKkokko raised one of its white wings.\n\"I know you have a lot to say and what you're going to say. But don't equate me with the artisan. Words have power, you know? Thinking it and saying it out loud are different.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The system is already watching Lee Sa-young. It's probably keeping an eye on this place too.\"\nStanding there awkwardly, Cha Eui-jae glanced up at the ceiling. Kkokko continued speaking slowly.\n\"The moment we break the rules, I'll be kicked out before I can answer any of your questions. So, let's help each other out. Of course, I can't tell you much...\"\nCha Eui-jae swallowed the words he had been about to say. He then lowered his head, gripping his mask. The one he was now speaking with was indeed the \"Hong Ye-seong\" he had encountered at the end of the Memorial Dungeon. And this one had the most information.\nHong Ye... no, Kkokko, flapped its wings and smacked its lips.\n\"Sigh, I was determined not to get involved this time... but you just had to drag me out, didn't you? You never act predictably, which makes you fun to watch.\"\nKkokko tilted its head and began chattering.\n\"By the way, friend, what have you done? Why is Lee Sa-young like this? Why didn't the souls fuse? This is an unexpected situation even for me. Care to explain?\"\n\"...You.\"\n\"Yes, friend?\"\nKkokko stretched its neck. Trembling for a moment in silence, Cha Eui-jae suddenly lunged at Kkokko, grabbed it, and shook it violently.\n\"Give me back Kkokko, you crazy bastard!\"\n\"Squawk!\"\nIn the quiet mountains, the loud crowing of a rooster echoed.\nTwenty minutes later, Cha Eui-jae was still sitting in Hong Ye-seong's \"love house,\" but the one sitting across from him now was Kkokko.\nKkokko had stacked up cushions to match Cha Eui-jae's eye level. The owner of the house, Hong Ye-seong, was curled up beside them, sound asleep, occasionally smacking his lips. Cha Eui-jae had taken off his mask and placed it beside him, sipping on sikhye while glaring at Kkokko.\nKkokko, who had been grooming itself diligently with its beak, finally opened its mouth— or rather, its beak.\n\"What could have awakened Lee Sa-young? Where did things go wrong?\"\n\"Stop throwing out questions and just explain properly.\"\n\"I've thought about it, and even if nothing was done, there must have been some kind of trigger.\"\n\"...What kind of trigger?\"\n\"Well, something that would make Lee Sa-young open his eyes wide. Like, for example...\"\nKokko tilted its head back and forth, its eyes rolling around.\n\"A kiss, maybe?\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nCha Eui-jae coughed, quickly covering his mouth, and then subtly averted his gaze. His already wide eyes grew even wider. Kkokko tilted its head curiously.\n\"What, did you really do it? I was just throwing it out there.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Wow...\"\nKkokko muttered, covering its beak with its wing. Its round eyes narrowed into slits.\n\"Thief.\"\nFeeling guilty, Cha Eui-jae shouted in protest.\n\"Shut up!\"\n\"That's why he woke up. According to the plan of the Lee Sa-young from the ruined world, the two were supposed to fuse without realizing it.\"\n\"How do you know about that plan?\"\n\"Well...\"\nThe small black eyes once again lit up with the intricate pattern of the Eyes of Appraisal.\n\"Because I'm the one who modified that watch. To make it usable again.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 156: The One Hidden in the Gaps\nCha Eui-jae fiddled with the watch strapped to his wrist. The round watch dial had three smaller watches etched into it. Two had stopped, while the last one ticked busily on its own. Cha Eui-jae pointed at the small watches.\n\"Are you talking about these small ones?\"\n\"Oh, you're wearing it well. That's right. Originally, there was only one big watch. I modified it to be more visible.\"\nKkokko lifted its head proudly.\n\"All my handiwork.\"\n\"Why did you modify it? I doubt it was just to make it look better.\"\n\"I did it because it was necessary.\"\n\"Necessary for what? This modification was done when Lee Sa-young from the ruined world used it, wasn't it? When I first used it to turn back time, these small watches weren't here.\"\n\"Wow, you actually remember that? I thought you didn't know anything.\"\nKkokko chattered on. Cha Eui-jae sighed and ran a hand over his face. Then, he called out,\n\"Hey.\"\nHis voice, now low and ominous, reached Kkokko. The light in the thatched house flickered menacingly before going out completely. The table hummed. When he lifted his head, blue lights flickered in the darkness. An icy, sharp energy that seemed to freeze everything from within engulfed the house.\nFrom a face so shadowed that it was barely visible, a calm voice emerged.\n\"You must've thought I was okay if you can joke around and beat around the bush like this.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But I'm not. I'm really freaking anxious right now.\"\nThe heavy atmosphere began to twist. Crack, the cup fractured. A suffocating pressure filled the space, as if it would choke anyone at any moment. Yet the voice remained gentle.\n\"I didn't come here to joke with you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I came to find out why this happened and how to solve it. I don't have time to waste.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So just get to the point. You said this was our last chance. We need to cooperate.\"\nAt that moment, he sensed movement from the inner room. He quickly turned his head. Beyond the half-open door, Lee Sa-young, covered by a blanket, was tossing and turning.\nCha Eui-jae exhaled a short breath and covered his face. Blink. The flickering light regained its brightness. The oppressive pressure that had weighed down on them vanished without a trace. The look of terror on Hong Ye-seong, who had been huddled on the bare floor, also returned to normal.\nCha Eui-jae sighed.\n\"Sorry.\"\nKkokko flapped its wings and shook its head.\n\"No, your point is valid. But to talk about that, we need to move to a different place. There are things I can't say here... Is that okay?\"\n\"It's fine.\"\n\"Then look into my eyes.\"\nCha Eui-jae lifted his head. The Eyes of Appraisal in front of him began to spin rapidly. He felt his consciousness being pulled into somewhere distant, and he let himself fall into the flow, closing his eyes.\nWhen he opened them a moment later, he found himself standing in the middle of Hong Ye-seong's workshop, the one he had seen at the end of the Memorial Dungeon. The monochromatic space, existing only in black and white like a photograph shot on black-and-white film, had a peculiar, timeless atmosphere. It felt as though he was peeking into someone's old photo album.\nHe could even smell the scent of dust from somewhere.\nCha Eui-jae looked around. In a backless chair in the workshop sat a man dressed in training clothes. He wore a confident smile and held up a peace sign. It was Hong Ye-seong, his hair tied back in a short ponytail.\nA voice emerged from his unmoving lips.\n—I won't keep you long.\nLike the rest of the photo, he was entirely in black and white. Only the golden patterns floating above his eyes had color, and they were the only part of the photograph that moved. The Hong Ye-seong before him had a different aura than the one Cha Eui-jae knew.\n'He looks much more experienced and relaxed.'\nHe was someone who could be described as a veteran.\nHong Ye-seong's voice echoed through the workshop.\n—I hadn't planned to explain things in such detail or even get involved... but I didn't anticipate Lee Sa-young ending up like that. So I've decided it's better if you know everything. You're the only one who can quickly respond to these variables, my friend.\n\"...\"\n—All I was allowed to do was observe, but this is an emergency, so... I'll explain everything from the very beginning.\nThe Eyes of Appraisal, which had been spinning rapidly, began to slow down.\n—Let's start with the watch. It's used to turn back time, but more accurately, it erases the previous world and starts anew in a new one.\n\"Yeah.\"\n—That means the watch was originally a one-time-use item. The idea of using something that erases the previous world and resets it in a new one multiple times is absurd.\n\"...\"\n—It was meant to be used only once. Once used, it was supposed to disappear completely. That's why, when we first turned back time, we didn't plan for another chance. We said the next time would be the last.\nCha Eui-jae touched his wrist. The cool metal surface soothed his overheated fingers.\n\"But the watch is still here, on my wrist.\"\n—That's the problem. From what I've seen, the issue began with the first use.\nThe Eyes of Appraisal began to weave a complicated pattern.\n—Your power, which was the initial anchor, was so overwhelming that it left a lingering trace on the watch. Instead of disappearing, it remained, along with the power to turn back time, but in a half-baked, incomplete form.\n\"...\"\n—It was so incomplete that, while it can still turn back time, there's no telling what side effects might occur. It's become a gamble, a risky item. You still had it in the second world, but after you died, it fell into Lee Sa-young's hands.\n\"...\"\n—I modified the watch to reduce the side effects, and Lee Sa-young used it. But even though he bore the burden with his entire being, he couldn't completely avoid the side effects.\nSide effects. Cha Eui-jae thought of Lee Sa-young, who must have wandered endlessly through the ruined world. The moment they met, with eyes like mirrors reflecting Cha Eui-jae entirely, silently shedding tears. He had become something other than human, something drained of all emotions.\n\"...I thought it was all meaningless.\"\n\"Everything I did...\"\nCould that also be part of the side effects? Becoming the warden of a ruined world, endlessly wandering, waiting for an end that might never come, not knowing if he had failed or succeeded.\nThat was just too...\nCha Eui-jae stared at Hong Ye-seong, speechless. Countless thoughts rose and fell, but he couldn't find any words that felt adequate enough to express them. Afraid that any incomplete words might spill out, Cha Eui-jae covered his mouth.\nHong Ye-seong murmured. His voice sounded somewhat defeated.\n—You experienced one of those side effects yourself.\n\"...I did? What?\"\n—The West Sea Rift.\nIt felt like he'd been struck in the head with a hammer. Cha Eui-jae's mouth fell slightly open. Hong Ye-seong, still trapped within the black-and-white photo, stared at him with a confident expression, his face devoid of emotion.\n—I told you, right? The watch erases the previous world and creates a new one. But because the watch is incomplete, this time, the previous world wasn't completely erased. That's why the ruined world continues to affect the present one.\n\"So... the West Sea rift too?\"\nCha Eui-jae's voice trembled slightly. His stomach churned, and his vision blurred as if he might pass out. Hong Ye-seong's voice carried a tone of pity.\n—Didn't you ever find it strange? The West Sea rift kept growing, swallowing up hunters, until you entered it. Have any other hunters gone in since you? Probably not. You were the last.\nJust as he said. After the hunters who had entered before him, as well as those who went in with him, had all perished, after he had killed the monsters roaming inside and stabbed the Basilisk in the head, no additional personnel were sent in.\n\"...\"\nBecause the rift had closed.\nIt was as if... Cha Eui-jae had been the target all along.\nA heavy voice drove the point home.\n—The ruined world found you, the original anchor. The current anchor's sacrifice wasn't enough, so it sought out the person to pay the rest of the price.\nHong Ye-seong paused briefly, letting out a short sigh. The Eyes of Appraisal, which had been spinning non-stop, grew faint.\n—Listen, my friend, we made a promise.\n\"...\"\n—You don't remember it, but...\nThere was a hint of sadness in his voice.\n—You were supposed to turn back time and prevent the apocalypse...\n\"...\"\n—And I was supposed to observe.\n\"Why did you make such a promise?\"\n—...\nHong Ye-seong spoke heavily.\n—To save the world, of course.",

      "content": "Chapter 157: The One Hidden in the Gaps\nCha Eui-jae stared at Hong Ye-seong's confident smile, frozen in time, at a loss for words. The two had made a promise in a past he couldn't remember.\n'To save the world.'\nCha Eui-jae clenched and unclenched his fist. Was it okay to forget such an important promise? Had he done something too cruel to Hong Ye-seong?\nThen, Hong Ye-seong suddenly spoke.\n—Hey, hey, don't take it too seriously. This was a promise for me, you know. You didn't want to do it, but I pushed and pushed until you agreed.\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened.\n\"What?\"\n—Well... I don't know if you realize this now, but I tend to switch interests pretty quickly. I can't focus on one thing for long. I get bored easily. If it feels like a task, I don't want to do it. I just want to have fun.\nThere was a playful glint beneath the surface of his emotions.\n—But saving the world is different.\n\"...\"\n—I've seen you save the world multiple times, you know?\n\"...\"\n—It looked really cool. So, I thought this time, I'd tag along while you save the world.\nExcitement crept into Hong Ye-seong's voice.\n—So, what do you think? Did that help? I'm the only one who can provide such top-tier deductions and information, aren't I?\nThe Hong Ye-seong in the faded black-and-white photograph was smiling. He probably had been smiling all along. Cha Eui-jae barely managed to choke out the words that had been rising in his throat.\n\"Thank you.\"\n—...\n\"You've kept yourself trapped here... just to keep that promise.\"\nCha Eui-jae knew better than anyone the loneliness that accompanied isolation, how precious the warmth of others was.\nThe first-world Cha Eui-jae must not have been lonely. Even after losing Lee Sa-young, he could have resolved to save the world because Hong Ye-seong was there beside him. That must have been why, instead of going mad, he decided to turn back time and reclaim Lee Sa-young.\nBut how many people would have gazed into Hong Ye-seong's photograph after he had trapped himself within it? Maybe Cha Eui-jae was the first. The previous world's Cha Eui-jae had died early, after all. Cha Eui-jae spoke up.\n\"I...\"\n—Ah, forget it. Let's stop with the heavy stuff here. Lee Sa-young's condition is more important, isn't it... right?\nThe light in the atmosphere shifted its focus. Hong Ye-seong mumbled.\n—Looks like Lee Sa-young's waking up. That guy's got sharp instincts.\n\"Waking up? Wait a minute.\"\n—Oh no, he's probably hitting your head on the table right now.\n\"What? Hey, you—\"\n—Let's go!\nBefore he could finish his sentence, Cha Eui-jae felt something grab his head and pull him up. He swallowed his curses as he was dragged along.\nWith a gasp, Cha Eui-jae jolted awake as if emerging from underwater, and instinctively held his breath.\nPurple eyes were staring straight at him.\nCha Eui-jae quickly raised his upper body. It seemed he had lost consciousness, slumped over on the table. The blue evening sky had been swallowed by the setting sun.\nIt seemed quite some time had passed. Cha Eui-jae darted his eyes around. Lee Sa-young, who had tilted his head and was watching him, continued to stare without averting his gaze. His sharp eyes seemed ready to devour him. Cha Eui-jae cautiously called out.\n\"...Sa-young? You're awake?\"\n\"...Hah.\"\nA short scoff escaped. Then, Lee Sa-young's face blossomed into a bright smile, his eyes curving into crescents. The radiance of his smile made Cha Eui-jae glance away. Lee Sa-young asked softly, his voice smooth and gentle.\n\"You must've been really tired?\"\n\"No... Well...\"\n\"Yeah, well... I get it. You had reasons to be tired...\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been avoiding his gaze, caught a glimpse of Lee Sa-young's phone screen.\n[J, Redefining the No. 1 Ranking.]\n[J's Bold Moves Continue... What's on His Mind?]\n[Hero J: How He Returned from the West Sea Rift.]\nIt looked like Lee Sa-young had searched for 'J' on the portal site. The screen was filled with headlines about J. A chill ran down Cha Eui-jae's spine from his neck to his waist.\n'Ah, shit.'\n\"I get it. You've been working so hard... Right?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been squatting, sat down properly and leaned in, his hands pressed to the floor. Cha Eui-jae leaned back as much as Lee Sa-young leaned in.\n\"No, it's just... You suddenly collapsed.\"\n\"I did collapse.\"\n\"And the situation with the world seemed pretty serious, didn't it?\"\n\"I suppose it did.\"\n\"There'd be a lot of talk when the number two ranking is absent...\"\n\"I see. So, you stepped in?\"\n\"No, it's just... I know the monsters appearing now better than anyone else.\"\n\"Aha...\"\nLee Sa-young let out a long sigh and roughly raked a hand through his hair.\n\"So, you were so tired that you fell asleep here with your head on the table? Without even lying down?\"\n\"No, I didn't sleep because I was tired.\"\n\"Such dedication...\"\nIt was unfair. But how could he explain that he had been having a secret conversation with Hong Ye-seong, who was currently possessing Kkokko's body, and the others from a different world? He couldn't overwhelm someone who had just woken up with that.\nCha Eui-jae glanced at Kkokko. He gestured, hoping for some help, but Kkokko had already turned his body around and was sitting with his back to him. The small round back resembled an old man grumbling, \"I don't want to see.\"\n'That little...'\nCha Eui-jae glared. All his gratitude evaporated. In the end, he had no choice but to resort to his go-to move.\nCha Eui-jae stretched out his arms and wrapped them around Lee Sa-young's neck, pulling him in. Despite his earlier annoyance, Lee Sa-young came in without resistance. Cha Eui-jae, holding Lee Sa-young awkwardly, stammered out a question.\n\"Is your body... okay?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You were crying so much earlier, I thought something had happened.\"\n\"I told you I wasn't crying.\"\n\"Hey, I actually came here to ask you something. That thing inside you...\"\n\"...I know.\"\nLee Sa-young responded curtly, wrapping his arms around Cha Eui-jae's waist. Then, with a low sigh, he rubbed his head against Cha Eui-jae's neck.\n\"Hong Ye-seong was passed out next to me, by the way.\"\nAs always, Lee Sa-young's words weren't as cute as his actions. Cha Eui-jae mechanically patted his head, selling out the sleeping Hong Ye-seong's honor.\n\"He suddenly knocked out while talking. Probably drank too much last night.\"\n\"...Really? So, did he say anything?\"\n\"Not yet.\"\nThey kept chatting quietly, embracing each other. How long had they been hugging when a vibration was felt from behind them? It was Lee Sa-young's phone. He loosened his arms from around Cha Eui-jae's waist and checked the screen. A frown creased his face.\n\"...I'll be right back. I need to take this call.\"\n\"Okay. Go ahead.\"\nLee Sa-young disappeared to the back of the straw-roofed house. No sound could be heard even when Cha Eui-jae strained his ears. Did he step outside the barrier? Cha Eui-jae lightly kicked the mat where Kkokko was sitting.\n\"Hey, traitor.\"\n\"Traitor? I'd prefer you call me a true friend who gave you two some private time.\"\n\"Shut up. Tell me more about Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"To do that, we'd have to go back into that space. The topic's too delicate to discuss here.\"\nThe more they spoke, the worse it got. If Lee Sa-young came back to find Cha Eui-jae lying on the table again, who knew how he'd react this time? Cha Eui-jae thought quickly and, lowering his voice to a whisper, asked,\n\"Right. So, do you know anything about Prometheus? Anything at all, just spill it.\"\nKkokko, who had tilted his head slightly, also covered his beak with a wing and replied.\n\"I don't.\"\nCha Eui-jae hadn't expected that answer. After acting all-knowing like a sage, now Kkokko was playing dumb? Cha Eui-jae glared at him with suspicion.\n\"Why don't you know? You acted like you knew everything.\"\n\"Well, those kinds of guys didn't leave much of a trace in my world. A grand name like that? I only saw it in Greek and Roman Mythology for Kids.\"\nCha Eui-jae's suspicious gaze remained fixed on Kkokko. Sensing the mistrust, Kkokko hit Cha Eui-jae's arm with his wing.\n\"Look, I'm telling you, I only found out about these guys after watching over you in this world.\"\n\"And what about the drug that mutates the Awakened?\"\n\"No way. This world is especially brutal.\"\n\"...\"\nTheir eyes met. An organization that didn't exist in the previous world now appeared in this one. Cha Eui-jae muttered quietly.\n\"So, could that be another side effect?\"\n\"Seems that way, right?\"\n\"Damn it. How is that a side effect? Why does everyone go insane together?\"\n\"I don't know either. That's something you have to figure out yourself. Now, give me more nurungji.\"\nCha Eui-jae obediently offered another piece of nurungji.\n\"Hey. One more question.\"\nKkokko, who had been pecking at the nurungji, looked up with a curious tilt of his head.\nNo matter how much time passed, Cha Eui-jae couldn't get used to hearing Hong Ye-seong's voice coming from such a cute face. Maybe it was worse this time since he had just seen Hong Ye-seong's frozen image in that photograph. Breaking off a piece of his own nurungji, Cha Eui-jae asked, fumbling,\n\"Were you... always Kkokko? Were you the one clucking around, too?\"\nKkokko dropped the piece of nurungji he was holding in his beak. A small, bean-like eye widened in shock.\n\"Are you seriously asking that?\"\n\"Just answer me. I need to look back on my past.\"\n\"Friend... What kind of person do you think I am?\"\nKkokko tilted his head indignantly. Watching him, Cha Eui-jae felt equally annoyed. This shiny, round, adorable creature was behaving far too strangely. Kkokko flapped his wings.\n\"It's only temporary that I'm borrowing Kkokko's body. Since this was something made by Hong Ye-seong, it was easy to inhabit. But I don't make a habit of it.\"\n\"Why didn't you come back in his body instead? Wouldn't that be easier?\"\n\"There's a complicated reason for that...\"\nKkokko chirped, waddling over to the sleeping Hong Ye-seong, who lay with his arm resting on a cushion, smacking his lips in his sleep. Watching the scene, Cha Eui-jae pondered for a moment. What would it feel like to look at your own body so closely, from another's perspective?\n\"The kid's a little strange, isn't he? Like he's missing a screw.\"\n\"Cough!\"\nCaught off guard by the sudden moment of self-reflection, Cha Eui-jae coughed harshly, covering his mouth. Kkokko, unfazed, continued talking.\n\"But it can't be helped. A soul that's meant to be whole was divided. So, with his soul incomplete, something is bound to be missing.\"\n\"What? But Lee Sa-young... wait.\"\nCha Eui-jae snapped his head up. There was no sign of Lee Sa-young.\nNo, this was...\n\"What's wrong?\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly grabbed Kkokko's beak. Kkokko struggled, flapping his wings angrily, but upon sensing the tension, he clamped his beak shut.\nIt wasn't that he couldn't sense Lee Sa-young— it was more like Lee Sa-young was deliberately hiding his presence. Cha Eui-jae's eyes briefly glowed blue, and at that moment, Lee Sa-young revealed himself. Standing silently, Lee Sa-young slipped his hands into his coat pockets and curled his lips into a smile.\n\"Mm... I thought it was my fault.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I thought maybe while I was asleep, you got so lonely that you developed a habit of talking to chickens...\"\n\"...\"\n\"So then...\"\nWith quiet steps, Lee Sa-young approached, crouching slightly to meet Cha Eui-jae's gaze. His violet eyes sparkled with amusement.\n\"Who's that guy?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 158: The One Hidden in the Gaps\nShortly after, they sat across the table from each other. The only difference from earlier was that Lee Sa-young had taken the seat where Kkokko had been, while Kkokko now sat beside Cha Eui-jae. One arm resting behind his chair, Lee Sa-young traced the rim of his cup slowly with his index finger.\n\"...So, to summarize.\"\nGulp. A swallow. The finger stopped. A lethargic voice murmured.\n\"You noticed that there's someone else inside me.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"And you came looking for Hong Ye-seong to figure out what's going on...\"\nHis black finger precisely pointed at Kkokko.\n\"And that chicken bastard is Hong—\"\n\"Wait, wait.\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly reached out to clamp Lee Sa-young's mouth shut as he half-rose from his seat. His violet eyes narrowed. He put a finger to his own lips with his other hand and whispered, \"Shh,\" as though to emphasize his point.\n\"We can't say that outright. There's still a lot to hear.\"\nThey hadn't yet figured out how to resolve this. They couldn't just send the otherworldly Hong Ye-seong back without solving the problem.\nAt that moment, Lee Sa-young's black hand gripped Cha Eui-jae's wrist tightly— surprisingly strong, even to Cha Eui-jae. Their eyes met. Lee Sa-young's gaze was filled with annoyance. He pulled Cha Eui-jae's hand away from his mouth and snapped sharply.\n\"Don't do that.\"\n\"What? ...Cover your mouth?\"\nCha Eui-jae remembered something Bae Won-woo had mentioned— Lee Sa-young hated being controlled. Cha Eui-jae withdrew his hand from Lee Sa-young's mouth, though Lee Sa-young gestured at his other hand with a nod of his chin.\n\"The shushing.\"\nThat was an unexpected response. Cha Eui-jae blinked in confusion, wiggling the finger he'd placed against his lips.\n\"This? Why?\"\n\"...Just don't. It's annoying.\"\nLee Sa-young's curt reply was followed by silence as he closed his eyes. He looked utterly exhausted. He'd always been moody and difficult to deal with, but now it seemed even worse— probably because he'd just woken up from a three-month coma. Cha Eui-jae clicked his tongue quietly.\n'Right, he has every reason to be unstable...'\nHe wasn't just Lee Sa-young anymore— he was essentially two people in one body. Handling one Lee Sa-young was already difficult enough, and now there are two. Cha Eui-jae massaged his neck absentmindedly as his instincts screamed a warning.\n'Lee Sa-young's one thing, but...'\nHe thought back to the way Lee Sa-young's fingers had trailed over his palm, his gaze completely focused on Cha Eui-jae as if nothing else existed. That eerie, worn-out aura... the 'Lee Sa-young' who no longer seemed entirely human.\nAnd then...\nCha Eui-jae glanced up at Lee Sa-young. The other man, pressing his fingers into his temple, blinked as if sensing Cha Eui-jae's gaze. Cha Eui-jae quickly looked away, but the atmosphere across the table grew tense. If he were an ordinary person, he would have fainted from the pressure alone. Damn, now he couldn't even look at Lee Sa-young for no reason. Either way, Lee Sa-young was a problem.\nCha Eui-jae sighed, fingering the edge of his cushion.\n'This is going to be exhausting...'\nBoth of them weren't going to make things easy, that much was clear. And being caught in the middle? He was going to suffer the most. Just then, Kkokko, who had been quietly perched atop a pile of cushions, opened his beak.\n\"Can I speak now?\"\n\"If it's about Lee Sa-young's condition.\"\n\"Of course it is. Anyway, for some reason, their souls haven't fully fused yet.\"\nLee Sa-young brushed a lock of hair back from his face and asked,\n\"What's the reason?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nAn awkward silence followed. Lee Sa-young raised an eyebrow. Kkokko glanced at Cha Eui-jae, who quickly and discreetly jabbed Kkokko in the side with a finger. Feeling a sharp poke, Kkokko responded mechanically.\n\"It's just what I said— some kind of external interference, an unfortunate accident, if you will... I don't really know the details!\"\nHe knew.\n\"Hey, if you don't know, just skip it. There's no point dwelling with an unknown cause. Nothing will come of it.\"\nSomething will come of it.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young shot Cha Eui-jae a suspicious look, but Cha Eui-jae just smiled. After all, not even Lee Sa-young could complain about someone smiling, right?\nLuckily, his tactic worked. After staring at Cha Eui-jae's face for a long moment, Lee Sa-young sighed and turned his head away. Seizing the opportunity, Cha Eui-jae jabbed Kkokko again. The ceramic chicken spilled out words like an answering machine.\n\"The truth is, there's no clear solution right now. It's not like before, when messing with it would cause an explosion, but things are still unstable. And the system is probably watching.\"\n\"Do you think I came all the way here to hear that?\"\n\"But it's the truth. How do you feel, though?\"\nKkokko turned to Lee Sa-young.\n\"How's your body? Do you see anything unusual? Having trouble with your memory?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young pursed his lips tightly. A scab that had formed on his lips cracked and started bleeding again. Cha Eui-jae and Kkokko waited patiently for him to continue. Finally, Lee Sa-young pressed his fingers to his temple and spoke slowly.\n\"...My memories are all jumbled up. Mine and... someone else's, all mixed together.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You want me to be more honest?\"\nLee Sa-young's violet eyes burned like fire, as if they wanted to consume Cha Eui-jae whole. Leaning forward across the table, Lee Sa-young spat his words out quietly.\n\"Earlier, I thought you were dead.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There was blood running down your head and neck... Ha, fuck. I thought I'd lost my mind.\"\nSuddenly, Cha Eui-jae remembered the day at the memorial stone, when Lee Sa-young had touched his head and temple, his face white with fear...\nWith a short breath, Lee Sa-young buried his face in his hands.\n\"When I realize this is real, it's... better. But when I first wake up... that's when it's bad.\"\nA shadow passed over his pale face. Lee Sa-young pressed a hand to his chest.\n\"I can feel him inside me... another version of me. But it doesn't feel unfamiliar... It's like he's claiming to be me, too. He's similar to me.\"\nHis blood-red lips twisted into a bitter smile.\n\"Disgusting...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well...\"\nLee Sa-young slowly stood up. He stuffed his hands into the pockets of his black leather coat, then tilted his head, looking down at Kkokko.\n\"Are you satisfied now? Hong Ye-seong.\"\nThe air seemed to freeze. Moments later, a fierce wind kicked up. Wooong. A bright white window appeared before their eyes. Kkokko's eyes widened as he frantically opened his beak.\n\"Wait, did you even listen to me? If you say it outright like that, I'll get kicked out—\"\n\"I know.\"\nLee Sa-young curled his lips into a cruel smile.\n\"I did it on purpose. To get rid of you.\"\n\"You ungrateful bastard!\"\nHong Ye-seong flapped his wings in anger, but Lee Sa-young only looked down at him with cold eyes.\n\"I don't need your help. I know better than anyone.\"\n\"You what?\"\nLee Sa-young clenched his hand around his throat, as if choking himself.\n\"I know exactly what he wants... better than anyone.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So get lost.\"\nHong Ye-seong shot a resentful glare at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Friend, what did you do raising this kid?\"\nCha Eui-jae was taken aback.\n\"Why am I suddenly getting cursed at?\"\n\"The Lee Sa-young I knew wasn't this rude!\"\nCha Eui-jae had no response to that. He knew the Lee Sa-young Hong Ye-seong was talking about— the one who wore an apron and welcomed him home with a rolled omelet. Cha Eui-jae couldn't help but feel a little dizzy.\n'Did living apart from me really change him this much?'\nAt that moment, a sweet scent wafted in, and a warm breath tickled Cha Eui-jae's ear. Lee Sa-young, who had moved closer, was leaning in to whisper.\n\"That's not it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I've always been rude.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I was just pretending to be nice.\"\nHis low voice grazed Cha Eui-jae's ear. A shiver ran down his spine. Just as Cha Eui-jae flinched, Hong Ye-seong shouted.\n\"Enough! I'll leave before I get kicked out!\"\nA flash of white light burst from Kkokko's body. When it dimmed, Cha Eui-jae quickly scooped Kkokko up. Kkokko blinked his black eyes. The intelligence that had once resided in his black, bead-like eyes was gone. What remained in front of him was just a sleek, porcelain chicken— not Hong Ye-seong, but the real Kkokko.\n\"Bawk?\"\n'Damn it, he left me behind!'\nCha Eui-jae trembled with a sharp sense of betrayal. He had thought of him as a friend, but now Hong Ye-seong had run off, abandoning him alone with the insufferable Lee Sa-young!\nKkokko flapped his wings wildly and escaped Cha Eui-jae's grasp. Then, he disappeared into the bedroom, likely to nestle beside Hong Ye-seong, who was lounging under a blanket. Finally, they were alone. Lee Sa-young spoke softly.\n\"Hyung.\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't respond, lowering his head. His heart felt heavy. Lee Sa-young, undeterred, ran his fingers over the nape of Cha Eui-jae's exposed neck.\n\"Your hair color...\"\nLee Sa-young's black fingers brushed through the gray strands of hair, tickling slightly. Cha Eui-jae's head twitched ever so slightly from the sensation. After playing with the short locks for a moment, Lee Sa-young mumbled to himself.\n\"It's gotten whiter.\"\n\"...Really?\"\n\"Yeah...\"\nLee Sa-young's words trailed off. Cha Eui-jae lifted his head to check his hair color, only to find himself staring straight into Lee Sa-young's violet eyes.\n\"Then... Hyung.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young knelt on one knee in front of Cha Eui-jae. Slowly, his hand reached out to cover Cha Eui-jae's eyes. Darkness fell over him. Cha Eui-jae's lips parted slightly in anticipation. He heard a soft laugh, as if in approval. Something warm and rough brushed against his lips— a mixture of the metallic taste of blood and a hint of sweetness.\nBetween their joined lips, a low laugh escaped.\n\"Ah, I get it now...\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young pulled back slightly, lightly biting his lower lip.\n\"You kissed me, didn't you? While I was asleep.\"\nOh, damn it.\n\"I can tell now.\"\nBefore Cha Eui-jae could respond, something soft slipped between his lips. His reply melted into the tangle of their tongues. Cha Eui-jae squeezed his eyes shut.",

      "content": "Chapter 159: The One Hidden in the Gaps\nThe more his vision was obstructed, the more his other senses reacted sharply. A strong arm and hand encircled his waist, their lips collided, a black tongue brushed against the roof of his mouth, and explored inside. The sweet scent and heat suffocated him, making him feel like he was going to die.\n'...No, this isn't the time!'\nSuddenly coming to his senses, Cha Eui-jae pushed Lee Sa-young's shoulder hard. Lee Sa-young obediently backed off and tilted his head slightly.\n\"Why?\"\nIn the meantime, Cha Eui-jae covered his mouth with the back of his hand and hurriedly retreated. He only stopped when his back hit a pillar. For once, he stammered out his words.\n\"Hey, you, how... No, were you awake?\"\nHow does this guy know I kissed him?\nWas it like his body was asleep but his mind was awake? Or did he hear the conversation I had with Hong Ye-seong earlier? Was he just pretending to be asleep? But I didn't sense any sign of that. Did I miss it because I was out of it? It felt like a storm was raging in his head. Then, Lee Sa-young's shoulders shook.\n\"Pfft...\"\n'What the...?'\n\"Hahaha!\"\nLee Sa-young started laughing out loud. It was a rare sight to see him smiling so brightly. Cha Eui-jae could only be dumbfounded. Laughing at a time like this? Cha Eui-jae took his hand off his mouth and snapped in anger.\n\"Are you not going to answer? Were you awake?\"\n\"Haha... Oh, seriously.\"\nWith eyes narrowing as if he was dying of amusement, Lee Sa-young crawled toward him. Cha Eui-jae tensed up as he pressed his back against the pillar. Lee Sa-young, who had approached him on all fours, met his gaze.\n\"Was I awake?\"\n\"...\"\n\"No way...\"\nHis lips approached Cha Eui-jae's ear. His languid voice whispered softly.\n\"I was just testing you.\"\n\"...What?\"\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly, his mouth slightly agape. Lee Sa-young, who had lowered his head and chuckled, pressed a loud kiss on his cheek.\n\"It's a good thing you wear a mask... What would've happened if you didn't?\"\n\"Hey, Lee Sa-young...!\"\n\"All your true feelings are...\"\n\"Hey, ugh...\"\n\"Showing on your face.\"\nAs Lee Sa-young continued to kiss his face— his cheek, the tip of his nose, the corners of his eyes, his forehead—he cupped Cha Eui-jae's ears and cheeks with both hands. Cha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young's wrists, gritting his teeth. The poker face that had once sustained him had long since disappeared. That's why...\n\"You're so terrible at lying.\"\nSmooch.\n\"At this rate... I can't leave you alone.\"\nHa, Cha Eui-jae let out a short breath. He saw his reflection in Lee Sa-young's amused violet eyes, which were filled with something unknown, more than just mirroring him like a simple reflection. Once again, their lips met, and the black tongue intruded into his mouth. Cha Eui-jae didn't stop it this time.\nWas he hypnotized?\nHis head felt like it was melting as the heat continued to rise.\n'Ah, seriously...'\nWith his ears covered by Lee Sa-young's hands, he couldn't hear any external noise, but the wet, sticky sounds echoed in his ears, tickling them. Struggling to pull himself together, Cha Eui-jae managed to grab onto the collar of his coat. The cold leather crumpled messily in his grip.\n'This is driving me crazy...'\nHe fumbled, wrapping his arms around Lee Sa-young's neck. His fingertips trembled. Cha Eui-jae panted, slowly opening his eyes. Beyond his eyelids, Lee Sa-young was staring at him. What he felt from those pitch-black violet eyes was,\n'...Shit.'\nA clear and vivid desire.\nA chill ran down his spine and waist. It was an instinctive feeling, but the chill was different from anything he'd felt before. A large, cold hand gripped the back of his neck, and long fingers traced his nape. Cha Eui-jae, now embraced by Lee Sa-young, tried to catch his breath. The lips that had left his fell to his chin.\n\"Why are you so tense...\"\nLee Sa-young's low, raspy voice sounded like it was echoing from afar. Cha Eui-jae clenched his hands together behind Lee Sa-young's neck. The stiff pain brought him back to his senses, as if he had finally emerged from being submerged underwater.\n'Wait a minute.'\nHe recalled the boy who used to wrap his fingers around Cha Eui-jae's while covered in bandages. Even as he whimpered in pain, it was as if the world had nothing else but Cha Eui-jae to hold on to, always watching him.\n'That kid...'\nCha Eui-jae looked at the dark figure holding him. Strong arms and body tightly embraced Cha Eui-jae, who wasn't small by any means. With his eyes half-closed, Lee Sa-young was focused on caressing Cha Eui-jae's nape and hair. Every time his long eyelashes fluttered, their shadows fluttered along. His lips, swollen red from too much friction, and the mole beneath his lip too.\nNoticing Cha Eui-jae's gaze, Lee Sa-young lifted his head. At that moment, his violet eyes narrowed, and his lips moved toward Cha Eui-jae's again. Cha Eui-jae quickly turned his head, making Lee Sa-young's kiss land on his cheek instead of his lips. A small laugh echoed in his ear. His heart started pounding loudly. His body tensed up.\n'This is the same person?'\nThat kid, looking at me with such a desire-filled gaze? Seeing me in a sexual way? It doesn't make any sense.\nThe sudden sense of dissonance shook Cha Eui-jae. Had they been apart for too long? Lee Sa-young had grown so much that Cha Eui-jae could no longer find traces of his past self, while Cha Eui-jae himself had remained stagnant. And the grown-up Lee Sa-young had surpassed Cha Eui-jae in both height and build. And now...\nHe's desiring Cha Eui-jae.\n'Shit, something is seriously wrong here.'\nThis couldn't possibly happen unless the world had turned upside down. The only desire Cha Eui-jae ever had was to become family with that boy. To become each other's only family, to live together, to eat together, to sleep under the same roof. It would have been even better if the boy leaned on him during that process.\n'But in that...'\nThere wasn't even the slightest space for such sexual contact in that desire. His thoughts were cut off the moment warm breath brushed against his ear. Soon after, a sharp pain pricked his earlobe. Lee Sa-young was biting his ear. In a panic, Cha Eui-jae pushed Lee Sa-young's cheek away.\n\"Where do you think you're biting?\"\n\"What are you thinking about without me?\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young's face. There was still an intense desire radiating from his eyes. It was so obvious that even someone as clueless as Cha Eui-jae could recognize it immediately. He lowered his head slightly. He was flustered.\n'How long has he been looking at me like this?'\nOf course, they had rubbed their lips together before. But! Those were abnormal situations where rational thinking was impossible. One time was to calm Lee Sa-young down from hyperventilating, and then...\n\"Hyung.\"\nA low voice cut through his rationalization. Cha Eui-jae snapped his head up. Lee Sa-young was slightly tilting his head.\n\"What are you thinking?\"\n\"...\"\nWhat am I thinking?\n'That our relationship is totally fucked, whatever it is now.'\nAt some point, it seems we buttoned the wrong button. Cha Eui-jae swallowed the words that had risen to his throat. There was no way he could say that while being held in Lee Sa-young's arms. If he uttered those words, the hand that had been gently caressing his neck would attack it in an instant. Of course, Cha Eui-jae wouldn't just sit back either, but...\n\"Hm?\"\nLee Sa-young stroked his hair as if urging him to speak. Cha Eui-jae barely managed to say something.\n\"...I'm just wondering if this is okay.\"\n\"What is?\"\n\"Uh, you... and... me. Is this okay?\"\n\"So, what exactly?\"\n\"You know... this behavior.\"\nCha Eui-jae barely managed to suppress his patriarchal and conservative instincts, carefully choosing his words. But what came back was a snort.\n\"After doing everything, you're saying this now...\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You really need to stop overthinking, Hyung.\"\nThe hand that had been tracing his nape and hair now cupped his cheeks. Pinching his cheeks slightly, Lee Sa-young made Cha Eui-jae's lips form a pout as he muttered.\n\"With this tiny head, what do you think about so much...\"\nAnnoyed, Cha Eui-jae slapped Lee Sa-young's hands away.\n\"What do you think you're doing to your hyung?\"\n\"Hyung? Oh...\"\nHis violet eyes sparkled. It was an ominous sparkle. Cha Eui-jae instinctively realized something was wrong. Unfortunately, he could only recognize it and not correct it.\nA chilling smile appeared on his pale face. Exhaling softly, Lee Sa-young pressed his forehead against Cha Eui-jae's and then stuck out his black tongue, biting it lightly.\n\"Do you kiss your younger brother?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. It was the most sacrilegious thing he'd ever heard. Before he could say anything, while he was still in shock, Lee Sa-young continued to grumble as he ran his fingers through Cha Eui-jae's hair.\n\"We're not even blood-related, and we've never been legally bound, so what brother...?\"\n\"You, you... you...\"\n\"Didn't I tell you at the lab... your attitude is contradictory.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You should really think about who I am and what you want from me. Stop denying it to yourself.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And not something cliché like 'family.'\"\nWith a light kiss on the tip of his nose, Lee Sa-young stood up. Then, with a dramatic swirl of his coat, he moved into the bedroom and kicked Hong Ye-seong, who was still wrapped up like a cocoon in the blanket. Kkokko flapped its wings furiously, attacking Lee Sa-young's ankle.\nLeft alone on the floor, Cha Eui-jae hung his head between his knees, which he had propped up with his arms. His face was flushed red.",

      "content": "Chapter 160: The One Hidden in the Gaps\nSeriously, this is driving me crazy.'\nHis fingers twitched involuntarily. His rapidly rising heart rate refused to settle. Thump, thump, thump... It was a completely different kind of tension from facing a monster. Cha Eui-jae was clearly agitated. That lazy voice kept echoing in his ears.\n\"Do you kiss your younger brother?\"\nWould you? Would you do it if you were me?\nHis inner traditional self suddenly resurfaced, pointing a finger at him. Cha Eui-jae agreed with his traditional self.\nYeah. According to all the values I've built up, I can't kiss my brother. But Cha Eui-jae had already shared countless...\n'Damn it...'\n...acts of affection with Lee Sa-young. Even though it was unavoidable, it was still him who kissed first, and just now, it was him who didn't avoid those falling lips and embraced them. He liked the warmth that touched his body. He even welcomed those lips on his face, almost as if he were addicted. A little more...\n'Ugh, get a grip!'\nCha Eui-jae banged the back of his head against the pillar. The sharp pain barely brought him back to his senses.\n'Have I finally gone crazy...'\nHe rubbed the back of his neck and sighed. He still felt the large hand on the nape of his neck. The low laughter, the sly whispering voice. His fingers curled up. The heat that had risen wasn't easily cooling down. Neither was his burning face.\nSpring had arrived, but the evening breeze was still chilly. The cool wind tickled his hair. Somewhere, a cricket chirped. Cha Eui-jae turned his head and blankly stared at the sky. The white hole wasn't visible within the barrier.\n\"You should really think about who I am and what you want from me. Stop denying it to yourself.\"\nWhat exactly is Lee Sa-young? Cha Eui-jae's idea of a brother or sibling was no longer applicable. They had already taken the wrong path and had come too far.\nSo, what path are we on now? What does Cha Eui-jae want from Lee Sa-young?\n'I...'\nBut whenever he tried to think a little deeper, that black tongue that had stirred in his mouth came to mind. Cha Eui-jae rubbed his face dry and pulled at his hair before suddenly standing up. The best way to clear your head is to move your body. Naturally, there was no way to avoid Lee Sa-young's gaze.\nLee Sa-young, who had been poking the increasingly curled-up Hong Ye-seong, tilted his head.\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"...\"\nJust going for a walk, why? Cha Eui-jae held back the words that were about to spill out. In his current state, whatever he said would only get him caught up in Lee Sa-young's web. Lee Sa-young, who had been quietly watching Cha Eui-jae, slightly lifted the corners of his mouth.\n\"Your face is really red.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't answer and quickly turned his head.\n\"Why aren't you answering?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ah... Are you planning not to talk to me anymore? After doing all that?\"\nAlthough his question was sharp, there was a hint of laughter in his voice. Cha Eui-jae ignored the questions and picked up the mask he had taken off. As he hid his face behind the mask, his rapidly beating heart calmed down a bit. Only then could he respond normally.\n\"Shut up.\"\nIn fact, it wasn't even that normal of a response. But, for whatever reason, Lee Sa-young, who normally would've pressed further, let it go, seemingly in a good mood.\n\"Sure. Okay.\"\nAt that moment, Hong Ye-seong, who had evolved from a cocoon to a pill bug, finally regained consciousness and mumbled.\n\"Ugh... Stop hitting me... Crazy bastard...\"\n\"Oh, you're awake?\"\n\"Huh? This... this bratty voice is...\"\nFrom the round cocoon of the blanket, a brown head popped out. Still half-asleep, Hong Ye-seong blinked between Lee Sa-young and Cha Eui-jae before suddenly widening his eyes.\n\"Holy crap, what's this? You're awake? Wait, why am I in the blanket? How long have I been asleep?\"\nOf the three people and one creature present, only Cha Eui-jae knew the cause of Hong Ye-seong's sudden nap. Cha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck and replied nonchalantly.\n\"You fell asleep after drinking the sikhye.\"\n\"Me? Really? A sugar spike? Can hunters get diabetes? Oh right, I still need to tell you what Lee Sa-young ordered!\"\nHong Ye-seong started bustling around as he got up, with Kkokko flapping its wings around his feet. But Lee Sa-young cut him off with a short nod.\n\"It's fine. I already know what needs to be done.\"\n\"Know? How?\"\n\"Well.\"\nA short and clear answer. Hong Ye-seong looked up at Lee Sa-young in a daze, his clear eyes brimming with tears.\n\"So... You're going to leave me behind again? After just using me like this? I'm so bored!\"\n\"Bawk...\"\nKkokko, who had somehow ended up on top of Hong Ye-seong's head, also let out a pitiful cry with added vibrato. It was a double dose of pity. However, Lee Sa-young wasn't one to be easily swayed. He looked at Hong Ye-seong with a crooked expression.\n\"Sorry, but I just woke up after three months, so I need to assess the situation.\"\n\"I'll tell you everything!\"\n\"What would a guy roasting rice crusts on a mountain know about the secular world... right?\"\nIt was a cutting remark. Hong Ye-seong's body trembled. Kkokko wobbled like a roly-poly in response.\n\"I-I'm...\"\n\"Well... I do know what you want, though.\"\nLee Sa-young leaned down slowly and whispered.\n\"I'll remove the signal jammer for you.\"\n\"Go ahead, sir!\"\n\"Bawk!\"\n\"Ack! Sorry, Kkokko!\"\nHong Ye-seong slammed his head onto the floor with a thud. At the same time, Kkokko, who had rolled to the floor, swiftly slapped him with its white wing. Hong Ye-seong's pitiful scream echoed throughout the room.\nLee Sa-young tugged on Cha Eui-jae's arm and whispered.\n\"Let's go while they're distracted fighting.\"\n\"Wait, shouldn't we say goodbye? Isn't it rude not to?\"\n\"The moment we say goodbye, our stay here will be extended by five minutes each time.\"\nNo thanks. They looked at each other and firmly nodded before quickly grabbing their shoes and escaping from Hong Ye-seong's love nest.\nClick, as soon as they stepped out of the barrier, the smell of rain greeted them first. Cha Eui-jae reached out his hand. The soft drizzle dampened his palm. The mountain was already shrouded in darkness. Inside the barrier, it had been dimly evening, but outside, the surroundings were pitch black, likely because of the rain.\n'We're on the mountainside.'\nIt's easy to get lost in the mountains at night. Cha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young beside him.\n\"Seo Min-gi will be waiting at the bottom of the mountain. Let's head down quickly.\"\nLee Sa-young nodded slightly. Cha Eui-jae, whose eyes had already adjusted to the darkness, began to walk, recalling the path he had taken while climbing the mountain. At the same time, he paid attention to the presence following behind him. A voice came from behind.\n\"Did you stick with Seo Min-gi all the time? While I was out.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"What did you do for three months?\"\n\"...Didn't you just look up all the articles?\"\n\"I wanted to hear it from you.\"\n\"Just, you know... the usual stuff. Hunting monsters. Clearing dungeons.\"\n\"And kissing me in between?\"\n\"Hey.\"\nCha Eui-jae snapped as he turned around. Even in the darkness, Lee Sa-young was laughing softly, covering his mouth with his fist. The damp night air filled his lungs. Lee Sa-young's violet eyes shone brightly even in the dark.\n\"Did you wait for me?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae resumed walking. Perhaps the rain had washed away his hesitation, or maybe the feelings that had grown while waiting made it easier to answer.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"...\"\nThe presence following him stopped. Cha Eui-jae also stopped. He waited for Lee Sa-young to close the distance, but Lee Sa-young stood there, as if rooted to the spot.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae turned his head. Lee Sa-young stood still, like he was one with the surrounding darkness. He looked like someone who didn't know where to go, or perhaps like a child who had lost their way. His murky violet eyes darted around, as if seeing something unfamiliar.\n\"...Lee Sa-young?\"\nCha Eui-jae cautiously called out his name. The eyes that had been staring blankly into space turned towards him.\nIs it 'Lee Sa-young' that's surfaced? But the atmosphere hasn't changed. Confused, he took a step closer.\n\"Why are you acting like that all of a sudden?\"\n\"...Hyung.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Will you hold my hand?\"\nIn an instant, the surroundings lit up in a flash of white. Rumble... The sky growled. It seemed like the rain would start pouring in earnest. They had to descend the mountain quickly. But Cha Eui-jae was fixated on the look on Lee Sa-young's face when the light briefly illuminated it. What surfaced there was...\nAnxiety.\nAsking about it would probably yield no answers. There was no time to argue about it here either. Cha Eui-jae extended his hand.\n\"Just until we get down the mountain.\"\n\"...Okay.\"\nA large hand cautiously approached and took his. A firm grip wrapped around his hand without hesitation. Warmth slowly spread from where their skin met. Cha Eui-jae, holding that hand, began to walk slowly.\nLee Sa-young quietly watched Cha Eui-jae's back as he walked ahead. The smell of rain-soaked earth and grass filled his nose and lungs. Rain soaked his head and body. The hand holding his was Cha Eui-jae's. But what Lee Sa-young's violet eyes saw was...\nA white wasteland.\n\"...\"\nOver the ruins of what once stood, a black figure appeared and vanished repeatedly. Memories that were not his own replayed in his mind. They told him Cha Eui-jae was already dead.\nBut Lee Sa-young knew that Cha Eui-jae was alive. He understood that the memory of Cha Eui-jae's death wasn't his own, but an intruder's. Lee Sa-young clung to the warmth of the hand in his grasp. The more he squeezed it, the more warmth returned to him. That was the only clear proof.\nProof that Cha Eui-jae existed.",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Summons\nTwo days later, in the Pado Guild meeting room.\n\"Bwahahahaha!\"\nAmidst the sound of pouring rain, a sharp, ringing laughter echoed through the room. The atmosphere in the meeting room was gloomy, much like the stormy weather outside, but the red-haired woman was pounding the table, laughing hysterically.\n\"Heh, ahahahaha!\"\nStanding at the podium, Bae Won-woo furiously rubbed his face and shouted.\n\"Kang Ji-soo, do you really find this funny right now?\"\n\"Why not! This is hilarious. Oh... I'm so glad I didn't go into that dungeon. I almost missed out on this crazy dopamine content... Huhuhu, ohhh. This is driving me crazy.\"\nKang Ji-soo laughed so hard that she eventually started to cry. Honestly, Bae Won-woo wanted to cry too. Not because it was funny, but because he was genuinely upset. His large, pot lid-sized hand, gripping a rolled-up newspaper like a stick, trembled along with the paper. In the dim corner of the meeting room, Seo Min-gi, who had been standing gloomily, muttered in a dying voice.\n\"I sincerely apologize.\"\n\"This isn't something that can be resolved with just an apology...\"\n\"I've dealt with all the surrounding CCTV footage, but photos taken on personal phones... I mean, I'm just as frustrated.\"\nSeo Min-gi bit down on his handkerchief in frustration.\n\"Why are phone cameras so good at zooming in these days! I've been monitoring the whole time, and I swear there was no sign of anyone.\"\n\"Hahahahah!\"\n\"Stop laughing, damn it!\"\nBae Won-woo roared like a lion, throwing the newspaper. But the laughter wouldn't stop.\nThe first page of the fluttering newspaper fell to the floor, showing a large black-and-white photograph. The photo depicted a man in a black mask, carrying something equally large and black in a princess carry. The quality wasn't great, likely due to extreme zooming, but the black fingers of the man being carried were clearly identifiable. Unfortunately.\nThe headline of the newspaper read...\n[The Secret Relationship Between No. 1 and No. 2]\nWhat an outrageous title!\n\"Lee Sa-youngaaaaa...\"\nBae Won-woo's pitiful wail echoed through the meeting room.\n***\nThe summary of the incident went something like this;\nAs usual, after finishing his early morning and morning workouts, Bae Won-woo was returning to the Pado Guild when he sensed strange murmurs and gazes. They weren't negative; if anything, they were closer to curiosity. What's going on? As he wiped his sweat with a towel and headed toward the building, he had a gut feeling.\n'Whatever it is, there's definitely a problem.'\nJournalists were camped out in front of the building's entrance. Bae Won-woo immediately zipped up his windbreaker, pulled out a hat and mask from his inventory, and slipped into an alleyway using a moonwalk.\nThe series of actions was as natural as breathing. Whether Lee Sa-young was around or not, he was always the one in charge of practical matters and cleanup. Encountering journalists and avoiding them was almost routine.\n'What's happened this time? Did someone cause trouble again?'\nBae Won-woo took out his phone. When he saw the mountain of messages and missed calls, his mouth dropped open. Something was seriously wrong.\nHe quickly logged into a portal site. What was prominently displayed on the main page was a dark, ominous photo.\n'...'\nThe coat of the man held closely by J looked strangely familiar, but he didn't want to admit it. No way. Bae Won-woo skimmed through the article labeled \"Exclusive Report,\" and eventually, he read a single sentence.\n[The man J is holding has been identified as the missing hunter Lee Sa-young...]\nBae Won-woo widened his eyes and zoomed in on the photo as much as possible. The fingers hanging down were jet black, about the length of a knuckle. Damn it, there was no way he could deny it now. Everyone who knew Lee Sa-young was aware that his fingertips were black. Besides, rumors about sightings of Lee Sa-young were already spreading like wildfire on the Hunter channel!\nDamn it all.\nWell, at least up to this point, he could try to remain optimistic. He could just say it wasn't true, and since Lee Sa-young was awake, they could hold a press conference and it would all blow over.\nHowever, as he read the article more carefully, the content seemed odd. It implied that the two had some sort of...\ndeep relationship. Bae Won-woo, trying to calm his troubled mind, checked his messages. But...\nJung Bin: I saw the article. Was this coordinated with the Pado Guild? ^^;\nA text from the former captain, filled with concern, and\nJi-soo: Vice-guild leader, what is this?\nJi-soo: (link)\nJi-soo: Did we agree to this kind of media play?\nJi-soo: Electric stimulation lol wtf\nA message from a guild member that would sting if you looked at it too closely, and\nHoneybee: What are you doing?\nA short but impactful message from his hangover soup partner, and\nSeo Min-gi: I apologize. We're screwed. It seems to be the work of the Fish Market.\nA message of apology from Mingi, the \"Miracle Worker,\" that only made things worse the more he read it.\nThe Fish Market. After reading the last message, Bae Won-woo silently screamed as he dialed a number. Naturally, \"Fish Market\" didn't answer.\nThe Mackerel. The best information broker in South Korea, based in Noryangjin Fish Market.\nIf the Seowon Guild served as a library that gathered all knowledge, the Mackerel bought and sold information to suit its taste. The price of information was other information. Just as fish gather in a fish market, information gathered around the Mackerel. Thanks to the Hunter Civil Service Academy and the Mackerel, Noryangjin experienced a new boom.\nIf the Mackerel was behind this article, it made sense that no one in the Pado Guild, including Bae Won-woo, had heard anything. It must have been done with extreme secrecy.\nHowever, the Pado Guild had also traded information with the Mackerel multiple times. Information was crucial in tracking the distribution routes of Prometheus and narcotics. Bae Won-woo scratched his head.\n'He's not the type to stab a partner in the back like this...'\nTrust was a vital trait for an information broker. What could he have done this for? Bae Won-woo couldn't figure it out.\nAnd thinking about it alone wouldn't bring any answers. He picked up a few newspapers from a street stall and trudged back to the guild through the member-only entrance. As soon as he entered, the guild members approached him with bewildered faces.\n\"For now.\"\nAfter taking a deep breath, Bae Won-woo spoke firmly.\n\"Unplug all the phone lines.\"\nAnd now, back to the present.\nA soft sipping sound could be heard as Kang Ji-soo, who had finally managed to stop laughing, slumped into her chair. Romantic Opener, Choi Go-yo, who had been browsing portal site articles on his laptop, propped up his chin and muttered.\n\"Well... if the Mackerel is involved, denying it would just make things worse. He probably has something he wants, which is why he did this, right?\"\n\"He'd just release more evidence until we admit it. Ugh.\"\n\"There's also a rumor that the Guild Leader's been avoiding outside activities because of this. Some people are saying J put him through brutal training, or that he was buried somewhere and then dug up.\"\n\"Is Lee Sa-young a piece of kimchi? Burying and digging him up?\"\n\"Oh, please... stop making me laugh. Let's see... there's even a theory that the Guild Leader was out of action for three months because he was being disciplined. This is hilarious. Can't we go with this?\"\n\"Sigh...\"\nBae Won-woo, now curled up like a bear, muttered.\n\"Why did they pull this stunt right before the General Assembly? And... what am I supposed to say when I get there?\"\n\"General Assembly?\"\nChoi Go-yo lifted his head. Kang Ji-soo, who had been sipping green tea, responded.\n\"Since the Day of Change, the high-ranking hunters get summoned by the Regional Directors every month, right? That.\"\n\"Can you even call that a meeting? Isn't 'summoning' the right word?\"\n\"Let it go.\"\nBae Won-woo mumbled as he curled up even tighter.\n\"Guys, I just want to go back to the Regional Office.\"\n\"Where do you think you're running off to? You have to clean up this mess before you go.\"\n\"Yeah. And do you even want to go? The salary at the Regional Office is peanuts.\"\n\"It'd be worth it for the peace and quiet.\"\n\"Everyone knows public office grinds people down. What are you talking about? You're possessed.\"\n\"Should we do an exorcism?\"\n\"Probably need one.\"\n\"I just want to work with Captain Jung Bin.\"\n\"No way, no way. Jung Bin doesn't take back traitors. Just get ready for the press conference.\"\nBae Won-woo groaned like a bear. Kang Ji-soo craned her neck to look at the corner of the meeting room. Seo Min-gi was still gnawing furiously on his handkerchief, looking as frustrated as ever.\n\"By the way, what did the Guild Leader say? When is he coming to work?\"\n\"The Guild Leader is still not fully recovered. He said he'll rest a bit longer before coming in.\"\n\"Then what about J? I'm most curious about J's reaction.\"\n\"J...\"\nBehind his sunglasses, his dark, lifeless eyes stared vacantly into space.\n***\nThe thumb scrolled rapidly, making the screen scroll with a repetitive sound. No matter how many times he refreshed, the words on the screen remained unchanged. A deep sigh escaped him.\nRank 2, Lee Sa-young, who had hidden himself away for a long time after the Day of Change, had reappeared after three months. How? In the arms of Rank 1!\nThe public's reaction was explosive. No, it was so intense that it felt like the entire Korean Peninsula was on fire. Right now, it seemed like the only Hunters in South Korea were J and Lee Sa-young.\nTo be honest, ever since J's return, both J and Lee Sa-young had become hot-button topics. The former Rank 1 Hunter and the current Rank 1 Hunter. But then the former Rank 1, who was thought to be dead, came back and snatched the top rank. Lee Sa-young, who had held the top spot for six years, was suddenly pushed down to second place. It was high-stakes, thrilling content that people went crazy over.\nJust as people debate who would win in a fight between a lion and a tiger, they argued over who was stronger between J and Lee Sa-young, who would win if they fought, what their relationship was like, and what might happen if they actually met. People were endlessly curious about the two, and their names were constantly linked online, like legendary rivals.\nBut this time, it wasn't the same.\n—So, why is he being held like a princess? Are they dating?\n'...Alright, I've made up my mind.'\nCha Eui-jae tossed his phone onto the sofa and covered his face with both hands.\n'Let's just break everything~!'",

      "content": "Chapter 162: Summons\nTwo hands, covering the face, began to rub it vigorously. Of course, that wasn't going to bring back his scattered thoughts. Cha Eui-jae, disheveled and frazzled, stared blankly into space. He never realized how wild people's imaginations could be. A single photograph had inflated into countless rumors spreading like wildfire.\nCha Eui-jae recalled a YouTube video he had seen recently with 534 views. The screen was black, with red, yellow, and white text flashing across it. It said that modern people, after experiencing the Day of the Rift and the Day of Change, tend to seek more intense stimulation as a form of escapism— so-called dopamine deficiency. Cha Eui-jae became slightly more serious.\n'Damn... I guess everyone's low on dopamine.'\nWas everyone chasing excitement because they were exhausted from their harsh lives? Even if that were the case, could this really be acceptable? Do the media these days have no sense of ethics?\n'What was Seo Min-gi doing?'\nHis frustration sparked against Seo Min-gi, his go-to problem solver. But being the thorough workaholic he was, Seo Min-gi had already dug himself an escape route. Cha Eui-jae picked up his phone and reread the message.\nSeo Min-gi: Just for your information, I've cleaned up all the nearby CCTV footage. There was no sign of anyone around until you both got into the van. Seems like the work of an informant.\nThis message had arrived even before Cha Eui-jae could ask for an explanation. Summed up in a single line, it meant;\nNot my fault.\nCha Eui-jae responded with a text, wearing an annoyed expression.\n[Yes, understood. Please gather and deliver any information related to the informant. Thank you.]\nBut what he really meant was;\nGive me some dirt on whoever the hell it is so I can crush them. Thanks.\nCha Eui-jae trudged over to the floor-to-ceiling windows that lined one wall. As he roughly tidied his tousled hair in the reflection, the article's comment section kept floating through his mind.\nJ beat him up, locked him away somewhere, put him in his place, sorted out the hierarchy, fought for three months— those sensationalist claims were relatively mild. The real problem was...\n—The phrase 'intimate relationship' is risky.\n—So, did they have a lover's quarrel and J won?\nThese reactions.\nCompared to the majority, these were just a few, and probably meant as jokes.\nHe knew. It was all nonsense. Cha Eui-jae knew it. He just had to ignore it. Normally, he would have already scoffed and brushed it off. Everyone's speculations were entirely wrong, and the reality was much harsher. I mean, Lee Sa-young split into two after sleeping for three months!\nEven so, Cha Eui-jae couldn't shake the unease. And with good reason.\n'Dammit...'\nThere was just too much hitting close to home to laugh it off...\nCha Eui-jae took out a cigarette and placed it between his lips. It was someone else's house, and indoors, so he didn't light it. He just fiddled with the unlit cigarette, chewing it out of frustration.\nAnyway, throughout his life, he had seen countless articles discussing J, but this was the first time he had encountered one that attacked his psyche so deeply. Cha Eui-jae frowned as he stared at the photo saved in his gallery. The background was familiar. It was near the West Sea Rift Memorial. The photo was taken in the brief moment while he carried a tear-stained, sleeping Lee Sa-young to the van.\n'It's definitely strange.'\nEven if Cha Eui-jae had been preoccupied with Lee Sa-young, there was no way he wouldn't have noticed a camera or a person's presence. How on earth was this photo taken? Maybe it was the informant's ability. Cha Eui-jae looked at his hands, which had been tightly holding Lee Sa-young's back and arms, and sighed.\n'...Should I have just carried him like a sack?'\nIt was a belated regret. But even that regret quickly dissipated. He couldn't have just slung a kid over his shoulder, especially one who was crying so much, like a broken faucet, even in his sleep. The kid was crying.\nJust as Eui-jae sighed again, he sensed a presence behind him.\n\"...What are you doing?\"\nA soft voice, slightly hoarse, accompanied by the gentle touch of hair brushing against the back of his neck. The smell of dandelions wafted in. The hand that wrapped around his waist felt perfectly natural. Cha Eui-jae quickly turned off the phone screen and replied.\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"What were you looking at just now...\"\n\"Nothing important.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at the reflection in the window. Lee Sa-young, looking like a well-fed lion, leaned his chin on Cha Eui-jae's shoulder, slowly blinking his drowsy eyes. A black-tipped hand reached out and gently grasped the cigarette between Cha Eui-jae's lips.\n\"A cigarette? And you didn't even light it...\"\nThe tip of the cigarette began to char and dissolve. The scent of dandelions grew stronger. In a languid tone, Lee Sa-young whispered.\n\"Do you smoke?\"\nCha Eui-jae awkwardly straightened his back.\n\"Yeah, kind of.\"\n\"Since when?\"\n\"Not too long ago...\"\nJust before the cigarette dissolved down to the filter in his mouth, a thumb and forefinger slipped in, gently brushing against his lips. As Cha Eui-jae winced, a low chuckle reached his ears. The fingers briefly touched his tongue before pulling away. The cigarette, freed from his lips, quickly melted into a black liquid in Lee Sa-young's hand. After brushing off his hand, Lee Sa-young murmured softly.\n\"Quit. You need to live long.\"\nThe hand that had been wrapped around his waist slid away. Lee Sa-young yawned deeply and walked toward the bathroom. Cha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck unnecessarily and rolled his eyes. A system message popped up, stating that Basilisk's venom had been activated, but he dismissed it with a wave of his hand. He was standing in the living room of Lee Sa-young's home on the top floor of the Pado Guild headquarters.\nTwo days ago, Lee Sa-young began to break out in a cold sweat as they reached the mountainside, and as soon as they descended, he collapsed as if fainting. Naturally, not only Cha Eui-jae but also Seo Min-gi, who had been waiting in the car, were both thrown into a panic.\nThey debated whether to take Lee Sa-young to Nam Woo-jin or to go back up the mountain. After all, he had already been asleep for three months.\nBut throughout the discussion, Seo Min-gi kept glancing at Cha Eui-jae. To the point where Cha Eui-jae, unable to hold back, spoke up first.\n\"Why do you keep looking at me like that? Do you have something to say?\"\n\"Oh, I was just wondering if you could give me a warning if you're going to explode.\"\n\"Explode?\"\n\"Don't you remember? You swung me around like a rag doll. Physically, I mean.\"\n\"...\"\nIt must have been a story from the Day of Change. Cha Eui-jae didn't remember it, but it seemed the victim, Seo Min-gi, remembered that day vividly. Cha Eui-jae awkwardly stroked Lee Sa-young's cheek.\n\"I won't do that anymore...\"\nIt wasn't a particularly convincing statement. Seo Min-gi also responded with a dubious tone.\n\"Well... I'll take your word for it.\"\nHe didn't sound convinced at all.\nOnly after Seo Min-gi hid in the shadows a couple of times, and Cha Eui-jae pinched Lee Sa-young's cheeks about five times, did they finally conclude their heated discussion. The decision was to go back up the mountain. Just as Eui-jae was fumbling around, preparing to carry Lee Sa-young on his back, a strong hand grabbed his arm.\n\"...Let's go home.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Stop spouting nonsense...\"\nLee Sa-young had somehow opened his eyes.\nGlaring at Cha Eui-jae as if he were about to devour him, Lee Sa-young spat out each word.\n\"I'm just exhausted... Stop messing around... Let's just go home.\"\nWas that his last bit of strength? As soon as he finished speaking, Lee Sa-young fainted again, his expression twisted into a deep frown. It was probably all the strength he had left.\nCha Eui-jae awkwardly smoothed out the furrowed brow of the unconscious Lee Sa-young and gave Seo Min-gi a signal with his eyes.\nAnd so, they took Lee Sa-young back home...\nSince then, Cha Eui-jae hadn't been able to leave the house. For two days.\n\"...\"\nHow did it come to this? Cha Eui-jae retraced his memories. It's not like he hadn't tried to escape the house. But whenever he tried to sneak out, Lee Sa-young would always find him like a ghost.\nCha Eui-jae glanced at the bathroom before putting on his mask. He was just about to tiptoe to the front door and grab the doorknob when it happened.\n\"Hyung.\"\nA voice came from beyond the door. Just like now.\n'Fuck, does he have a radar or something?'\nCha Eui-jae slightly removed his mask and responded.\n\"Y-Yeah?\"\n\"Since Bae Won-woo is coming over, keep your mask on.\"\n\"W-Why is Bae Won-woo coming? For what?\"\n\"Isn't it obvious? Something must have happened.\"\nWas he drying his hair? There was the sound of a towel rustling against wet hair. At that moment, Cha Eui-jae's instincts started working against his will. Something that would bring Bae Won-woo directly to the house. What flashed through his mind... was the article headline.\n[The Secret Relationship Between No. 1 and No. 2]\nCha Eui-jae adjusted his mask. Alright, I'll make my escape now. I'll hide out in a dungeon until things calm down. With that decision, Cha Eui-jae flung open the door. And he found himself face-to-face with a figure blocking the door like a bear.\n\"...\"\n'Shit.'\nIt was Bae Won-woo, who had grown gaunt since they last met. He looked around like a zombie, then smiled viciously when he saw J.\n\"Uhhh...? Oh, J!\"\n'Fuck.'\n\"You sensed I was coming and opened the door for me, huh? I didn't even ring the bell. Wow, I can't compete with that. Sa-young's inside, right?\"\n'No.'\nThe sound of wet footsteps approached from behind. Lee Sa-young was walking up, tying the belt of his bathrobe. He stood right behind Cha Eui-jae, raising an eyebrow.\n\"What... You're here already? How long has it even been since I called?\"\n\"I had no choice. This is a bit urgent.\"\nThe scent of dandelions mixed with a fragrant aroma filled the air. Lee Sa-young draped his arm over Cha Eui-jae's shoulder, pulling him close. Why did that arm feel like a shackle today?\nBae Won-woo was holding a newspaper. Even at a glance, the words \"No. 1\" and \"No. 2\" were visible. Bae Won-woo, still smiling amiably, stepped into the entryway.\n\"Oh, right. J, you heard the news from Seo Min-gi, right?\"\nBefore Cha Eui-jae could respond, Lee Sa-young cut in.\n\"What news?\"\n\"Oh... It's nothing much. Just that a picture of J carrying you bridal-style made it into the news.\"\n\"...What?\"\nNarrowing his eyes, Lee Sa-young took the newspaper from him. Cha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young. As his violet eyes scanned the newspaper, his freshly showered, flushed lips curled into a neat smile. The violet eyes followed suit, narrowing into thin lines.\n\"Hmm...\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young's still-damp toes lightly tapped Cha Eui-jae's heel. Cha Eui-jae flinched. Their protruding ankle bones brushed against each other. A voice full of amusement murmured.\n\"I didn't know you carried me like that?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 163: Summons\nEven if I don't know who took the photo, I'll definitely deal with them. Cha Eui-jae forced himself to suppress his writhing urge for destruction and subtly moved his foot aside. He ignored the snicker he heard next to him.\n\"Sa-young, J goes out of their way to carry you so carefully, you should at least say thank you.\"\n'Please, just be quiet.'\nCha Eui-jae clenched his teeth. Bae Won-woo's well-meaning but useless support fire, doubling as a lesson in manners, was pointless. He caught a glimpse of a slightly higher raised corner of the lips and resigned himself. There was no place left to escape.\nRustle, rustle, the sound of a newspaper being flipped echoed clearly. Just as he thought he heard a brief chuckle, an arm wrapped around his shoulder, bringing a sweet scent closer. Lee Sa-young whispered teasingly.\n\"...Thanks?\"\n'Is that the voice of someone who's grateful?'\nBut Bae Won-woo, acting as though he were Lee Sa-young's father, awkwardly chuckled.\n\"Oh dear, sorry about that. Sa-young isn't great at expressing it, but he's a good person.\"\n\"Ah, sure.\"\n\"Not many people are as good as him...\"\nHad the dictionary definition of \"good\" changed while he was trapped in the Rift? Just as Cha Eui-jae was at a loss for words, Bae Won-woo rubbed his arm. Lee Sa-young, who had been leaning crookedly against Cha Eui-jae, squinted his eyes.\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\"Huh? No... I'm fine, but lately, it's been oddly aching. I asked the doctor, but they said nothing's wrong with my bones or muscles.\"\nBae Won-woo tapped his forearm and shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Maybe I should go get some acupuncture at a clinic. Anyway, it's good that you're up. There's a lot more you need to hear besides what I just said. The General Assembly is coming up. It would've been quite a headache if I had to attend in your place again.\"\nLee Sa-young slightly furrowed his brows.\n\"General Assembly? What's that?\"\n\"Oh! You don't know at all. Well, it was formed only two months ago. Where do I even begin...\"\n\"First.\"\nLee Sa-young jerked his chin toward the hallway.\n\"Let's talk inside. This might take a while.\"\nA short while later, they were seated in the desolate living room. Lee Sa-young had changed out of his bathrobe into comfortable casual wear. Lee Sa-young and Cha Eui-jae took the long sofa, while Bae Won-woo occupied the single armchair. Bae Won-woo pointed to the large window.\n\"You saw what the outside looks like, right? Do you know what's going on?\"\nLee Sa-young answered indifferently.\n\"I have a rough idea.\"\n\"Then I'll get straight to the point. After the Day of Change, Director Ham Seok-jeong summoned the hunters. Given that we experienced the Day of the Rift, the social atmosphere was, you know, a bit tense? To handle that and all. Most of the representatives of mid-to-large guilds gathered.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nLee Sa-young twisted his lips into a smile.\n\"Of course, they would. What about him?\"\nA black finger pointed at Cha Eui-jae. He leaned back against the sofa, arms crossed. Seeing Lee Sa-young's expectant look, he answered slowly.\n\"Bae Won-woo told me about it, but I didn't go.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Well, nothing much... I didn't think there'd be anything for me to do.\"\nIn truth, it was because meeting Ham Seok-jeong or Song Jo-heon was awkward, but Cha Eui-jae mumbled his words. If he met them, the past would inevitably come up. They lived in the past, just like he did.\nHe wasn't ready to face the past yet. Probably not until he found the remains. Until he fulfilled his responsibilities, he wouldn't be ready.\n\"...\"\nAt that moment, a large hand suddenly landed on his head, ruffling it as if to pat him. Cha Eui-jae instinctively slapped the hand away.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Oh, you're fine.\"\nIt was a nonchalant voice. Lee Sa-young, as if he had never ruffled his hair, was muttering while scrolling through a tablet screen.\n\"What's the point of the General Assembly without the first or second-ranked?\"\nIt was an arrogant statement. Bae Won-woo smiled bitterly.\n\"Until now, I've been attending as your proxy. The heads of most of the major guilds attend personally.\"\n\"Good job. So?\"\n\"Anyway, at the first meeting, there was a suggestion to gather regularly in the future. To pool our strength. In short, it's a meeting where hunters gather and discuss various things. Usually, those within the top 100 attend.\"\n\"It's unusual for them to gather so well.\"\nA place where sensitive hunters gather. It's natural to think of the Artisan Exhibition.\n'Can they even be gathered?'\nCha Eui-jae had witnessed firsthand the disaster that unfolded when the super hamsters were gathered in one place. Unable to suppress his rising doubts, he blurted out,\n\"Does it... actually work? The meeting?\"\n\"Ah, that's the surprising part. They at least pretend to be polite. Maybe it's because Jung Bin and the director are firmly holding the reins? It actually runs pretty smoothly.\"\nBut why did the Artisan Exhibition end up like that, even with Jung Bin there? The resentment of being caught in the vortex of chaos welled up inside him. Lee Sa-young, who had been quietly listening, crossed his legs.\n\"I'll attend the next General Assembly myself. I'm curious about the atmosphere.\"\n\"Oh, really? Then I'll confirm that. But before that...\"\nBae Won-woo's face darkened. The newspaper in his hand crumpled mercilessly. Cha Eui-jae's face also crumpled, but thanks to his mask, it wasn't visible. Bae Won-woo hesitated.\n\"I think we should deal with this... first.\"\n\"Then let's deal with it.\"\nA slippered foot tapped the ground.\n\"If someone took a picture without even J noticing... the only one capable of that is Mackerel.\"\n\"What's their ability?\"\n\"Oh, you'll know if you experience it firsthand. It's pretty funny...\"\nLee Sa-young's lips curled into a smirk. The faces of the hunters he had met so far flashed before his eyes. From his distant hunter days to his time working part-time at the hangover soup restaurant, to now, something Cha Eui-jae had felt keenly was this; Most hunters aren't in their right mind. Including Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae asked with a feigned seriousness.\n\"Are they crazy?\"\n\"Mm, not quite crazy... more like a funny guy? It's a kind of protest, you see. Doing it just to get my attention.\"\nLee Sa-young neatly folded the newspaper.\n\"After being out of contact for three months, I suppose they were curious about what I was up to. I did ask them for some information.\"\n\"So, are you going to meet them yourself? Should I prepare the car?\"\n\"No... with J.\"\n\"Me?\"\nCha Eui-jae looked up. Lee Sa-young, who was resting his chin on his hand, smiled brightly.\n\"Don't you want to see the face of the bastard who published this article?\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you're the J I know, you probably do.\"\n'Damn it.'\nCha Eui-jae began to understand why Seo Min-gi had slammed the steering wheel in anger. It must've felt like having all his thoughts read. But strangely, he didn't feel angry. Rather...\n'...Am I pleased?'\nIn a sudden moment of realization, Cha Eui-jae blankly stared at the ceiling. Pleased? Why? Since Lee Sa-young woke up, his head often failed to keep up with his heart. Strangely so.\nA voice tinged with amusement cut through his daze.\n\"Right... and get me the suit and gas mask.\"\n***\nMaybe it was because it was a weekday afternoon, but the fish market was relatively quiet. The fishy smell of the sea tickled his nose, even through the gas mask. Unfortunately, with his heightened senses, he could feel people's gazes gathering on him. Where? On him.\nWith his hands shoved into the pockets of his suit pants, he stared at the tightly packed stalls, section by section.\nHis breath hissed through the gas mask, the sound harsh.\n'Guess I do look strange...'\nStanding in the middle of the fish market, wearing a suit and a gas mask, he was bound to draw attention. Cha Eui-jae ground his teeth. The employee ID around his neck glinted in the light.\nEarlier, while he was still out of it, Lee Sa-young had handed him the suit, a black wig, and the gas mask that Seo Min-gi had brought up, and shoved him into the bathroom. The combination of items felt ominous. Anyone could tell that it would bring back the nightmare of the Artisan's Exhibition! Cha Eui-jae shouted toward the closed bathroom door.\n\"What is this?!\"\n\"You're not planning to go with the J mask, are you?\"\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\"Have you heard of Noryangjin Fish Market...?\"\nDamn it. The fact that the hunter's name was \"Mackerel\" was already suspicious. As he fumbled to change into the suit, Cha Eui-jae listened to the background story. Mackerel was an information dealer who had set up shop in the fish market at some point, and his information was pretty good. He had even been quite helpful in dealing with some drug-related issues...\n\"He probably wants you to come along since he dragged me into it, too.\"\n\"Is he a twisted pretzel? Why can't he just say that?\"\nA snicker came from the other side of the door. Cha Eui-jae stared at his reflection in the mirror, his face twisted in frustration as he donned the wig. The faded hair was now covered in black. His scowling face disappeared behind the gas mask. He stared at the masked figure in the mirror and made a decision.\nHe was going to slice that mackerel to pieces.\nOf course, it seemed it would take a while for that wish to come true. His unease about the strange outfit quickly faded, as the friendliness of the vendors couldn't be blocked by something like a gas mask. A few of them subtly approached the silent, statue-like Cha Eui-jae and whispered.\n\"A hunter, huh? What are you here to buy?\"\n\"...\"\n\"We got some fresh flounder in today, big and lively.\"\n\"Abalone's cheap these days. The roe's nice and thick too.\"\n\"You like squid?\"\n\"...\"\nBut none of their words reached Cha Eui-jae's ears. He was too busy seething with betrayal. After acting like he was going to stick around, Lee Sa-young had, upon arrival, checked some message, grabbed Cha Eui-jae by the shoulder, and whispered,\n\"Wait here.\"\nThen he disappeared. After leaving behind just one sentence! What am I, a dog waiting for his master? Couldn't he at least explain the situation?\n'Does he think just saying 'wait' makes everything okay?'\nCha Eui-jae's stubborn contrarian instinct, reserved for Lee Sa-young, started to rise. Maybe he should just wander off somewhere.\nJust then, someone broke through both the crowd and Cha Eui-jae's personal space, suddenly appearing right in front of him. Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened. It was a middle-aged woman wearing a bright blue vinyl apron. Her eyes widened as she took him in, and then she burst out laughing.\n\"I wondered which rookie was standing around like a statue, and it turns out you're from the Pado Guild! It's your first time, isn't it?\"\n\"Oh, Pado Guild, huh?\"\n\"Can't you tell from the gas mask? They're the only ones who'd come dressed like this.\"\n\"I thought so. You never know these days, with all the weirdos around.\"\n\"Man, I thought I was going to make some sales. Guess I'll have to pass them over to Misu-gi.\"\nThe vendors clicked their tongues and dispersed like sand. Soon, the noise died down, and only the middle-aged woman and Cha Eui-jae were left in the path. The woman clapped her gloved hands together.\n\"Well, shall we get going?\"\n\"Uh, where to?\"\n\"Where else?\"\nThe middle-aged woman grinned.\n\"You came to meet Mackerel, didn't you?\"\n\"...\"\nCome to think of it, nestled among her curly perm was a dark blue in-ear communication device. She winked at him.\n\"I'm the Pado Guild's designated guide, so follow me. If you keep standing here, the small fry will keep pestering you, and it'll be a hassle.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 164: Summons\nThe woman smiled broadly, her lips curling up in a playful grin.\n\"Oh dear, look at me, forgetting to introduce myself. My name is Jang Mi-sook. You can call me 'Aunt,' but I wouldn't mind if you called me 'Noona' either.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hoho! Was that too forward?\"\nCha Eui-jae slightly opened his mouth, then, without realizing it, raised his hand to check the gas mask. He was glad his face was hidden. He bit down on his lip. As soon as he heard the word \"Aunt,\" he felt like the ground had just dropped out from under him.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae found himself studying Jang Mi-sook's face. Her perfectly normal hands too. Of course, the woman in front of him bore no resemblance to his aunt. That's how it should be.\n\"Come on, let's get going. He's waiting. Honestly, he's got no patience, not even a speck of it...\"\nGrumbling, Jang Mi-sook turned and began walking. Cha Eui-jae was about to follow her as if in a trance, but his feet suddenly stopped. His face scrunched up behind the gas mask. The thing that was holding his feet in place was none other than the thought of the repercussions if he disobeyed Lee Sa-young's orders.\nIt wasn't that he was afraid of Lee Sa-young, not at all. It's just...\n'Isn't he going to give me an earful for acting on my own again...'\nSo hard to placate a sulking Lee Sa-young!\nThe thought of having to spend a long time soothing him was daunting. He could already hear Sa-young's sarcastic voice in his head...\n'Oh, really...? And then?'\n'Ah... is that so?'\n'Well done... You know that's not a compliment, right?'\nDamn it. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth.\n'This is like being shackled.'\nIf anyone had tried to put a shackle on him, they'd succeeded. The usually impulsive Cha Eui-jae was now actually thinking. He scuffed the ground with the sole of his shoe, continuing to think.\nIt's better to stay put than to wander around somewhere unfamiliar. After all, the only thing he knew about this fish market was that somewhere in it was a man called Mackerel. The information gap was just too big.\nIn truth, he wasn't thrilled about following Lee Sa-young's orders. Even so, one thing was clear. Now, he had people to call on for help even if he didn't act on his own. People like Lee Sa-young or Seo Min-gi. He had the belief that even if he did nothing, they would help him.\n\"...\"\nJang Mi-sook, who was walking ahead, turned around with a puzzled look.\n\"What are you doing, just standing there? Let's get going.\"\n\"Well...\"\nCha Eui-jae cleared his throat before speaking haltingly.\n\"The Guild Leader... told me to wait here.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Sorry.\"\nLaughter burst out from in front of him. Jang Mi-sook was laughing so hard that her voice echoed throughout the fish market. She wiped the tears from her eyes after a long bout of laughter.\n\"Oh my, I haven't heard something like that in ages. You must be a newbie?\"\n\"...\"\nIs that really something to laugh about? Before he could process his confusion, his phone buzzed. Jang Mi-sook pointed at it with a nod.\n\"Why don't you check? I bet you've got a message.\"\nCha Eui-jae took out his phone from his jacket pocket and turned it on. Just as she said, there was a message waiting for him. Actually, it wasn't just one.\nThe sender was...\nSa-young: It'll take a bit.\nSa-young: You can follow someone named Jang Mi-sook.\nSa-young: I'll be there soon.\nLee Sa-young.\nCha Eui-jae hesitated for a moment before his fingers moved to send a reply.\n[Got it.]\nBeep. Sent. The moment he slipped his phone back into his pocket.\n\"Still, I like that you're cautious. Trust is an important virtue, especially in these chaotic times.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Staying put was the right call too. Up to this point is the safe zone.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"You'll see.\"\nJang Mi-sook smiled warmly, as if asking if he trusted her now. She shook her head slightly, pointing to her in-ear communication device.\n\"Ah, anyway, let's get going. He's been nagging me to hurry.\"\nThe fish market was a dungeon.\nNot a metaphor— a literal dungeon. Behind his gas mask, Cha Eui-jae's vividly blue eyes scanned the area. With each step he took, the surroundings were reconfiguring themselves.\nA shop that sold live fish would turn into a stall selling freshly fried tempura, and then into another selling shellfish. He tried to find a pattern, but there wasn't one. It seemed to change according to the whims of the place's master. With every step, there was a creaking sound, like cubes turning and fitting into place, enough to make him feel dizzy.\nThis place was a living labyrinth.\n\"You're not that surprised, huh? Most people faint when they see this for the first time.\"\n\"Ah... no, I was surprised.\"\nCha Eui-jae mechanically responded, and Jang Mi-sook burst into laughter.\n\"You're terrible at lying!\"\n\"...\"\nAm I really that bad at lying? Cha Eui-jae pouted slightly. Jang Mi-sook pointed to the side street that was changing in real-time.\n\"Want to know something fun? There's even a lost-and-found center here.\"\n\"A lost-and-found center? ...Really?\"\n\"Of course! Rookies who don't know anything waltz in here thinking they can buy and sell information, but then they get lost. It happens dozens of times a day.\"\nJang Mi-sook, familiar with the scene, moved expertly through the tangled paths. Without a guide, you'd inevitably get lost. Now he understood why Lee Sa-young had warned him to stay put. If he'd wandered around by himself, he might have ended up at that lost-and-found. Ugh, what a nightmare.\n'Good thing I followed orders.'\nCha Eui-jae changed the subject out of nowhere.\n\"So what should first-timers do?\"\n\"You need to check in first! Then you wait until you're assigned a guide.\"\n\"...I guess not just anyone gets assigned.\"\nCha Eui-jae looked around. In the ever-changing scenery, the shopkeepers were calmly doing their work, but their eyes were sharp. The eyes of merchants.\n\"You're quick to catch on. That's right. This place runs on information. Only those deemed to have valuable information get assigned a guide. Guilds get assigned guides on a guild-wide basis. That's why you're unique. You should've looked for me as soon as you arrived.\"\n\"...I didn't hear anything about that.\"\n\"Hohoho, thanks to that, I had some fun.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae asked reluctantly.\n\"Are all the shopkeepers awakened?\"\n\"Some are, some aren't.\"\n\"How do you ensure the safety of those who aren't?\"\n\"Safety?\"\nJang Mi-sook glanced back at him, then burst out laughing again. By now, her hearty laughter had become so familiar that it would feel strange without it.\n\"Oh, don't worry! This place is safer than most.\"\n\"...\"\n\"We're here.\"\nShe stopped in front of a shop that looked much like the others he'd seen. Tanks with water constantly circulating, fish swimming inside, the salty and fishy smells of the sea.\nThe sign hanging from the ceiling flickered. On the white sign, the words \"Jangmi Fisheries\" were written in pink letters.\n\"...Oh, you're here.\"\nA gloomy voice echoed. Cha Eui-jae looked for the source of the voice. A young man with shaggy hair was hunching over, washing a knife. There was a dark aura around him, as if it was swirling only in his vicinity. He was dressed in a colorful outfit; a bright blue vinyl apron, red boots, and pink rubber gloves. It was hard to see his face because of his long bangs.\nJang Mi-sook patted Cha Eui-jae's back.\n\"This is my son. Say hello.\"\n\"What? Ah, hello.\"\nHer son silently nodded his head. Jang Mi-sook chuckled.\n\"He's a bit shy... Come on in and sit down. Son! Slice up some flatfish for us.\"\n\"Okay...\"\nHer son put down the knife, picked up a net, and walked over to the tank in an awkward shuffle. Cha Eui-jae shook his head.\n\"No need for the sashimi...\"\n\"It's customary to have a bite when you come here. Now, get inside!\"\nBefore he knew it, Cha Eui-jae was sitting neatly on a cushion. Jang Mi-sook's hands moved with incredible speed as she pushed him into the room, wiped the table, set the utensils, placed the water bottle, cups, and wet wipes. Of course, Cha Eui-jae could match her speed, but...\n'Is she awakened?' His eyes followed each of her movements closely. He was planning to use it for his part-time job at the hangover soup restaurant. But soon his gaze stopped.\n'...I probably won't be going back to the restaurant anymore.'\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly at the side dishes being placed in front of him. He missed the hangover soup restaurant's dim lighting and the automatic pet feeder— no, the automatic kimchi and side dish self-serve station—more than ever.\n'I hope everyone's doing well...'\nHe never thought he'd miss those regular customers who were like enemies to him. Where were they eating now? Were they all starving? Even though his time as a hunter was much longer than his time as a part-timer, he couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia.\n\"Here's the flatfish sashimi!\"\nA white plate suddenly appeared in his dazed vision. It was piled high with pure white, bouncy sashimi. Damn, it looked delicious. Cha Eui-jae snapped out of his daze. Jang Mi-sook smiled brightly.\n\"I'll close the door for you so you can take off your mask and enjoy it.\"\nAs expected of a guild guide from Pado. She was considerate. Slide. The door closed. Cha Eui-jae looked up. This room was a sealed space. However, there was a man sitting across from him. Jang Mi-sook's son.\nThe dark blue hair that obscured his face was a deep indigo.\n\"...\"\nWithout a hint of surprise, Cha Eui-jae unwrapped and snapped apart a pair of wooden chopsticks. The sound of them breaking was crisp and clear. And then,\nSwoosh—!!\nWithout a hint of shock, he caught something flying toward his face with the chopsticks. Cha Eui-jae frowned and checked what he'd caught. It was a stiff business card.\n[Noryangjin Fish Market]\n[Mackerel]\nCha Eui-jae read the card's contents and sighed. He crumpled the card in his fist, his previously upright posture naturally slouching.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You know who I am, don't you?\"\n\"...\"\nThe indigo-haired head nodded slightly up and down. Of course, he would. Cha Eui-jae threw the crumpled card straight at the head.\n\"What the hell are you doing throwing stuff at the table?!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 165: Summons\nThud!\nDespite being a bundle of papers, the sound was as dull as being hit by a baseball. The young man, as if struck by electricity, trembled and crouched on the floor, clutching his head. Cha Eui-jae pointed a finger at the cowering youth.\n\"These days, hunters are all style and no substance, huh?\"\nThe next moment, he jumped to his feet and punched the wall. Bang—! A hiccup was heard amidst the explosive sound. Just beside the spot where he had punched, another navy-blue head slid out from the wall. The youth emerging from the wall also collapsed to the floor.\nCha Eui-jae withdrew his fist and looked back and forth between the man collapsed at his feet and the other man still writhing on the floor, clutching his head.\nTheir hair color, body shape, and even their faces, at a glance, were strikingly similar. So much so that one might suspect they were the same person. Cha Eui-jae squinted his eyes.\n\"...What the hell is this?\"\n\"Aaahhh...\"\n\"Is everything okay in there?\"\nJang Mi-sook called out in a loud voice. The crouched youth and Cha Eui-jae both looked up simultaneously. Cha Eui-jae grabbed the youth by the scruff of his neck and gestured with his chin towards the door, signaling him to answer wisely. The youth nodded repeatedly and replied.\n\"Everything's fine.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes, it's okay. Don't worry about it.\"\nJang Mi-sook's footsteps gradually faded. Cha Eui-jae let go of the neck he had been gripping. The youth rubbed his neck, where a bruise was already beginning to form, and grumbled.\n\"All the info was wrong. They said you were kind and gentle, but you threw punches without warning.\"\n\"Who told you to hide in the wall like a rat?\"\n\"I didn't expect you to attack right away.\"\n\"That wasn't an attack; it was a takedown. How was I supposed to know if you were an enemy or not?\"\n\"That makes sense.\"\n\"I had to eliminate the potential threat.\"\n\"You're making too much sense; it leaves me with nothing to say.\"\nThe youth approached the other young man still curled up on the floor and crouched in front of him. Side by side, they looked even more identical. The first thought that came to Cha Eui-jae's mind was...\n'Clones?'\nThat was it. Maybe it was because he had seen so many strange things in his life. Cha Eui-jae directed a question at them.\n\"So, which one of you is the Mackerel?\"\n\"Which one?\"\nThe crouched youth struggled to his feet. As the other youth, who had been chattering away, brushed his long bangs aside, a handsome face was revealed. His navy-blue eyes, matching his hair color, sparkled with amusement.\n\"We're both the Mackerel.\"\nAfter the situation had settled, Cha Eui-jae and the two claiming to be the Mackerel sat across a table from each other.\nIt felt oddly unsettling to see two identical faces sitting side by side. The Mackerel who had been hit by the business card still radiated a gloomy atmosphere as he crouched, while the other Mackerel, whose neck had been grabbed, casually held a soju bottle in one hand and a cider bottle in the other, weighing his options.\n\"What would you like? Soju? Cider?\"\n\"Cider.\"\n\"Sure thing.\"\nThe Mackerel who had poured the cider with both hands pushed the glass toward Cha Eui-jae with a bright smile.\n\"Have a drink, and try some sashimi. My hyung's really good at slicing fish.\"\nThe word \"hyung\" caught Cha Eui-jae's attention. He picked up his chopsticks and asked.\n\"Are you two brothers?\"\n\"We're identical twins. Don't we look exactly alike? It's like looking in a mirror all the time.\"\n\"...\"\nThe gloomy Mackerel nodded silently. Though his long hair covered his face, his body shape and the glimpses of his face showed they did resemble each other quite a bit. The talkative Mackerel drew two human shapes in the air.\n\"Well, to introduce ourselves briefly... We're the Mackerels. We're information brokers. I handle all the business and customer interactions. My hyung is shy, so he works from behind the scenes. When people talk about the Mackerel, they're talking about me. Most don't even know there are two of us.\"\n\"For someone so shy, he's sitting here just fine.\"\n\"Well...\"\nThe younger Mackerel draped his arm around his brother's shoulder and pushed him towards Cha Eui-jae. The elder Mackerel's navy-blue eyes, large and round, peeked out between his disheveled bangs before he jerked back, trembling. The younger Mackerel chuckled.\n\"We're fans of J. Especially my hyung.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThe older Mackerel fumbled to pull out a pair of horn-rimmed glasses and put them on. The younger Mackerel pouted.\n\"But you threw a business card at a fan. And you got violent.\"\n\"Hey, who threw it first?\"\n\"Old fart.\"\nAt this point, Cha Eui-jae was dumbfounded. The nerve of this guy! Cha Eui-jae had simply returned the favor to the disrespectful brat who had thrown something at his face during dinner. The younger Mackerel waved his hand, and the hole Cha Eui-jae had punched in the wall was replaced by a new one, as if the shop itself had changed.\nThat must have been his awakened ability. Calming his anger, Cha Eui-jae asked.\n\"Are you both awakened?\"\nThe two Mackerels exchanged glances. The younger Mackerel scratched the back of his head, looking troubled.\n\"Wow... You really came without knowing anything. This is new. Did Lee Sa-young tell you nothing?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"No rules or anything?\"\n\"Nope.\"\nThe Mackerels started whispering to each other. Judging by Jang Mi-sook's reaction and the younger Mackerel's response, it seemed Cha Eui-jae had come here without knowing something that was apparently obvious. Did Lee Sa-young intentionally keep him in the dark?\n'...It's scary to think Lee Sa-young might have done this on purpose.'\nCha Eui-jae glanced around anxiously. In movies, isn't this the point where you're supposed to deny it, saying that he wouldn't do such a thing? But knowing Lee Sa-young, it wasn't out of the question. Lee Sa-young was always full of secrets, more so than Cha Eui-jae. It was infuriating. He could even guess the kind of excuse Lee Sa-young might use.\n'You're not going to be with me all the time, right?'\n'I'll explain everything when the time comes.'\n'Don't you trust me...'\nDamn it. Cha Eui-jae clenched his teeth. I know Lee Sa-young too well!\nAs Cha Eui-jae seethed over Lee Sa-young's infuriating attitude, the Mackerels were still whispering among themselves. The younger Mackerel's voice rose slightly.\n\"So Lee Sa-young just threw J in here and left? What kind of nerve is that? Are they really not on good terms? Then why are they together? Or does Lee Sa-young just want to see J wreck the whole fish market? Is this some kind of revenge?\"\nThe tone of his words seemed a bit off. Wasn't this basically treating J like a walking time bomb? One of Cha Eui-jae's eyebrows raised. Though it wasn't visible behind his gas mask.\n\"Ah, no. Wait a second.\"\nThe older Mackerel stammered, finally speaking up. He wiggled his fingers and mumbled.\n\"There was an urgent client looking for him. So, I got them connected.\"\n\"Oh, right. Room number?\"\n\"Room 4.\"\n\"Are they still talking?\"\n\"Y-yeah. Still in conversation.\"\n\"Is that so? ...Then it's time to attract some customers.\"\nThe younger Mackerel's demeanor shifted. It was the look of a merchant, the same one Cha Eui-jae had seen countless times leading up to this place. The younger Mackerel's navy-blue eyes gleamed with energy as he whispered slyly.\n\"So, sir.\"\nHe clasped his hands together with a gentle smile.\n\"What can I help you with?\"\n\"What? All of a sudden?\"\nThe younger Mackerel extended two long fingers.\n\"There are two types of people who set foot in the fish market. Those who buy information, and those who sell it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Which one are you, J? Either way is fine. You seem to have a lot of valuable information.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"There's a third option.\"\nCha Eui-jae flicked his chopsticks. The ceiling light shattered. With a crackle, the room plunged into darkness. He took the brief moment to remove his gas mask and put on his black one.\nHe cracked his knuckles, the sound echoing clearly.\nA distorted voice spoke.\n\"The one who's here to beat you up.\"\nA dark shadow lunged at the Mackerels.\n***\nA moment ago, at the Fish Market.\nThe hem of a black coat fluttered. Although the surroundings had turned into a chaotic mess, the steps continued without hesitation.\nAfter walking for some time, a small security booth came into view. An elderly man, who had been dozing off, sensed a presence and opened his eyes. A hand clad in black leather gloves took out an old wooden plaque from the inventory and presented it. The plaque had the character for \"death (死)\" inscribed on it.\n\"I'm here to meet someone.\"\n\"Hmm, head to room 4.\"\nThe old man mumbled as he slid the wooden plaque into a slot inside the security booth. The firmly closed door slowly slid open, revealing a long corridor with flickering red lights. Lee Sa-young began to walk slowly. Between the long walls, there was a single gap adorned with a string curtain.\nAs he lifted the densely hung beads, the small beads clattered down onto his hair. The small room, bathed in red light, contained a square table with two chairs and a long fish tank filling one wall. Inside the tank, a few bright red goldfish swam energetically.\nOne of the chairs was already occupied. Blonde hair shimmered beneath a scarf tied around her head. The woman slid down her sunglasses slightly, revealing her eyes.\n\"Finally, you're here?\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's really hard to see your precious face.\"\nIt was Honeybee.\nLee Sa-young didn't respond and leisurely walked over, seating himself in the chair opposite Honeybee and crossing his legs. As if on cue, a shadowy figure appeared and set down a cup in front of them. Steam rose from the cup. As the steam dissipated, Lee Sa-young spoke first.\n\"You must have gotten word that I was coming.\"\n\"You can relax; there wasn't a leak. I just came here every day. Until you arrived.\"\n\"...Every day?\"\n\"There was a good reason.\"\nHoneybee untied her scarf. Her hair, which had been tied up, tumbled down.\n\"I asked the Mackerel to connect me with you if you ever showed up.\"\n\"It must be urgent.\"\n\"It is. And serious too.\"\nHoneybee tapped the table lightly before speaking.\n\"Matthew is in critical condition.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 166: Summons\nLee Sa-young furrowed his brow slightly.\n\"...Matthew? Why?\"\n\"The doctor keeps checking on him, but his condition isn't improving. Whether it's because of that damned drug or something else, even potions or healing abilities aren't working...\"\n\"...\"\nThe gloved fingertip traced the rim of the cup. Matthew got injured? Wasn't he already dead? I don't recall hearing any reports about issues with his safety. Thoughts that were his and not his own tangled together in a mess. He let out a long sigh, and a hissing sound escaped from his gas mask.\n'At this rate...'\nIt seemed unlikely he'd be able to work properly for a while. Lee Sa-young clenched his fist tightly before releasing it.\nThat delayed sense of movement, the unpleasant feeling as if his body wasn't truly his own, showed no sign of disappearing. If he let his guard down even a little, an unwelcome presence would push him aside and take control of his body. Even after clinging to Cha Eui-jae at home and barely regaining a sense of control, it was still like this.\nHoneybee, who had been muttering with a deeply furrowed brow, looked up. She narrowed her eyes as she scanned the gas mask.\n\"...Did you hear me? About the drugs and Matthew? I told him to pass it on to you.\"\n\"To whom?\"\nWhat was she talking about? Drugs? Was there even such a thing as drugs? Lee Sa-young's mind felt foggy as if he were groping through a thick mist. It felt like being a lost child, wandering aimlessly. Unpleasantly so.\nHoneybee, resting her chin on her hand, asked,\n\"Aren't you working with J? Your guild. J said he'd pass it on.\"\n\"...J?\"\nJ. Cha Eui-jae. He looked sharp in his suit. As he recalled the image of him standing by his side not long ago, his mind finally began to move. Did Hyung mention something like that?\n\"...Ah.\"\nLee Sa-young finally let out a small sigh of realization. Now that he thought about it, it seemed Hyung did say something along those lines. When he grabbed Cha Eui-jae as he was lingering by the door, what did he say? Something about Matthew and how it was important to pass it on.\nOf course, he let it go in one ear and out the other. He was too dizzy to care about some other man's business. In fact, he deliberately ignored it, annoyed that Hyung was talking about someone else in front of him.\nLee Sa-young replied indifferently,\n\"I heard it.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"I just needed a reminder.\"\nHe did hear it. He just let it slip away. Honeybee glared at him suspiciously. Lee Sa-young shrugged and tapped his temple lightly.\n\"I'm not exactly in my right mind these days. Sorry about that.\"\n\"You were never in your right mind.\"\n\"Haha...\"\n\"Don't act like you ever were. Everyone knows you're crazy.\"\nHoneybee shot back sharply and pulled a small file from her inventory, handing it to him. As he quickly skimmed through it, a few words caught his eye. Samra Guild, drugs, Matthew, addiction... all familiar keywords. He twisted his lips into a smile.\n\"...You've been up to something interesting.\"\n\"Hand over the information related to the drugs. That's what I want.\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head as he peeked at Honeybee over the file.\n\"And if I do?\"\n\"Are you seriously asking? We bust them. We find a clue to treat Matthew too.\"\n\"No... that's none of my concern.\"\nThud. A gloved hand set the file down on the table. Lee Sa-young clasped his hands together and rested his chin on them. His gas mask tilted slightly as he leaned his head to the side.\n\"I'm asking... what you'll give me in return.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh. You weren't planning to take this valuable information for free, were you? Are you really that shameless and unreasonable?\"\nBang!\nHoneybee slammed her fist on the table and stood up, glaring down at Lee Sa-young. Her bright brown eyes sparkled with anger.\n\"Don't piss me off like that. I wasn't planning on taking it for free. What do you want?\"\n\"Hmm, let's see...\"\nLee Sa-young replied without hiding his boredom.\n\"Honestly, there's not much I want...\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I doubt you could give me what I really want anyway.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...In other words, this deal was never going to work out.\"\nJust as Honeybee was about to say something, Lee Sa-young's violet eyes narrowed behind the lenses.\n\"But I'll give you the information. Matthew needs to be saved... yeah.\"\nThe fist that had been about to slam down on his gas mask stopped just short of his face. Honeybee's hand trembled as she clenched and unclenched it before muttering through gritted teeth.\n\"You... really piss me off. That was worse than Gyu-Gyu just now. You know that?\"\n\"I haven't had much chance to be mischievous lately.\"\nLee Sa-young took out a pen from inside his coat pocket. He scribbled a phone number on the cover of the file and slid it over to Honeybee.\n\"You'll get a call at that number within a few days. Be there. And make sure no one tails you.\"\n\"Got it.\"\n\"But not right away. I have things to do too.\"\n\"I get why you're here. You're after Mackerel, aren't you? That article is from Mackerel, isn't it?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I never thought the great Lee Sa-young would end up being carried by J.\"\nHoneybee sneered as she tucked the file back into her inventory.\n\"Aha... so that's what everyone thinks.\"\nBut contrary to her expectations, the narrowed eyes only seemed to smile more. What the hell? I meant to hurt his pride, so why is he smiling? Honeybee frowned. Maybe he really isn't in his right mind, just like he said earlier. Lee Sa-young chuckled as he replied.\n\"I just came to say thank you.\"\n\"What?\"\nWithout further explanation, Lee Sa-young waved his hand dismissively.\n\"If you're done, you should go. You can't stay away too long.\"\n\"Hmph, I was going to leave anyway.\"\nAs she turned to leave, Honeybee spun back around and snapped sharply.\n\"And make sure you answer your damn phone from now on. Got it? Don't hole up somewhere and make me come looking for you again.\"\n\"...What?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been idly rubbing the cup, looked up.\nHad Honeybee ever come looking for him personally? No. But he knew. He knew exactly what she was referring to. A fragment of memory surfaced, faint amidst the shattered pieces. A time when he had locked himself away in a dark space, barely holding on to life. The one who opened the door and came in was...\nHoneybee, after tidying her hair and tying her scarf, looked back at him curiously.\n\"Why are you looking at me like that? Do you have something to say?\"\nWhen she had come through the door, her hair had been a mess, cut unevenly.\n\"...\"\nA few long strands of hair slipped out from under the scarf. Honeybee clicked her tongue and gathered the long, uneven strands back together. The mixture of neatly cut and jagged hair intertwined and crossed.\nAm I the crazy one? Or...\n\"Do you remember what you just said? You.\"\n\"What? Of course, I do. I'm not some goldfish. I said to answer your phone regularly.\"\n\"And after that?\"\n\"After that? Hmm, I said don't hole up somewhere and make me... huh?\"\nHoneybee, who had been speaking confidently, trailed off. Her fingers, which had been tying the knot, suddenly froze. Confusion clouded her bright brown eyes.\n\"Right? That's strange. Did I ever come looking for you? I don't think so...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Ah, this is driving me crazy. What's wrong with me lately?\"\nHoneybee rubbed her temples, her face turning pale. It didn't seem like something she had said intentionally. Words unconsciously slipped out, a scene from the fragments of the uninvited guest's memory. Honeybee knew that moment. Lee Sa-young stood up. The hem of his black coat fluttered.\n\"You're not the only one, it seems. In this case.\"\nShe took a step back, now on guard. Lee Sa-young spoke ominously.\n\"Tell me.\"\n\"Why should I?\"\nLee Sa-young removed his gloves. His blackened fingers grasped the pen on the table. Ssssk, the pen began to melt into black liquid.\n\"Otherwise, I can't give you the information...\"\n\"What? Hey, are you really going to act like this?\"\n\"Just tell me. I'll believe whatever crazy thing you say.\"\nBiting her lip, Honeybee sighed deeply and responded quickly.\n\"Fine. Lately, I've been seeing weird things. Things I never did, suddenly coming out of my mouth. Like I'm losing my mind. Happy now?\"\n\"Like what?\"\n\"Goddamn it...\"\nHoneybee roughly tousled her hair before pointing a finger straight at the center of Lee Sa-young's gas mask.\n\"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you. Got it?\"\n\"I get it. Now hurry up and tell me.\"\nEven though she promised, she hesitated to speak, pacing back and forth in the room for a long while. Lee Sa-young waited patiently. If he had known it would take this long, he would have brought Hyung along. The longer the delay, the greater his anxiety grew. Not only the fear of losing control but also,\n'Please don't cause any more trouble...'\nThe anxiety was mostly like that of a dog owner with a highly active pet. Cha Eui-jae himself thought he was acting quite rationally, but from what Lee Sa-young could see, he was a complete mess. It was as if several screws were loose, yet somehow, like a robot, he carried out orders perfectly. In some ways, he was even self-destructive.\nWhile waiting for Honeybee to start speaking, Lee Sa-young sent a text message.\n[It'll take a bit.]\n[You can follow someone named Jang Mi-sook.]\n[I'll be there soon.]\nIt wasn't long before a reply came back.\nHyung: Got it.\nFortunately, it seemed there hadn't been any accidents yet. Just as Lee Sa-young was tapping his phone screen absentmindedly, Honeybee finally spoke.\n\"...I see the face of a living person, but suddenly it looks like it's been torn apart by an animal, rotting away.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young didn't respond, simply listening to her words. Honeybee bit her lip and muttered.\n\"Do you know what I saw recently? I was talking to Jung Bin, and suddenly, Jung Bin's neck was half-severed, dangling by a thread. I thought I'd been cursed or something.\"\n\"Was it not a curse?\"\n\"No, it wasn't.\"\n\"...When did it start happening?\"\n\"...\"\nHer black boots tapped against the floor.\n\"Since the Day of Change.\"\nHoneybee and Lee Sa-young were both tense, a fragile atmosphere like cracked glass surrounding them. Only the bright red goldfish in the tank swam peacefully.\nLee Sa-young loosened the straps of his gas mask and took it off, placing it on the table. Disheveled hair, violet eyes, and pale lips were revealed in succession. With his face fully exposed, Lee Sa-young tilted his head and asked.\n\"What about me?\"\n\"...\"\n\"When you look at my face, what do you see?\"\nHoneybee slowly observed Lee Sa-young. She tilted her head slightly before responding.\n\"You... seem the same as before.\"\n\"...Hmm. Is that so?\"\n\"No, wait. That's not right.\"\nHer light brown eyes filled with curiosity.\n\"The color of your eyes... it's a bit brighter. Light violet?\"\n\"...Ah.\"\nLee Sa-young let out a low exclamation, twisting his lips into a smile. But his eyes were filled with displeasure.\n\"Annoyingly accurate.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 167: Summons\n\"Annoyingly accurate.\"\nLee Sa-young slowly stood up and moved toward the fish tank. Leaning forward, he brought his face close to the glass, where violet eyes stared back at him from the blue and red surface. As he clenched his hands behind his back, his fingers moved with his grip. He still had control over his body.\nLee Sa-young, whom he had faced on the desolate shoreline. Those faded, pale violet eyes were unsettling, stained with a deep hue of loss. Lee Sa-young straightened up after staring idly at the goldfish in the tank.\n\"About Matthew, you asked J to pass it on to me, didn't you?\"\n\"Huh? Yeah.\"\n\"Did you tell him in person?\"\n\"Well... yeah? I didn't have his contact info. I heard J had entered our guild's dungeon.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young felt his mind searching as he leaned on the tank. A few goldfish swam close to his hand, their fins fluttering.\nEverything had been a mess since he woke up. When he opened his eyes, three months had passed, the world had drastically changed, and an unwelcome, powerful guest had taken residence in his body. Was it because they shared the same soul? Because they were both Lee Sa-young? If he let his guard down even a little, the control would be taken away.\nThe only thing keeping him sane was...\n\"Are you okay?\"\nCha Eui-jae being by his side.\nHe tapped the tank with his fingers. The goldfish opened and closed their mouths.\nHis memories were all jumbled up. It took quite an effort to separate his memories from \"Lee Sa-young's\" memories.\nThey thought alike, as if proving they were the same person. There were even similar memories, and the people in them were often the same. To distinguish between them, he had to play a tedious game of spot-the-difference each time, identifying the dissonance in their near-identical memories.\nYet, amidst the mess, there were memories that were distinctly his own.\nIn his blurry vision, the white lab coats coming and going, the endless injections of unknown substances into his body, the awful sweetness in taste and smell, the restraints that held him down, the disgusting sensation of his skin and organs slowly melting away, the headache that felt like his skull was splitting, and the metallic taste of blood that lingered with every breath.\nThe nights spent wandering by the massive hollow in the middle of the ocean, where the remains of the rift had left a deep depression. The smell of the sea, which had been so ingrained in him that it now made him nauseous. The endless days of waiting for someone who would never return, holding on to a flimsy promise made only with fingers intertwined. And...\n\"Even twins born a minute apart can distinguish between who's older and younger!\"\nThe old-fashioned, grumpy tone that didn't match the handsome face.\n\"I'm sorry for breaking my promise.\"\nThe pale, guilt-ridden face that couldn't even breathe properly, let alone meet his eyes.\n'...'\nThe smile he flashed, even when facing monsters, baring his teeth.\nThe playful grin and the pout that accompanied every grumble, the eyes that darted around as he made excuses that didn't hold up.\nThe eyelids that slowly closed when they kissed, the warm, straight neck, the ears turning red with heat. The two hands and arms that wrapped around his neck.\nAll those memories of Cha Eui-jae and the memories given by Cha Eui-jae belonged solely to Lee Sa-young.\nThey were the only things that kept Lee Sa-young as Lee Sa-young.\n\"Why do you ask?\"\nLee Sa-young turned his head. Honeybee was looking at him with an uneasy expression.\nShould he ask? Yes. For some reason, the unwelcome guest had lost Cha Eui-jae. In that guy's world, Cha Eui-jae was dead. Afraid of losing control, he clung to Cha Eui-jae and searched through the scattered fragments of memories, but he couldn't find that particular memory.\nThe memory of Cha Eui-jae's death.\n'If I knew how he died...'\nAt least he could try to prevent it. There was no guarantee that a death that had occurred once wouldn't happen again. Worse still, there were ominous signs in this world too. Bae Won-woo, who had lost an arm in the previous world, felt pain in his still-intact arm, and Honeybee saw the faces of those who had died in the previous world superimposed on others.\nThe influence of the destroyed world that had lost its warden was growing stronger.\nThe fear of losing him again.\nLee Sa-young gritted his teeth and turned completely to face Honeybee. He leaned against the tank. Whatever he was about to hear, he had to brace himself and accept it. It was all in the past world. He wouldn't be as helpless as the unwelcome guest. Lee Sa-young took a small breath and tilted his head.\n\"When you saw J, did you notice... anything?\"\n\"Like what, something like the Mark of Cain?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Now that you mention it...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh, that's strange. There wasn't anything.\"\n\"...What?\"\nThe response was unexpected. Lee Sa-young frowned as Honeybee seemed lost in thought, her eyes rolling toward the ceiling. After staring at the ceiling for a while, she murmured.\n\"Yeah, nothing at all. If I had seen something, I would've remembered. It's J, after all.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Maybe it was because of the mask? But that can't be... We've had masked hunters in our guild before, and I could still see it on them. Hmm... Could it be that he's not dead? I mean, it's J.\"\n\"No.\"\nThe firm words slipped out before he knew it. Honeybee widened her eyes and frowned.\n\"What? How can you be so sure?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young didn't answer. To be more precise, he didn't have the time to. In the previous world, Cha Eui-jae had died. But how? Why did he die?\nNo one had pursued J's trail as relentlessly as Lee Sa-young. He knew every grueling mission J had undertaken during his three years as a hunter. He had even seen glimpses of the horrific events in the West Sea rift. He had seen the piles of bones stacked high. Even in that hellish place, Cha Eui-jae had somehow made it out alive.\nAnd yet.\n'Why did he die?'\nWhy did he die?\nWhat killed him?\nLee Sa-young glanced back down at the tank. Strangely enough, even without Cha Eui-jae by his side, the unwelcome guest was quiet. Only at times like this was it silent. Lee Sa-young twisted his lips. Not even a single fragment of a useful memory surfaced. There was no sensation, no emotion trickling through, as if a door had been locked.\n'How convenient...'\nHe sneered at the unwelcome guest. Yet it remained silent. But he understood its mentality. If he were in the guest's situation, he would lock his memories too. So that no one else could see them. So that they would remain his and his alone.\nAt that moment, a chuckle broke the silence.\n\"Ha.\"\nHoneybee, with a sarcastic tone, snapped.\n\"See, you do know something. Come on, spill it. I'm about to lose it right now.\"\n\"Do you think I'm any different?\"\n\"Oh, right. Congratulations!\"\nBang! The table rattled as Honeybee slammed her hands down on it, gritting her teeth.\n\"For a while now, I've been seeing Matthew die, bleeding out.\"\n\"...\"\n\"God... I thought I was losing my mind. So I went to the doctor and got checked out. They said there was nothing wrong. No curses or anything!\"\nShe roughly ran her hand through her hair. Even through the makeup, the dark circles under her eyes were visible.\n\"But then I hear his life is in danger. Because he's hooked on some stupid drug. Does that make any sense? What the hell.\"\nA rough hand suddenly reached out and grabbed Lee Sa-young by the collar. He looked down at the hand gripping his collar with indifferent eyes. The calloused hand was trembling uncontrollably.\nAfter a moment, the grip loosened, and Honeybee muttered.\n\"So... whatever it is, just give me the information.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Please.\"\nSigh... Lee Sa-young let out a long breath. He knew all too well what she was feeling right now. And that made it all the more unpleasant. He placed his gloved hand over the one clutching his collar.\n\"Okay.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll tell you that and the drug info. Just wait.\"\n\"...Really?\"\nHoneybee lifted her head quickly, then looked at him with skeptical eyes. Lee Sa-young removed her hand and nodded.\n\"I'm good at keeping promises...\"\nThe comment had a bit of a sting to it.\n\"I've got a bit of a trauma with promises.\"\n***\nThe sound of hurried footsteps was layered with various voices and noisy clamor. In the midst of the bustling fish market, a young man in a black coat and gas mask walked, his coat flaring behind him. People's curious glances followed him, but he paid them no mind.\nLee Sa-young took out his phone to check the time. It had been quite a while since he last exchanged messages. Was he okay? Judging by the mood of the merchants, it didn't seem like anything unusual had happened.\nHis gaze soon shifted forward. The one guiding Lee Sa-young wasn't a person, but a bright red goldfish floating in the air. Its fins lazily drifted.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head as he followed it. The goldfish wasn't leading him towards Jangmi Fisheries but was guiding him in a different, more secluded direction.\nWhere has he wandered off to now? Hopefully, he isn't waiting at a lost-and-found. Imagining Cha Eui-jae sitting there, pouting, almost made him feel better. His mood lightened slightly as a small smile crept onto his face.\nThe goldfish stopped in front of a door with bead curtains, resembling a visitor's room. A small sign was attached next to the door; \"Video Room\". Despite having visited the fish market several times before, he had never known this place existed until now.\n'What are you up to now...'\nLee Sa-young frowned as he stared at the sign. A faint voice leaked out from inside. It was hard to make out anything but the voices from the Mackerels. Grasping the handle, he pushed the door open, and the first thing that greeted him was a large screen filling one wall. The second was...\n\"Ah, you're here.\"\nIt was Cha Eui-jae's voice, altered by the mask.",

Then, he frowned.\nCha Eui-jae was half-lying on a plush bean bag, staring at Lee Sa-young. The low table next to him was piled high with all sorts of snacks. The black mask he wore gleamed under the light from the screen.\n'What the...'\nHe thought Cha Eui-jae would be keeping those Mackerels in line.\nLee Sa-young stopped in his tracks. Eui-jae pulled another bean bag close to him and patted the seat next to him.\n\"Come sit.\"\nWhy does he look so comfortable?\n\"Hyung~nim~\"\nAt that moment, the younger Mackerel with his head down swooped in, holding a bag of freshly popped popcorn that was still steaming. Mackerel grinned and knelt on one knee, offering the popcorn like a bouquet of roses. Lee Sa-young's expression soured even more.\n\"Hyung-nim, I brought some popcorn. Oh? The guild leader is here too. Nice to meet you!\"\nThe younger Mackerel waved his hand in greeting, but the gesture was lost on Lee Sa-young. His mind was overwhelmed by the shocking term of address.\n'Hyung-nim?'\nUnbelievable. His lips twisted into a smirk. Judging by the younger Mackerel's attitude, it seemed that Cha Eui-jae had already established his authority. Did he really want to be called \"hyung\" that badly? Lee Sa-young crossed his arms. Cha Eui-jae, meanwhile, glanced away from Lee Sa-young and shook his head.\n\"I told you, I'm not eating.\"\n\"Don't worry, hyung-nim. I'll leave once you start eating.\"\n\"What makes you think I'll take off my mask?\"\n\"Should I draw up a contract? You can be the principal.\"\n\"No thanks.\"\n\"Uh, um...\"\nThis time, a gloomy Mackerel appeared, nervously extending a tray. On the tray was a cup of iced sikhye. Oh, great, I've run into both mackerels. Lee Sa-young tilted his head slightly.\nHe knew they would reach out to Cha Eui-jae, but he didn't expect both of them to show up. It just goes to show how important Cha Eui-jae is to them...\n\"W-what do you think of this...\"\n\"Why sikhye all of a sudden?\"\n\"I-it's made by the master artisan.\"\n\"Why is that guy's stuff here?\"\n\"I-it's something we got through a deal.\"\n\"For crying out loud. Hyung, you need soda with popcorn.\"\n\"Ah... should I go get some c-cola?\"\nThe absurd conversation continued to spiral into nonsense. Now that he was paying attention, Cha Eui-jae, dressed in a suit, looked like some kind of decadent emperor. Throw a red blanket over him, and he'd be no different from a king. The two Mackerels bowing and scraping beside him could be his eunuchs or bureaucrats. Lee Sa-young watched the scene unfold with his arms crossed, curious to see how far they would go.\nHe tapped his arm with his finger. More than anything...\n'It's annoying...'\nOf course, he wanted Cha Eui-jae to be happy. But still.\nAs Lee Sa-young quietly observed him, he called out to Cha Eui-jae in a mechanical tone.\n\"Hunter J.\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been chatting with the Mackerels, immediately snapped his head up at the mention of his hunter name. He pointed to himself, asking with a bit of hesitation.\n\"...M-me? Are you talking to me?\"\nLeaning against the doorframe, Lee Sa-young looked at him intently before smiling. This time, he called out more deliberately, emphasizing each syllable.\n\"Yes, Hunter J.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nCha Eui-jae put down the remote control he was holding. Tension was visible as his shoulders and arms stiffened. The younger Mackerel whispered into the older Mackerel's ear.\n\"I don't think we should be here.\"\n\"Should we... should we leave?\"\n\"Let's get out of here.\"\n\"Y-yeah.\"\nPerhaps it was due to their experience as information brokers, but the younger Mackerel winked at Lee Sa-young before leading the older one away.\nWith only the two of them left in the dimly lit room, Lee Sa-young closed the door behind him. Thud. Click. He made sure to lock it. Although he was still under the influence of the mackerels, and couldn't completely escape their watchful eyes...\n'If they have any sense, they won't peek in for a while.'\nLee Sa-young put his hands in his coat pockets and slowly approached. Cha Eui-jae, half-crouching, looked up at him.\nHe could already guess the expression behind that black mask. That bewildered look of wondering, \"Why is he acting like this? What did I do wrong?\" Only then did he feel a bit more satisfied. The nervousness on Cha Eui-jae's face was kind of cute, too.\n'This guy... He's not very good with people.'\nSo why does he attract so many weirdos?\nIf you take your eyes off him for just a moment, he's already made friends with some oddball. Does he have a sense of caution or not? He was all fired up about keeping them in line, but he's already dropped his guard and followed them to this remote place. Is it because he's lonely and craves interaction? Even so, how can he be so careless?\nLee Sa-young started analyzing Cha Eui-jae's thoughts, oblivious to the fact that he himself had been considered a \"weirdo\" in the past. Unaware that he was driving his Hyung to the brink of despair.\nMeanwhile, Cha Eui-jae was on the verge of losing it.\n'What the hell is with him?'\nHunter J. It was a title he'd heard from plenty of others. At some point, people stopped using the \"Hunter\" part and just called him \"J.\" But from the past until now, even after they reunited, this was the first time Lee Sa-young had called him that. Damn it.\nCha Eui-jae began to replay his actions in his mind. Did I do something wrong again? I was just following Jang Mi-sook here like I was told. Is it because the Mackerels were around that he called me that? But does he have to call me that so coldly? The inexplicable sense of hurt quickly gave way to annoyance.\nLee Sa-young, walking towards him like a slasher villain in a horror movie, just stood there, silently observing Cha Eui-jae. Eventually, it was Cha Eui-jae who broke the silence.\n\"...Why did you call me that?\"\n\"Hmm? Call you what?\"\n\"You know, Hunter J.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nLee Sa-young let out a small sound of realization, then chuckled lowly.\n\"You seem to be getting along well with the Mackerels. You're already calling each other hyung and everything...\"\nIs that really the biggest issue here? There was no way to keep up with Lee Sa-young's thought process. Cha Eui-jae grabbed his head in frustration.\n\"I didn't ask them to call me that. They just did it on their own.\"\n\"Sure, whatever. Why aren't you at Jangmi Fisheries? And without the gas mask?\"\n\"I was there at first. But then they... found out I was J?\"\n\"Didn't you say you'd beat them up?\"\n\"No, well, after talking to them, I realized they weren't so bad.\"\nCha Eui-jae recalled what had happened earlier.\nAt Jangmi Fisheries, after smashing a light with his chopsticks, Cha Eui-jae had used the darkness to his advantage, charging at the Mackerels. They flapped around like fish, trying to escape, but Cha Eui-jae was faster. He had one of them in a headlock when the younger Mackerel, choking, shouted out.\n\"What's your problem?!\"\n\"You little punks, who told you to post that ridiculous article?!\"\n\"But... if we don't post stuff like that, J-ssi won't even notice us!\"\nWhat kind of comic book line is this? Cha Eui-jae was dumbfounded. He loosened his grip slightly, curious about what the Mackerel had to say next. The younger one flopped around.\n\"Other hunters make reservations just to meet us, but even though you're active again, J-ssi, you never come to see us!\"\nWell... Seo Min-gi collects all my intel anyway, so I've never had a reason to visit. In his mind, a stoic image of Seo Min-gi flashed by, flashing a V sign. The younger Mackerel covered his face with his hands, pretending to cry.\n\"We have so much information for J-ssi. We've been saving it for the day you'd finally visit! How could you not understand how we feel? You dummy.\"\n\"Information? What kind of information?\"\n\"W-would you like to come to the video room?\"\n\"The video room?\"\n\"Yes. Come and see for yourself before deciding. We'll make sure the article is retracted and corrected as a fake. By tomorrow morning, it'll all be cleared up.\"\n\"You think you can cover it up?\"\n\"Don't worry. We'll drop a few other hunters' scandalous stories at the same time. I'm sure you've heard of Lee Won-ho and Kang Du-chil?\"\nIt was names he thought he had heard somewhere before. A customer at the hangover soup restaurant, perhaps? Anyway, the seasoned tactics of these \"brokers\" were something no criminal could hope to follow. Cha Eui-jae ended up sitting in the video room, waiting for Lee Sa-young to arrive.\n\"If you pull any funny business, I'll flip this place over.\"\n\"I wouldn't dare, sir!\"\nKnowing he had the strength to back it up, he had made that decision.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young's expression behind the gas mask was ambiguous, as if he wasn't quite sure what to make of this situation. Cha Eui-jae patted the empty bean bag next to him once more. Lee Sa-young quietly sat down on the edge of the bean bag and looked at the screen. The beam projector flashed from his right side. Cha Eui-jae picked up the remote and dusted it off.\n\"Look, these guys showed me a bunch of stuff. It was interesting, even useful.\"\n\"...What did they show you?\"\n\"The last thing was an overview of the shifting power dynamics among rankers and guilds after the West Sea rift, and now this...\"\nCha Eui-jae pressed the play button. The black screen shifted to reveal:\n—You've just awakened and immediately claimed the top rank. Which guild do you plan to join?\nClick, click, click. Camera flashes went off. A young man, still with traces of boyishness, stood alone on the stage in a suit. His black hair was neatly combed back, and his long eyelashes fluttered with each blink. Despite standing in front of countless reporters and cameras, he showed no signs of nervousness. In fact, he seemed bored, his face reflecting a clear sense of weariness. His plump lips moved slightly.\n—I don't plan to join any guild.\n\"This is the first interview you did after becoming a hunter.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Wow, you were so young, so young. How old were you then? Eighteen?\"\nThud! Lee Sa-young's hand, about to strike the beam projector without hesitation, was caught in a strong grip.\n\"Hey, why are you trying to break it?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young clenched his fist, the joints cracking audibly. He felt the tension in the wrist and arm he was holding. He looked ready to strike Cha Eui-jae at any moment.\nCha Eui-jae, sensing the increased pressure, moved a little closer and reached out with his other hand. He had used it a few times before, and by now was quite adept at loosening the fasteners of Lee Sa-young's gas mask. Slipping his fingers between the straps, he removed the mask that had been covering Lee Sa-young's face.\nBeneath the disheveled black hair, his pale face was flushed red.",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Summons\nCha Eui-jae froze in place, clutching the gas mask. He only meant to tease him a little, but this reaction was unexpected.\nIs it really something to be this embarrassed about? Or wait— was Lee Sa-young really embarrassed? For some reason, Cha Eui-jae's fingertips tingled, and before he realized it, his hand twitched.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young took a few harsh breaths and then yanked the gas mask away. His reddened face was about to disappear behind it when Cha Eui-jae quickly grabbed his hand. A low, tightly clenched voice followed.\n\"Move.\"\n\"Hey, wait. Hold still for a second.\"\n\"Move your hand.\"\n\"Why are you trying to put it back on?\"\n\"Why do you care? I... want to wear it.\"\nLee Sa-young's chest heaved beneath his coat, and now he was snorting in frustration, his face turning even redder beneath the half-hidden mask.\nThere was no trace of the boyishness Cha Eui-jae had once seen on Lee Sa-young's face. The sharp cheekbones, the defined jawline, and the deeper eyes belong entirely to a grown man.\nMeanwhile, the interview between the reporters and young Lee Sa-young continued on the screen.\n—Is this a declaration of establishing your own faction?\n—Yes.\n—Can you tell us why you didn't choose the Samra Guild?\n—Just because.\n—Any thoughts on your future goals?\n—Is that really necessary?\nA murmur of awe escaped from the reporters, and Cha Eui-jae, almost reflexively, murmured a quiet \"Oh.\" He gripped the gas mask tighter. Lee Sa-young muttered a low curse.\n\"Fuck...\"\n\"...Pfft.\"\n\"You think that's funny right now?\"\n\"...No?\"\n\"I really don't get it.\"\nLee Sa-young muttered sharply. The young Lee Sa-young on the screen was delivering one shocking line after another. It was hard to believe someone at eighteen could have this much nerve.\nCha Eui-jae, in the midst of his scuffle with Lee Sa-young, was also mesmerized by the screen. He couldn't help it; Lee Sa-young had a knack for grabbing people's attention, whether in a good or bad way.\n—Haah...\nWith a bored expression, the younger Lee Sa-young rested his elbow on the podium and propped his chin on his hand, deliberately sighing loudly enough for everyone to hear. The funny thing was, everything he did looked like it was straight out of a movie.\nWhether it was the neatly slicked-back hair, the perfectly tailored suit, or perhaps the long lashes, the sleepy violet eyes, or the slightly parted full lips...\n'What the...'\nWhy am I staring so closely? Cha Eui-jae quickly snapped himself out of it, and suddenly, a realization hit him.\nLee Sa-young had been this rude since the first time he was lying down wrapped in bandages! Surely, others must have noticed this about his personality by now.\nUnable to suppress the question building up inside, Cha Eui-jae finally asked,\n\"Have you ever gotten backlash for your attitude?\"\nThe grip on the gas mask slackened, and Cha Eui-jae seized the opportunity to snatch it away and throw it into a corner. But instead of being angry, Lee Sa-young just stared at him with an incredulous expression, though his face was still flushed.\n\"...Fuck, is that seriously what you're curious about right now?\"\n\"Well... don't people usually get criticized for acting like that? You were fine?\"\n\"What the hell is wrong with you?\"\n\"Aren't you curious?\"\n\"Drop that damn curiosity of yours.\"\n\"Your tone's getting short again.\"\n\"Ugh, that obsession over formality of yours.\"\nLee Sa-young ground his teeth. A popping sound came from his knuckles, and his body was so tense it seemed like he'd crawl over to retrieve the gas mask any second. Cha Eui-jae decided to switch topics.\n\"You didn't wear the gas mask back then?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Come on, you can answer that at least.\"\n\"...I didn't.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"...They said it would be better not to for my first public appearance.\"\nThat made sense. First impressions are crucial. Though the gas mask is certainly striking, it's not something that wins people over. If he'd shown up wearing that, people might've thought he was some lunatic— just like Cha Eui-jae had when they first met in the back alley.\n\"Smart choice.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced back at the screen. The young Lee Sa-young, teetering on the edge between adolescence and adulthood, was doing his best to answer questions, despite the bored look on his face. Of course, his answers weren't exactly sincere.\nIt would've been fun to see that in person.\n\"I missed seeing this with my own eyes.\"\nMaybe it was to be expected, but the regret that slipped out of Cha Eui-jae's mouth came from a deeper place— the part of him that wanted to see the journey Lee Sa-young had gone through while he was wandering around the West Sea rift.\nHe was curious. What had happened to Lee Sa-young? What had he gone through? What was he thinking? Cha Eui-jae didn't just want fragments of information; he wanted to know everything.\n\"I really missed out...\"\nHe felt a strange sense of loss. A part of him regretted not being there for Lee Sa-young's journey.\nPerhaps he just wanted to hold onto the image of young Lee Sa-young a little longer. His grip on Lee Sa-young's wrists loosened. Lee Sa-young didn't waste the opportunity.\n\"Huh—?\"\nSuddenly, a strong force grabbed his arm, and his vision spun. Instinctively, Cha Eui-jae prepared to roll and break his fall, but it wasn't necessary. A large hand was already supporting the back of his neck.\nThat large hand gently laid Cha Eui-jae's head onto the bean bag chair. Before he knew it, Cha Eui-jae was lying on the beanbag, and Lee Sa-young was straddling him. Cha Eui-jae blinked. The shadowed face of Lee Sa-young above him was flushed red.\n\"Why are you...?\"\nLee Sa-young's hand moved next, searching for the remote control to turn off the projector. Beep. The light slowly dimmed, and the redness of Lee Sa-young's face faded into the darkness. Complete blackness descended.\n\"...\"\nSoft breaths grew closer. The sound of the long coat rustling, fabric brushing against fabric. Lee Sa-young's hand rested on Cha Eui-jae's stomach. Instinctively, Cha Eui-jae held his breath, tightening his abs.\nThe hand pressing down on his stomach moved, deftly undoing the buttons on Cha Eui-jae's tightly fastened suit jacket. Then it moved upward, fingers reaching for his tie knot.\nFingers slipped through the knot. Cha Eui-jae nervously clutched the beanbag above his head. The bean bag crinkled under his grip.\n\"Sa-young...\"\n\"Stay still.\"\nThe tie slid off smoothly. Cha Eui-jae could feel the tickling sensation of the fabric brushing against his neck as it was pulled away. Why is he doing this all of a sudden? Before Cha Eui-jae could gather his thoughts, gloved fingers were fumbling with his shirt collar. One by one, the buttons came undone.\nTwo buttons in, Cha Eui-jae finally regained his senses and grabbed Lee Sa-young's gloved hand.\n\"Why are you undoing my shirt? What's going on?\"\n\"I said stay still...\"\nLee Sa-young grumbled irritably. Who's the one supposed to be irritated right now? Cha Eui-jae was speechless.\nAt that moment, a sharp pain shot through his fingers. Cha Eui-jae froze. Lee Sa-young was biting his fingers, gnawing on them hard.\n'Are you a dog?'\nCha Eui-jae swallowed the words rising in his throat. Honestly, Cha Eui-jae couldn't say much, considering he'd bitten Lee Sa-young's fingers before too.\nThen, something warm and wet brushed against his fingers. Cha Eui-jae suppressed a yelp. Lee Sa-young was licking his fingers now. Cha Eui-jae's fingers curled involuntarily. He stammered out a question.\n\"Why, why are you doing this?\"\nSomeday, I'm going to crack open his brain and dissect his thought process. Cha Eui-jae couldn't keep up with Lee Sa-young's train of thought. Every time his tongue grazed his fingers, a ticklish sensation made Cha Eui-jae squirm. Lee Sa-young bit his fingers one last time before letting go. Cha Eui-jae hastily retrieved his hand.\n\"Turn the projector back on.\"\n\"...You're really something.\"\nLee Sa-young's face leaned closer. Cha Eui-jae propped himself up on his elbows, about to sit up, but stopped. Without warning, lips pressed against the top of his mask.\nThe lips slowly moved down toward the mouthpiece of the mask, pausing near it. Cha Eui-jae held his breath. He couldn't feel the kiss, but he knew that Lee Sa-young was pressing his lips against him.\n\"You talk too much...\"\n\"...\"\nA gloved hand slipped between the mask and Cha Eui-jae's chin. Click. The mask lifted slightly without resistance. The black fingers gently caressed the skin beneath, tracing his chin and lips. Lee Sa-young's voice, slightly shaky, asked softly.\n\"Do you remember? That time. When you lifted your mask a little to let me touch your face.\"\nCha Eui-jae involuntarily swallowed. Lee Sa-young's thumb pressed against his lower lip.\n\"That night... You don't know how much I lost sleep over it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I kept wondering what your face looked like under the mask...\"\nThe hand caressing his face now was nothing like the boy's hand back then.\n\"I...\"\nThe mask, only slightly lifted before, was now fully removed. Clatter. It dropped to the floor with a distinct sound.\n\"I like us... because we're special.\"\nThis hand was much larger and firmer than the one in his memory, and above all...\n\"More than any other Lee Sa-young and Cha Eui-jae.\"\nIt was gentle.\nIf the void of time had brought us to where we are now,\nIf loss had made us who we are,\nWarmth, like a wave, enveloped his lips. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes and accepted that warmth.",

      "content": "Chapter 170: Summons\nSoft lips touched his, and a thick tongue pushed through the parted gap, exploring the inside of his mouth. There was no hesitation in its movements, as if it had done this several times. As though it intended to devour him whole, two large hands cupped his face, rubbing his cheeks and tickling his ears.\nRustle. His grip tightened on the bean bag. His body twisted instinctively.\nI can't breathe.\nIt felt like he was being devoured. A sharp tingle ran down his spine. Cha Eui-jae reached out, fumbling to grab the body on top of him. When he gripped the firm shoulders, the lips parted with a wet sound. A thumb pressed between his lips.\n\"Breathe.\"\nAh. A small sound of surprise escaped. He must have been holding his breath without realizing it. As his airway suddenly cleared, a small cough slipped out. His chest heaved up and down with every small cough. Lips brushed his cheek.\n\"I thought you'd gotten used to it by now...\"\nA gentle voice asked.\n\"When will you get used to this?\"\nHis body trembled. As the coughing subsided, the hand that had been caressing his face slid down his neck and rested on his chest.\nThump, thump, thump. His heart pounded faster than ever under the large hand. A lukewarm warmth pressed against his heart. Cha Eui-jae covered his eyes with his arm and tried to steady his breathing. A voice tinged with laughter whispered in his ear.\n\"You have to breathe through your nose.\"\n\"Move your hand...\"\n\"Your heart's beating too fast...\"\nAt that moment, tension shot through his entire body.\nAh, damn it. Cha Eui-jae cursed silently to himself. How could a living person hide the sound of their heartbeat? It's impossible unless you're dead. A low chuckle reached his ears. The hand pressing on his heart felt like a heavy stone. But instead of feeling suffocated, he strangely felt at ease.\n'Wait a minute.'\nCha Eui-jae caught his breath, his eyes widening. The faint sound of footsteps he'd heard in the distance was now growing louder. Cha Eui-jae was about to sit up, gripping the hand on his chest when—\nKnock, knock. There was a knock at the door.\n\"Excuse me, hyung-nim? Can I come in?\"\nThe sound of their breathing, heavy in the darkness, came to an abrupt halt. Cha Eui-jae rolled his eyes, searching for the mask. Sensing that Cha Eui-jae's attention had shifted, Lee Sa-young glared at him.\nBut Cha Eui-jae didn't have the presence of mind to read the expression. There's no way he could let J's fans, the Mackerels, see him like this! He quickly reached out and snatched the mask that was lying on the floor.\nJust as he was about to put it on, his chin and wrist were grabbed. Cha Eui-jae whispered urgently.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"I should be asking you. What are you doing right now?\"\n\"I'm trying to cover my face!\"\n\"Tch.\"\nLee Sa-young scoffed.\n\"We haven't even started yet.\"\n\"What do you mean, 'haven't started'! Get off! Someone's coming in.\"\n\"Lock the door, then.\"\n\"I saw that guy come through the wall. If you don't let him in, he'll break through the wall.\"\n\"Ah... so you saw that too?\"\nCha Eui-jae glared at him.\n\"You saw that too? How dare you speak to me informally— are you insane?\"\n\"Hah...\"\nLee Sa-young let go of his wrist with a flick. At the same time, his soft hair brushed against Cha Eui-jae's neck. There was a grinding sound as Cha Eui-jae clenched his teeth.\n\"Why are there so many people getting in the way...?\"\nShould he even be upset about this? Cha Eui-jae was bewildered. Wasn't this the Mackerel's space in the first place? It's not even an appropriate place for this kind of thing...\n'Damn it, what am I even thinking?'\nCha Eui-jae silently screamed, clutching his head. What's an appropriate place for this anyway? Clearly, he was completely under some sort of spell in this darkness. He hurriedly slapped the mask onto his face. His wildly racing heart began to calm down.\nWhen he pressed the remote to turn on the projector, light flooded the room. Cha Eui-jae looked at Lee Sa-young, who was still on top of him.\nLee Sa-young, who had buried his face in Cha Eui-jae's neck, slowly raised his head.\nAnyone could see he was pouting. His displeasure was evident, and even his neck was flushed red with heat. When Cha Eui-jae reached out, pretending to fix Lee Sa-young's messy hair, he pushed it behind his ear. Through the strands of black hair, a hint of a red ear peeked through. A soft chuckle escaped.\n\"Why are you laughing?\"\n\"Well... you look like you need a gas mask too.\"\n\"...\"\nKnock, knock. Another knock came from the door.\n\"Excuse me~ Guests? If you don't answer, we're just going to open the door and come in. It's urgent.\"\nCha Eui-jae raised his voice to reply.\n\"Just hold on a second!\"\n\"Oh, hyung-nim! We thought you fell asleep. We were about to call a locksmith. Could you please open the door?\"\nThe younger Mackerel spoke in a polite tone. Cha Eui-jae tossed a gas mask to Lee Sa-young and got up. Lee Sa-young's flushed face quickly disappeared behind the mask. Cha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly and was about to grab the doorknob when Lee Sa-young, fiddling with the mask's strap, called out.\n\"Wait, Hyung...!\"\nClick.\n\"...\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced back into the room, then turned his attention to the Mackerels standing in the now-open doorway. The older Mackerel stammered, \"Uh, uh,\" while the younger one quickly covered his brother's eyes with his hand.\n\"Hah...\"\nLee Sa-young let out a deep sigh, as if it had been building from deep within his chest. He approached and stood firmly behind Cha Eui-jae. A finger poked him painfully in the back.\n\"Why... oh.\"\nOnly then did Cha Eui-jae become aware of his appearance. His hair, tousled from their earlier tussle, and his shirt, half unbuttoned down to his collarbone, thanks to Lee Sa-young's handiwork. His shirt and jacket were wrinkled beyond recognition, and his tie— where did he even throw that? In his mind, a field of flowers bloomed, accompanied by a mysterious voice.\nAh~ I'm so fucked~\nWearing nothing but a combat uniform when he was J, and casually sporting a hoodie and apron as a part-timer— this was the karma catching up to him. He never paid attention to clothes, so! But his survival instincts, which shone brightest in moments of crisis, kicked in. Cha Eui-jae leaned against the door frame, striking a nonchalant pose.\n\"Sorry. We had a bit of a disagreement.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"A bit of a fight.\"\n\"A... a fight?\"\nThe older Mackerel, whose eyes were still covered, stammered. Cha Eui-jae replied casually.\n\"I showed him a video from when he was a kid, and he suddenly lunged at me, saying not to watch it. So we had a bit of a scuffle.\"\n\"...\"\nThe look that burned into the back of his head was intense. It felt like it could scorch a hole through the back of his skull. Well, technically, it wasn't a lie. What they had just done was also a kind of scuffle, wasn't it? Words flowed out as smoothly as if his tongue had been oiled.\n\"It's my first time fighting in a suit, so I didn't know how to fix it afterward. But nothing in the room's broken.\"\n\"F-fighting is n-not allowed.\"\n\"Yeah. Sorry.\"\n\"No, n-no need to apologize... Could you... m-move your hand?\"\n\"Oh, right~ My bad.\"\nThe younger Mackerel smiled and removed his hand from his brother's eyes. The younger Mackerel's gaze, which briefly met Cha Eui-jae's, was rather sly, but Cha Eui-jae quietly suppressed it with a clenched fist. As he buttoned up his shirt, he asked,\n\"So, what's the urgent news?\"\n\"Oh! The urgent news. Well... ta-da.\"\nThe younger Mackerel suddenly thrust a tablet forward. A photo was displayed. Cha Eui-jae squinted his eyes. Lee Sa-young, who was standing behind him, tilted his head to look over Cha Eui-jae's shoulder. In the photo...\n\"...What is this?\"\nA stark white surgery room, with a man lying on the table, connected to various machines. His body was covered in knife wounds. And standing in front of the table, holding a scalpel in one hand and a glowing white aura in the other, was a man. The scalpel was about to be plunged into the man on the table.\nA white coat and long white hair tied in a single braid. Cha Eui-jae had seen someone dressed like this before.\n\"...Nam Woo-jin?\"\n\"Bingo!\"\n\"Why a picture of Nam Woo-jin?\"\n\"Take a closer look at who the doctor is dissecting. You may not have met him in person, but you probably saw his face in the video I just showed you.\"\n\"...Ah.\"\n\"Tsk.\"\nLee Sa-young clicked his tongue. His arm reached around Cha Eui-jae's chest, zooming in on the picture. Cha Eui-jae also recognized the man with his eyes closed.\n\"Matthew. Where did you get this photo?\"\n\"There's a website on the dark web. It's for those who support Pro... Prometheus. You can't even sign up without an invitation and a referral.\"\nThe younger Mackerel cut in.\n\"Guild leader Lee Sa-young, who's been holed up for three months, should start from the basics. Well... the site opened up after the Day of Change, but it wasn't really talked about much at first. But then...\"\nThe younger Mackerel took back the tablet and tapped something before handing it over again. A black screen with a burning flame appeared, followed by lines of white text in various languages.\n[The apocalypse must be averted by human power.]\nThe same phrase is repeated in various languages. Cha Eui-jae frowned. The younger Mackerel shrugged his shoulders.\n\"About two weeks ago, the number of members started to skyrocket.\"\nTwo weeks ago. That lined up with the time Lee Sa-young's disappearance began to surface, and J's actions became more expected.\n\"...\"\n\"This photo also came from that site. Seems like there are supporters even within the Seowon Guild, right?\"\n\"How did you guys join?\"\n\"If we can't join places like this, how can we call ourselves informants? Let's see...\"\nThe younger Mackerel tapped the screen several times, and then a fiery animation flared up. A forum page appeared, showing languages from all over the world. He tapped the Korean flag, and a Korean-language forum appeared.\nA moment later, a small pop-up window with long lines of red text appeared in the center of the screen.\n[Do not fear if you witness the scenery of the apocalypse that has already arrived.]\n[It is proof that you have been chosen by the apocalypse.]\n[Do not trust the system that scatters chaos and destruction upon the world.]\n[Do not trust the hunters who fight using the power of the system.]\n[Trust only in yourself, who has witnessed the apocalypse. Only through human power can we overcome the end.]\n\"What kind of cult...\"\nThere were always people preaching about the end of the world. After the Day of the Rift, how many doomsayers had sprung up? Of course, none of them were ever right. Cha Eui-jae clicked the 'X' to close the pop-up. Another window soon appeared, with even redder text than before.\n[Do not trust the hero J.]\n[He is a traitor who abandoned the world and fled.]",

      "content": "Chapter 171: Summons\nHe ran away from the world. Traitor.\nThe words were a strange sequence. Cha Eui-jae stared at the red text and chewed it over for a long time. Traitor, runaway. Runaway, traitor... Have I ever run away?\n'I don't think I've ever run away...'\nJ doesn't run away. He neither had the thought nor the reason to, and besides, if he ran, more people would die. As much as it sounded odd to say, J was a shield in and of himself. Ever since Cha Eui-jae had awakened, he never once doubted his own usefulness.\nBut why did they say he \"ran away\"? Pure curiosity stirred. Cha Eui-jae scratched his head for no reason, then reached for the tablet.\n\"J.\"\nAt that moment, something black blocked his vision. Lee Sa-young covered the eye holes of the mask with his palm and pulled the round head toward him. Cha Eui-jae, who had tried to resist, stopped and tilted his head back instead. A blunt voice asked,\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Why are you still reading this kind of nonsense?\"\n\"Huh? Well, there must be a reason for writing this kind of stuff, right?\"\n\"Reason?\"\n\"People don't just say things like this without basis...\"\nLee Sa-young scoffed. His fingers, covering the mask's eyeholes, tapped lightly on it. The mask trembled slightly.\n\"Are you kind, or just stupid...\"\n\"What'd you say, jerk?\"\n\"Do you think crazy people have reasons? Put the tablet away.\"\n\"Wait a second, I haven't finished yet. Hey, don't take it away.\"\n\"Put it away.\"\n\"If you take it away, you're dead.\"\n\"Put it away.\"\n\"I rank higher than you.\"\n\"Didn't expect J to resort to intimidation like some street hunter... using rankings, of all things.\"\n\"Ah, and we don't even have popcorn. Having a conflict like this without popcorn is just... Oh, by the way, did you finish the popcorn I brought earlier?\"\nThe younger Mackerel made a joke. Just as Cha Eui-jae was about to pull Lee Sa-young's hand off his wrist, Lee Sa-young quickly slipped his fingers through the gaps in the mask. Cold leather touched the corner of his eyes. Cha Eui-jae glared.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"If I let go now, the mask will come off. Is that okay?\"\n\"I'll break your fingers.\"\n\"Go ahead, try.\"\n\"...\"\nThe fingers inside the mask wiggled slightly, tickling his eyelashes. It was a teasingly irritating touch. Cha Eui-jae frowned. Of course, he knew Lee Sa-young was doing this precisely because he knew Cha Eui-jae wouldn't break them.\nWould he have been able to if he didn't know that Lee Sa-young was that boy?\n'...Though, even if I didn't know, I probably wouldn't.'\nIt felt like he had realized something he wasn't supposed to.\nA vein bulged on Cha Eui-jae's forehead. What a sly, cunning bastard! Lee Sa-young had a knack for getting under people's skin. Cha Eui-jae slowly let go of his grip on Lee Sa-young's wrist. But even after that, the fingers didn't budge.\nJust as Cha Eui-jae, ready to grab Lee Sa-young's wrist again, asked,\n\"Hey, aren't you going to pull your fingers out?\"\n\"If I do, you'll immediately pull my hand off.\"\nYou think I wouldn't know that? Lee Sa-young teased right by his ear. Damn it. Lee Sa-young knew Cha Eui-jae far too well. Meanwhile, the younger Mackerel threw more fuel on the fire rather than putting it out.\n\"With the No. 1 and No. 2 getting along so well, the future of South Korea sure looks bright! Right, hyung?\"\n\"Uh, yeah. Right.\"\nNo, it's not!\nCha Eui-jae thought hard. Should he drag Lee Sa-young into the video room, lock the door, and neutralize him? It wouldn't be impossible. If it came down to physical combat, he was confident. It might be a bit rough, but S-grade individuals could withstand mild blows, and if he adjusted his strength...\nSomething hard tapped his head. Probably the bottom of Lee Sa-young's gas mask.\n\"I can hear the gears turning in your head. You were thinking of hitting me, weren't you?\"\nCha Eui-jae, who had been imagining slamming Lee Sa-young onto a bean bag chair, responded indifferently.\n\"No, I wasn't.\"\n\"Why are you so obsessed with this crap? You don't need to see it...\"\n\"Isn't all the info on that site?\"\n\"Ugh, come on.\"\nLee Sa-young sighed deeply. His fingers, which had been playing with Cha Eui-jae's face, finally slipped out, and the hand pressing on the mask withdrew. Cha Eui-jae blinked slowly as his vision brightened.\nThe Mackerel brothers, as if they had never held up the tablet in the first place, looked at him with calm expressions. So, they did put it away after all. Before Cha Eui-jae could scold them, two hands landed on his shoulders. Gently, Lee Sa-young turned Cha Eui-jae's body toward the video room. He sighed again and muttered,\n\"Just go in and finish watching the interview.\"\n\"...What?\"\nCha Eui-jae blinked. Lee Sa-young, looking like he wanted to die rather than say it, spoke with clear reluctance, pausing between each word.\n\"Go... watch the cute... version of me.\"\n\"Pfft!\"\n\"I don't think I ever said you were cute, though...\"\n\"I'll handle the website.\"\nWith a big hand, Lee Sa-young gave Cha Eui-jae a soft shove toward the video room. Just before the door closed, their eyes met. Lee Sa-young's violet eyes were full of irritation. Thud, the door shut.\nStanding alone in the dark video room, Cha Eui-jae blinked, scratched his head, and then picked up the remote, pressing play. On the screen appeared the youthful face of the boy, Lee Sa-young, standing on the edge of boyhood and young adulthood. Yet strangely, he didn't seem as captivating as before.\n'Why is he trying to hide it?'\nIs there information I shouldn't know? Or is he worried I'll get hurt?\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae settled into the plush bean bag and tilted his head, staring at Lee Sa-young's indifferent young face. Did Lee Sa-young really think he'd get hurt by a baseless rumor like that? But for such trivial things to wound him, Cha Eui-jae's heart was far too hardened. His heart had already...\nClick, click. Flash. He ran away. Traitor. Abandoned and ran away. Traitor.\nHe left his comrades behind and escaped alone, that filthy traitor. Everyone is waiting for the day you pay for your sins.\nFor a moment, the screen turned blood red, but soon returned to its original color.\nCha Eui-jae rested his chin between his knees. The young Lee Sa-young yawned softly. The tension in Cha Eui-jae's shoulders eased. Well, if Lee Sa-young didn't want to tell him everything now, then what of it?\n'I'll just track him down and shake it out of him later.'\nNo one can stay silent in front of a fist, right? Cha Eui-jae's knuckles cracked.\n***\nScreens large and small flickered, emitting a blue glow. Numerous screens surrounded the entire room in a circle.\nLee Sa-young pulled his hand out of his pocket. With each step he took, his image was reflected from various angles on the screens. At the center of the large, dark room, sitting on a desk, the younger Mackerel opened his arms wide in a welcoming gesture.\n\"It's been a while since you've come here, hasn't it? Man, I can't tell you how bored I've been without any visitors to the deepest parts of this place.\"\nBeside him, the older Mackerel was examining the many screens, one by one. His fingers tapped the air as if typing on an invisible keyboard. The lenses of his glasses gleamed in the bright blue light.\nThis was the heart of the Fish Market— the Mackerels' office. A place no one could reach without the owner's guidance.\nLee Sa-young gave a curt nod.\n\"Get to the point. I don't plan on staying away from my post for long.\"\nThe younger Mackerel smirked.\n\"Since when did you and J get so close? Close enough to stick your hand inside his mask?\"\n\"I told you. Get to the point.\"\n\"This is the point. I mean, what kind of courtesy is it to place an order and then disappear for three months without a word? You should've at least dropped a hint. Information has a shelf life, you know. It's all gone bad.\"\n\"Even rotten information needs to be delivered. That's what an information broker is supposed to do.\"\n\"Ah, come on, you've done this enough times to know better.\"\nThe younger Mackerel shook his head and ran a hand through his hair, his dark blue eyes glinting. He made a circle with his thumb and forefinger.\n\"The price has gone up... that's what it means.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slowly.\n\"What do you want?\"\nThe younger Mackerel grinned. He rubbed his thumb and finger together as if counting money.\n\"I think I know about your relationship with J, so I won't ask. Where have you been for the past three months?\"\n\"Ah...\"\nLee Sa-young let out a mocking laugh. It was obvious. Many people must have been curious about his absence, placing orders to find out where he was and what he had been up to. Perhaps wondering if he was plotting something behind the scenes.\n\"Seems like a lot of people have been wondering about my whereabouts.\"\n\"You're a superstar, after all.\"\n\"I slept.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nThe younger Mackerel's eyes went wide. Even the older Mackerel, who had been focused on something else, lifted his head. The younger one got ready to cover his brother's ears and asked again.\n\"You slept? Oh, with who?\"\n\"What are you imagining? You should get your brain washed.\"\nLee Sa-young spat out his words.\n\"I slept. For three months.\"\n\"Sleeping for three months straight? That's ridiculous. No, I guess it's possible... but why?\"\n\"I don't know. I collapsed and fell asleep on the day you guys call the 'Day of Change,' and...\"\nHe jerked his chin toward the younger Mackerel.\n\"I woke up for the first time on the day that picture of me was taken. Is that enough?\"\n\"It's hard to believe you slept all that time without any issues...\"\n\"I said I don't know.\"\nHe responded irritably. There was no need to share all the details with an information broker. After all, they wouldn't be able to give him the answers he was looking for. The only one who could answer him was the unwelcome guest inside his own body.\nThe two Mackerels exchanged glances. When the older one nodded, the younger Mackerel clapped his hands.\n\"Alright then. On the Day of Change, mutated beings suddenly appeared everywhere. As you know, these mutations were caused by Prometheus' experiments and drugs, which transformed awakened individuals. But, starting from a certain point, in the lower rungs of society— among civilians who hunters typically wouldn't pay much attention to— strange conspiracy theories began to emerge.\"\nWith a flick of his fingers, three images floated into view. A black hole that had turned white, like a white hole; a black figure piercing a massive whale, with ash-colored hair fluttering; and a mutated being, subdued and collapsed with a hunter's badge hanging around its neck, while civilians nearby whispered to one another.\n\"After the Day of Change, rumors started spreading that the awakened were turning into monsters...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 172: Summons\nPrometheus causes the awakened to mutate.\nAfter the Day of Change, the awakened begin to mutate.\nThough the conclusion is the same, the process differs. The former has a clear cause, while the latter is nothing more than an unfounded rumor. However, sometimes, the root of a problem lies within the rumors.\nLee Sa-young stared intently at the black figure riding atop the massive whale. Indeed, Cha Eui-jae's hair had lightened compared to three months ago. Lee Sa-young flicked his fingers and asked,\n\"What causes the mutations? What's behind it?\"\nThe younger Mackerel clapped his fingers together, as if he had been waiting for this.\n\"That's exactly it. After the Day of Change, the awakened start to mutate! Why? How?\"\nThen he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.\n\"There's nothing. The most important part is missing. But there's evidence and results that the awakened have mutated, right? People have seen it with their own eyes, and there are pictures.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, people began filling in the blanks themselves to create a plausible story. The system's curse, the awakened's sins, someone's revenge, and so on... the repertoire is quite varied.\"\nThe stories might sound laughable to those who know the truth. But this wasn't a matter to be taken lightly. Fear without a solid basis can paralyze a person's mind. Lee Sa-young tilted his head. The smile disappeared from the younger Mackerel's face, the pale blue light casting shadows across his features.\n\"Maybe that's why the rumors are spreading so quickly. Hunters who are in tune with these things have probably heard it at least once— about the awakened mutating. Some hunters actually believe it. Right, hyung?\"\n\"Y-yeah.\"\n\"Man, some idiot even came to us asking what he should do if he mutates, begging us to tell him how to prevent it.\"\nFor a moment, Lee Sa-young wondered if the Awakened Management Bureau hadn't intervened. But he quickly dismissed the thought from his mind.\nThe Awakened Management Bureau is a conservative public institution. They wouldn't act recklessly, and even if they tried to address the rumors, a half-baked explanation would likely only cause more confusion. They hadn't even fully mapped out the drug distribution channels, after all.\nThe younger Mackerel started playing with his brother's hair.\n\"We know it's nonsense, but the vast majority don't. The rumors have smartly tapped into the anxieties of people since the Day of Change...\"\n\"...\"\n\"The awakened may be strong, but their numbers are tiny compared to civilians. They can't afford to ignore public opinion. J's recent actions helped keep things under control for a while, but now things are getting worse.\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head. Prometheus. They wanted to prevent the apocalypse through human power. Unfortunately, his memories of being dragged to their labs and experimented on weren't clear. Only a vague sense of the experience remained.\n\"If your brain forgot, that means it was a great shock. Don't push yourself too hard.\"\nJung Bin, back when they were living in the mountains with Bae Won-woo in a remote cottage, had told him not to force himself to remember if it was too difficult. But Lee Sa-young stubbornly pieced together his fragmented memories. What he had dredged up from those foggy recollections was;\n—\"Hopefully, the experiment we did on you succeeds. Right? You're good at enduring pain, aren't you? You've held up well so far.\"\n—\"If it succeeds, humanity will take a big step forward in fighting against the apocalypse. With our own strength!\"\nA strangely familiar woman's voice and a seething, overwhelming rage.\nWhile Lee Sa-young was lost in thought, the younger Mackerel was busy teasing his brother by taking off and putting on his glasses.\n\"What's their goal?\"\n\"Well...\"\nThe younger Mackerel blew a bubble with his mouth, which floated into the air. He took his brother's glasses and mumbled,\n\"Considering the group's tendencies... probably to sow distrust toward the awakened and hunters.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I couldn't say it earlier because you were in front of me, but it's obvious why they've targeted J. When you think of hunters, you think of J. Even people who don't like hunters recognize J's achievements, don't they?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young only lifted his head after hearing J's name. The younger Mackerel continued rambling.\n\"The first awakened, saved the country, dealt with the West Sea Rift, came back alive when everyone thought he was dead, took down a whale when it seemed like everything was doomed again, defeated monsters like Hong Gil-dong. Do you know how many stories there are of people claiming J saved their lives?\"\n\"Aha...\"\n\"As long as J is standing tall, you won't be able to fan the flames of distrust against hunters.\"\nYeah, J sure has been busy while I've been asleep. Lee Sa-young suppressed the sarcastic remark that tried to bubble up.\nIn truth, Cha Eui-jae wasn't the type of person to sit quietly and do nothing just because someone told him to. It was in his nature. As long as he was alive, he had to do something. He'd get anxious if he stayed idle. He couldn't rest, no matter how hard he tried. A man born to live loudly— that was Cha Eui-jae.\n'Would he have been quieter if he hadn't become a hunter?'\nAn image of Cha Eui-jae in a school uniform floated up in Lee Sa-young's mind. Carrying a large backpack to school, studying in class, taking naps, eating lunch in the cafeteria, chatting with friends. Lee Sa-young's brow furrowed. No matter what scene he imagined, people always swarmed around Cha Eui-jae.\n\"...\"\nAh, forget it. Lee Sa-young tilted his head back and let out a small sigh. His gas mask hissed as the air escaped. The younger Mackerel clapped his hands with a loud smack.\n\"Anyway, to summarize! Prometheus has changed its methods since the Day of Change. They used to distribute drugs and kidnap awakened ones to experiment on them...\"\nThe screens surrounding Lee Sa-young lit up with a flood of text. All of it carried a similar message: \"You are chosen\", \"Don't leave our future in the hands of the awakened\", \"Let's fight the apocalypse with our own strength...\"\n\"Now, they're spreading rumors to change the thoughts and perceptions of civilians. The awakened are dangerous! We need to fight the apocalypse ourselves! Stuff like that. And they're also chipping away at J's reputation while they're at it.\"\n\"Utter nonsense.\"\n\"I agree. Oh, I've got more information, but what should I do with it?\"\n\"Send it to the Seo Min-gi branch. I'll check it myself.\"\n\"Understood. Thanks for the good deal!\"\nLee Sa-young turned his back. As he was taking off his glasses, the younger Mackerel asked,\n\"Oh, you're leaving already? Why don't you stick around for a chat?\"\nHis steps halted. His black coat billowed behind him.\n\"J shouldn't be left alone for too long.\"\nThe younger Mackerel instinctively touched his ear. It almost sounded like there were two voices layered together. As he glanced at his brother to ask his opinion, Lee Sa-young had already disappeared. The older Mackerel removed his glasses from his brother's face and tilted his head.\n\"Th-that was strange...\"\n\"You heard it too?\"\n\"Y-yeah.\"\n\"It really feels like something must've happened during those three months... What's with him and J? When did they get so close? Ah, it's driving me nuts with curiosity!\"\n\"Sh-should we call a reporter?\"\n\"No, hold on.\"\nThe younger Mackerel rubbed his chin, his eyes gleaming.\n\"We've got to stop Prometheus from spreading these rumors anyway... Hey, listen, hyung. How do you put out a fire?\"\n\"You pour water on it...\"\n\"You make a bigger fire!\"\nThe younger Mackerel hopped off the desk. The older Mackerel hurried to grab his brother's arm but was a second too late.\n\"I don't think that's...\"\n\"No, this is the right way. Call the reporter, hyung! If you tell them it's a follow-up to the last article, they'll jump on it. Let's burn this up all the way to the Council.\"\n\"How, how are you going to manage this...\"\nThe younger Mackerel grinned mischievously, scrunching up his face.\n\"What, you think we're gonna die?\"\n***\nThe tightly shut door opened soundlessly. A tall figure appeared through the sliver of light pouring in. Lee Sa-young entered as quietly as possible, keeping his movements subtle.\nThe screen still displayed a young Lee Sa-young, standing with a sour expression, though there was a slight difference— Bae Won-woo was beside him.\nCha Eui-jae was sitting on the floor, knees pulled up to his chest, his head resting on his arms. Quiet, rhythmic breaths escaped from him, signaling that he had fallen asleep.\nIf you're going to sleep, at least use the beanbag. Why do you always sleep in such uncomfortable positions?\nCha Eui-jae always did one of two things; either causing a commotion when left unattended, or curling up alone like this, looking utterly forlorn.\nLee Sa-young preferred when Cha Eui-jae was causing trouble. At least that made him feel alive. Lee Sa-young removed his gas mask, reached out, and gently lifted Cha Eui-jae's face off his arms. With a soft click, he removed the mask from Cha Eui-jae's face. His eyelashes and the area around his eyes were wet. Lee Sa-young let out an annoyed sigh.\nSee? You can't be left alone.\nUsing his thumb, he lightly wiped away the tears from Cha Eui-jae's eyes and then put the mask back on. He should have woken up by now with all this fuss, but strangely, he didn't. Lee Sa-young listened to Cha Eui-jae's steady breathing for a moment.\n\"...\"\nAs long as you're alive.\nLee Sa-young took off his coat and draped it over Cha Eui-jae. Then, lifting him up, he kicked the door open and stepped into the hallway. The surrounding scenery began to shift and swirl, becoming increasingly chaotic. Amid the disordered scene, the gazes directed at Lee Sa-young gradually changed.\nFrom shock, to disbelief, to curiosity, and finally, to the excitement of catching a big prize.\nJust as he was about to leave the fish market, a shrimp floated through the air towards Lee Sa-young. The shrimp hovered by his side, its jet-black eyes staring up at him. Lee Sa-young tilted his head.\n\"What, taking pictures again?\"\nThe shrimp's antennae wiggled frantically. Lee Sa-young let out a quiet chuckle.\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"...\"\n\"This time, make it undeniable.\"\nPoof!\nWith a burst of cartoonish smoke, the shrimp vanished. Lee Sa-young, now fully immersed in the weight in his arms, walked out of the fish market. Soon after, strange shouts faintly echoed from within.\n\"We've hit the jackpot~!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Wavelength\nAfter the Day of Change, people lived with unresolved anxiety.\nThe black hole had changed color overnight, white ash fluttered like snow, and gates and cracks appeared more frequently, along with monsters. Although the hero J had appeared, everything seemed to hint at the coming of a new disaster. People still couldn't forget the losses engraved by the Day of the Rift.\nAt some point, it became common to see people on the streets proclaiming the end of the world. Even if you didn't want to, the people waving flags painted with flames on the main streets drew your attention.\n\"We must stop the end of the world with the power of humanity!\"\nThey shouted about the apocalypse, whether anyone listened or not. Did the power of words actually exist? This daily repetition of the apocalypse. At first, people laughed at them, but they no longer could. Those who had ignored them before now glanced at them every now and then. The anxiety growing inside people quietly swelled.\n\"...\"\nYoon Ga-eul was no exception. Yoon Ga-eul glanced at the fluttering flags and hurried her steps. The strange doomsayers had taken up a spot on the shortcut path, making it impossible to avoid them. Even when parents complained, it was only temporary.\nIn fact, Yoon Ga-eul couldn't help but be more affected, as she had seen the world after the apocalypse firsthand.\nDo they even know what the end of the world is? Could this be the group that Jung Bin-nim mentioned?\nAll her thoughts led back to the apocalypse. It was as if a huge stone labeled \"apocalypse\" was pressing down on her. Every time she passed by them, Yoon Ga-eul turned up the volume on her earphones. That was the best she could do.\nBut in the past few days, she hadn't had the luxury to care about them. Whether that was a relief or unfortunate, she didn't know.\nDuring lunch, a chorus of awe erupted from one corner of the classroom. Every tap on the tablet revealed a new photo. All the figures in the pictures were of Lee Sa-young. The screen froze on a side profile of him. Someone gasped in admiration.\n\"Wow... he's ridiculously handsome.\"\n\"I always thought he was crazy since he always wore that gas mask.\"\n\"Hey, check out his old interview videos. That's the real deal.\"\n\"Yoon Ga-eul! You should look at this too. There's something about him, seriously.\"\nA photo appeared in Yoon Ga-eul's line of sight. Thin, like it was cut out from a newspaper, it depicted people she knew all too well. Lee Sa-young, holding J tenderly, staring into the camera. The corners of Lee Sa-young's lips were curved as if he was smiling.\nFrom morning till now, she must have seen this fifty times, no exaggeration. Nodding mechanically, Yoon Ga-eul took the picture. Da-yeon muttered under her breath, her face flushed.\n\"Aren't they actually dating?\"\n\"Totally. The princess carry? This doesn't make sense unless they're dating.\"\n\"At least, they must be flirting.\"\n\"But they're both guys?\"\n\"That's what makes it good.\"\nYoon Ga-eul bit her lip hard. She didn't want to throw cold water on her friends' excited chatter. And besides, the atmosphere in the picture was just too suspicious!\n'Why are you holding him so tenderly...?'\nEven Yoon Ga-eul, who had seen them in real life, couldn't deny that they seemed to be living in a world of their own. She clutched the photo tightly and swallowed her tears.\n'J, Guild Leader. I'm sorry.'\nThe apocalypse that had been swirling in her mind had long since been wiped clean.\n***\n[\"Exclusive Report\" 1st and 2nd Rank Caught Again... The Biggest Scandal Since the Day of the Rift!]\nIt hadn't even been a few days since the scandal involving South Korea's top two hunters was reported, and once again, the country was in an uproar because of them. This time, a photo of Lee Sa-young holding J was revealed. What's more, the picture was taken even closer than before, and it was crystal clear! People cheered for the pristine quality.\nHunters on HunterNet, who had been debating whether J or Lee Sa-young was stronger, lost their minds over the new gossip. It was like pouring a whole bottle of gasoline on a fire before they even finished their last debate!\nSome argued that since Lee Sa-young was holding J, he must be stronger. Others countered, didn't J hold Lee Sa-young in the previous picture? It must be that they each asserted dominance once. This time, J was going easy on Lee Sa-young, and there's no way they could have fought at the fish market. Perhaps they just put a mask and wig on someone and pretended it was J...\nAs people debated with just two pictures, the conversation naturally led to the root question.\n'Why are they even holding each other in the first place?'\n'What kind of relationship do they have?'\nAs they delved deeper into the mystery, they arrived at a new theory.\n— Maybe they locked eyes while fighting!\nA bit twisted, but a playful suggestion.\nBut once they started looking at the pictures through this skewed lens, too many odd details stood out.\n—What's with that smug expression on 240's face?\n⤷ Damn it, now that you mention it, I can't unsee it.\n⤷ That's definitely a smug look, ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ.\n⤷ If I got to take a picture holding J, I'd probably make that face too.\n⤷ I'd love to see him in person just once.\n⤷ He's got the expression of a concubine who just had a son, ㅋㅋ\nNot just Lee Sa-young's smirking face as he stared straight into the camera,\n—But isn't 240 a poison user? Does J have poison immunity? Even with 240's gas mask off, they're so close, and J looks perfectly fine.\n⤷ Yeah, his skin looks fine, doesn't seem poisoned. What's going on?\n⤷ Maybe it's an artifact from the gas mask.\n⤷ I wonder how good J's gear must be.\n⤷ But seriously, why is he holding him so tightly? The jacket's even wrinkled! Tenderly??? I feel like I'm going insane.\n⤷ You need to stop overthinking.\n⤷ Turn off HunterNet.\nLee Sa-young's overly close and tight grip,\n—Also, isn't 240 really good-looking? Why is his smile so seductive? It's giving me chills.\n⤷ He looks like a courtesan, what do you mean good-looking—— Hunters should be more rugged, like Shield Guy.\n⤷ Okay, but Shield Guy is ranked 11th, and 240 is 2nd, so deal with it~\n⤷ But seriously, why did they fight when they're both on the same team?\nLee Sa-young's looks are getting reassessed.\n—I'm a current hunter, and this is just a publicity stunt. 240 can't beat J with strength, so he's using psychological warfare, and we've all fallen for it.\n⤷ What are you even talking about?\n⤷ Don't you remember that public service announcement? He's a master of psychological attacks.\n⤷ Oh my god.\n⤷ Why does that sound plausible?\n⤷ How strong are you going to get, 240?!\nThe theory of psychological warfare raised its head once again.\nKang Ji-soo, a dopamine addict who browses HunterNet whenever she's bored, couldn't stand the overwhelming stimulation and kicked the door to the vice-guild leader's office.\n\"Vice-Guild Leaderrrr!\"\nBang! The door shook as if it was about to fall off, but she didn't care. Her red hair and the newspaper in her hand fluttered violently. However, Bae Won-woo was silent. Normally, he would've scolded her for the door damage. Puzzled, Kang Ji-soo looked around the office and noticed him on the sofa.\n\"Oh, I thought you weren't here. What are you doing? Did you see the photos?\"\n\"Ji-soo, don't talk to me...\"\nBae Won-woo was lying sideways on the sofa, mechanically chewing on a protein bar with a blank expression. He looked oddly pathetic. His jaw moved robotically as he chewed and swallowed the bar, and his eyes were completely lifeless. He began mumbling.\n\"I've handled all kinds of things since following that bastard Sa-young...\"\n\"Yup.\"\n\"But are we actually a talent agency?\"\n\"Have you lost it? We've got several dungeon expeditions scheduled.\"\n\"No, seriously... Why do I have to deal with a dating scandal? If it were a controversy about his character, I'd be like, 'Finally! Took long enough.' But this? This isn't right.\"\nThe unplugged phone on the desk buzzed softly. Bae Won-woo curled into a ball, covering his ears.\n\"And that bastard Sa-young isn't even answering his phone! Why were they even photographed at the fish market?\"\n\"About that.\"\nKang Ji-soo unfolded the crumpled photo, tilting her head.\n\"Don't you think they got photographed on purpose?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I mean, look. The background is a fish market, and he's staring straight into the camera lens. Do you really think the guild leader didn't know they were being photographed by Mackerel?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Didn't they go to the fish market to confront him in the first place? Knowing the guild leader's personality, he would've made a scene and forced the guy to delete the picture. But he allowed it, didn't he?\"\nBae Won-woo's dazed eyes seemed to wander in the air. Now that he thought about it, Lee Sa-young had been acting strange when they visited his house. Fresh out of the shower, wearing only a bathrobe, he clung to J. J, usually so indifferent, had been unusually devoted to Lee Sa-young.\nThe part of his brain that had been on strike for 364 out of 365 days suddenly started working hard today. He felt like he had stumbled onto something he wasn't supposed to know.\nBae Won-woo staggered to his feet.\n\"...Ji-soo.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nA look of determination crossed his face.\n\"I'm heading into a dungeon. Tell anyone who asks that I'm not here.\"\n***\n\"Ahaha, staying back was worth it~ I even get to see pictures like this.\"\nThe lightly tossed newspaper fluttered to the ground. The gray paper soaked through with bright red.\nA bloodstained, straight finger picked up a takeaway cup. The hand's owner was perched atop the corpse of a massive monster. White, disheveled hair blew in the wind. Gyu-Gyu, after taking a long sip of coffee, looked down with a smiling face.\n\"Has the civil servant seen this article yet?\"\nStanding a bit away, untouched by the blood, Jung Bin looked up.",

      "content": "Chapter 174: Wavelength\nA slightly awkward expression showed through Jung Bin's usual gentle smile. He covered his mouth with a fist and cleared his throat before slowly nodding.\n\"Yes, I've seen it.\"\n\"What do you think? You know both of them, don't you~\"\n\"Haha, that's not something I should comment on.\"\nGyu-Gyu bit down on the straw, showing his teeth as he chewed on it.\n\"Eeh~? Is there really something going on between them? All the hunters in the world are curious.\"\nJung Bin didn't answer and maintained his smile. After observing Jung Bin for a while, Gyu-Gyu shrugged as if he was losing interest. He tossed the empty takeaway cup behind him with a flick.\n\"Ah~ boring.\"\nClang—\nCracks began to form in the air as if a thin fracture had split open. Beyond the rift was a wasteland covered in white ash. Soon, a white light burst from within, and it scattered into fine ash. Gyu-Gyu balanced himself on one foot atop the corpse before standing up straight.\n\"Up we go.\"\nJung Bin scanned the surroundings. As the rift vanished, the piles of monsters around them also began to disintegrate into ash, one by one. Even the monster beneath Gyu-Gyu's feet turned to ash. He lightly jumped to the ground, stretching his neck and rolling it from side to side.\n\"Fish market, huh. It's been a while since I visited...\"\nGyu-Gyu, who usually left the country as soon as his business was done, had been staying in Korea unusually long. Even though the task of tracking J had ended with his own appearance. Clearly, what had changed his mind was the Day of Change. The day he pierced through that massive whale in one blow...\nJung Bin, watching Gyu-Gyu move about busily, finally spoke up.\n\"How have you been lately?\"\n\"Sudden interest in my life? Just living as usual.\"\n\"I heard you've been attending Sunday services regularly...\"\n\"Ugh. Where'd you hear that?\"\n\"Your picture was plastered right on the homepage of your father's church. It was hard to miss.\"\nSon of a pastor, Ban Gyu-min. Hunter alias: Gyu-Gyu. His photo, prominently displayed on his father's church homepage, had become somewhat famous. Jung Bin had stifled a laugh the first time his team had shown him that picture.\nIt was hard not to, given the sight of someone standing out by a whole head among the others, awkwardly smiling and giving a thumbs-up. Even more so in a choir robe.\n\"I told them not to post that...\"\nFor once, Gyu-Gyu scratched his cheek with an embarrassed expression. Jung Bin added with his usual gentle tone.\n\"You looked like quite the dutiful son.\"\n\"Ugh. If you've got something to say, just get it over with. I've got other places to be.\"\n\"Alright. Will you be attending the upcoming General Assembly?\"\n\"Wow... So you came all the way out here to ask me that?\"\nGyu-Gyu stuck out his tongue, pretending to gag in disgust. He then scratched his messy hair, grumbling.\n\"Why would I go? It's a hassle, and I know the director will just chew me out.\"\n\"But this meeting is important. Haven't you noticed the recent unsettling atmosphere?\"\n\"...\"\nGyu-Gyu continued to stare at Jung Bin with his ever-present smile, waiting for him to reveal his cards first. Jung Bin fiddled with the earpiece in his ear and finally spoke.\n\"Public distrust of hunters is growing by the day. That's what this meeting is about.\"\n\"So, everyone's gathering to scheme about how to get back into people's good graces? Hmm~\"\nGyu-Gyu folded his arms, pretending to think deeply, before grinning.\n\"Not going!\"\n\"Are you really not coming? You'll regret it.\"\n\"Not going~ I'd rather dive into Lake Baikal.\"\n\"That's unfortunate.\"\nJung Bin let out an exaggerated sigh, making sure Gyu-Gyu could hear it. He turned around with deliberately heavy footsteps. His voice, though soft, was just loud enough to be overheard.\n\"I heard J is personally attending this time...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, I can't force you to come. I'll be heading off then, I need to pick up Hong Ye-seong as well.\"\nHe had barely taken two steps when— whoosh! A thin vine shot out from behind, wrapping itself around Jung Bin's wrist. Jung Bin calmly began untangling the vine with his other hand, thread by thread.\n\"Aren't you headed to Lake Baikal?\"\n\"Well, it's not like I'm dying to go.\"\nThe vine that had lightly coiled around his wrist now bloomed into a small, white wildflower. Jung Bin glanced back. Gyu-Gyu, half-turned away, was pretending to look at his phone. The vine had extended from the ground beneath Gyu-Gyu's feet. Looking up, Gyu-Gyu gave a sly smile.\n\"I was just thinking I'd check the schedule~\"\n***\nCha Eui-jae blinked for a moment, lost in the blinding white light that filled his vision.\nBlurred figures rushed past him, too busy to notice. Once again, he found himself standing in the hallway of the old Awakened Management Bureau. He was standing in front of a door, his hand already reaching for the doorknob. Cha Eui-jae looked up and read the nameplate next to the door.\nDirector's Office. This was Ham Seok-jeong's room.\n'Is this a memory of meeting Ham Seok-jeong?'\nWhat kind of information could he extract from their conversation? It would be nice to find a clue about the apocalypse. His hand, which was reaching for the doorknob, hesitated. Cha Eui-jae took a step back from the door.\nRight next to the Director's Office was another black door.\n'Was there a door like that before?'\nIt was a door that did not exist in 'Cha Eui-jae's' memory. The door, which had appeared suddenly, strangely caught his attention. There was no nameplate on it. From the gap beneath the door, a black energy seeped out, undulating slightly. It felt oddly familiar.\n'What is this?'\nSomeone whispered; Open the door. As if hypnotized, Cha Eui-jae reached out and gripped the doorknob. It was cold enough to send chills through his body. Slowly, he turned the knob. Creak— the door opened more easily than expected. Cha Eui-jae poked his head in to look inside. Pitch-black darkness greeted him.\n'This is strange.'\nHe had read through 'Cha Eui-jae's' memories several times using the watch, but this was the first time an anomaly like this occurred. Has something changed? What could have caused this shift? The only thing different between then and now was—\n'Lee Sa-young woke up...'\nThud. The space trembled. A powerful force pushed him through the door. Instinctively, he tried to resist, but the force was too strong for him to fight. He was helplessly pushed into the center of the darkness.\nBang! The door slammed shut behind him. Cha Eui-jae stared into the void with an incredulous expression.\n'Damn it, did I just get pushed so easily?'\nHe clenched his fist, then opened it again, something felt off.\n'...Wait, what?'\nThe power he had always felt as his own was gone. He hadn't realized how weak he had been before awakening. He felt disoriented, like an ant among giants. He stared blankly into the darkness.\n'Cha Eui-jae' whispered; This isn't mine, that's why.\n'What are you talking about...?'\nThen, it happened.\nIn the empty void where nothing could be seen or heard, a voice echoed.\n\"...Did you say you turned back time?\"\nA voice, deep and low, more like a beast than a human. Creak, creak, the sound of footsteps on a wooden floor. Clatter, the sound of a drawer opening. An old clock floated into the air.\n\"Then, that means I can turn it back too...\"\n\"...\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes again, pitch-black darkness and a strange sense of being watched greeted him.\nBefore he could grasp his surroundings, he jolted upright, instinctively feeling his face. The mask was gone.\nWhat is this? Where am I? The eerie presence continued to track his every move. It made no effort to hide itself. Just as Cha Eui-jae was about to throw a punch in the direction of the unseen presence, a familiar voice spoke.\n\"You don't need to be so startled.\"\nIt was Lee Sa-young's voice. Click— the sound of a button being pressed. A faint reddish light flickered on. Squinting, Cha Eui-jae looked around and saw the familiar room he had been visiting for months— Lee Sa-young's room.\nNext to it, in the chair Cha Eui-jae often sat in, was Lee Sa-young, now casually seated with his legs crossed. Sensing his gaze, Lee Sa-young unfolded his arms.\n\"Looks like I woke you up.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Did you have a good dream?\"\n\"...You.\"\nCha Eui-jae stared at him, his shadowed face showing a flicker of recognition in his blinking eyes. Eyes that reflected everything like a mirror. He clenched his fist tightly.\n\"You're not him.\"\n\"Yes... you're right.\"\nSurprisingly, Lee Sa-young agreed lightly.\n\"You woke up after two days.\"\n\"What?\"\nTwo days? It was hard to believe. He instinctively tried to check the time, but there was no way to do so in this room— he had cleared everything out. Even his phone was gone.\nRight, the watch. He raised his wrist, but his wrist was also bare.\n\"Looking for this?\"\n\"...\"\nThe watch was now in Lee Sa-young's hand. His black fingers were fiddling with it.\n\"It's pretty worn out.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Yet, somehow, it still works.\"\nWas he telling the truth or lying? Cha Eui-jae tried to read something from his expression, but his face was as blank as ever. That expressionlessness made him more anxious than anything. The Lee Sa-young he knew, after all, was always quite expressive.\nGazing at Cha Eui-jae, Lee Sa-young tapped his temple lightly.\n\"Seemed like you were having an interesting dream.\"\n\"...\"\n\"How was it?\"\nA void entangled in the end of a long dream. A faintly familiar voice that had been heard. The owner of that voice was unmistakably Lee Sa-young. A mechanical smile spread across his face, devoid of mockery, joy, or any other emotion.",

      "content": "Chapter 175: Wavelength\nCha Eui-jae clenched and unclenched his hand. The strength that had disappeared had fully returned. A strange door that suddenly appeared in 'Cha Eui-jae's' memory. A voice he had never heard in Cha Eui-jae's memory, yet felt familiar. Cha Eui-jae tried to recall. The voice growled like a beast...\n\"Cha Eui-jae.\"\nIt was similar to what he'd heard in the fragment Yoon Ga-eul had shown him. Lee Sa-young was still sitting there, unmoving, smiling. It was an eerily precise smile. Everything about him seemed inhuman.\nShould he neutralize him first? Cha Eui-jae cracked his knuckles. And right after—\nBang!\nCha Eui-jae shot forward, kicked the chair, and grabbed Lee Sa-young's throat, climbing on top of him. Thud, Lee Sa-young's head hit the floor. Tap, tap, tap... The watch fell from his wrist and rolled away.\nDespite being pinned to the floor and choked, Lee Sa-young didn't resist. His smile didn't falter. Cha Eui-jae felt the urge to cover that face.\nLee Sa-young parted his lips.\n\"Stop it... I didn't do this to fight.\"\nThe skin under his palms felt cold, yet there was a faint, light pulse. Cha Eui-jae glanced sideways. Should he break his legs first? Even if he did, Nam Woo-jin could fix them...\nLee Sa-young whispered.\n\"I have to... test everything. This is the last chance.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young reached up and cautiously covered Cha Eui-jae's hand that was choking him. His touch was cold. Cha Eui-jae tightened his grip on Lee Sa-young's neck.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"Oh, what I want...?\"\nThe muscles in his neck trembled slightly. Lee Sa-young was laughing. Soft coughs punctuated by a delicate laugh escaped. Once he started laughing, it went on for quite a while before it finally ceased. Lee Sa-young tickled the back of Cha Eui-jae's hand with his fingers.\n\"Let's sleep together.\"\n\"...What?\"\nCha Eui-jae doubted his ears. Did he hear that right? But Lee Sa-young stared up at him, still smiling. His long eyelashes fluttered. A dizzying fragrance wafted through the air.\n\"You checked for yourself just now.\"\nLee Sa-young tapped his head with his fingers. It was a rough action, with no regard for his own body. Cha Eui-jae almost grabbed his hand but stopped. Lee Sa-young continued, unbothered, in a slow voice.\n\"Your dreams and my dreams are connected now. Thanks to the watch.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Aren't you curious? About what only I know...\"\nA warden who had watched the end for a long time. What the end is, how it comes, and why they failed. No one would know better than Lee Sa-young. It was a tempting offer.\nCha Eui-jae stared into the violet eyes nestled between Lee Sa-young's disheveled hair. The eyes still reflected everything about him. No emotions, no opinions. Just reflecting. When Cha Eui-jae tightened his grip, a small groan escaped Lee Sa-young's lips.\nAfter a moment, Cha Eui-jae loosened his grip slightly, allowing him to breathe. A fit of coughing followed. Cha Eui-jae felt the muscles tremble beneath his hand and asked in a low voice.\n\"This would all be over if you just told me. Why bother with the extra steps?\"\n\"Oh, that's... no fun.\"\n\"What are you... You told me this is the last chance.\"\n\"I did...\"\n\"If you miss this chance, we're all dead. You, me, everyone.\"\n\"I know...\"\n\"And fun is still important to you?\"\n\"What... isn't important?\"\nLee Sa-young blinked slowly. His violet eyes had faded to a pale lilac. Deep in his soft-colored eyes, a white flame flickered. Cha Eui-jae, entranced, stared at the flame. Lee Sa-young muttered.\n\"I wandered alone for such a long time.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And now... I finally feel alive...\"\nThe black hands gripped the hands that choked him and squeezed. Cha Eui-jae snapped back to his senses and opened his eyes wide. Lee Sa-young barely whispered in a strained voice.\n\"Choke me harder. This feels good...\"\nA smile crept onto the face that had shown no emotion before.\nA twisted smile. He was genuinely enjoying this.\nA chill ran down Cha Eui-jae's spine. The sensation left him shivering as he yanked his hands away, shaking them furiously. Lee Sa-young clicked his tongue in disappointment. Cha Eui-jae was appalled.\n'Is he really insane?'\nThe black fingers tapped against Cha Eui-jae's hand like the legs of a spider. He shuddered. Lee Sa-young burst into laughter.\n\"It's good for both of us, isn't it? Didn't you want to choke me?\"\n\"Stop making me sound like a pervert!\"\n\"Really? That's a shame...\"\nLee Sa-young rubbed his neck, where Cha Eui-jae's handprint was still clearly visible. Cha Eui-jae swallowed hard.\nDamn. Wasn't there supposed to be some meeting or something? Lee Sa-young shrugged.\n\"Weren't you digging through memories, trying to find something...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Think about it. I'm fine with whatever... Hyung.\"\nAnd as soon as Eui-jae heard that word—\nSmack!\nHe couldn't hold back and threw a punch.\nLee Sa-young's lilac eyes rolled back, and his body went limp. Cha Eui-jae, panting, unclenched his fist, his hand pressing against Lee Sa-young's chest. Luckily, his instincts had kicked in, and he had pulled his punch. His pulse was still beating normally.\nCha Eui-jae's hand trembled uncontrollably. He wiggled his fingers, the lingering sensation of Lee Sa-young's touch still vivid.\n'What the hell? Is he a real pervert?'\nWhat? Sleep together? Choke him? Is he seriously insane? Maybe he'd been wandering so long that he lost his mind.\nCha Eui-jae barely swallowed the scream rising in his throat. His heart pounded as if he'd run a marathon. Whether it was anger, shock, or excitement, he couldn't tell.\n'Lee Sa-young is not in his right mind.'\nNow, he missed the Lee Sa-young he knew. The bratty but somewhat endearing Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae bowed his head, resting his forehead on Lee Sa-young's chest. His voice trembled.\n\"Hey, hey, wake up, Lee Sa-young...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Come on, don't just leave me hanging here...\"\n\"...\"\n\"You've slept enough!\"\nAt Cha Eui-jae's shout, the body beneath him stirred. A small groan followed. Cha Eui-jae jerked his head up. Lee Sa-young, groaning as if in pain, held his head and blinked. His handsome face twisted in a grimace.\n\"What the hell...\"\nLee Sa-young propped himself up on his elbows, bringing their faces closer.\n\"When did I... why are we like this... wait.\"\nHe narrowed his eyes and scanned Cha Eui-jae's face, tilting his head. His hand shot out, cupping Cha Eui-jae's chin and cheek. Lee Sa-young examined his face, frowning.\n\"Why is your face so red... do you have a fever?\"\n\"My face?\"\n\"Wait a minute...\"\nLee Sa-young hesitated and clutched his head again, right where Cha Eui-jae had punched him. Cha Eui-jae averted his gaze. He looked like a dog who had done something wrong. Lee Sa-young blinked.\n\"Hyung.\"\n\"...Yeah.\"\n\"Did you hit me?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"Wait, then... why does my neck...\"\nLee Sa-young rubbed his neck and cleared his throat. It was exactly where Cha Eui-jae had choked him. Cha Eui-jae turned his head further, almost looking over his shoulder now. Lee Sa-young tilted his head.\n\"Hyung.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You know, don't you?\"\nCha Eui-jae snapped his head back. Surprisingly, Lee Sa-young looked uneasy.\nWhat did he mean, \"know\"? That there was another Lee Sa-young inside him? Or was there something else he had been hiding? Cha Eui-jae was just as confused, but he couldn't miss this opportunity.\nCha Eui-jae nodded. It was time to pull out the old skills from his part-time job at the hangover soup restaurant.\n\"Yeah.\"\nFeign ignorance and agree. Most people spilled their secrets after being nudged a little. Lee Sa-young narrowed his eyes briefly before lowering his lashes, deep in thought.\n\"...Where did you hear it? You don't even have a phone...\"\nCha Eui-jae folded his arms and stared intently at Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young, busy thinking, let out a short sigh.\n\"Oh...\"\nHe ruffled his hair in frustration.\n\"Damn it. You saw it on the Hunter channel, didn't you?\"\nNormally, this guy wouldn't have given away any clues, but now he was just spilling everything on his own. Must be disoriented. Good thing I hit him on the head, thought Cha Eui-jae, letting out a scoff loud enough for him to hear. He hadn't opened the Hunter channel in a while, so he scrolled through the backlog of messages.\nAnd what greeted him was...\n.\n.\n.\n[5] Gyu-Gyu: J, come to chat~\n[5] Gyu-Gyu: If you don't show up, I'm gonna assume you two are dating for real~\n[8] I Am An Artisan: Do we even need more words?\n[8] I Am An Artisan: You saw the picture too.\n[8] I Am An Artisan: He was carrying them like they were a sacred treasure.\n[29] Marble Seller Boy: Uh, what's going on again?\n[8] I Am An Artisan: Another latecomer.\n[8] I Am An Artisan: Hurry up and read the article.\n[8] I Am An Artisan: J and 240 are dating, it says.\nWhat?\n[11] Shield Guy: Ugh...\n[11] Shield Guy: We don't know anything either.\n[11] Shield Guy: The guild's phone line has been cut off.\n[11] Shield Guy: Don't contact us.\n[11] Shield Guy: I'm going into a dungeon too.\n[6] Honeybee: Hey, aren't you gonna give a straight answer?\n[6] Honeybee: What's the deal with those two, seriously?\n[6] Honeybee: Are they dating?\n[6] Honeybee: Or are they scheming something together?\n[11] Shield Guy: Shield Guy is currently unavailable.\n[6] Honeybee: \"Currently unavailable\"? Are you kidding me?\n[6] Honeybee: Hey, Seo Min-gi, come out!\n[34] A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi: A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi is currently unavailable.\n[8] I Am An Artisan: This sneaky behavior is wild.\n[6] Honeybee: Huh.\n[5] Gyu-Gyu: Hahahahahaha.\n[6] Honeybee: Why don't you all just say you're dating too?\n[11] Shield Guy: Please refrain from saying \"dating.\" I have PTSD from that.\n[6] Honeybee: Ugh.\nCha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young by the collar as he fumbled around his throat. His eyes glowed bright blue.\n\"What did you do?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 176: Wavelength\n\"What did you do?\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"I said, what did you do!\"\nDespite having his collar grabbed, Lee Sa-young just blinked with a blank expression, showing no resistance. He still didn't seem fully conscious.\nBut Cha Eui-jae wasn't in his right mind either. He couldn't even calm his pounding heart, still reeling from Lee Sa-young's shocking statement, only to now be faced with this unbelievable reality. The dating rumors, which had seemed like nothing more than idle chatter, had exploded to the point of even being discussed in the Hunter channel!\n'What the hell did those Mackerels do?'\nThey said one call would clear things up, but it seems like that was all empty words. Cha Eui-jae ground his teeth.\n'It would've been better if the rumors were about us being enemies or rivals.'\nCha Eui-jae, in an attempt to snap Lee Sa-young back to his senses, shook the collar he was gripping. Lee Sa-young's head bobbed weakly. Soon, Lee Sa-young winced and grabbed his head.\n\"Hyung...\"\n\"Speak clearly.\"\n\"It hurts...\"\nCha Eui-jae loosened his grip on Lee Sa-young's collar. Or rather, his strength just gave out. A groan escaped from Lee Sa-young's lips.\nHad it been so long since he'd hit someone that he lost control of his strength? Even if he's an S-grade, could it still hurt? It must, right? While Cha Eui-jae was lost in thought, Lee Sa-young slowly lifted his body, then promptly buried his face into Cha Eui-jae's shoulder.\nThe soft hair brushing against him woke Cha Eui-jae up. He quickly grabbed the arm that was wrapped around his waist like a snake.\n\"You're trying to get away with this by being cute again, aren't you?\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been burying his face in Cha Eui-jae's shoulder, lifted his head. With his cheek resting on Cha Eui-jae's shoulder, Lee Sa-young gazed up at him with a sulky expression.\n\"It really hurts...\"\n\"...\"\nIs he acting right now, or is he really hurt? Cha Eui-jae was still feeling uneasy. He glanced at Lee Sa-young's pale, slender neck and saw red marks where his hand had been. Cha Eui-jae scratched his head. Sharing a body like this was more uncomfortable than he expected.\n\"Does your neck hurt?\"\n\"Yes, and my head.\"\nA small cough escaped. Cha Eui-jae, now awkward, muttered while staring off into space.\n\"...I kind of choked you.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nLee Sa-young let out a soft sigh, squinting his eyes. His black fingers grazed the red marks on his neck. Now that his senses had returned, his eyes glinted with interest, the dullness gone. His lips curled into a smile.\n\"So, that's your thing, huh?\"\n\"No, it's not!\"\nCha Eui-jae shouted abruptly. Lee Sa-young, still rubbing his neck, murmured.\n\"Choking people is kind of...a bad habit, don't you think?\"\n\"When I woke up, there wasn't you but some other guy standing there, so what was I supposed to do?\"\n\"Oh... And you choked without saying a word? That's pretty violent...\"\n\"That guy was saying weird things.\"\n\"What weird things?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae clammed up. He didn't want to repeat the vile words that had been spoken. Lee Sa-young squirmed against his waist, nudging him to speak. When Cha Eui-jae looked down, Lee Sa-young's expression was surprisingly calm, despite being possessed and attacked.\nWell, it was probably better to explain everything now rather than letting things spiral out of control. Cha Eui-jae mumbled and began to speak.\n\"He suggested that we sleep together...\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLee Sa-young frowned. Cha Eui-jae hurriedly clarified.\n\"Just to sleep! Literally sleep! Nothing weird!\"\n\"I wasn't going to misunderstand, but now it seems like you're the one who had weird thoughts, Hyung.\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae clenched his fist and shook it, Lee Sa-young smiled and made an X over his mouth with his fingers. He raised his eyebrows.\n\"I get it, keep talking. What happened next?\"\n\"Then he asked me to choke him more... I mean, is that guy crazy? Why would he want to be choked more?\"\n\"Oh... So you choked him again? Is that why my neck is like this?\"\n\"Are you nuts? I let go right away.\"\n\"Sigh...\"\nLee Sa-young sighed deeply, blinking slowly as if exhausted.\n\"And then, what else?\"\n\"And then...\"\nCha Eui-jae remembered the face that kept smiling as he choked him.\nAccording to Hong Ye-seong, their 'fundamentals' were the same. By 'fundamentals of the soul,' it must mean the core nature of a person. Even if they lived completely different lives, if their core didn't change, they would be the same being.\nBut...\n\"...\"\n\"Hyung?\"\n\"But it just felt...\"\nBut the Lee Sa-young he had just faced gave him an odd feeling of discomfort. Not because of the absurd suggestion to sleep together or the perverse request to be choked. If someone asked him where the discomfort stemmed from...\nFrom everything that made up Lee Sa-young.\nIn fact, there had been a strange sense of unease from the very first moment he saw him. His eyes, like empty glass beads, reflected nothing but Cha Eui-jae.\nThey say eyes are the windows to the soul. But in the eyes of that Lee Sa-young, there was no soul or self. They only reflected what was in front of them, like a mirror.\nAnd even the energy he gave off felt strange. More like a dungeon than a human...\n\"...\"\n\"It just felt... off.\"\nCha Eui-jae finished his sentence uncomfortably. Lee Sa-young lowered his gaze, deep in thought, and licked his lips. As Cha Eui-jae watched Lee Sa-young's black tongue slide across his red lips, a sharp glare returned to his face.\nHe had almost let himself get sidetracked again. This guy knew exactly how to distract people with his looks and touches before sliding into a different conversation like a snake.\nCha Eui-jae grabbed both of Lee Sa-young's cheeks with his hands. Lee Sa-young's eyes widened as he looked up at him.\n\"Anyway, what did you do?\"\n\"Weren't you already aware of this?\"\n\"Say it yourself. Before I storm over to the fish market.\"\n\"What... I didn't do much.\"\nDidn't do much? No way the Hunter channel would be blowing up over nothing. When Cha Eui-jae shot a glare, Lee Sa-young smirked.\n\"I just did what you did, Hyung.\"\n\"What I did?\"\n\"When I saw you asleep, I picked you up and carried you home.\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slightly, blinking. His eyelashes fluttered.\n\"Is that a crime? I just did what you did, Hyung.\"\nCarried him? Cha Eui-jae's mind flashed to an image associated with that word. A hazy, low-resolution image formed in his head. The photo of J carrying Lee Sa-young. At that time, J had cradled Lee Sa-young like a princess...\n'Fuck.'\nChills ran down Cha Eui-jae's spine. He jumped up from his seat and began rummaging through the room. Lee Sa-young sat on the floor, propping his chin on one knee.\n\"What are you looking for?\"\n\"Where's my phone?\"\n\"I have it.\"\nLee Sa-young pulled Cha Eui-jae's phone out of his pocket and handed it over. Cha Eui-jae snatched the phone and quickly turned it on, connecting to the internet. The headline on the portal site's main page looked ominous.\n[What's the relationship between Lee Sa-young and J? The Pado Guild remains silent...]\nWith trembling hands, Cha Eui-jae clicked on the article. As the loading icon spun for several seconds, Cha Eui-jae's anxiety grew.\nTap, tap, tap. He nervously tapped the floor with his foot. As soon as the article finished loading, Cha Eui-jae found himself staring into Lee Sa-young's eyes. Not the real Lee Sa-young in front of him, but the one in the photo.\nThe Lee Sa-young in the picture was smiling as if he had seen it all...\n\"...\"\nAnd the masked man held him quietly in his arms.\nAs Cha Eui-jae froze, Lee Sa-young stood up lightly and walked behind him. Then he pressed his lips to the nape of Cha Eui-jae's neck, exposed beneath his soft gray hair. Cha Eui-jae's body tensed in response.\nAt the same time, a delayed message notification popped up over the photo on the screen.\nThe sender was;\nHa-eun: Uncle, Grandma's asking if this is true\nThe body in Cha Eui-jae's arms trembled. Lee Sa-young pressed his lips to the end of Cha Eui-jae's hair once more.\n\"They say you can't even drink water carelessly in front of kids.\"\n***\nCha Eui-jae didn't get angry, surprisingly. No, perhaps it was more accurate to say that he didn't have the energy to be angry. He simply stood there trembling with his phone in hand for a while, then suddenly pushed Lee Sa-young away, who had been kissing the back of his neck. Stumbling slightly, he walked toward the bathroom.\nBang!\nThe door slammed shut.\nClick.\nHe locked it.\nEvery action flowed as naturally as water. Lee Sa-young didn't tell him to open the door or knock on it. Instead, he pulled over a chair where he could see the bathroom door, sat down, and waited quietly.\nIt was kind of cute... If he wanted to isolate himself, he could've chosen the bedroom, but hiding in a corner like the bathroom? That was so typical of Cha Eui-jae.\nCha Eui-jae didn't come out for a full hour, and aside from the occasional heavy sigh or muffled scream, there was little sound from inside.\nLee Sa-young, who was now sitting backward on the chair with his arms resting on the backrest and his chin propped on top, rolled his eyes. Once separated from Cha Eui-jae, the unwelcome guest within him began to stir again. His consciousness, which had been focused on Cha Eui-jae, slowly drifted toward the intruder. Cha Eui-jae's voice echoed in his mind.\n\"Then he asked me to choke him more... I mean, is that guy crazy? Why would he want to be choked more?\"\nLee Sa-young let out a short sigh.\n'Why, you ask...'\nHe knew why the intruder had acted that way. Resting his cheek on his arm, Lee Sa-young relaxed his body.\nCould someone who wandered alone in a world on the verge of destruction for a very long time still be normal?\n'No way...'\nLike a large rock eroded by water and wind, both the body and mind would have gradually worn away. Once everything had been worn down, even the emotions that once consumed him would've eroded as well.\nSorrow, anger, regret— all of it would've vanished. And in their place, he would've spent each day ruminating on nothing but his purpose.\nOnly obsession would remain.\n'Am I right?'\nThe intruder didn't respond. But Lee Sa-young knew he was right. He could feel the other version of himself writhing in discomfort.\nHow would someone who had lost everything, including their own body, react upon having a living body again? They would surely be excited by stimuli that once felt familiar but now seemed foreign. Especially if the one providing those stimuli was Cha Eui-jae...\nLee Sa-young touched his still throbbing neck. He didn't need to check to know that there was probably a bruise. Closing his eyes, he listened to the sound of water running— Cha Eui-jae must have turned on the faucet.\nWas there anything that made one feel more alive than the stimuli that Cha Eui-jae provided?\n'If it were me, I would've asked for more too...'\nLee Sa-young understood the other Lee Sa-young's feelings. And it deeply disturbed him.",

      "content": "Chapter 177: Wavelength\nIt took Cha Eui-jae an hour and a half more to finally open the locked door. During that time, Lee Sa-young waited patiently. In fact, it wasn't even about patience. Compared to the time he'd already spent waiting, this was just a fleeting moment.\nHearing footsteps approaching the door, Lee Sa-young lifted his head. Cha Eui-jae, sticking just his head out of the door, squinted at him.\n\"...What are you doing there?\"\n\"I waited for you... until you came out.\"\nLee Sa-young, with his cheek resting on his arm draped over the back of a chair, narrowed his eyes and smiled.\n\"Have you calmed down a bit?\"\nStill hiding behind the door, Cha Eui-jae glared at Lee Sa-young.\n\"This is all Mackerel's move, isn't it?\"\n\"Well, I suppose it is.\"\n\"I saw the pictures. It was almost like you threatened them to take good shots. Wasn't that your doing?\"\n\"Ah, so even you think the photos came out well. That's a relief...\"\n\"You little... Those guys are not going to get away with this.\"\nCha Eui-jae, spitting out curses, strode over. His expression was far from calm, as if he was ready to march into a fish market and thrash some mackerels. Lee Sa-young, deliberately tilted his head to show off the handprint still visible on his neck. Cha Eui-jae's menacing aura softened a bit at the sight.\n\"But thanks to the article, all the other issues were swept under the rug.\"\nLee Sa-young thought that it would be nice if the bruise lasted longer. Maybe when it started to fade, he could ask for another one. His lips curled into a smile at the sudden thought. He reached out and grabbed Cha Eui-jae's coat hem as he approached.\n\"I think we used our names to quell any anxiety.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Does that make you feel a little better?\"\nBut Cha Eui-jae, without answering, kept his mouth shut. There was a strange shadow over his face that Lee Sa-young didn't like.\nLee Sa-young studied his expression, trying to read his thoughts. This topic needs to be dropped, he decided, smoothly changing the subject.\n\"Aren't you hungry? You've been sleeping for quite a while.\"\n\"Ah, a little.\"\n\"Let's go downstairs and eat. I'll have them bring food to the guild leader's office.\"\n\"Do we really have to? Can't we eat here?\"\n\"Oh... do you want to eat here? In your shirts?\"\nLee Sa-young smiled mischievously and slipped his fingers inside Cha Eui-jae's shirt. Cha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young's wrist and pulled it off.\n\"Hey, someone could see us. We'd have to take off the masks to eat.\"\n\"No one can just walk into the guild leader's office. Besides, I've got work piled up that I need to do.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you're that worried... Should I have someone stand watch at the door?\"\n\"No, we don't need to go that far...\"\nCha Eui-jae's expression turned reluctant. Whether Lee Sa-young was aware or not, seeing that face made him want to tease him even more. He got up from his chair and motioned toward the entrance with his chin. Cha Eui-jae, fiddling with the buttons of his loose shirt, muttered in response.\n\"Let me just change clothes first. Where are my clothes?\"\n\"In the dressing room. Your mask's there, too.\"\nCha Eui-jae headed toward the dressing room as if it were his own house. It was a nice sight, seeing him navigate the room so naturally. The sound of rustling clothes followed as he undressed and dressed. Lee Sa-young crossed his arms, listening to the noises. After a brief sigh, Cha Eui-jae emerged, now completely transformed into J.\nAll it took was putting on a mask, but the atmosphere was completely different from the loose and relaxed Cha Eui-jae. The mask, which concealed not just his expression but his entire face, exuded an eerie pressure.\nA little later, the two stepped into the elevator side by side. It had only been a few months since they last rode the elevator together, but it felt like ages ago. Back then, Cha Eui-jae had picked a corner to stand in, alert to everything around him. Now, he stood calmly next to Lee Sa-young.\nLee Sa-young, staring at Cha Eui-jae's light gray hair, asked,\n\"By the way, do your grandmother and Ha-eun know that you're J?\"\n\"Hm? No.\"\nCha Eui-jae gave a brief answer.\n\"I told them I closed the hangover soup restaurant... and that I'd be working at the Pado Guild now. They only know I'm a hunter.\"\n\"But the text earlier... it seemed like they knew.\"\n\"...I don't think so?\"\nHe tilted his head as if something didn't add up.\nCha Eui-jae hadn't told them he was J. Not when he first showed up to eat white broth soup at their house, nor when he later asked to work at their shop.\nThe elevator doors opened. As Lee Sa-young had mentioned, the floor where the guild leader's office was located was quiet.\nCha Eui-jae walked down the hallway, his footsteps echoing. Then suddenly, he came to an abrupt stop.\n\"Oh.\"\nA long-forgotten memory seemed to have surfaced. Lee Sa-young, walking beside him, looked back in confusion.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"I think... they might know. Yeah, I think they know.\"\nCha Eui-jae absentmindedly rubbed his mask, sweat beginning to form on his face under the mask. His voice, already distorted by the mask, trembled with unease.\n\"Now that I think about it... back then, I went there in my J outfit...\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"The clothes I wore when I was J!\"\nCha Eui-jae instinctively followed the scent the moment he opened his eyes, knocked on the door of the hangover soup restaurant, and entered. At that time, the TV in the shop was showing a documentary commemorating the 8th anniversary of the West Sea rift. A picture of J, wearing his battle gear, had even flashed on the screen. His grandmother had been chopping garlic while watching that, and Cha Eui-jae had been standing there in his J uniform, looking ragged.\n'No, she might not have noticed...'\nCha Eui-jae quickly turned to Lee Sa-young.\n\"Hey, Lee Sa-young. Did you watch the J documentary? The one where Hunter Song Jo-heon gets interviewed.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"Did you see it or not? Tell me quickly.\"\n\"Hah.\"\nLee Sa-young looked at him for a moment before scoffing. A short laugh quickly turned into outright derision. Narrowing his eyes, Lee Sa-young responded.\n\"Of course, I saw it... Pado Guild made it.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"From planning to funding and support, Pado Guild handled the whole thing... So yeah, I saw it.\"\n\"Whaaat?\"\n\"I swear... Next time, we should slap the guild logo on it, too.\"\nLee Sa-young muttered in disbelief. Was that so? Maybe the shock of eight years passing had wiped out all the trivial details from his memory. Cha Eui-jae quickly grabbed Lee Sa-young by the shoulders.\n\"That aside, I didn't watch the whole thing. Just the interview and a bit before it. Did it show me in action?\"\n\"Hm? Of course, it did. It showed you fighting, your pre-entry interview... everything.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why do you ask?\"\nThe uneasiness grew stronger.\nCha Eui-jae desperately tried to recall the past. What had his grandmother done back then?\nHe had finished his meal but had hesitated, unsure what to do since he didn't have money to pay. His grandmother hadn't scolded him but had instead handed him a navy jacket and a black hat.\n\"If you wander around in that state in daylight, you'll get caught. Wear it.\"\nAfter that, he'd sheepishly swapped out his tattered jacket for the one she'd given him and pulled the hat down low. Why had she given him a jacket and a hat? Because of his wounds? No.\n'Did she mean I'd get caught...?'\nCha Eui-jae paled.\nNow that he thought about it, right after coming out of the West Sea rift, he hadn't been in his right mind. He hadn't realized that his clothes would make him easy to identify, or that he should cover his face. He had been focused on satisfying the most basic need— hunger.\nIf it hadn't been for his grandmother's kindness, he might've been caught right then and there. His bare face, and the fact that he had returned. Even his decision to run away.\nCha Eui-jae covered his mouth. His voice trembled uncontrollably.\n\"She must know... She was watching the documentary, and she even gave me a hat...\"\n\"Well, that makes sense.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Seems like you don't realize how much footage of you was shown.\"\nLee Sa-young stared at Cha Eui-jae with an expressionless face, then turned away. His voice, oddly cold, followed.\n\"You were all over the TV back then. People debated all day whether they should send J in or not... When the decision was made to let you enter, they showed all your achievements, your last interview, your back as you entered the rift... They wrung every last bit out of it.\"\nHis tone was that of someone relaying secondhand information. Then again, Lee Sa-young had been in no condition to watch anything at that time. He had been in poor health, barely able to move. This was news even to him. Cha Eui-jae suddenly asked,\n\"Who told you this?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young quietly stared at Cha Eui-jae before shrugging.\n\"Jung Bin.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I lived with him briefly... anyway.\"\nLee Sa-young crossed his arms and tapped them lightly with his fingers.\n\"You were more famous than you thought. There wasn't anyone who didn't know you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, after they set up a memorial stone thinking you were dead, people slowly forgot.\"\nIt was probably inevitable. As time passed, newer, more outstanding hunters would have appeared.\nLike sand burying more sand, people cover old memories with new ones. They wouldn't have remembered a hunter who died trapped in some rift for long. At best, they might think, 'Ah, there was someone like that,' from time to time. They certainly wouldn't have believed he was still alive.\nEven he had lost his way and wandered.\n\"I couldn't have just left it like that.\"\nBut.\n\"Who said they could just forget?\"\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly at Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young, who had been staring straight ahead, turned his head.\n\"Still...\"\nTheir eyes met.\n\"At least spending money on that documentary seems to have been worth it. If they were playing it even in such an out-of-the-way place.\"\nLee Sa-young smiled, lifting the corner of his mouth.\n\"Right?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 178 - Wavelength\nThump.\n'Huh?'\nThump, thump, thump. Suddenly, his heartbeat started pounding loudly. Strangely. Nothing had changed, but something felt off.\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his chest. Meanwhile, Lee Sa-young had already taken a step ahead. His languid voice mixed with a sweet scent lingered in the air. Under the bright hallway lights, only his black silhouette was in Cha Eui-jae's view.\n\"I was going to include an interview with the director, but she kept refusing...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Jung Bin also turned it down, probably because of the director's orders. So, I got a little annoyed.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh, but Song Jo-heon was surprisingly easy. I guess it was because of image management... He agreed right away.\"\nThere was an oddly playful tone in every word he spoke. Pale skin peeking through black hair, a neck marked with bruises from handprints, his swaying coat, and the sharp profile of his nose and lips visible when he slightly turned his head— Lee Sa-young's violet eyes were focused entirely on Cha Eui-jae. The emotion in those eyes...\n\"...Hyung?\"\n\"...\"\n\"What's wrong?\"\nCha Eui-jae found himself looking at Lee Sa-young anew. Had Lee Sa-young always had such broad shoulders? Was he always this tall? He was now a half-head taller than Cha Eui-jae, who was already not short. When Cha Eui-jae didn't follow and stood frozen, Lee Sa-young turned around to face him.\nOddly enough, there was no trace of the boy whose life Cha Eui-jae had once saved. In front of him stood a fully-grown man. Without thinking, Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"Why did you make it?\"\n\"Make what? Oh, the documentary?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Sa-young blinked as if Cha Eui-jae had said something strange. His response was so matter-of-fact, like it was the most obvious thing.\n\"I told you. I made it because stupid people kept forgetting you.\"\n\"The dead are bound to be forgotten. With time, everything...\"\n\"Who said anyone's dead... Ugh, why are you suddenly acting like this?\"\n\"Anyway, it was known that I was dead. They even put up a memorial stone.\"\n\"Are you so hungry that it's making you lose your mind?\"\nLee Sa-young snapped irritably. Uncrossing his arms, he pointed his finger at Cha Eui-jae's face. Beyond his hand, those piercing violet eyes stared directly at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"The one who grabbed my hand first was you, Cha Eui-jae.\"\nCha Eui-jae remembered the face he had encountered in the ruins. Barely clinging to life, with a faint heartbeat, a chest rising and falling weakly, lips moving silently. A quiet plea for salvation.\n\"Please save me.\"\nCha Eui-jae had reached out his hand. And,\n\"It's okay.\"\nHe had grabbed the withered, deformed hand, melted away by venom, without the slightest hesitation.\nCha Eui-jae blinked. The withered hand was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a large, strong hand was now pointing directly at him. Lee Sa-young spoke as if spitting out the words.\n\"You promised me you'd come back.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I just kept my promise.\"\nCha Eui-jae slightly parted his lips. He thought it was such a selfish request. Back then, Cha Eui-jae had no certainty that he would even survive. He had only reached out to the one hand he could hold onto, just like a drowning person grabs at anything they can.\nBut that boy.\nThat Lee Sa-young.\nEven now, after eight years, he had not let go of his hand.\nCha Eui-jae felt his throat close up, unable to speak. What was the basis of this unwavering faith? The source of this endless belief? Lee Sa-young sighed, pulling his hand away from Cha Eui-jae's face. He began fiddling with his own hair with his black fingers.\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you get it, come on. We need to eat something. This isn't good...\"\nLee Sa-young clicked his tongue and turned around. But Cha Eui-jae couldn't move. No, he couldn't make himself move.\n\"...\"\nIt felt like the ground beneath his feet was melting away. His fingertips and toes tingled. His heart was beating faster and faster, to the point where it made him feel breathless. His head felt blank.\nCha Eui-jae could barely swallow. He breathed, blinked, swallowed— each natural action felt forced. Every sense in his body was acutely, intensely focused on one thing. On Lee Sa-young.\nLee Sa-young's movements, as he turned back around, appeared in slow motion.\nHe blinked. With each blink, his long eyelashes fluttered. His plump lips parted slightly. His chest rose and fell faintly. His eyebrows shifted a little, and his brow furrowed slightly. His head tilted slightly to the right, causing his hair to sway. That sweet scent filled the air. His black fingertips, resting against his cheek, trembled slightly.\nCha Eui-jae covered his mask with both hands. Even if he could block out his sight, he couldn't block his sense of smell or hearing.\n\"Hyung?\"\nLee Sa-young's curious voice called out to him. Cha Eui-jae's fingers fidgeted against the mask. Damn it.\n'Why is this happening all of a sudden?'\nCha Eui-jae exhaled a slightly labored breath. He felt like he was suffocating, despite not being underwater.\nIf he kept facing Lee Sa-young like this, he'd collapse soon. He had a sudden, sharp instinct that this couldn't go on. Without realizing it, he took a step back. Then he quickly scanned his surroundings. He spotted the emergency exit door next to the elevator they had come down from. The green emergency light blinked.\n\"...Hup.\"\nCha Eui-jae inhaled sharply. And then,\nTap, tap, tap!\nHe bolted toward the emergency exit. Lee Sa-young, who had been staring at him in disbelief, clenched his teeth and ran his hand through his hair.\n\"What the... What are you doing now?!\"\nCha Eui-jae began to dash down the long staircase. Shortly after, he heard the sound of footsteps thudding down behind him. They were hot on his heels. He could see a glimpse of Lee Sa-young's coat flapping behind him. Lee Sa-young shouted,\n\"Why are you acting like this? Are you crazy?\"\nI feel like I'm going crazy if I don't! Why!\nCha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and began leaping down several steps at a time. Thud, thud, thud— his legs were holding up fine. But Lee Sa-young wasn't far behind either. Damn it. He thought he heard a curse from behind, and then the footsteps seemed to take on a rhythm. He must be jumping too. That's when Cha Eui-jae yelled,\n\"Don't follow me!\"\n\"Tell me why you're acting like this! Have you lost it? Or do you suddenly feel guilty?\"\n\"It's not that, so stop following me!\"\n\"How would I know if you don't say anything?!\"\n\"You don't say anything either!\"\n\"Are you seriously having this conversation right now? What the hell are you doing?\"\nLee Sa-young was fuming.\n\"If you've got something to get off your chest, at least do it somewhere quiet and in person! Does this make any sense, having this conversation while running down the stairs?!\"\nHe had a point. Cha Eui-jae was about to respond but quickly looked down. And he froze. Someone was standing by the emergency exit door, mouth agape, watching them.\nJudging by the uniform and name tag, it seemed to be a member of the Pado Guild. Ah, I didn't think of this. After all this yelling, of course someone was going to check it out!\nCha Eui-jae clenched his teeth and moved his feet even faster. Thud, thud, thud— he could hear Lee Sa-young letting out a frustrated sigh from behind him. The presence behind him felt even more dangerous.\n\"Are you going to stop? How far are you planning to run?\"\nAll the way to hell!\n\"Stop now! Otherwise, how are we going to talk, damn it!\"\nBut the more Lee Sa-young pressed, the more stubborn Cha Eui-jae became. He didn't stop. The lower he went, the more people he felt around him, and the more Pado Guild members came out to see what was happening.\nThey gasped in shock when they saw Cha Eui-jae in his black mask, and screamed in fear when they saw Lee Sa-young, full of fury, chasing after him.\n5th floor, 4th floor, 3rd floor— they were getting closer to the lobby. Cha Eui-jae quickly recalled the layout of the Pado Guild building from his last visit. If he went out the main door, too many eyes would be on him. He'd need to hide somewhere, escape through the back, or break through a window. Good. Perfect plan.\n2nd floor,\n1st floor.\nScreech! His boots slid on the smooth floor. Cha Eui-jae grabbed the emergency exit door handle. Clatter. It rattled in his hand; the door was locked.\nHe glanced up to assess the situation. Lee Sa-young didn't look tired at all, except for his messy hair. And it was the coldest expression Cha Eui-jae had ever seen on his face. His heart was pounding erratically. He couldn't tell if it was from running down dozens of flights of stairs or because of Lee Sa-young.\nCha Eui-jae roughly grabbed the door handle. Without hesitation, he kicked the door.\nBoom—!!\nBright light poured in. Cha Eui-jae quickly scanned his surroundings. Thanks to the glass, the wide lobby of the Pado Guild was fully visible along with the outside view.\nBeyond the main entrance, there was a crowd of people. In one corner of the lobby, there was a company café where several hunters from the Pado Guild were sitting. He recognized some of the faces. He even made eye contact with Bae Won-woo, who, in shock, spat out his coffee.\nA menacing aura loomed from behind him. If he was caught, he'd die. Cha Eui-jae bolted forward. Lee Sa-young, who had followed him out, shouted urgently.\n\"Wait, Hyu...!\"\nLee Sa-young briefly glanced around and swallowed the word \"Hyung\", realizing where they were. Instead, he called out a name he had once repeated many times, long ago.\n\"J!\"\nJ glanced back, but only for a brief moment. He began running for his life again. Lee Sa-young took in the scene of the lobby and let out a bitter laugh.\n\"Ah... this is driving me crazy, seriously.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nBae Won-woo let out a dazed sigh. He didn't even have any coffee left to spill.\nAt that moment, a black head suddenly popped out from Lee Sa-young's shadow. It was Seo Min-gi, wearing his usual sunglasses. He slowly pulled his upper body out and placed a paper bag on the ground. It had the logo of a nearby Korean restaurant on it. Seo Min-gi blinked, confused, as he looked around.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Guild Leader? Why are you in the lobby? Weren't you in your office?\"\n\"...Immediately.\"\n\"Sorry?\"\nLee Sa-young, now watching Cha Eui-jae's rapidly disappearing figure turn into a black dot in the distance, pointed at him.\n\"Chase him. Now!\"",

A deep sigh escaped. Bae Won-woo clutched his head, letting out a groan. He felt like he had sighed this hopelessly not long ago.\nFirst floor of the Pado Guild building, the in-house café. Just a moment ago, the café had been bustling, but now it was quiet. Only three people sat there, lonely in the emptiness.\nBae Won-woo let out another deep sigh, as if the earth itself would collapse.\n\"Haah...\"\n\"Stop sighing already, Vice-Guild Leader.\"\n\"...They saw everything, right?\"\n\"Well, we tried to block it... but they probably saw the important parts.\"\nA fresh scent of grass filled the air. The windows that once gave a clear view outside were now covered with vibrant greenery and flowers. Leaves fluttered gently. Kang Ji-soo stirred her strawberry latte with a straw. Her dark green eyes gleamed with a brilliant emerald hue. The café counter was now manned not by a part-time worker but by a vine-like human figure.\nBae Won-woo muttered.\n\"I should've just gone straight into the dungeon... Why did I bother getting coffee...\"\n\"What's the point of regretting what's already done, Vice-Guild Leader? You should be thinking about how to fix it.\"\n\"What on earth is this, Sa-young? How many times are you planning to make the front page of the newspaper?\"\n\"This time it's not my fault...\"\nA low, displeased voice responded. Lee Sa-young had his legs crossed, massaging his temple with his eyes closed.\nThe long dial tone stopped, and soon a notification announced that the call could not be connected. His delicate brow furrowed slightly. Lee Sa-young dialed again, his cold voice muttering.\n\"Now he's not even picking up...\"\nBae Won-woo cautiously spoke.\n\"J... and, uh... they must've had a reason for playing 'catch me if you can,' right?\"\n\"I don't know...\"\nA grinding sound came from his clenched teeth. An ominous aura flickered behind Lee Sa-young, who was dressed in a pitch-black coat. He spat out his words bitterly.\n\"Damn it. I asked them to eat, and they bolted like their feet were on fire. How is that my fault?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Tell me, Bae Won-woo. Is it my fault for asking someone who slept all day to grab a meal?\"\n\"N-no... Asking someone to eat is a nice thing to do...\"\n\"No matter what I said, they didn't respond. What, do they not want to eat with me? Not even talk to me? Run away like that?\"\nHis voice grew more and more heated the longer he talked. This was dangerous. If things kept going like this, he might explode.\nKang Ji-soo and Bae Won-woo exchanged glances. You talk to him first. No? The Vice-Guild Leader should talk first. After silently debating for a while, Kang Ji-soo widened her eyes, daring him. Finally, Bae Won-woo broke the silence.\n\"Sa-young. Maybe... did you, um, did you imprison J?\"\n\"What? Ha...\"\nLee Sa-young scoffed. A fierce smile appeared on his delicate face.\n\"Are you blind? Does J look like someone who could be imprisoned?\"\n\"That's not it, but... there's always the possibility of 'what if' in the world, right?\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Sa-young answered firmly, and Bae Won-woo sighed in relief. He sneaked a glance at the back of his neck. A dark bruise, shaped like a handprint, stood out clearly. The body of an S-grade is tough— strong enough that only a great force could leave even a scratch. To leave such a clear mark on a body that resilient...\nAh, he didn't want to know anymore. Lee Sa-young was someone he had raised, cared for, and nurtured, through thick and thin. He didn't want to know about his rough romantic entanglements. But the signs were all too obvious, even to someone as clueless as Bae Won-woo. Everything pointed to one conclusion.\nHe covered his face in despair. If only he were a bit more oblivious!\nAt that moment, Kang Ji-soo slammed her glass down with a sharp sound.\n\"For now!\"\nBae Won-woo and Lee Sa-young both looked up at the same time. Despite their sharp gazes, she clapped her hands without showing a hint of fear.\n\"Seo Min-gi said they followed J, right?\"\nA Small Miracle Seo Min-gi that emerged from Lee Sa-young's shadow, had immediately merged back into the shadows after receiving orders, without even grasping the situation. Bae Won-woo nodded.\n\"Y-yeah, that's right.\"\n\"Seo Min-gi won't be able to defeat J, but they should've at least secured their location, right? Probably turned on GPS too.\"\n\"That makes sense.\"\n\"If we just sit here talking amongst ourselves, we won't get any answers.\"\nShe raised her index finger sharply.\n\"Vice-Guild Leader, call Choi Go-yo.\"\n\"Huh? Got it.\"\n\"And Guild Leader...\"\nKang Ji-soo added seriously.\n\"Try looking pitiful.\"\n***\n\"Ha...\"\nCha Eui-jae leaned on the building's railing, gazing up at the sky filled with swirling white ash. The ash fell like snow, indifferent to his feelings. He clicked his tongue in frustration. His phone vibrated incessantly in his hand. Running away had been a good idea, sure. But...\nThere was nowhere to go.\n'How can there be nowhere to go...'\nCha Eui-jae rested his chin on his arm. The hangover soup restaurant was too obvious, Jung Bin was probably busy, and Hong Ye-seong's cozy love nest... Cha Eui-jae shook his head, pushing the thought aside. Too much hassle. Going to Hong Ye-seong to avoid Lee Sa-young would be like jumping from one hell to another.\n'Maybe I should buy a house?'\nHe remembered that Han Seok-jeong was managing his old place. Maybe he should go there... Cha Eui-jae let out a small sigh.\n\"Sir, please return my phone. I'm begging you, this is life or death for me.\"\nSeo Min-gi, tied to the rooftop railing by his wrist with a necktie, pleaded. The knot was loose enough to untie easily, but what truly bound him was not the necktie— it was Cha Eui-jae.\nThe phone buzzed again. Cha Eui-jae glanced at the caller ID. Guild Leader. Since he hadn't answered, it seemed the leader had shifted focus to Seo Min-gi. Cha Eui-jae crouched in front of him, showing him the phone screen.\n\"Answer and tell them you lost me.\"\n\"Uh? But...\"\nCrack, Cha Eui-jae silently cracked his knuckles. Seo Min-gi nodded quickly. The guild leader was far away, but Cha Eui-jae's fists were right here. Cha Eui-jae slid the call to answer and held the phone up to Seo Min-gi's ear. Seo Min-gi steadied his breath and spoke.\n\"Yes, Guild Leader.\"\n—...\n\"Guild Leader?\"\nThe phone was silent for a long moment before a soft intake of breath came through.\n—J is there with you, isn't he?\n\"W-what? No, no, not at all!\"\nSeo Min-gi's voice cracked and squeaked as his attempt at lying fell apart miserably. Cha Eui-jae grabbed Seo Min-gi by the collar and mouthed the words;\n\"Do you want to die?\"\nSeo Min-gi frantically shook his head. His sunglasses rattled against the phone screen. Meanwhile, Lee Sa-young remained silent. Finally, his voice, now subdued, asked quietly.\n—Did I do something wrong?\n\"...\"\nSeo Min-gi's jaw dropped. Cha Eui-jae, holding the phone, was equally stunned. He had never heard that tone from him before. Lee Sa-young continued to mutter.\n—I just wanted to have a meal with you, but you ran off like that...\n...Is that so?\nCome to think of it, Lee Sa-young must have been taken aback too. They had been talking normally, and he suddenly bolted. But still...\nCha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck. Hearing his voice made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. His ears itched, and his fingers curled involuntarily.\n'If just his voice is doing this, how could I possibly face him in person!'\n—...Hyung, are you angry? Are you really not going to answer me?\nCha Eui-jae opened his mouth but then stopped, holding his breath. He felt like his voice would come out weird if he spoke now. Meanwhile, Seo Min-gi, sensing Cha Eui-jae's mood, untied the necktie around his wrist. He slowly scooted away, inching further from the phone.\nJust as Cha Eui-jae was about to say something, Lee Sa-young spoke first.\n—Then I'll...\nSomething appeared behind him. It was a sensation he'd felt a few times before. Cha Eui-jae immediately turned around. A large door had appeared in the middle of the rooftop. Slowly, the door creaked open. On the other side was a space filled with greenery, like a botanical garden. The scent of fresh grass wafted in.\n\"Eek.\"\nRomantic Opener, clinging to the doorknob, let out a faint squeak as he fainted. Long legs gracefully stepped over Romantic Opener's limp body and touched down on the rooftop floor. A black coat fluttered. Cha Eui-jae muttered silently.\nShit.\n\"...I do have some sense.\"\nShit!",

      "content": "Chapter 180 - Wavelength\nLee Sa-young, still holding the phone to his ear, stared directly at Cha Eui-jae. He then made a point of ending the call and tilted his head slightly. As soon as Cha Eui-jae heard the beep, he shot to his feet and stumbled backward, hitting the railing with his waist.\nShould I just jump? He glanced downward. From this height, he figured he'd be fine even if he fell. But Lee Sa-young immediately reacted.\n\"Where are you looking? Turn your eyes back here.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Look at me.\"\nSmart bastard. Cha Eui-jae held onto the railing, determined. If push came to shove, he really would jump. Lee Sa-young smiled, but there wasn't even a hint of laughter in his eyes.\n\"Oh... are you going to fall?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Should I fall with you? This time, instead of the stairs, maybe we should run down the main road, side by side. That would make for an even better rumor, don't you think?\"\nWho do you think is responsible for this? You don't even understand how I feel. Cha Eui-jae, on the verge of snapping and saying, \"Fine, let's both die then!\" was interrupted by a dull voice from behind Lee Sa-young.\n\"Guild Leader, don't you know what it means to be pitiful? You're supposed to act pitiful, not pick a fight.\"\nBeyond the black coat, a red head popped out from the door. It was Kang Ji-soo, whom Cha Eui-jae had glimpsed earlier in the lobby. Next to her was Bae Won-woo, scratching his head with a grimace. Lee Sa-young shrugged.\n\"Oh... I've never really been pitiful before, so I wouldn't know. My bad?\"\nInstead of answering, Cha Eui-jae turned his head slightly, enough so only Lee Sa-young's black coat remained in his sight. He heard a faint chuckle from Lee Sa-young. In his place, what entered Cha Eui-jae's vision was Seo Min-gi, crawling toward the door on all fours.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nSensing eyes on him, Seo Min-gi glanced back, nodded solemnly, and bowed his head.\n\"This seems to be a matter that you and the Guild Leader need to resolve personally, sir.\"\nThen he resumed crawling. Resolve it? How? I'm not even in the right state of mind! But before Cha Eui-jae could say anything, Seo Min-gi had reached the door.\nHe grabbed the doorknob, scooped up the collapsed Romantic Opener, and said,\n\"Good luck!\"\n\"I hope you have a meaningful conversation.\"\nThen, he shut the door behind him.\nBAM!\nThe sound of the door slamming was like the fall of a guillotine. Soon after, the door vanished, as if it had never existed, dissolving into dust. Only the two of them remained on the rooftop. Cha Eui-jae deliberately turned his head away. White ash gently fell, soft as snow.\nA short breath escaped him. Lee Sa-young ran a hand through his hair, the soft curls scattering.\nCha Eui-jae suddenly noticed that Lee Sa-young was holding a square shopping bag in his left hand, with a logo from a Korean set-menu restaurant. Seeing it made something in his chest churn strangely. Lee Sa-young's voice, low and calm, asked,\n\"Do you hate seeing me?\"\nNo.\n\"Then why did you run away?\"\n...\n\"Did I do something wrong?\"\nIt was the same question as earlier, but the atmosphere and the tone were different. Cha Eui-jae found it oddly amusing that the accusatory tone suited Lee Sa-young so well. That bold confidence, almost enough to irritate, suited him. Slowly, Cha Eui-jae turned his head. He opened his mouth slightly.\nThe expression on Lee Sa-young's face in front of him was...\n\"If I did something wrong, you should tell me what it was. You usually talk just fine, but suddenly, you're keeping your mouth shut. What's going on?\"\nIt was an expression he had never seen before.\n\"Answer me, Cha Eui-jae.\"\nLee Sa-young's delicate face gradually twisted. His violet eyes blazed with intensity, but the corners of his eyes reddened, as if he were about to cry.\nCha Eui-jae's mind went blank. His grip tightened on the railing. With a loud creak, the iron rail twisted under the pressure. Lee Sa-young spoke again, clearly and deliberately, enunciating each word.\n\"I can't know everything. If you don't tell me, I won't know.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Guessing and assuming only goes so far. How long do you expect me to wait?\"\nHis breath caught in his throat. His once-empty mind was now flooded with tangled thoughts. What should I say?\n\"Thanks for waiting\"?\nNo, that's too cliché. And would that be appropriate to say to someone on the verge of tears? Should I apologize? But I already did. Can I repeat what I've already said?\nWhenever Cha Eui-jae stood before Lee Sa-young, he always ended up overthinking. But even then, Cha Eui-jae always acted faster than he spoke. He reached out and grabbed Lee Sa-young's arm. The firm muscle he felt through the leather jacket was strangely reassuring.\nExpressing his true feelings was difficult. He hadn't always been the most open about everything, but at some point, it became especially hard. There came a time when his words seemed unnecessary. Since the day every word he said carried more weight than he wanted, he had resorted to action instead. He had to, in order to save more people...\n\"It's not your fault, it's just that I...\"\nCha Eui-jae swallowed hard. His throat felt swollen, and even swallowing was difficult. He stammered, continuing with effort.\n\"It's just... you...\"\nThump, thump, thump— his heart was pounding out of control. It was always like this when he was in front of Lee Sa-young. A large hand covered his own, offering him warmth and comfort. Cha Eui-jae gripped Lee Sa-young's coat, crumpling it slightly.\n\"The fact that you waited for me...\"\nThat was just...\nGulp, he swallowed again.\nWhat does someone who's lost need the most? What does someone who can't even trust themselves need? From the moment Cha Eui-jae entered the West Sea rift, he had been like a kite with its string cut, a ship adrift on a vast sea.\nHe had wandered for what felt like an eternity.\n\"...\"\nUntil one day, for reasons unknown, he had suddenly been flung back out of the West Sea rift. After so long. Cha Eui-jae suddenly stopped breathing and blinked. Fragments of memories flashed before him.\nThunk! A sharp blade pierced through the skull, crushing the windpipe with brutal force. Cha Eui-jae bent over, gripping the sword's hilt tightly, gasping for breath. Huff, huff, huff...\nIt didn't take long for his ragged breathing to slow.\nEven though he had killed the last remaining monster, the rift's gate did not open.\nInstead,\nSilence descended.\nThere was no sound of wind blowing, no rustling of grass, not even the chirping of insects. This world was eerily quiet. He could clearly hear the sound of his heart pounding— thump, thump, thump. It was the only noise. The more he listened to it, the more anxious he became. How ridiculous, to grow nervous from hearing his own heartbeat.\nCha Eui-jae looked up at the sky. The white sky was still raining down ash. Despite killing the last monster, nothing had changed. No— one thing had changed.\nHe was now completely alone.\nHis dry lips parted.\n\"Why...\"\nHe blinked heavily, struggling.\n\"Why won't it open?\"\nCha Eui-jae released his grip from the sword hilt. His hands, which had turned pale from squeezing too hard, slowly regained their color. A sign that he was still alive. He glanced around.\nWhite and red things.\nThings that had stopped.\nThings that were dead.\nI'm the only one alive in this world.\nThe moment he realized that, what hit him was—\n\"I want to go back.\"\nCold sweat dripped down. He felt like throwing up. Cha Eui-jae lifted his head. The blinding white sky was painfully bright. It was unbearable, so he squinted his eyes. Soon, a single tear trailed down his dry cheek.\n\"I want to live...\"\nIt was an unbearable loneliness.\nA sharp pain snapped him back to his senses. He glanced down to see black fingers scratching the back of his hand. A thin, long, red scratch remained on the back of his hand. Cha Eui-jae looked up. Lee Sa-young was staring at him, his face still twisted as if on the verge of crying.\nTheir eyes met. Cha Eui-jae's heart, which had been pounding in anxiety, seemed to slow for a moment, only to start racing even faster.\nThe reason Cha Eui-jae had managed to find his way after being dropped into an unfamiliar place, the reason he hadn't lost his path despite being like a kite with its string cut, floundering in the wind—\nThe hand that covered his own gently rubbed his fingers, as if urging him. There had been days when even such small warmth felt desperately needed.\nAfter the rift, my life felt like it was built on you. And that's why...\n\"I was happy.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So don't cry...\"\nAs he spoke those heavy words, he felt lighter, as if a shackle had been lifted. Haah, Cha Eui-jae exhaled softly and rested his forehead on Lee Sa-young's shoulder.\nThunk, the shopping bag fell to the ground.\nAs if waiting for the moment, a large hand wrapped around the back of his neck. The fingers massaged his nape gently, as if praising him. The other hand circled around his waist, naturally. His shoulder twitched. Cha Eui-jae gasped, goosebumps rising as heat rushed to his head in an instant. Ah, wait.\n'This isn't right.'\nThis shouldn't be happening, but his mind was too jumbled to think clearly, perhaps because of the heat. Instincts urging him to be closer conflicted with reason telling him this was wrong. His hand twitched. His whole body was burning up. Just then, something wet touched his earlobe.\n\"You do need a different kind of advice...\"\nA stinging pain shot through his ear.\n\"Hey, what are you doing...!\"\nCha Eui-jae tried to pull his neck away, but the hand gripping the back of his neck kept him from moving. It felt like he was trapped in a fiery prison called Lee Sa-young. A low chuckle echoed near him. Lick, a tongue swept across his ear. Cha Eui-jae barely stifled a scream.\n\"How was it?\"\n\"W-what?\"\n\"My performance.\"\n\"What?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes shot wide open as he jerked his body back. It was surprisingly easy to lean away. Only then did Lee Sa-young's face come into view. The tear-stained, twisted expression was gone, replaced with a sly smirk tugging at his lips. The redness around his eyes had disappeared as well.\nLee Sa-young stuck out his black tongue.\n\"Gotcha.\"\nAh, damn it.\nCha Eui-jae clenched his teeth and pushed the body wrapped around him away.\n\"Screw off!\"\n\"Why so upset, Hyung?\"\nThe arm that had loosened around his waist quickly tightened again. A firm thigh pressed between his legs. With natural ease, Lee Sa-young lifted Cha Eui-jae slightly, pressing his lips to the jawline of his mask.\n\"After such a fiery confession.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 181 - Wavelength\nWith just the strength of his thighs, his body was lifted high into the air. The feet that had been firmly planted on the ground were now hovering. He was used to looking down at people, but never quite like this. Surprised, Cha Eui-jae pressed his hand over Lee Sa-young's face, trying to push it away.\n\"A confession? What are you talking about? Hey! Are you crazy? get off me!\"\nHowever,\nAs if waiting for it, something wet licked between his palm and fingers. Through the gaps of his parted fingers, he caught a glimpse of violet eyes. Thinly curved, as if laughing in amusement. His fingertips instinctively recoiled. A strange tickling sensation fluttered around his heart.\n\"Don't just call me 'hey.'\"\n\"Move your tongue!\"\n\"You're the one who put your hand on my face first.\"\n\"You shoved your face in first. Let me go, now.\"\n\"If you don't move your hand like this...\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head slightly and began to lightly bite the tip of Cha Eui-jae's thumb. Damn it. Cha Eui-jae squeezed his eyes shut and quickly withdrew his hand. A low chuckle escaped. Every time he heard that laughter, his whole body tingled. It was fortunate he was wearing a mask. He couldn't even imagine how his bare face might look right now.\nCha Eui-jae scolded sharply, for no reason.\n\"You go through all this acting just to hear me say something...\"\nBut he couldn't finish his sentence. Even if the teary eyes were an act, the sight of Lee Sa-young pierced through Cha Eui-jae's heart like an arrow.\n\"Guessing and assuming only goes so far. How long do you expect me to wait?\"\nUnintentionally or not, it was true that he'd kept Lee Sa-young waiting. The sharp energy quickly disappeared, replaced by softer, more subdued words.\n\"...saying something like that.\"\n\"It's only because I have to go this far just to make you speak.\"\nLee Sa-young's reply came in a casual tone. He moved forward a few steps, still holding Cha Eui-jae slightly aloft. Cha Eui-jae's hips bumped into a cold railing. Trying to avoid the overwhelming gaze, he leaned back a little, and the distance beneath him opened up. A cold breeze brushed against his cheek. His ash-gray hair fluttered.\n\"It's hard to get you to answer, and even harder to hear what you're really thinking.\"\nWithout Lee Sa-young's arms holding him, it felt as though he might fall at any moment.\n\"You're used to enduring right up to your limit, for no reason...\"\nThe hand gripping his waist tickled his side.\n\"To get someone so tight-lipped to talk... it takes at least a few tears.\"\n\"...I don't need that.\"\nCha Eui-jae barely managed to get the words out. Lee Sa-young bent forward. Their bodies pressed against each other. Lee Sa-young rested his cheek against Cha Eui-jae's chest, looking up at him. The wind tousled his dark hair.\n\"Were you happy?\"\n\"...\"\nInstead of answering, Cha Eui-jae squeezed his eyes shut, desperately wishing for his heart to stop. He was sure Lee Sa-young could hear every loud thump of his heartbeat.\n\"Come on, answer.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So that I know... it was worth waiting.\"\nEach time Cha Eui-jae breathed, his chest subtly rose and fell, and Lee Sa-young could feel it all. It was so unfair. He was collecting undeniable evidence.\nCha Eui-jae hesitated for a long moment before finally opening his mouth.\n\"...I was happy.\"\nWhy were those three words so difficult to say?\nHis head felt hot. The inside of his mask was burning. The sound of his heartbeat was so loud it was driving him insane.\nHe didn't want to be caught, but at the same time, he did. He wanted Lee Sa-young to not know, but also to notice. He wanted the warmth to go away, but also for it to stay. Ironically, even Cha Eui-jae couldn't fully understand his own feelings.\nAh, this is a mess.\nCha Eui-jae raised his arms and covered the eye holes of his mask. Lee Sa-young chuckled softly, his cheek still pressed against Cha Eui-jae's chest. He looked up and gently pressed a hand to Cha Eui-jae's sternum, his voice filled with laughter.\n\"Why are you so loud? Even a sleeping person would wake up.\"\nDamn it, he never lets anything go. Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth and snapped back.\n\"Shut up...\"\n\"Should I pretend I didn't notice? But I just can't...\"\n\"Pretend you didn't.\"\n\"You know your neck is completely red, right?\"\n\"I don't care, just shut up!\"\n\"Shall I?\"\nHis response was surprisingly compliant. The warmth that had been heating up Cha Eui-jae's body also began to dissipate. Cold air filled the empty space. He thought Lee Sa-young would push further, but... What was this? What was he planning? Cha Eui-jae cautiously lowered the hand that had been covering his eyes. Lee Sa-young was smiling.\n\"I've waited 8 years. I can wait a bit longer.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But still.\"\nAt that moment, fingers slipped beneath the mask. With a click, it was lifted and removed. Cold air blasted against his flushed, overheated face, but only for a moment—\n\"Mmph—!\"\nThe flood of words that had been waiting to spill from his lips were swallowed up. A thick tongue invaded his mouth, rubbing against his own. It felt like he was being devoured. Of all the kisses they'd shared, this one was the roughest. His lips were crushed. Somewhere between the sweetness, he tasted the metallic flavor of blood, probably from biting his lip in the moment they had briefly parted.\nEven the small whimper he let out between gasps was drowned in the wet sound. Cha Eui-jae tried to push Lee Sa-young's shoulders away but slowly gave up, letting his hands fall limp. As if in praise, Lee Sa-young's tongue gently caressed the tender flesh. Cha Eui-jae's body trembled. His eyes filled with heat. The kiss finally broke when he was on the verge of suffocation.\nHis legs gave way, and his feet touched the ground. Cha Eui-jae clutched the railing and leaned forward, coughing harshly. Cough, cough. He looked up sharply to glare at Lee Sa-young.\nBut,\n\"You...\"\n\"Hmm... was it too rough?\"\nLee Sa-young wiped his lips with his thumb. Dark blood dripped from his swollen lips. Not mine— had I bitten him? When? I wasn't even thinking clearly enough to realize I had. A black tongue flicked out to lick away the blood.\n\"No matter how good it felt.\"\n\"There you go, making things up again. 'Good,' my ass...\"\n\"Then, did you hate it?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You're a terrible liar.\"\nOnce Cha Eui-jae finally managed to stand straight, clutching the railing for support, Lee Sa-young snickered. His body was still overheated, but seeing blood helped clear his head a bit. Cha Eui-jae cleared his throat unnecessarily.\n\"Do you have a potion? Hurry up and heal.\"\n\"Hm? Wouldn't that be a waste?\"\n\"What? The potion? You're rich. You've spent tons of magic crystals on strange machines...\"\n\"It's not the potion I'd be wasting.\"\nLee Sa-young raised an eyebrow. Then, with the thumb that had been wiping his lips, he pressed down on the wound. More blood began to flow. Cha Eui-jae was shocked. Had he lost his mind? He hadn't even recovered from the nightmare where Lee Sa-young had begged to be strangled harder! Cha Eui-jae hurried over and grabbed his wrist.\n\"Are you insane? What are you doing!\"\n\"Hm? It'll heal soon anyway. Why waste it?\"\n\"Waste, my ass! You have to heal injuries immediately...\"\nWith a shout, Cha Eui-jae rummaged through his inventory. But all he grabbed was the artisan's spear, a basilisk fang, and... ah, there it was. He held up a bottle.\nWhat he boldly pulled out was;\n[Standard Healing Potion (C)]\n[Restores 10% of health when used.]\nIt was...\n\"...\"\n\"...huh?\"\nWhat is this? Cha Eui-jae stared at the small potion, barely the size of a finger, with a bewildered expression, then let out an \"ah\" as he remembered.\nRight, he got this as a gift back when he worked part-time at the hangover soup restaurant, after people found out he was an Awakener. It was one of those items from the \"A gift box for the newly Awakened ♥\" or something. Probably from that hunter who looked like a Russian bear...\nHope he's doing well.\n\"...\"\nAnyway, Cha Eui-jae glanced between the small red potion and the towering, pitch-black Lee Sa-young. A C-grade potion and an S-grade Awakened. The finger-sized potion and the huge, statue-like Lee Sa-young. Watching his actions, Lee Sa-young chuckled.\n\"How cute.\"\nDamn it. Cha Eui-jae grimaced. Lee Sa-young chuckled softly again and asked, amused,\n\"Oh. Is that actually a real potion, not some mini accessory? You're really carrying that around?\"\nAnnoying. Memories of the nightmare at the hangover soup restaurant resurfaced. Lee Sa-young sitting in the middle of the shop with a gas mask, disrupting business. Coming late at night just to pester him. Lee Sa-young. Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae's shoulders shook with frustration.\n\"...It was a gift.\"\n\"Ah... from who?\"\n\"...A customer at the hangover soup restaurant.\"\n\"That's a precious gift. So... you're going to use that on me?\"\n\"...\"\nWithout a word, Cha Eui-jae opened the potion. With a pop, the lid came off, and he poured the red, transparent liquid into his palm, letting it pool in the cup of his hand. Then he...\nSplat!\n\"Ugh!\"\n...splashed it onto Lee Sa-young's mouth and rubbed it roughly. His rough hands scraped against the injured lips, making Lee Sa-young grimace as he tried to turn his head away, but Cha Eui-jae's hands were quick to follow.\n\"Stay still. This is part of the treatment.\"\n\"Who uses a potion like this, ugh, so recklessly?!\"\n\"This is how we did it back in the day!\"\n\"Oh, really? Go ahead, then! Like that'll heal anything!\"\nAfter wiping Lee Sa-young's lips with his jacket sleeve, Cha Eui-jae frowned. The bite wound was still there, showing no signs of healing. Lee Sa-young, still grimacing, turned his head with a sigh.\n\"With a potion like that, it's not going to heal.\"\n\"Then what are you supposed to use for a wound like this?\"\n\"A special concoction...\"\nJust then, both of them turned their heads sharply. A distant scream echoed faintly, followed by the clash of sharp objects.\nQuickly, Cha Eui-jae extended his hand. Lee Sa-young clicked his tongue but handed him the mask. Cha Eui-jae's flushed face disappeared behind the black mask. He tapped the toe of his boot against the ground and looked at Lee Sa-young.\n\"Can you keep up?\"\n\"Try me. I'll follow you to hell if I have to.\"\nAlways with the remarks. Cha Eui-jae reached into his inventory again and pulled out a spear. Gripping the massive weapon in one hand, he gave a few light jumps on the spot.\nBang!\nThen he kicked off the ground, leaping high. Whoosh! Cutting through the air, he soared higher.\nIn the brief moment he was airborne, his eyes beneath the mask turned a bright, piercing blue.\nThe sound had come from the north. Cha Eui-jae held his breath and landed lightly on a nearby rooftop before jumping again. The screams were getting closer. And finally, he spotted something in his vision. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath, rotated his upper body mid-air—\nSwoosh—\nThud! Thunk!\nHe impaled the target through the neck as he landed.\nDust billowed up in a thick cloud.\nAs he yanked out the spear, the mangled head rolled away, tumbling awkwardly because of the spikes protruding from its face. Cha Eui-jae picked up the head with the spear to examine it, and...\nHe recognized the face. His hand trembled.\n\"Why...\"\nThough its face was warped and spikes jutted out everywhere, it was still recognizable. After all...\n\"I heard you awakened, part-timer. Here's a gift for you.\"\nIt was the face of the Russian bear hunter who had shyly handed him the potion back then.\nOnce a customer at the hangover soup restaurant.",

      "content": "Chapter 182 - Wavelength\nClouded eyes, as if covered by a hazy veil, blankly stared at Cha Eui-jae. The vitality of life was nowhere to be found, the eyes of a dead person. The shy face that once offered a potion, the lively expression when ordering an extra dish of hangover soup— those had long since vanished.\nStill, Cha Eui-jae couldn't take his eyes off the face. He tried to find traces of the person he knew in that small object.\n'Why?'\nHis mind wasn't working. It felt as if he and the Russian bear hunter, with thorns protruding from his face, were the only ones in the world. The eyes, half-open and lifeless, were cloudy. His chest felt tight. His vision blurred.\nWhy was he here? Why had things come to this? He had so many questions, but no one to answer them. Because it was Cha Eui-jae himself who had severed the person's neck.\nAt that moment, Kikikikik! The sound of sharp objects clashing echoed in the air. The reaction came faster than expected. Before his foot could touch the ground after a leap, the spear pierced through flesh and bone. Thud! Cha Eui-jae gritted his teeth. Blood splattered.\nHe let go of the spear and clenched his fist instead. Before the pierced body could even fall to the ground, his sturdy fist smashed into the incoming thorns.\nCrack! Shattered pieces of thorn bounced off his fist and face, leaving not a single scratch. In the brief moment he slammed his fist into the hard head, he took a glimpse of the face— and was relieved. It was a stranger.\nBoom!\nWith the sound of bones snapping, the body struck by his fist flew off and crashed into something. Thump, thump, thump, his heart raced. He wiped his sweaty palms on his pants and pulled the spear from the collapsed body. Blood splattered onto his black boots. Cha Eui-jae thrust the spear into the ground.\nThe thick cloud of dust had yet to settle.\nCha Eui-jae lifted his head. In the hazy sky, the shimmering white hole swirled. Everything that had happened just moments ago felt like a dream. He stared blankly at the sky, an involuntary chuckle escaping his lips. A strange thought had crossed his mind. Maybe he had just woken up from a brief dream, returning to reality now.\nYes, things were too good to be true. His reality had always been like this, after all.\nHe felt hollow.\nThen,\nA strong grip tightly seized Cha Eui-jae's arm. Instinctively, he elbowed whatever had grabbed him. But his elbow, too, was caught by something firm. A calm voice spoke.\n\"It's me, Hyung.\"\n\"...Ah.\"\nCha Eui-jae blinked. Somehow, Lee Sa-young had caught up and was holding onto his arm tightly. Only then did Cha Eui-jae take a deep breath. He must have been holding his breath without realizing it. There was a weight in his hand. He was still gripping the Russian bear's head.\nA fit of coughing seized him. Gasping, he bent over as a large hand followed, supporting him and patting his back. He finally stopped coughing, but his body still trembled.\nCha Eui-jae was shaking. Pathetically so.\n\"...Ugh.\"\nHe kept gagging. He felt like he was going to throw up. The world spun around him. His grip loosened, and the head he had been holding dropped to the ground with a thud.\nAs the large hand grasped his neck and pulled, Cha Eui-jae was helplessly dragged along. A low voice whispered in his ear.\n\"Why the sudden change...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Can you tell me? What's going on?\"\nThe hand around his neck gently stroked his hair, urging him softly.\n\"...He was a customer.\"\nCha Eui-jae stammered. The person holding him tightly was the only one in this moment who could share his secret. The only person who knew both J and Cha Eui-jae.\n\"He was a customer at the hangover soup restaurant. I'm not mistaken... I'm sure of it. He even gave me a gift. That potion I used on you just now... He gave it to me.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Why? Since when? It's only been three months since I closed the shop. Why...\"\nWith each word, his rapidly beating heart began to calm down. It was strange. Just speaking aloud the thoughts he had kept to himself was enough to soothe him. Lee Sa-young remained silent, simply listening. His ragged breathing slowly returned to normal. The black hand continued to rub his back.\nLee Sa-young asked,\n\"Do you want to run away?\"\nCha Eui-jae mulled over the words blankly. Run away? No. He couldn't run away.\n\"You can if you want to.\"\nHe looked up at the firm voice. Lee Sa-young was staring down at Cha Eui-jae with an unreadable expression.\n\"If that's what you want, Hyung.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll go with you.\"\nThe murmur of the crowd faintly reached his ears. It was only now that he became aware of the presence of others. Cha Eui-jae gently pushed Lee Sa-young away and bit down hard on his tongue. Hard enough for the sound to be audible.\nThe sharp pain and the taste of blood barely brought him back to his senses. Lee Sa-young, watching him, frowned.\n\"Right now—\"\n\"No.\"\nCha Eui-jae cut him off firmly. Lee Sa-young closed his mouth, though he looked displeased. He didn't voice his objections, however. Cha Eui-jae swallowed the blood-tinged saliva.\n\"It's not stubbornness or anything. I just...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I just don't want to run away again. Don't misunderstand.\"\nThe dust slowly settled. Soon, they would be visible to the others. This time, he was ready. Ready to reveal himself. Cha Eui-jae smiled, though Lee Sa-young wouldn't be able to see it.\n\"Still, thanks. I'll keep it in mind.\"\nIf it ever comes to it, someone will run away with me. Now.\nThe dust completely cleared. Numerous eyes fixated on him. Eyes filled with unease, fear, and a touch of curiosity. He heard murmurs.\nWhoa, it's J. Where did he suddenly come from? And with Lee Sa-young next to him? What's going on? They don't seem to hate each other that much.\nCha Eui-jae skillfully swung his spear, shaking off the blood before storing it in his inventory. Every one of his movements was followed by a watchful gaze. Fortunately, none of the attention felt negative. Rather...\n'Are they enjoying this?'\nHe placed his hands behind his back out of habit. It had been a while since he felt such awareness of being watched. Back when he moved with Seo Min-gi, he always tried to handle things quickly and disappear before anyone noticed him, because he hated being under people's gaze.\nLee Sa-young, arms crossed defiantly, gave an exaggerated yawn. Small gasps escaped from here and there. Cha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young and muttered,\n\"Your image, seriously...\"\n\"You can see it for yourself. How long are we staying here?\"\n\"No... I want to inspect the bodies a little. It feels weird to do it alone. Surely someone must have reported this.\"\nAfter experiencing the Day of the Rift and Change, people had become quick to report things. If something went wrong, the hotline to the Rift Management Bureau or the Awakened Management Bureau was immediately dialed. That's what the school and public service ads constantly hammered into people's heads. It was the best way to ensure civilian lives were protected.\n\"Yeah, someone must have...\"\n\"I'll just have a quick chat with the Rift or Awakened Management Bureau's—\"\nJust then, hurried footsteps approached. Speak of the devil. They must have just arrived. Cha Eui-jae shrugged as if to say, \"See?\" Lee Sa-young scoffed.\n\"Excuse me. Please step back. Further away...\"\nThe sound of hurried footsteps gradually came to a halt. Lee Sa-young twisted his lips into a smirk.\n\"Did you wait just for this?\"\n\"...No.\"\nHe didn't expect this person to show up.\nThe man gave a few hand signals to the hunters who had arrived with him and then approached the two standing figures. A gentle smile spread across his face.\n\"Ah, J. And... Lee Sa-young-ssi. You two handled this? Thank you.\"\nJung Bin adjusted his disheveled hair and bowed slightly. J bowed back out of courtesy. After the short greeting, Jung Bin pulled out a small device from his chest pocket and pressed a button.\nRumble! The ground quaked as a wall rose from the earth. The large barrier encircled them, separating them from the civilians.\n'What kind of fancy tech is this...?'\nJung Bin smiled at Cha Eui-jae's curious glance.\n\"It's a new invention by Hong Ye-seong-ssi. Given the considerable attention you two receive, I thought it best to keep you from being overly exposed.\"\n\"Why... Ah.\"\nCha Eui-jae followed Jung Bin's gaze and saw the splotchy, bruise-marked fingerprints around Lee Sa-young's neck. Damn it. Cha Eui-jae subtly looked down at the ground. Jung Bin surveyed Lee Sa-young with concerned eyes.\n\"Have you received any treatment?\"\n\"None of your concern.\"\n\"Not willing to answer, I see. Understood. You must have been through a lot.\"\nWith that, Jung Bin cheerfully dropped the matter and looked around. His gaze settled on the severed head near Cha Eui-jae's feet. Would he recognize him? Jung Bin wasn't a regular customer, so maybe he wouldn't. Cha Eui-jae's throat went dry.\nJung Bin's face hardened.\n\"This is... Excuse me for a moment.\"\nJung Bin carefully picked up the head, examining it closely. Cha Eui-jae swallowed hard and asked,\n\"...Do you recognize the face?\"\n\"...Yes, I do.\"\nJung Bin let out a heavy sigh, looking at the severed head with a sorrowful expression.\n\"This is a hunter who went missing recently. The guild leader personally reported it. He was a hunter from the Magok Guild...\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Missing? Jung Bin carefully ran his hand over the face, now covered in spikes. The dull, lifeless eyes were hidden beneath the eyelids.\n\"The number of missing hunter reports has been increasing recently. These are people who haven't even entered dungeons or rifts. Most of them are low-tier hunters, and when they're found...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...they usually look like this.\"\nLike this. Cha Eui-jae glanced at the other corpse he had pierced with his spear. A grotesque, mutated body with spikes protruding all over. It was clearly the handiwork of Prometheus. Jung Bin continued.\n\"Nam Woo-jin-ssi suspects that someone is kidnapping awakened individuals for experiments. The drug addiction can't explain it, as the timeline is too short. Unless it's an extremely potent drug.\"\n\"But capturing an awakened person wouldn't be easy.\"\n\"It would be, if there were a traitor.\"\nLee Sa-young, who had been silent, interjected. He looked at the head Jung Bin was holding with an emotionless gaze.\n\"Low-tier awakened ones can never defeat high-tier ones, no matter what. And it's not like Prometheus excels at combat. At best, they can make... something like this, a mere byproduct.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, the possibility of a hunter being involved can't be ruled out... In fact, it's quite high.\"\n\"...And that person would be a ranked hunter.\"\nSilence followed the grim conclusion. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes. A fleeting regret passed through him. If he hadn't closed the hangover soup restaurant, would he have noticed these strange events earlier? But there was no time for regrets now.\nNow, it was time to act.",

      "content": "Chapter 183 - Multiple Thoughts\nA scream erupted. After the scream died down, a small whistle began to sound. Scream, whistle, scream, whistle, \"help me!\", Whistle. The whistle was getting closer and closer. The man, with anxious eyes, glanced at the door and began frantically tearing the papers on the desk.\nBut there was too much to tear alone. Damn it! The man bit his lips hard. Blood pooled.\nThat's when it happened.\nKnock, knock, knock.\nThere was a polite knocking sound. So, they've finally come. The man swallowed his saliva and pulled a button from his pocket, gripping it tightly.\n\"...Who is it?\"\n\"Me? A guest~\"\nA cheerful, low voice answered. It was a voice he had never heard in this place. The man pressed himself against the wall, fingers hovering over the button. Just then, a higher-pitched voice interrupted.\n\"What are you talking about? Just open it.\"\n\"It could be a lunatic, or a monster. We need to check if their head's still on straight.\"\n\"Ha...\"\n\"Well, since they seem capable of communication...\"\nThe man gritted his teeth and pressed the button.\nBeep—\nScreeeech!\nAs the button was pressed, the door violently burst open, and something flew at him. The man's eyes widened. As his frozen body finally loosened, something trickled down from his ear. He touched the spot where his ear had been. Horrific pain shot through him.\n\"A, a, a...\"\nAAAAHH! The man crouched down, wailing like a beast.\nAt the door stood two figures. A man, leaning casually with his hands in the pockets of a white parka, and a woman dressed in a black leather jacket, her face meticulously concealed with a cap and mask. The woman pulled her mask down to her chin. Her red lips twisted. She whispered in a sharp, small voice.\n\"Can't you handle this more cleanly? What if blood splatters on the data?\"\n\"Ugh, more nagging...\"\n\"When you're hired, you should listen to your employer, right?\"\n\"Sorry~? I only listen to employers who respect my freedom.\"\n\"Do you even know how much you were paid? Do your job properly.\"\n\"Oh, right. Hmm, should I...?\"\nThe man, who had been standing with a throwing posture, finally raised both hands.\n\"Oops! I meant to throw just for intimidation, but I accidentally hit~\"\n\"Ha... what if he dies from blood loss?\"\n\"He won't die from losing an ear~ I've been through worse myself. Anyway...\"\nAmid the screams, a low growling sound mixed in. The man in the parka pointed his chin towards a corner.\n\"Want me to handle it if it's too much for you?\"\n\"No, just sprinkle a potion on him.\"\n\"Such generosity.\"\nThe woman in black disappeared from view for a moment. Flashes of light burst out here and there, followed by a splattering sound. Blood sprayed across the white wall in long streaks. Meanwhile, the man in the parka ambled over, swaying like a drunken person.\nHe yanked out the bloodied hand axe stuck in the wall and crouched down in front of the trembling researcher. Blood dripped from the axe.\nThe man popped open a potion with a soft plop, grabbing the researcher by the hair.\n\"Hands off~\"\n\"Uh...\"\n\"If it were me, I'd listen before I lose another limb.\"\nThe blood-soaked hands hurriedly fell away. The man poured an entire potion onto the ear. The severed area quickly began to heal. The pain subsided, and the growling of the beastly creature quieted down.\nAfter a while, the woman emerged from the darkness, her appearance unchanged except for a single drop of blood on her cheek. She flicked her rapier, shaking off the blood that had collected. Her voice was laced with gritted teeth.\n\"How many people have you kidnapped to do this kind of thing?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Look here~\"\nA hand suddenly shot into view, snapping its fingers. The researcher looked up in terror. The man took off his hood. Disheveled hair poked out. Pale blue hair glistened under the light. The researcher's eyes widened in shock.\n\"W-w-why, why are you here...\"\nGray eyes narrowed into a crescent shape. Ban Gyu-min— Gyu-Gyu —grinned wickedly.\n\"Well, I got paid~? I'll do anything as long as the price is right.\"\nBloodied boots stepped closer. The handle of the rapier pressed against the researcher's back.\n\"Do you have time to chat?\"\n\"Yes, yes. Got it~\"\nGyu-Gyu grabbed the researcher's face with his hand and raised his eyebrows at the woman.\n\"So, what do we need to find out?\"\nThe woman roughly removed her cap, letting a waterfall of black hair cascade down, streaked with patches of gold. Her bright brown eyes gleamed fiercely. She was Honeybee.\n\"Anything related to the drug they gave to Matthew...\"\nShe paused for a moment, shaking her head.\n\"No, it doesn't have to be directly related. Just get anything out of him. Everything he knows.\"\n\"That's pretty broad~\"\n\"Seeing what's inside, I think these guys are the ones making the mutations. Scrape out everything down to the bottom.\"\n\"Oh, now that sounds fun.\"\n\"S-spare...\"\nSnap, the veins on the hand holding the researcher's face bulged. Though the researcher screamed in desperation, the sound was muffled by Gyu-Gyu's grip. His gray eyes sparkled as his lips curled upward.\n\"Could you stop crying? And don't drool on me... I'm a bit of a germaphobe~\"\n\"Ugh, mmph!\"\n\"Shh, if you keep screaming, I won't ease the pain, okay?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Good, that's a good boy.\"\nWith a wide smile, Gyu-Gyu loosened his grip and looked back.\n\"But boss, you know my powers, right?\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"You also know there's no guarantee that I'll get what you want?\"\n\"I know. Do it anyway.\"\nHoneybee perched on the desk and picked up the torn documents. As she pieced them together, she scoffed and glanced coldly at the researcher.\n\"If he dies, we've got plenty more to ask.\"\n\"So scary~\"\nGyu-Gyu chuckled slyly as he stared into the tear-filled eyes of the researcher.\n\"Well, I'll try my best.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm starting to get curious myself...\"\nGyu-Gyu pulled something out of his pocket. It was a 10-sided die. He placed it on his thumbnail and flicked it like a coin. The spinning die shot up into the air. Clasping his hands together, he closed his eyes.\n\"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come...\"\nHe rattled off a rapid-fire prayer.\n\"...for the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.\"\nThe die, still spinning in midair, slowly came to a stop.\n\"Amen.\"\nThe die, suspended in the air, dropped to the floor with a clatter. Tak, tadadak... It rolled and finally stopped as it hit the researcher's leg.\n6.\nGyu-Gyu sighed and scratched his messy hair. Soon, his hand, now sharp like a beast's claw, fell from his head.\n\"I've been going to church every week this month. Talk about bad luck.\"\n\"Got something else?\"\n\"Yeah~... What should we do?\"\n\"What else would we do?\"\nHoneybee crossed her legs.\n\"Do what you're best at. That's why we hired you.\"\n\"Oh, right...\"\nHis rough hand clamped over the researcher's mouth, lifting him up. Dangling in the air by his head, the researcher swayed. Between the man's parted lips, sharp fangs gleamed. His gray eyes glinted mischievously as he bent his pinky finger with a snap. The scream was swallowed by the firm grip.\n\"If you don't want to hurt more, start talking, okay? I'll start with the fingers...\"\n***\nThe secret relationship between the top two.\nThe scandal involving the number one and number two, which had shaken the entire country, quieted down more quickly than expected, thanks to the intervention of a shadowy information dealer known as Mackerel.\nMackerel had spread all sorts of rumors, diluting the information. Since it was Mackerel who had sown the seeds, it was only right that Mackerel cleaned it up. Despite advocating for the freedom of the press, Mackerel was powerless in the face of J's threatening presence, which stormed in with a menacing aura.\n\"When did freedom of the press start covering fabrications, huh?\"\n\"It's not a fabrication, hyung-nim! No, isn't this a fact? What about those marks on the guild leader's neck!\"\n\"What do you mean 'what about'? They're from this!\"\n\"Ack! Gah!\"\nRumors of strange marks on the neck of Lee Sa-young, the guild leader, and of the two being unusually close and looking overly familiar were passed around like urban legends via HunterNet, anonymous sites, and through whispers in the streets.\nThanks to the secret dealings between the number one and number two, the unsettling atmosphere that seemed to be quieting down persisted. The Awakened Management Bureau was troubled by the growing number of missing low-grade hunters. Despite issuing several notices warning hunters not to travel alone and working with various guilds, the number of disappearances kept rising.\nAwakeners, once symbols of safety and success, were slowly becoming a new threat. They were now seen as ticking time bombs, potentially turning into mutants at any moment. While this was still considered a conspiracy theory...\n\"We're reaching the limits of keeping witnesses quiet.\"\n\"...\"\nJung Bin sighed briefly, tapping his pen on the table. More and more people were starting to recognize that these mutants were originally hunters. His brown eyes were filled with concern.\n\"This is troublesome...\"\n\"Ah, that's right!\"\nSomeone raised their hand excitedly.\n\"I just met J! How about asking J for help?\"\n\"J?\"\n\"Yes, J visited the Awakened Management Bureau earlier.\"\n\"Oh, in that case...\"\n\"No.\"\nA firm answer cut off the conversation. The rare smile on Jung Bin's face had disappeared. Though it quickly returned as the team members exchanged cautious glances, he clasped his hands together and spoke.\n\"J is busy with other matters.\"\nA faint mist rose from the white coffee cup. Ham Seok-jeong liked to have a coffee machine in the director's office and brew her own coffee. When Cha Eui-jae came to visit with his aunt, he would often be offered a cup as well. Though he never drank it, back then he liked it.\nHis aunt's scolding, \"Why are you giving coffee to a child?\" and Ham Seok-jeong's joking, \"He's all grown up, it's fine.\"\nNow, Cha Eui-jae couldn't even use the word \"visit.\"\nInstead of sitting in the seat of honor, Cha Eui-jae sat across from Ham Seok-jeong, who gazed at him. The once black hair now had streaks of gray, and the face bore more signs of time and a few new scars.\nIt was funny how he was reminded of the passage of time at moments like these. Since Cha Eui-jae hadn't changed in eight years, he had to look at others to notice it— whether it was Jung Bin, Ham Seok-jeong, Song Jo-heon, or even Lee Sa-young.\nThud. Ham Seok-jeong set down her cup. Her sharp eyes softened with a faint smile.\n\"It's been a while.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 184 - Multiple Thoughts\nTak, Ham Seok-jeong set her cup down.\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nSilence fell again. Cha Eui-jae waited patiently. The distance between them, once close like family, had now grown far. She turned her head and covered her mouth with a fist, coughing lightly. She didn't look well. Ham Seok-jeong struggled to suppress the coughs that kept threatening to escape.\n\"Have you been well?\"\n\"For now, yes.\"\n\"I see... that's a relief.\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at the cane leaning against her chair. It was the same cane he had seen during the press conference.\n\"You've been using a cane.\"\n\"Oh, you saw it on TV? So, you don't live out in some deep mountain wilderness after all.\"\nShe let out a short laugh. Ha, I can't even make a simple joke anymore. Cha Eui-jae gave an awkward smile as well. Ham Seok-jeong rubbed her left knee.\n\"I injured myself a few years ago. After that, I stepped back from the front lines... and became an old relic stuck in the backroom.\"\nAnother bout of silence. For some reason, their conversation just couldn't flow smoothly. Had they always struggled to keep a conversation going like this? He tried to recall, but even that memory was hazy. Cha Eui-jae blinked.\n'This feels oddly unfamiliar...'\nOnce again, it was Ham Seok-jeong who spoke first.\n\"When did you return?\"\n\"Oh, not too long ago.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I won't apologize. Even if I could go back in time, I would do everything the same. I sent Hye-kyung away, and I sent you away. And I would still ask for your help, brazenly.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"Good.\"\nThe conversation kept circling around, never hitting the core of the matter. They repeated meaningless pleasantries several times. It was frustrating. Out of the blue, Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"Aren't you curious why I didn't come to see you sooner, why I'm only coming now?\"\nHam Seok-jeong took a sip of her coffee before answering.\n\"There must have been a reason.\"\n\"You were looking for me, weren't you?\"\n\"Yes. When I heard that you had returned alive after eight years but hadn't even shown your face, I wondered if you were too badly injured to move. Or if you had lost your memory.\"\nCha Eui-jae studied Ham Seok-jeong's face. Her once sharp, raptor-like features had softened with age, but the intensity remained. He used to be scared of her when he was younger. She placed her cup down and stared blankly at the black mask.\n\"Does that sound like an excuse?\"\nHam Seok-jeong leaned back in her chair, a faint smile playing on her stern face.\n\"Because it is an excuse.\"\n\"Yes, I thought it might be.\"\nCha Eui-jae sighed and straightened his posture.\nHam Seok-jeong, the first director of the Awakened Management Bureau. She had taken the lead since its inception, renowned for her keen observational skills and sharp deductive reasoning. It wasn't an ability granted by her awakening; it was innate. Even J couldn't hide his true intentions in front of her.\nHam Seok-jeong calmly folded her fingers one by one as she spoke.\n\"Of course, it's also true that I wanted to find you to protect you if you couldn't defend yourself and to ask for your help to prevent the end. But that wasn't the main reason.\"\nFinally, she was getting to the point. She gazed at her half-folded hand before tilting her head slightly.\n\"How about Hye-kyung? And the other hunters?\"\n\"...\"\nAunt.\nCha Eui-jae's aunt, Hunter Park Hye-kyung, had been as close as a sister to Ham Seok-jeong. Cha Eui-jae swallowed hard. When he finally opened his mouth, his voice came out cracked. Others might not notice due to the distortion, but Ham Seok-jeong surely did.\n\"Aunt... and the other hunters...\"\nCha Eui-jae clenched his fists, shutting his eyes tight.\n\"I couldn't... I couldn't save them.\"\n\"Don't say you're sorry.\"\nHer words were sharp. Cha Eui-jae's head snapped up. Ham Seok-jeong's expression hadn't changed as she looked at him.\n\"Even you, J, couldn't do it. No one else could have either. Isn't that right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You must have given it your all. I know. The hunters who went in with you must have done their best too. And yet, this is how it turned out.\"\nHis chest stirred uneasily. This wasn't the reaction he had braced himself for, not the response he had prepared for over and over. It was something completely different. Cha Eui-jae lowered his head, unable to speak. Ham Seok-jeong sighed quietly.\n\"As a director, that's what I'm supposed to say.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But still...\"\nShe looked down and muttered to herself.\n\"I already knew they were dead. I was the one who officially declared them deceased, and it's been eight years. Besides, if Hye-kyung had been alive, she would have come to see me by now. I knew.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There were times I wondered what would've happened if I had stopped her from going back then...\"\n\"...\"\n\"But vague suspicions and the testimony of a survivor carry different weight. I'm sorry, but I needed to hear it from you, for myself.\"\nSlowly, Cha Eui-jae lifted his head. He wasn't sure why, but he wanted to see Ham Seok-jeong's face. She...\n\"I can finally let go.\"\n...was expressionless.\nEmpty.\nAs if she had lost something of great importance. Like an empty room.\nCha Eui-jae stared at her, speechless. He wanted to say something, anything, but no words would come out. He thought absently,\n'How strange.'\nWhy am I thinking about Lee Sa-young?\nHam Seok-jeong grabbed the armrest of her chair and stood up. She walked slowly, limping as she made her way around the table to Cha Eui-jae. He couldn't help but notice her uneven gait. She bent down and gently hugged him.\n\"Thank you. And I'm sorry.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Welcome back.\"\nIt wasn't like her to act this way. In fact, Cha Eui-jae blinked in surprise.\n'Aunt used to do this often.'\nWhat happens to a person when they lose the cornerstone of their life?\n'The director...'\nHer hand patted his back kindly, much like his aunt's touch. Hesitant at first, Cha Eui-jae slowly placed his arm around her back. Her body felt much smaller than he remembered. As he closed his eyes, he thought,\n'She'll live the rest of her life thinking of Aunt...'\nThe long hug eventually ended. Cha Eui-jae quickly stood to help Ham Seok-jeong back to her seat as she limped away. She looked exhausted once seated. Ham Seok-jeong let out a brief sigh before asking.\n\"Come to think of it... you seem to be close with Sa-young.\"\nDamn. She saw the article. Cha Eui-jae grimaced. He would have to give the Mackerels another scolding. And then the thought followed,\n'Sa-young? That's a bit familiar, isn't it?\nCha Eui-jae replied hesitantly, his face twisted in discomfort.\n\"Pardon? Well, not really...\"\n\"Aren't you? You looked pretty close in that article.\"\n\"No, I just thought... It sounded like you're closer to him, calling him Sa-young like that...\"\n\"Do you think he likes me? Hardly.\"\nHam Seok-jeong chuckled softly and picked up her cup. The once-steaming coffee had already cooled to a lukewarm state. She closed her eyes and muttered,\n\"It's been years now. It happened after you entered the West Sea rift. There was a period when Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo were out of contact for months. Their last report said something like, 'I need to care for a child, so I won't be able to return for a while. Sorry.' At first, I thought it was complete nonsense.\"\n\"...\"\nA thought flashed through Cha Eui-jae's mind.\nCome to think of it, didn't Lee Sa-young mention once that he used to live with Jung Bin? He had almost forgotten, but the memory resurfaced clearly. Cha Eui-jae found himself focusing more on the story.\n\"A few months went by like that. We were already short-staffed, but with two of our strongest hunters gone, we were overwhelmed.\"\nThat makes sense. With Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo, two of the highest-ranked hunters, out of commission— on top of himself being absent— it must've been chaotic. Ham Seok-jeong sighed.\n\"Then out of the blue, I got a message. They were bringing a child. I thought we might need to set up a playroom or something, but then they showed up with this tall, lanky young man instead. A bit too old to be called a child.\"\nIs she talking about Lee Sa-young?\n\"But those two treated him like he was some five-centimeter baby, coddling him constantly. He seemed normal enough at a glance, but his eyes... there was something unhinged about them.\"\nThat's definitely Lee Sa-young!\nUnhinged eyes? That could only be Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae listened intently as Ham Seok-jeong let out a chuckle.\n\"Look at that. Your face lights up as soon as Lee Sa-young comes up.\"\n\"...\"\nShe couldn't even see his face under the mask, yet she somehow knew. Cha Eui-jae absentmindedly touched the mask. Tak, Ham Seok-jeong set her cup down and clasped her fingers together.\n\"Well, enough small talk. Let's make a deal.\"\n\"...What kind of deal?\"\n\"It won't be anything that harms you.\"\nCha Eui-jae swallowed nervously. He had no idea what terms she might offer. Ham Seok-jeong smiled, but the smile still carried an air of emptiness.\n\"Meet with me sometimes and talk. Share stories.\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"I'll tell you stories about Sa-young that you don't know, and you tell me stories about Hye-kyung that I don't know.\"\nCha Eui-jae blinked in confusion. Ham Seok-jeong rested her chin on her hand.\n\"And when you're ready, tell me what happened in the rift. Tell me about her last moments.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae exhaled softly. Ham Seok-jeong smiled, her expression empty.\n\"What do you think? Doesn't sound like it'll hurt.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 185 - Multiple Thoughts\n\"What do you think? Doesn't sound like it'll hurt.\"\nCha Eui-jae blankly stared at the hollow smile. In truth, he could tell her right now. Even though his memories were fragmented, he clearly remembered the last moments of his aunt. It would be a bit painful, but they had been like family.\nBut he had a strange instinct. If he told her everything about his aunt now, Director Ham Seok-jeong...\nCha Eui-jae subtly lifted his head to see her dry face. There wasn't even a trace of the vitality that used to linger there. She almost looked like an intricately crafted wax figure.\n'Even if I tell her someday, now's not the time.'\nCha Eui-jae deliberately shrank back and lowered his head.\n\"If it's alright if it's a little later.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't fully remember everything that happened inside. I think I need some time.\"\nHam Seok-jeong furrowed her brow slightly. A flicker of emotion bloomed on her once empty face. She asked, concerned.\n\"Are you having trouble with your memory?\"\n\"Yes... a little. Honestly, I don't even know how I got out of the rift.\"\n\"But you're physically alright? Shouldn't you get checked?\"\n\"No, I'm fine physically.\"\n\"Well... that's a relief.\"\nHam Seok-jeong answered more calmly than expected. She sighed, moving her fingers on the hand that supported her chin.\n\"I guess it can't be helped... I'm sorry to ask, but I hope you can remember at least something. From what I've heard, your experience inside the West Sea rift seems to be related to the end.\"\nThe end. Cha Eui-jae snapped his head up. He asked urgently.\n\"Director, how much do you know about the end?\"\n\"I don't have much information. All I've heard are vague predictions that it will come someday. Just fragmented visions... the problem is that no one knows when or how it will happen.\"\n\"Then why do you believe in it?\"\n\"Well, an S-grade hunter mentioned it... and because of Prometheus. As ridiculous as that sounds.\"\nHam Seok-jeong let out a long sigh, rubbing her chin. Worry shadowed her sharp face.\n\"Have you heard of Prometheus?\"\n\"Yes. I've heard of it.\"\n\"Of course, you work with the Pado Guild. Naturally, you would have.\"\nDamn it. Cha Eui-jae rolled his eyes behind his mask. Of course, Ham Seok-jeong would know, but hearing her confirm it felt strange. It made him feel as if he really was part of the Pado Guild. Ham Seok-jeong spoke slowly.\n\"In fact, I've known about their existence for a long time. After the West Sea rift, when the hunters' strength was weakened, they began to make their moves. You probably didn't know.\"\n\"They must have had a reason for revealing themselves.\"\n\"Yes. Civilians started disappearing, and the common thread was that they had all been involved in a dungeon or rift and escaped. We immediately launched an investigation in cooperation with the police, and at first, we thought it was human trafficking. But it was far worse.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae visited the Seowon Guild, he remembered the story Nam Woo-jin had told him as they walked through the forest.\n\"At that time, their research hadn't progressed much, so they used people with some peculiarities as test subjects.\"\n\"Peculiarities?\"\n\"Yes. Those who had been involved in a rift, or had wounds from a monster attack. In any case, something special related to the rift. They might have kidnapped people for experiments in that chaotic state.\"\nCha Eui-jae had thought of the boy who had reached out, begging for help. Who could have known that boy would turn out to be Lee Sa-young? And who could have known that while he was missing, Lee Sa-young had been subjected to countless torturous experiments?\n'But that guy won't tell me anything...'\nIt would be better if he just told Cha Eui-jae directly. He had heard all the stories of what happened after entering the West Sea rift from others. The fact that he hadn't been told personally was deeply frustrating.\n'I want to know everything.'\nCha Eui-jae tapped his foot on the floor. Ham Seok-jeong leaned back in her chair and continued speaking.\n\"At the time, they didn't have a grand name like they do now. They were just a group of losers who felt inferior because they weren't chosen by the system and weren't awakened. Or they were mad scientists obsessed with creating awakened ones themselves. There were very few of them.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If we had left them alone, they would've disappeared on their own, without achieving anything.\"\nCha Eui-jae recalled a conversation he had with Hong Ye-seong, who had been in Kkokko's body. In the first and second worlds that Hong Ye-seong had witnessed, when asked about Prometheus, he had reacted indifferently.\n\"Well, those kinds of guys didn't leave much of a trace in my world. A grand name like that? I only saw it in Greek and Roman Mythology for Kids.\"\nIn the first and second worlds, they would have disappeared as Ham Seok-jeong said. They wouldn't have made a name for themselves. But here, Ham Seok-jeong's voice was starting to sound irritated.\n\"But at some point, they changed. Those who should've vanished were given a clear purpose.\"\n\"To stop the end... is that it?\"\n\"Yes. Instead of relying on the system to create awakened beings, we would create them ourselves to stop the end. The end must be stopped by human power... It's a grandiose purpose. Almost sounds like chasing after clouds.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Someone said that Prometheus has a prophet.\"\n\"A prophet?\"\n\"They say the prophet knows what will happen in the future... Ha, it's nonsense.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Misguided knowledge and beliefs are the scariest things. Even if they lack the capability to do anything, they can justify everything with belief alone. That makes the impossible seem possible.\"\nHam Seok-jeong closed her eyes in frustration. Cha Eui-jae thought carefully. Even Yoon Ga-eul couldn't see the future. She could only see fragments of a world that had already perished, glimpsing into the past. If he applied Yoon Ga-eul's case, Prometheus' prophet wasn't seeing the future...\n'Isn't the prophet just applying past experiences to the future?'\nBut this world was heading down a completely different path than the previous two. There were countless differences. The West Sea rift, the 8-year gap, Prometheus, the experiments Lee Sa-young was subjected to...\n'Still...'\nTo understand when and how the end would come, what happened in the second world, and whether Prometheus' prophet was based on memories or truly knew the future, Cha Eui-jae needed to dig up information from the other Lee Sa-young that lived inside him.\n\"...\"\nNo. Cha Eui-jae squeezed his eyes shut. He didn't want to get involved with that perverted version of Lee Sa-young who practically asked to be strangled. He was still Lee Sa-young, but something was off!\nBut doing things he didn't want to do was part of becoming a true adult. Cha Eui-jae clenched his fists and muttered.\n\"...I'll do my best to recover my memories.\"\n\"Good... but don't push yourself too hard.\"\nHam Seok-jeong pressed her hand on the armrest of her chair and stood up. Cha Eui-jae awkwardly followed suit. She approached him slowly, leaning on her cane, and gave him a clumsy pat on the shoulder.\n\"I left the keys with Jung Bin. Your old house and Hye-kyung's house. Pick them up before you leave.\"\n\"Oh, okay...\"\nWas the Director really looking after them? Cha Eui-jae blinked. Why hadn't she disposed of the house of someone who had passed away?\n\"You must have resented me. I know.\"\nMaybe it was her lingering attachment.\n\"I won't ask for forgiveness.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just... be careful.\"\nThe hand patting his shoulder suddenly gripped harder. Ham Seok-jeong leaned in and whispered in a low voice.\n\"People at the top tend to attract attention.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I know you're not the type to run away, even if it's foolish. But not everyone knows that.\"\nThe red letters written on Prometheus' website.\n\"The higher you stand, the more visible your fall is. There are plenty of people waiting for it.\"\n[Do not trust the hero J.]\n[He is a traitor who abandoned the world and fled.]\n\"Always remember that.\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nHam Seok-jeong's hand dropped, leaving a dull ache behind. She opened the door to the director's office herself, bidding him farewell. Just before the door closed, Cha Eui-jae caught a glimpse of her eyes. They were hollow, but a small hint of concern remained. That, at least, was reassuring.\nPerhaps because it was in front of the director's office, the hallway was quiet. The sounds of activity came from downstairs. Had she told him to stop by Jung Bin? Scratching his head, Cha Eui-jae started to look for Jung Bin when a strong presence began climbing the stairs.\n'It's probably coming to see me...'\nCha Eui-jae deliberately walked closer to the stairs. Soon, beyond the turn in the staircase, he saw black hair streaked with gray. Tap, a cane struck the floor. The long coat swayed. The face, sharp like an old and wise tiger, was looking at J. A look of amazement crossed the wrinkled face.\n\"Oh my... Good heavens, is it really you?\"\n\"Yes, probably.\"\n\"Goodness!\"\nCha Eui-jae replied jokingly. Song Jo-heon, who had been climbing the stairs two steps at a time, opened his arms wide as he approached.\n\"J! I don't know how you made it back, but welcome!\"\n\"Hunter Song Jo-heon. Ah, or should I say Guild Leader now?\"\n\"Haha, call me whatever you like.\"\nA rough hand suddenly extended. Song Jo-heon, with a broad smile, offered a handshake.\n\"Good to have you back. I've missed you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The higher you stand, the more visible your fall is. There are plenty of people waiting for it.\"\nHam Seok-jeong wouldn't have said that without reason.\nWith a smile, Cha Eui-jae took the hand and slowly shook it up and down.\n\"Thank you for the warm welcome.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 186 - Multiple Thoughts\n\"Well, no wonder I felt like coming to the bureau today. Must've been to meet you.\"\nSong Jo-heon said with a hearty laugh after finishing the handshake. Cha Eui-jae also smiled, though it wouldn't have been visible. Song Jo-heon, looking down the corridor in front of the director's office, asked,\n\"You came to see Director Ham, right? Did you just meet her?\"\n\"Yes, I just saw her.\"\n\"You should've stopped by to see me too. I was so surprised when I heard you were back!\"\n\"Were you only surprised?\"\nWithout realizing it, Cha Eui-jae threw out a light joke with a bit of bite. But Song Jo-heon casually shrugged and responded without missing a beat.\n\"Of course I was happy too! I don't know if you're aware, but most of the first-generation Awakened have retired and gone into hiding. There aren't many people left to share old memories with.\"\n\"...\"\nA smile appeared on his fierce, tiger-like face.\n\"I'm really glad to see an old comrade again. Welcome back.\"\nWhat kind of person was Song Jo-heon?\nMost of the first-generation Awakened, who gained their powers right after the Day of the Rift, were naturally gifted with physical abilities. As a result, many had previously worked in physically demanding professions like soldiers, police officers, or athletes. Cha Eui-jae, who had been a regular student, was particularly unique.\nSong Jo-heon had been a soldier, and they said his rank had been fairly high. When the Awakened Management Bureau was established, he had clashed with Ham Seok-jeong, who had been a police officer, over the position of director, but ultimately stepped aside on his own. People had murmured that Song Jo-heon should have been the director, but those rumors quickly faded. It was obvious that Ham Seok-jeong was more capable.\nAnd to J, Song Jo-heon was...\n'Honestly, I don't have any strong feelings.'\nBack when S-grades were rare, not even A-grades were common. The problem was many, and there were few hunters, so the Awakened Management Bureau was constantly understaffed. There had been a certain camaraderie among those who worked together in those days. Facing life and death together naturally led to some level of bonding. But Cha Eui-jae had had very few direct experiences working alongside Song Jo-heon. Most of their interaction was through relayed orders.\n'...What is this feeling?'\nWhat was this awkward sensation?\nSong Jo-heon rubbed his chin and stared at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"I wouldn't recognize your face because of the mask, but from what I can see, you haven't changed much. Well, except for your hair color.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Haha, yes. My hair, on the other hand, is starting to turn gray. Oh, by the way... Have you heard about the General Assembly?\"\n\"The General Assembly?\"\n\"Yes, a gathering of the rankers to discuss various matters. The world's been quite chaotic since the Day of Change, hasn't it? I feel like you'd have plenty to talk about if you attended too...\"\n\"J! There you are.\"\nJust then, from behind Song Jo-heon, appeared Jung Bin with slightly disheveled hair, as if he'd hurried over. With a soft smile, Jung Bin politely bowed to both Song Jo-heon and Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Oh, I didn't know you were here too, Song Jo-heon-ssi. Were you in the middle of a conversation? I hope I'm not interrupting...\"\n\"Oh, Jung Bin! Not too busy these days, I hope?\"\n\"Haha, thanks to the guild leader's hard work, I've got some time to rest.\"\n\"Haha! So, what's brought you here?\"\n\"I have an urgent favor to ask J. But if you were in the middle of a conversation, I can wait.\"\nJung Bin winked subtly at Cha Eui-jae from behind Song Jo-heon. It felt like a rope had been tossed down from the heavens just as the conversation was starting to wind down. Before Song Jo-heon could respond, Cha Eui-jae quickly spoke.\n\"Oh, we're just about done. Just catching up, right?\"\n\"Oh. Right, of course. By the way, I hear you're working with the Pado Guild lately? Have you finally decided to join a guild?\"\n\"No, not really. I'm just working with them for a bit.\"\n\"Haha. Well, I hope you'll consider our Samra Guild instead of a small group like that. We're structured, organized, and large. You'd be more than welcome.\"\nSong Jo-heon pulled out a business card and handed it over.\n[Guild Leader of Samra Guild, Song Jo-heon]\n\"Do visit us sometime. We'd welcome you anytime.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"The Pado Guild, huh... Well, just don't get too close to that Lee Sa-young fellow.\"\nAt the sudden mention of Lee Sa-young's name, Cha Eui-jae looked up. For the first time since they'd met, Song Jo-heon's ever-friendly face showed a hint of concern. He rubbed his chin and sighed.\n\"He's such an impolite kid, perhaps because he's young. You can't read him at all... Don't get tangled up with him and end up in trouble. Be careful.\"\n\"Ah, yes...\"\n\"Alright then, I'll take my leave. You two enjoy your conversation. Keep up the good work, Jung Bin.\"\n\"Thank you. Goodbye.\"\nAfter patting Jung Bin on the shoulder, Song Jo-heon headed down the stairs. Jung Bin listened intently to the sound of footsteps until it completely faded away. Only then did he let out a small sigh and smile.\n\"He's gone.\"\nCha Eui-jae cautiously asked,\n\"So, what was that favor you mentioned?\"\n\"Oh, that? It was just an excuse.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"The director asked me to get you alone.\"\nJung Bin adjusted his disheveled outfit and awkwardly laughed.\n\"Though I didn't expect it to turn out like this. I hope I wasn't being rude...\"\n\"No, you weren't... It was perfect timing, actually.\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced behind him. Ham Seok-jeong must have orchestrated this. Should he be thankful? Scratching his neck awkwardly, Cha Eui-jae replied.\n\"Honestly, we were almost out of things to talk about. You came at just the right time.\"\n\"I'm glad to hear that.\"\n\"Oh, and, by the way...\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae looked at Jung Bin, who was listening attentively, he mumbled.\n\"The director said to get the house key from you.\"\n\"Ah, yes. The director entrusted it to me. Here, take it.\"\nJung Bin pulled out two keys from the inside pocket of his suit and handed them over. Cha Eui-jae took the keys. They were familiar objects, but they felt strange in his hand. A small rabbit keychain hung from the key to his aunt's house, and from his own key dangled a small plastic hero keychain, worn and faded with time.\n\"...Why didn't the director just give it to me herself? Why leave it with you?\"\n\"I'm not sure... She didn't say much when she gave it to me either.\"\nWhat had Ham Seok-jeong been thinking while holding onto these keys? If not for this moment, the keys might have remained forgotten in a drawer.\nJust as Cha Eui-jae was fiddling with the keychain, a strong presence made itself known from below. Cha Eui-jae grimaced. It was a familiar aura, one he recognized instantly.\nJung Bin's smile grew slightly awkward, as if he'd sensed it too. Cha Eui-jae asked quietly.\n\"Was he supposed to visit today?\"\n\"Um, no. As far as I know, he wasn't. Seems like a sudden visit...\"\nThe presence was getting closer. Then, like a déjà vu, something dark appeared beyond Jung Bin. A hissing sound of air escaping followed.\n\"Seems like the two of you are having fun...\"\nIt was Lee Sa-young, wearing a gas mask. Jung Bin quickly stepped aside, pressing against the railing to make way for him, then bowed his head to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"My job here is done, J. I'll be going.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Haha... I got called up during a meeting. Sorry about that. I'll see you later. Lee Sa-young-ssi.\"\nLee Sa-young gave a brief nod in response. Damn, say what you will about Song Jo-heon, but the man had an eye for people. According to Ham Seok-jeong, Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo had looked after Lee Sa-young for a while, but that clearly hadn't changed anything— he was as rude as ever.\nLee Sa-young held onto the railing and stared up at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Why didn't you tell me you were coming here?\"\nEver since that day, the one with the Russian bear's head, Cha Eui-jae had been actively avoiding Lee Sa-young. His heart would beat too erratically whenever he saw Lee Sa-young's face. Sleep under the same roof as him?\n'No way.'\nBut Cha Eui-jae didn't have a proper place to stay, nor did he have the means to find one easily, so he had ended up spending a few nights at a video room in the fish market, with Mackerel's help. Though he had half-expected Lee Sa-young to follow him there, for some reason, he hadn't. Instead, Lee Sa-young had just sent a message through Mackerel.\n\"One week.\"\nA countdown, or something? It had been a little creepy, but Cha Eui-jae let it slide. He now stared at Lee Sa-young, who was still wearing that gas mask, and suddenly remembered something.\nCome to think of it, today marked exactly one week since he'd escaped Lee Sa-young's house!\n'Damn, this guy really sticks to his word...'\nSwallowing hard, Cha Eui-jae clasped his hands behind his back. The keys in his hand jangled softly.\n\"There was no need to tell you I was meeting the Director.\"\n\"What's that in your hand?\"\n\"House keys.\"\n\"...House?\"\nLee Sa-young's voice dropped a tone. The hissing sound from his gas mask grew slightly more intense. Cha Eui-jae quickly added more context.\n\"Not a new house— my old one. The Director was looking after it.\"\n\"Who uses keys these days... Isn't it a passcode?\"\n\"There was someone with the ability to control locks back in the day. I left it with them.\"\n\"Hmm... So that person's still alive, huh? The one who made it.\"\n\"What?\"\nCha Eui-jae couldn't believe what he was hearing. Did this guy just say what I think he said?\nAs if to cut off any doubt, a chilling voice, void of humor, sliced through the air like a blade.\n\"If they die, wouldn't their ability be undone?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Then it'd just be a normal lock and key... You could call a locksmith to open it.\"\n\"You're insane.\"\nThe words slipped out before Cha Eui-jae could stop them. Lee Sa-young narrowed his eyes and took a step closer.\n\"Then who told you to leave in the first place?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 187 - Multiple Thoughts\nThe tone of the words was a bit vague, wasn't it? Cha Eui-jae retorted, stepping back with an awkward expression.\n\"Leave...? What do you mean? You're the one speaking strangely. That's your house in the first place. I was the one out of place there.\"\n\"Why... haa.\"\nLee Sa-young crossed his arms and tilted his head. He let out a sigh, loud enough for Cha Eui-jae to hear. His fingers tapped his arms with a hint of anxiety.\n\"Where'd you sleep the past three months, on the ground? No, right?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You lived at my place for three months. Doesn't that count as living together?\"\n\"No, that was only because I had no choice. It was a temporary arrangement, like cohabiting for caretaking purposes.\"\n\"Mm... is that so?\"\nHis violet eyes gleamed sharply. There was a strange intensity. Now that Cha Eui-jae looked, his eyes were quite deranged. He was always a little unhinged, but never had he seemed this far gone. It had only been a week since they were apart, yet he now carried the tense air of a starving beast. Enough to give someone chills.\nCha Eui-jae blinked.\n'This is weird...'\nThis guy had waited for a dead person to return without any guarantee, for eight years at that. Has his patience finally worn thin after all this time?\n'No...'\nIt couldn't be Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae was certain of that much. Lee Sa-young would always wait for Cha Eui-jae. That's what he believed. So, the Lee Sa-young standing in front of him now was definitely not normal.\n'Is this the influence of the other Sa-young?'\nA brief image of a crying and irritated Lee Sa-young flashed through his mind. Had he lost control of his body again, like that time? But his mind still seemed like the Lee Sa-young he knew. As Cha Eui-jae was trying to deduce the cause, Lee Sa-young blinked and spoke coldly.\n\"What, do I have to collapse again for you to come back?\"\n\"You've lost it. Hey!\"\nCha Eui-jae instinctively yelled, then turned around sharply. At this distance, the director in the director's office would've overheard their conversation for sure. Lee Sa-young should've known that too. Cha Eui-jae glanced back at him. Lee Sa-young was staring at him intently, seemingly unfazed by the idea that the director might hear.\nLee Sa-young responded bluntly.\n\"It's not 'hey,' it's Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"That's not what's important right now... ha.\"\nCha Eui-jae ruffled his hair, then grabbed Lee Sa-young's arm. He lowered his voice and whispered.\n\"Just try saying that kind of nonsense again.\"\n\"And what if I do?\"\n\"I'll make sure you can't say anything again.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"What do you mean, how? I'll shut you up physically. Hey, no, I mean... come with me, Lee Sa-young.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae tugged on his arm, the large figure followed without resistance. His crazed eyes and ominous aura had calmed somewhat. Lee Sa-young asked,\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\"If we talk here, the director will hear everything, right? Let's go somewhere else and finish this conversation.\"\nHis grip tightened on Lee Sa-young's arm, but their steps halted at the stairs. Lee Sa-young planted himself like a rock, his violet eyes glaring at Cha Eui-jae reproachfully.\n\"Is the director more important right now?\"\n\"I said it is, so let's just go!\"\n\"More important than me?\"\nCha Eui-jae tried to reply, but stopped himself. Of course, the director was important... but he couldn't deny that his concern leaned more toward Lee Sa-young. But he didn't want to voice that thought. He wasn't ready to admit that, not yet. Instead, he snapped irritably,\n\"Why are you acting like this all of a sudden? You weren't like this before.\"\n\"Stop dodging the question and answer me. Is the director more important than me?\"\n'This is driving me crazy.'\nWith each word, the urge to gag Lee Sa-young or knock him unconscious surged. But oddly enough, Lee Sa-young, standing there with that sulky expression... looked strange.\nWait?\nCha Eui-jae widened his eyes and scanned Lee Sa-young from top to bottom. The gas mask, the black coat, arms crossed, standing there like a statue... was cute. Even with a gas mask on!\n'Am I crazy?'\nCha Eui-jae was horrified. His heart had already been pounding whenever he saw Lee Sa-young, and now he found his menacing gas mask cute? This was serious. He had it bad.\n'Ah, shit. I think I'm totally screwed.'\nWhile Cha Eui-jae rubbed his face in disbelief, Lee Sa-young, still waiting for an answer, furrowed his brow.\n\"You're not going to answer?\"\n\"Just hold on. I need to think.\"\n\"Think about what? Is this really something you need to think about?\"\n\"Just wait a sec.\"\nAt this point, his sulking felt almost cute. Cha Eui-jae patted Lee Sa-young's arm reassuringly as he thought it over. Lee Sa-young's behavior now was strikingly similar to Park Ha-eun when she didn't get her way and started to sulk. It seemed like a display of anxiety caused by losing control...\nWait, losing control?\nIf he had lost control, that meant the other Lee Sa-young was influencing his body. It also meant that the usually dormant soul was now awake, or both souls were coexisting. Which meant...\n\"Let's sleep together.\"\n\"Choke me harder. This feels good...\"\nHe wouldn't have to sleep next to that pervert anymore, right? Since there was already another Lee Sa-young inside him?\nIt felt as if a lightbulb had turned on in his head. Cha Eui-jae grinned broadly, impressed by his own quick thinking.\nThey say you can survive even a tiger's den if you keep your wits about you. This was an opportunity he couldn't miss. He had no desire to sleep beside a pervert who liked being strangled. He'd much rather endure his heart racing, cold sweats, and nervous jitters while lying next to Lee Sa-young. Enduring was something Cha Eui-jae was good at.\nHe felt sorry for Lee Sa-young, but while he was out of control and not quite himself, yet not under the full influence of the other Lee Sa-young, now was the time to act. Right now!\nCha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young by the shoulders.\n\"Let's go.\"\nLee Sa-young eyed him suspiciously.\n\"Suddenly? Where to?\"\n\"My house. Do you have Hong Ye-seong's scroll?\"\n\"My house? Your house? Suddenly?\"\n\"Do you have it or not? If you do, take one out.\"\nWithout warning, Cha Eui-jae reached into Lee Sa-young's coat pocket. All he found was a phone. Lee Sa-young grabbed his wrist and snapped,\n\"What are you doing, suddenly? Trying to change the subject again...\"\nBut Cha Eui-jae cut him off, even faster than Lee Sa-young could finish speaking.\n\"I'm not changing the subject. I want to show you my house. Aren't you curious?\"\n\"...\"\nThe grip on his wrist loosened. Good, he's interested. Of course, he'd be curious. I'm curious too. Cha Eui-jae seized on the slight opening and pressed further.\n\"There are things I need to bring from there too. Stuff I used for work. You might even find the clothes you wore when we went to the hospital.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young let out a small sigh, much softer than the one earlier when he seemed ready to kill someone. Sensing the moment, Cha Eui-jae added the final push.\n\"If we go now, you'll be the first visitor in eight years. What do you think?\"\nThe hand gripping his wrist fell away. Without a word, Lee Sa-young pulled out a scroll from his inventory and handed it over. Cha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young's arm with one hand, the scroll with the other, and bit down on the scroll.\n'Home.'\nThen, he tore it.\n***\nThe cozy scent of fabric softener tickled the tip of Cha Eui-jae's nose. He slowly opened his eyes. They were standing in the entrance hall now, having apparently moved there.\nCha Eui-jae stared quietly at the door between the entrance and the living room. The wooden pollock fish hanging in the corner of the door was a gift from his aunt. She had said it was a talisman to ward off bad luck.\n'Did it really ward off any evil?'\nBeyond the glass of the door, the hallway and living room looked exactly as he remembered. It felt like he had gone back in time, as if everything that had happened was just a nightmare, and he had finally returned home.\n\"...\"\nBut with Lee Sa-young beside him, it couldn't possibly be the past.\nLee Sa-young stood there, waiting patiently like a guest who had just been invited in. When Cha Eui-jae took off his shoes, Lee Sa-young, who had been standing quietly next to him, followed suit and took his off as well.\nHe carefully opened the door. Creak. It opened more smoothly than he had expected. There wasn't a speck of dust on the wooden floor connecting the living room to the entrance. Cha Eui-jae instinctively softened his footsteps as he walked inside. Behind him, he could sense Lee Sa-young following closely. Soon enough, the living room came into view.\n\"...\"\nIt was the same.\nThe scene he had taken the last time he left the house was exactly the same. The ivory-colored leather sofa his aunt had picked, the white curtains, the wooden table, the vase of flowers his aunt had left, the TV covered in dust from lack of use...\nNo, there was one thing that was different. Cha Eui-jae picked up the round stone placed in the center of the coffee table. Its smooth surface glimmered with a faint blue light. From behind him, Lee Sa-young commented.\n\"It's a preservation stone.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Usually, they're used in dungeons to keep food or valuable items in good condition... but to use one at home...\"\n\"I didn't put it here.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The director must have left it.\"\nCha Eui-jae swallowed hard. What had been on her mind, what thoughts did she have as she left a preservation stone in this empty house? In his house, and even at his aunt's place. He couldn't begin to imagine. A dull ache spread through his chest. Cha Eui-jae, feeling uneasy, tugged at Lee Sa-young's arm.\n\"Come here.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"I'll show you my room.\"\n\"...\"\nIt felt like there was a bit of resistance in Lee Sa-young's arm. Cha Eui-jae opened the door that had been tightly shut. Inside was just a bed and a single wardrobe. The neatly folded gray blanket, even the creases on it, were exactly the same as in his memories. It didn't feel at all like he was returning after eight years. It felt more like he had just left for a short trip.\nCha Eui-jae glanced up at Lee Sa-young, who stood beside him. He was genuinely relieved to have Lee Sa-young there— it made him realize more quickly that it had indeed been eight long years.\nLee Sa-young carefully examined the room, empty save for a few essentials. Finally, he turned to meet Cha Eui-jae's gaze, his violet eyes glinting mischievously. A subtle tension hung in the air. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath. He reminded himself not to lose focus— he had come here for a reason. He needed to test it, before Lee Sa-young slipped out of \"Lee Sa-young's\" influence. Before he returned to normal.\nBoth of them had to fall asleep. Together.\nWith a surprisingly gentle tone, Cha Eui-jae called out to him.\n\"Sa-young.\"\n\"Yes, Hyung?\"\nCha Eui-jae slowly removed the watch from his wrist. The violet eyes followed the movement intently, as if swallowing every detail. After inhaling deeply, Cha Eui-jae spoke decisively.\n\"Let's sleep.\"\nLee Sa-young's violet eyes widened in shock, filled with disbelief.",

      "content": "Chapter 188 - Multiple Thoughts\nCha Eui-jae stared in bewilderment at Lee Sa-young's trembling eyes. Why was he acting like this all of a sudden? Lee Sa-young even took a step back, as if he were about to bolt out of the room. This guy, who usually couldn't stand not being close to him!\nWhat's with him now? Cha Eui-jae absentmindedly rubbed the chin of his mask before stopping abruptly.\n'Wait a second.'\nWhat did I just say? Let's sleep?\nA strange sense of déjà vu crept in. It felt like they had argued about something like this before. The conversation from back then slowly surfaced in his mind.\n\"Just to sleep! Literally sleep! Nothing weird!\"\n\"I wasn't going to misunderstand, but now it seems like you're the one who had weird thoughts, Hyung.\"\nNo way.\nEventually, Cha Eui-jae's face was also filled with shock. He unconsciously took a step back, pointing accusingly.\n\"Hey, hey, what are you thinking? What's with that expression?\"\n\"...\"\nThere was distrust in the eyes he could see through the gas mask's lenses.\nWhat, does he think I'm some kind of pervert now? He was being treated like a creep for no reason. Frustrated, Cha Eui-jae clasped his hands together and mimed falling asleep, pressing them to the side of his face as if resting on a pillow.\n\"No, I meant sleep! You know, head on the pillow, blanket over us. Nothing weird! Last time you said you weren't even going to misunderstand, so why are you acting like this now?\"\n\"...Who said anything?\"\n\"Your eyes are impure right now. And why are you backing away?\"\n\"I just want to move back. You're the one making it weird... Besides, didn't you phrase it weird in the first place?\"\n\"You're the one who misunderstood first!\"\nLee Sa-young crossed his arms and snorted, but the distance between them didn't shrink. No. Cha Eui-jae could feel it— the more they talked, the more Lee Sa-young was slipping back into his usual, unyielding self. The version of him Cha Eui-jae knew was regaining control, and that was bad.\nFeeling desperate, Cha Eui-jae quickly stepped forward and grabbed Lee Sa-young by the shoulders. Lee Sa-young narrowed his eyes. Cha Eui-jae's voice wavered like a bleating goat as he asked,\n\"Lee Sa-young, aren't you sleepy? I hope you're feeling sleepy.\"\n\"...Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?\"\n\"We have to sleep. Please, let's just sleep.\"\n\"Why do we have to sleep? In the middle of the day?\"\n\"If I explain, it'll take too long. Just lie down first, and I'll explain.\"\n\"Even if it takes long, go ahead. It's not like we're short on time...\"\n\"No, we are short on time.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nCha Eui-jae gritted his teeth, holding onto Lee Sa-young as he stubbornly resisted. Clutching his shoulders tightly, Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes and hung his head low before shouting,\n\"If you and I don't sleep, the apocalypse won't be stopped!\"\nGo! Go! Go...!\nMaybe it was because the only furniture in the room was the bed, but Cha Eui-jae's words echoed faintly, lingering in the air. Damn it. He felt like crying. Lee Sa-young, who had been staring blankly at Cha Eui-jae, grabbed the filter part of his gas mask and let out a deep sigh.\n\"Hyung, you're... seriously...\"\n\"...\"\n\"This is ridiculous...\"\nWith another sigh, Lee Sa-young placed his hand over Cha Eui-jae's, still gripping his shoulders.\n\"Fine... Let's lie down. Explain while we lie down.\"\n\"Really?\"\nCha Eui-jae lifted his head in surprise. In that instant, Lee Sa-young slid his fingers under the mask and removed it with a soft click, revealing his flushed face beneath. He stared at Lee Sa-young's bright eyes for a moment before tapping Cha Eui-jae's forehead lightly with the filter.\n\"You'll take responsibility for this.\"\nA moment later.\n'Should've listened to my aunt and bought a bigger bed...'\nCha Eui-jae was now regretting a choice he'd made eight years ago.\nThe room, which previously only held a bed, now looked more like someone lived there, with gas masks, a mask, a black coat, and a jacket scattered on the floor.\nOn top of that, the weight pressing against his back was no joke. It was impossible for two adult men to comfortably lie side by side on a super single bed, so the two of them had to lie sideways, back-to-back. And yet, it was still cramped.\nHaving given the pillow to Lee Sa-young, Cha Eui-jae had to rest his head on his arm, glaring at the wall. He needed to mentally prepare himself.\n'It's still better than using a skull as a pillow back in the rift.'\nHe could clearly feel Lee Sa-young breathing through his back. They were so close that he couldn't even wriggle his toes without causing discomfort. Then, Lee Sa-young's back rumbled. He was talking.\n\"So to sum it up, you can see past worlds through the watch... and the other guy inside me can also see them. If we're close, we share what we see in front of us. Is that right?\"\n\"...Yeah, that's right.\"\n\"The reason you suddenly wanted us to sleep together... is because when I'm under that guy's influence, if we sleep together, I could see the world even without him falling asleep. Is that right?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"It's a clever idea, but...\"\nLee Sa-young's large foot nudged Cha Eui-jae's foot.\n\"Hmm. And you hid this from me until now?\"\nCha Eui-jae bit the inside of his cheek. Again! He gritted his teeth and replied,\n\"No... I didn't hide it. I just missed the right timing to say it. I've been all over the place myself...\"\n\"Oh, so you had time to run away but no time to explain?\"\n\"I was panicking back then too.\"\n\"Sure, let's go with that.\"\nThe blanket rustled, followed by a grumbling voice.\n\"But do we really have to sleep like this? It's uncomfortable.\"\n\"That's why I said I'd sleep on the floor.\"\nLee Sa-young snorted. Cha Eui-jae grumbled quietly.\nAt that moment, 'Lee Sa-young' was sitting in a chair next to the bed. It seemed that as long as the two were close to the watch, they could connect without physical contact. After a brief explanation, Cha Eui-jae had proposed sleeping on the floor, realizing the bed was too narrow for two men. However...\n\"Who said you could?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Lie down. We'll fit if we squeeze together.\"\nHe hadn't been able to shake off Lee Sa-young's hand as he pulled him onto the bed. And now here they were. As Lee Sa-young shifted and rustled again, Cha Eui-jae muttered,\n\"If I move to the floor now...\"\n\"Stop talking nonsense.\"\n\"Then what? We need to sleep.\"\n\"Haa...\"\nLee Sa-young sighed in annoyance and sat up. What? Was he about to sleep on the floor himself? Cha Eui-jae was about to turn around to check.\nSuddenly, an arm wrapped around his waist, pulling their bodies together. Warm breath brushed against the back of his neck and ear. Cha Eui-jae instinctively held his breath. A low voice murmured,\n\"Lift your head a bit.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hurry.\"\nStill stiff, Cha Eui-jae obediently lifted his head slightly. A firm arm slid into the space between his neck and the mattress. What is this? Cha Eui-jae blinked, frozen in place like a stone statue. What's going on? He was now entirely enveloped in warmth, from his back to his waist and legs. And what was pressing against his back wasn't a back...\nA chest?\nWhile Cha Eui-jae was frozen, Lee Sa-young coolly covered them both with the blanket. The soft fabric wrapped around their bodies, and their legs tangled together. A large foot brushed against his shin. Cha Eui-jae clenched his fists. Lee Sa-young muttered,\n\"Now this is better.\"\nNot for me!\nCha Eui-jae barely swallowed down a scream. This was the first time they'd ever been this close, and in such a cramped space, no less. His heart pounded. Lee Sa-young must know too, he thought, given how close they were. They were practically one body.\nHeat radiated from his toes and fingertips, spreading through his entire body. Cha Eui-jae squeezed his eyes shut. The hand wrapped around his waist and resting on his stomach felt too heavy.\nFrom behind, a low voice whispered,\n\"...It's too loud.\"\n\"What is?\"\n\"Your heartbeat.\"\nCha Eui-jae flinched and snapped back,\n\"Shut up.\"\n\"Can you stop fidgeting?\"\n\"It's not like I'm doing it on purpose. We're stuck together like this...\"\nJust as Cha Eui-jae grumbled and shifted his body,\n\"...\"\nSomething pressed against him.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nSilence hung in the air. Cha Eui-jae paused for a moment before abruptly sitting up. Lee Sa-young frowned.\n\"What now...?\"\n\"I can't do this.\"\nThere was no way he could sleep like this! Cha Eui-jae grabbed his head in frustration, messing up his hair. Lee Sa-young buried his face in the pillow with a sigh before lifting his head again.\n\"What do you mean you can't? You were the one who wanted to sleep together.\"\n\"How about we hit each other once? Passing out counts as sleep, right?\"\n\"...Are you serious?\"\nLee Sa-young ground his teeth and rubbed his face with his hand. Cha Eui-jae awkwardly rubbed the back of his neck, feeling the heat rising. His face and neck were surely flushed bright red.\n\"Cha Eui-jae.\"\nLee Sa-young's cracked voice called his name, making Cha Eui-jae flinch. He didn't even have the energy to get angry at being addressed so casually. Lee Sa-young's black-tipped fingers wrapped around his side.\n\"You don't need to be so self-conscious...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm holding back too, so just lie down.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Shit... we need to save this damn world first...\"\nLee Sa-young irritably finished his sentence and forcibly laid Cha Eui-jae back down. Once again, warmth enveloped his entire body.\nDamn it! Cha Eui-jae squeezed his eyes shut and tried to ignore the overwhelming sensations. His racing heart, the slightly labored breathing, the rustling sound of the blanket every time a foot moved. And then, at some point, the room fell quiet. Eventually, Cha Eui-jae realized something.\nThe loud heartbeat he'd been hearing wasn't only his own.\nOnce he realized that, sleep finally came to him. Cha Eui-jae didn't resist it and closed his eyes.\n***\nWhen he opened his eyes again, a familiar yet strange scene came into view. The wallpaper and everything else were identical to the room he had been in before falling asleep. However, there was a subtle sense of wrongness.\nCha Eui-jae sat up. The feel and color of the blanket were the same. The difference was... the room had a lot more furniture. There were desks, bookshelves, drawers, and a wardrobe— making it look much more like a lived-in home compared to the original room. And then,\n'Am I alone?'\nThe presence of Lee Sa-young, who had been pressed tightly against his back, was gone.\n'Did I end up in the right place...?'\nJudging by the look of things, this wasn't reality. Cha Eui-jae scratched his head and got out of bed. That's when he noticed he was wearing silk pajamas— something Cha Eui-jae would never have bought for himself.\nHe gently pinched the collar between his thumb and forefinger. The soft, smooth fabric felt strangely familiar.\nHe should probably step outside. This place seemed to be his home, after all. Cha Eui-jae cautiously opened the closed door. Creak— light spilled through the crack. And then,\n\"...\"\nHe found Lee Sa-young, dressed in the exact same pajamas as him.",

      "content": "Chapter 189 - Multiple Thoughts\nCha Eui-jae tightly shut his eyes after witnessing a reality he didn't want to face. Sharing a bed in the Memorial Dungeon was one thing, but now they were wearing the same pajamas? Ridiculous!\nFortunately, Lee Sa-young was sitting on the sofa, eyes closed, and didn't witness Cha Eui-jae's distress. From the way he was rubbing his temples, it seemed like he had fallen asleep. Cha Eui-jae moved quietly, tiptoeing into the living room.\nThe wallpaper, the house's layout, the familiar furniture— most of it was recognizable, except for a few differences. It was unlike the house he had seen in the Memorial Dungeon.\nThe sights seen through the Memorial Dungeon and the clock belonged to the first world. So then...\n'It doesn't seem to be the first world.'\nDid he come to the right place? Cha Eui-jae pulled back the white curtains covering the living room window. His face twisted.\n\"...\"\nOnly darkness greeted him.\nHe should have been able to see the street outside, but beyond the large window was nothing but perfect darkness. Just like beyond the door of the Memorial Dungeon.\n'Are they telling me to see for myself...?'\nThe glass reflected Cha Eui-jae's image like a mirror. The man in loose silk pajamas with black hair staring back at him was Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae absently ran a hand through his hair. At that moment, a pitch-black shape appeared behind him in the glass. A flickering, human-like shadow with bright, violet eyes.\nCha Eui-jae whipped around, but there was nothing— just the peaceful living room and the sleeping Lee Sa-young. He looked back at the glass. The shadow had already shifted into the form of Lee Sa-young, his violet eyes narrowing.\nCha Eui-jae narrowed his eyes in return.\n\"You...\"\n'Ah, I didn't expect you to come here through such a method... how creative.'\nA voice tinged with amusement echoed. Lee Sa-young cupped a hand over his mouth and chuckled. So, it seemed he had come to the right place. After laughing low for a long time, Lee Sa-young murmured.\n'But still, I'm glad you came to see me... though it's a shame we didn't sleep together.'\n\"Sleep together, my ass. Hey, I don't have time to mess around with you. I came here for information.\"\n'Of course... So, what is it you want to know from here?'\n\"How the apocalypse came, what caused it.\"\n'And?'\n\"How to stop it.\"\nLee Sa-young tilted his head.\n'Aha... But you've already failed twice.'\n\"Didn't you send me back in time thinking I could stop it?\"\n'Me?'\n\"Yeah. You.\"\n'No, I didn't.'\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. In the glass, Lee Sa-young tilted his head, smiling softly. A lock of hair fell across his eyes. This was the most expressive he'd ever seen the Lee Sa-young of the second world. His lips moved silently.\n'Do you really think I sent you back in time to stop the apocalypse?'\n\"Isn't that the case?\"\n'Oh my... Think a little harder.'\nLee Sa-young exaggeratedly shrugged and sighed, clearly intending to make a point. This bastard... Cha Eui-jae was about to snap back when Lee Sa-young spoke first.\n'I sent you back in time... because you died.'\n\"Isn't that the same thing?\"\n'Of course not. Even if the apocalypse comes and the world ends, as long as you're alive... the end of the world means nothing.'\nHis face darkened, a sinister smile faintly appearing beneath. It stretched, as if his mouth had been torn.\n'It wouldn't matter at all.'\n\"...\"\n'So stop talking nonsense about stopping the end of the world. Don't even think about it.'\n\"Just watch it all fall apart? Do you think I can do that?\"\n'I figured you'd say that, but hearing it in person doesn't feel great.'\nThe devilish smile vanished like melting snow, replaced by a blank expression. Returning to his usual emotionless self, Lee Sa-young shrugged.\n'Since you're here anyway, might as well look around. You won't find the information you're after, though.'\nWith that, Lee Sa-young disappeared into the darkness. Cha Eui-jae stared at his reflection in the glass for a long moment, then ruffled his hair.\nHe'd definitely come to the world that creepy bastard had shown him. Next thing to check... Cha Eui-jae peeked beyond the curtain. Lee Sa-young was still asleep on the sofa.\n'Did Lee Sa-young cross over too?'\nHe could just wake him up and ask. Cha Eui-jae tiptoed closer to Lee Sa-young and bent over, folding his arms behind his back as he stared intently at Lee Sa-young's face.\nHis plump lips were slightly parted, his long lashes occasionally fluttered, and his high nose stood out... Cha Eui-jae studied his face closely, just about to call his name and wake him.\n\"Mmm...\"\nThe thin eyelids twitched, and beneath them, violet eyes slowly appeared. Lee Sa-young, dazed, gazed blankly at Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae waved his hand in front of Lee Sa-young's face for no reason.\n\"Are you awake?\"\n\"...\"\n\"We need to talk.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young blinked slowly, still out of it. He looked like he hadn't fully gathered his senses. Oh well. Cha Eui-jae grabbed Lee Sa-young's cheek and pulled.\n\"What are you doing?\"\nLee Sa-young frowned, swatting Cha Eui-jae's hand away. Good. Judging by his attitude, this was the Lee Sa-young Cha Eui-jae knew. Lee Sa-young glanced around the room before looking back at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"...What's with those pajamas?\"\n\"I don't know. I woke up wearing them. You're wearing them too.\"\nLee Sa-young looked down at the clothes he was wearing and sighed.\n\"Looks like we made it... judging by the state of things.\"\n\"Seems like it.\"\nLeaning back on the sofa, Lee Sa-young asked,\n\"Alright. We've solved the first problem, so... what are you going to do now?\"\n\"I'm going to search his memories thoroughly. How the apocalypse came, how it was resolved. I'll find even the smallest clue.\"\n\"Fine, do that.\"\nLee Sa-young got up, and Cha Eui-jae asked absentmindedly:\n\"...You're not going to stop me?\"\n\"Why would I?\"\nLee Sa-young blinked, and Cha Eui-jae blinked too. Right. Why did he think Lee Sa-young would stop him? Was it because of the warning 'Lee Sa-young' gave?\nLee Sa-young rubbed the back of his neck, speaking lazily.\n\"We came all this way to find that out, didn't we? Even if we had to grind up against each other.\"\n\"You always have to say weird things, don't you?\"\n\"What, I'm not wrong. Anyway...\"\nHis violet eyes scanned the empty air sharply.\n\"Let's finish this quickly, whatever it is.\"\n\"Why? Did you notice something strange?\"\n\"Don't you feel it?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nCha Eui-jae looked at him in confusion. Now that he thought about it, Lee Sa-young's delicate face had a hint of discomfort. Lee Sa-young clenched and unclenched his fists, rolled his neck, and moved his legs, as if testing his range of motion. He muttered in frustration,\n\"My body feels unusually heavy. Like I'm under some kind of curse or restriction.\"\nCha Eui-jae flexed his hands and feet, testing his own body. He didn't feel anything out of the ordinary. His state was just like in the original world. Had 'Lee Sa-young' pulled some kind of trick? He eyed Lee Sa-young with concern.\n\"Can you still fight?\"\n\"I'm not sure, honestly.\"\n\"Do you want to wait here? I can explore on my own.\"\n\"What kind of nonsense is that...\"\nLee Sa-young gripped Cha Eui-jae's shoulder tightly, his violet eyes blazing.\n\"Go change your clothes. Let's see what's so important about these memories.\"\nLuckily, the wardrobe was filled with the black clothes that Cha Eui-jae often wore during his time as J, and there was even a mask neatly placed on one side. After putting on the mask, Cha Eui-jae stepped out into the living room. Lee Sa-young, casually draped in a coat, looked at Cha Eui-jae with tired eyes.\n\"You sure you're okay?\"\n\"I'm not so weak I can't move... I just feel a bit sluggish.\"\nJust as he said, his eyes were half-closed. After rubbing his eyes, Lee Sa-young headed toward the front door. Two pairs of boots and a pair of striped slippers were neatly lined up at the entrance. As he pushed his feet into the boots, Lee Sa-young spoke.\n\"In the memory dungeon, we lived in a different house from this one, right?\"\n\"Yeah, that's true.\"\n\"Why do you think we live in this house in this world? The house where you used to live?\"\nCha Eui-jae stared at Lee Sa-young's back as he fumbled with his boots and spoke what came to mind.\n\"Maybe... we moved to a safer house back then?\"\n\"...A safer house?\"\nLee Sa-young, now fully in his boots, took a few steps forward and turned around. As Cha Eui-jae laced up his boots, kneeling on one knee, he continued speaking.\n\"In that world, you weren't an awakened. On top of that, your eyes were hurt from the poison, and you were a regular person. I imagine you might've moved to a place with better security or closer to a hospital.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Well, I mean, that's what I would've done, and that Cha Eui-jae is still me...\"\nAfter finishing his sentence, Cha Eui-jae felt awkward. Clearing his throat unnecessarily, he got up from his kneeling position. Just then, a rough hand grabbed Cha Eui-jae by the arm, pulling him close. He was about to shake off the grip but stopped when Lee Sa-young's face came close. Their faces drew nearer and nearer, almost touching Cha Eui-jae's mask when—\nBeep— Beep— Beep—\nA loud alarm rang out. Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened as he looked around. An alarm, out of nowhere? At that moment, Lee Sa-young, who had been holding onto Cha Eui-jae, let out a strained groan and hunched over. Cha Eui-jae hurriedly supported Lee Sa-young by the shoulders. Small sparks flickered and crackled around Lee Sa-young.\n\"Sa-young! What's going on, why are you like this?\"\n\"I don't know, it's just...\"\nLee Sa-young's body jerked and twitched sporadically, as if he was being electrocuted.\nWait a second... That loud, annoying alarm— where have I heard that before? Just then, a bright white window suddenly appeared in front of them.\n[Warning! Please act according to your role.]\n[Lee Sa-young's role is: Beloved Younger Brother.]\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What the hell is this crap...\"\nLee Sa-young barely managed to spit out a curse. Hold on, act according to the role? Then what about me? Cha Eui-jae scrolled through the window to check his own role. And then he saw...\n[Cha Eui-jae's role is ( ).]\nNothing. There was nothing listed.",

      "content": "Chapter 190 - Multiple Thoughts\nThe blank space he saw immediately filled Cha Eui-jae with a sudden surge of anxiety.\nWhat is the purpose of a person without a designated role? Is it okay to even remain in this place? Unknowingly, Cha Eui-jae tightened his grip on Lee Sa-young, who let out a small groan. Realizing what he had done, Cha Eui-jae quickly loosened his hold and pulled his hands away. At the same time, the sparks flickering around Lee Sa-young disappeared.\n\"Oh, sorry. Are you okay?\"\nLee Sa-young straightened his hunched body and brushed his shoulders off. With a tone of irritation, he asked, \"Is this really a dream?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"The system has some kind of coercive power. I just got penalized for breaking a rule... and the sensations are so vivid.\"\nNow that he mentioned it, it was strange. Could a system interfere with a human's dream? Of course, Yoon Ga-eul had once seen fragments of a ruined world in her dreams, but she could only observe— it wasn't possible to interfere with that world. A system that imposes force and physical power like this...\n\"This does feel more like a dungeon, considering what just happened.\"\nCha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck.\n\"I saw memories from a previous world, just like Ga-eul did. So I naturally assumed this was just another dream.\"\n\"But there was never a situation where physical force was used, right?\"\n\"Yeah. I just watched it, like I was at the movies.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, who Cha Eui-jae thought might make some sarcastic comment, remained surprisingly quiet. He seemed to be deep in thought. Staring into space, he suddenly tilted his head and rested his temple lightly on Cha Eui-jae's head. Thankfully, there was no penalty this time.\nWas this considered an action fitting for a younger brother to do with his older brother? Cha Eui-jae frowned. Lee Sa-young muttered quietly.\n\"If my role is to be the good younger brother... then what's your role?\"\nCha Eui-jae answered calmly, trying to maintain his composure.\n\"...There isn't one.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"There was nothing written there. I guess I don't have a role.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young let out a low hum. Then he straightened up.\n\"I've been thinking, about a lot of things.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"The person who made this place... doesn't seem to be in their right mind...\"\nSelf-reflection?\nCha Eui-jae swallowed the words that had risen to his throat. Fortunately, Lee Sa-young seemed too distracted by other thoughts to notice Cha Eui-jae's reaction. He reached out and grabbed the doorknob.\n\"We should be careful...\"\nLee Sa-young whispered, his voice cracking.\n\"Because it wouldn't be surprising if something jumped out at us from anywhere.\"\nClick. The doorknob turned.\nThe door opened.\nBlaaare— A loud horn blared. The sedan that had honked quickly disappeared down the road. A motorcycle zoomed by with a loud vroom. The scene outside the door was not an apartment lobby or hallway, but a road!\n'So this really was made by someone who's lost their mind.'\nLee Sa-young, holding the doorknob, looked at the road with a dumbfounded expression.\nPeople were walking on the sidewalk next to the road. They wore earphones, stared at their phones, or talked with someone as they walked.\nOddly enough, their faces were all clear. Eyes, noses, mouths, their moving lips, the motions of their fingers and bodies, even the way their hair swayed— it was all vivid. They were completely different from the people in the blurry memories of Cha Eui-jae.\nCha Eui-jae muttered absentmindedly,\n\"They're too clear.\"\n\"...\"\n\"They seem like real, living people.\"\n\"Your dream wasn't like this?\"\nCha Eui-jae nodded slightly. In the memories Cha Eui-jae had seen through the clock, the people had been blurry. They were merely human-like shapes, and their faces couldn't be seen clearly. Only people like Honeybee, Jung Bin, or the Director had appeared with clear forms and voices.\n'Back then, I thought it was because they were people Cha Eui-jae had strong impressions of.'\nBut was that really the case? Lost in thought, Cha Eui-jae responded belatedly.\n\"The people connected to those memories were clear... the others were blurry.\"\nCould a person remember everything perfectly? There's nothing more uncertain than memory. Memory is something we can manipulate as we please. Cha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young.\n\"You don't have an exceptional memory or anything, right? Like photographic memory?\"\n\"If you're asking whether I can remember things this vividly... no.\"\nLee Sa-young crossed his arms, scanning the movements of the people one by one. Not long after, he gave a light comment, as casually as if he were talking about the weather.\n\"This is creepy...\"\nWas it really that bad? Cha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young. He was covering his mouth. His frowning brow and the hand over his lips made him look genuinely disturbed. With a jerk of his chin, he motioned toward the street.\n\"...We should get moving. Do you have a place in mind?\"\n\"Seowon Guild?\"\nAt the mention of it, Lee Sa-young frowned reflexively. The furrow between his brows deepened.\n\"...Seowon Guild? Nam Woo-jin? Why there?\"\n\"Well, when I saw the fragments, it looked like it was some sort of base. Maybe even a shelter... you and I would have been in and out of there a lot after the end of the world, so there might be something useful there.\"\n\"...Then let's go.\"\nLee Sa-young stepped aside slightly, as if gesturing for Cha Eui-jae to take the lead. Cha Eui-jae stepped out onto the road.\nThe pavement, with a slightly cracked edge, and the small wildflowers and grasses growing between the tiles seemed too detailed to be artificial. Even though there was no wind, the wildflowers swayed gently. This place mimicked reality down to the smallest detail. As if it were another world. As if someone had tried to painstakingly reconstruct it.\n'I think I get why he said it felt creepy...'\nCha Eui-jae walked with deliberate force. Despite the black mask on his face, none of the people walking along the street gave him a second glance. In the real world, he wouldn't have been able to walk like this without being mobbed by people. He felt like a complete outsider.\nA blank space.\nAn outsider.\n\"...\"\nBut Cha Eui-jae didn't feel lonely. The sound of footsteps behind him proved that he wasn't alone.\nAfter walking for who knows how long, a familiar building came into view.\nIt was the Seowon Guild's building. Its entrance was wide open, unguarded, as if inviting them in.\nCha Eui-jae turned to look back. Lee Sa-young, still wearing a displeased expression, nodded when their eyes met.\n\"It looks like they want us to come in.\"\nAs they stepped into the entrance, a long, straight hallway stretched out before them. At the far end, a glimpse of a library filled with books came into view. As they got closer, the crisp scent of old paper and books teased Cha Eui-jae's nose. Just as Cha Eui-jae stepped inside and Lee Sa-young's black boots hit the red carpet behind him, a voice echoed throughout the library.\n\"A surprise guest has arrived.\"\nAt the same time, a white system window appeared before their eyes.\n[Please select the correct answer within 5 seconds.]\n[Q. Nam Woo-jin: \"A surprise guest has arrived.\"]\n1. Get lost.\n2. Shut up.\n3. Die.\n4. Thanks for the warm welcome.\n[Choosing the wrong answer will result in a penalty.]\n[Penalty: Decreased stay time.]\nWhat's up with these choices!\n'...Well, number 4 seems the least aggressive, right? Though it's still a bit sarcastic, we didn't come here to pick a fight.'\nCha Eui-jae, momentarily dumbfounded by the rude and inappropriate options, quickly began to consider his answer. But before he could make a decision, Lee Sa-young reached out without hesitation and pressed option 2 with his black fingers. He spoke.\n\"Shut up.\"\n\"What?\"\n[You have selected the correct answer. Congratulations!]\n'Shut up' was the right answer?\nCha Eui-jae widened his eyes in surprise and looked back at Lee Sa-young. Their eyes met. Lee Sa-young shrugged as if to say, 'What's the problem?' Cha Eui-jae couldn't help but be impressed.\n\"You... have a good sense for this, huh?\"\nWas it because they were kindred spirits? However, Lee Sa-young looked as though he'd bitten into something bitter, his face twisted in a grimace. He whispered through clenched teeth.\n\"Don't tell me that was meant to sound nice?\"\nIt was a compliment, though. Lee Sa-young muttered coldly.\n\"Annoying.\"\nSo cold. Just then, the library echoed with a clear, ringing laugh.\n\"Ah, yes, yes. What brings you here today? It's not a scheduled inspection.\"\n\"I need information.\"\n\"If it's information you want, you should head to the fish market.\"\n\"Not that kind of information. Academic information. About the system.\"\n\"Hmm... I didn't think you'd be interested in such things. What's got you in the mood for studying today?\"\nA white coat fluttered between the shelves of books. Nam Woo-jin, holding an open book in one hand, walked up to stand beside Cha Eui-jae. But he didn't look at Cha Eui-jae. It was as if he didn't even know Cha Eui-jae existed.\n'No way...'\nCan he not see me? Cha Eui-jae waved his hand in front of Nam Woo-jin's face. Nam Woo-jin calmly closed his book with a snap. He was only looking at Lee Sa-young. Cha Eui-jae tried to grab Nam Woo-jin's shoulder.\nOr at least, he thought he did.\nHis hand passed right through Nam Woo-jin's body. Meanwhile, Nam Woo-jin, with a satisfied smile like a well-fed cat, tucked the book under his arm. His eyes, burned white, curved into a grin.\n\"That's a good attitude. So, what is it you're curious about?\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae, withdrawing his hand, unknowingly glanced at Lee Sa-young.\nHis face had gone cold and hard.",

      "content": "Chapter 191 - Multiple Thoughts\nCha Eui-jae swung his arm, which had pierced through Nam Woo-jin's face and shoulder, then quietly stepped back. A stern gaze followed him. Cha Eui-jae didn't mind and looked around.\n'First... I need to figure out what works and what doesn't.'\nThinking back to when he hugged Lee Sa-young at home, it seemed like he could make contact with him. Cha Eui-jae tapped the floor with his foot. He could still stand on solid ground. Cha Eui-jae waved his arm toward Lee Sa-young.\n\"Hey! I need to check something for a sec.\"\n\"What now...!\"\n\"...Huh? What's wrong? Weren't you going to ask me something?\"\nAs Lee Sa-young's voice grew louder, Nam Woo-jin tilted his head in confusion. It seemed like even sound couldn't reach him. Lee Sa-young bit his lip and glared at Cha Eui-jae, as if telling him not to move recklessly. Cha Eui-jae pointed toward the bookshelf.\n\"No, I was just going to check if I can touch things.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll do it where you can see me. Is that okay? I'm going to do it now, alright?\"\nWith a sigh, Lee Sa-young averted his glaring eyes. Cha Eui-jae pulled out a book from the shelves, which were packed all the way to the ceiling. Fortunately, he could touch it. He examined the book. There was nothing written on the cover or the spine.\nThe inside of the book was the same— endless rows of blank pages.\n\"...\"\nHe pulled out another book and skimmed through it, but it was blank as well. Blank, blank, blank... As he kept flipping through, the pile of books at his feet grew taller. It was as if they had gathered stacks of empty notebooks disguised as books.\n'This isn't a stationery shop notebook section.'\nCha Eui-jae scratched his head. Could Nam Woo-jin have had an odd habit of collecting blank books? Holding a few of the blank books, Cha Eui-jae approached Lee Sa-young. The two were in the middle of a conversation. Nam Woo-jin asked,\n\"...The information related to the system is too vast; even if we stayed up all night, I couldn't explain it all. You should narrow it down to what specifically you're curious about.\"\n\"Everything related to the end.\"\n\"The end?\"\nNam Woo-jin responded with a puzzled expression.\n\"The end... what do you mean by that?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young narrowed his eyes. Cha Eui-jae examined Nam Woo-jin's face. It wasn't the face of someone lying. It was the innocent look of someone truly ignorant. After a moment, Nam Woo-jin smirked, twirling his white hair with his fingers.\n\"Aha... Have you been listening to some doomsday theories? All of that is just made-up nonsense.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't let yourself be swayed by such strange talk.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Honestly, there are so many people trying to take advantage of others by stirring up anxiety... It's the end of the world, really.\"\nNam Woo-jin clicked his tongue and began muttering. It seemed like he had a lot to say on the subject. Seizing the moment, Lee Sa-young glanced at Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae opened one of the books and showed him the blank pages.\n\"All the books on the shelf look like this. Is this how they normally are?\"\nLee Sa-young gave a small shake of his head. The books were supposed to be fine. Then, Lee Sa-young called out to Nam Woo-jin.\n\"Doctor.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nLee Sa-young asked calmly,\n\"Do you know J?\"\n\"J?\"\nNam Woo-jin blinked his bright, flame-colored eyes. Cha Eui-jae unconsciously held his breath, waiting for an answer. For a brief moment, the white flame seemed to flicker with a hint of purple. Finally, Nam Woo-jin responded.\n\"What's that?\"\nAn answer filled with confusion.\n***\n\"Haa...\"\nA deep breath escaped, as if the ground beneath him would give way. The sigh belonged to Cha Eui-jae, who was sitting at a terrace table of a handmade burger joint. Cha Eui-jae rolled his eyes. Beyond the glass window of the shop, he could see Lee Sa-young's back, clad in a black coat. For some reason, it was oddly amusing to watch that big, dark figure placing an order at the counter.\n'Anyway...'\nCha Eui-jae rested his chin on his hand, automatically replaying the events at the Seowon Guild in his mind.\n\"J? What's that?\"\nThe moment Lee Sa-young heard Nam Woo-jin's answer, he immediately grabbed Cha Eui-jae's arm, spitting out in irritation.\n\"No point in hearing more...\"\nThey left the library, and the two wandered aimlessly through the streets. They had no destination— just walking wherever their feet took them, heading in the same direction. People avoided Lee Sa-young, but Cha Eui-jae passed by them as if unnoticed.\nAs Lee Sa-young silently watched the scene, he suddenly spoke.\n\"I'm hungry.\"\nThanks to that, they now had a new destination— the nearest restaurant, which happened to be this handmade burger place. Naturally, Lee Sa-young was in charge of ordering.\nCha Eui-jae took off his mask. After all, no one could see him anyway. Wearing J's clothes but with the mask off, he felt strange— a mix of mild unease and a bit of liberation.\nA cool breeze brushed across his face, but the sensation of the wind felt oddly unfamiliar. His ashen hair was blown into a mess by the wind, and Cha Eui-jae blinked unnecessarily.\n\"You took off the mask.\"\nAt that moment, Lee Sa-young set a tray down on the table with a thud and sat across from him. He inserted a straw into a cola and pushed it toward Cha Eui-jae, who rested his chin on his hand.\n\"You're the only one who can see me, anyway.\"\n\"...True.\"\nLee Sa-young tossed a French fry into his mouth, chewing it, and then followed Cha Eui-jae's lead, resting his chin on his hand as well.\n\"You're taking this better than I thought.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Being invisible to everyone. And... no one remembering you.\"\nInstead of answering, Cha Eui-jae just shrugged. Lee Sa-young frowned slightly.\n\"Aren't you anxious?\"\n\"I mean, well...\"\nIf he had been alone, he would definitely have felt anxious. He might not have been able to take a single step, unable to bear the sudden loneliness. But...\nCha Eui-jae stared quietly at Lee Sa-young before taking a sip of the cola in front of him. Then,\n\"Hyung?\"\nFuck!\nHe slammed the cup down, though carefully enough not to break the table.\nCha Eui-jae shook the cup, watching the black liquid ripple inside as ice clinked together. The fizz from the soda crackled loudly. It was black, carbonated, and served with fries and a burger.\nIt's cola, right? Cha Eui-jae couldn't believe it and asked.\n\"...Is this soda water?\"\n\"Huh? It's cola.\"\nLee Sa-young blinked. Cha Eui-jae took a deep breath and drank the supposed cola once again. Afterward, he covered his eyes with his hand, still holding the straw. He didn't want to accept reality.\n\"...\"\nThere was no sweetness! All he could feel was the carbonation assaulting his mouth and throat. This was the collapse of cola. While Cha Eui-jae was in the throes of despair, Lee Sa-young twisted the knife further.\n\"It's cola.\"\n\"Liar.\"\n\"No, it really is.\"\nLee Sa-young suddenly offered him a French fry.\n\"Try it.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae stared at the fry with a reluctant expression. Why was he offering this now? It looked crispy and warm on the outside, golden yellow and appetizing. Freshly fried, it seemed. As Cha Eui-jae started to have a staring contest with the fry, Lee Sa-young slyly stuck out his dark tongue.\n\"Since I can't taste it... shouldn't you be the one to check if something's wrong?\"\nThat made sense.\nBut he didn't want to eat something that would taste exactly like he expected it to. Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes and opened his mouth. With a soft chuckle, Lee Sa-young put the fry in his mouth. He chewed once, twice, three times... After swallowing, Cha Eui-jae lowered his head in gloom.\n\"It's tasteless...\"\n\"Ah, that bad?\"\n\"No... I mean it's really tasteless. There's no flavor at all.\"\nAs much as he didn't want to, Cha Eui-jae reached for another fry. As he chewed on the flavorless fry, he took in the crispy exterior and soft potato texture underneath. But that was all. The rich, salty, greasy taste he had expected didn't follow. With a strange look, Cha Eui-jae kept chewing, mumbling as he did.\n\"No, seriously, this is weird...\"\nLee Sa-young chuckled. Tasteless food was horrible, especially if you knew what it was supposed to taste like.\n'Come to think of it.'\nLee Sa-young had mentioned he couldn't taste anything. So... Cha Eui-jae glanced at him. Lee Sa-young was casually sitting with his legs crossed, munching on the fries. Has he been living his whole life eating flavorless food like this?\n'No wonder he didn't want to eat!'\nSuddenly, he felt a wave of sympathy. Meanwhile, Lee Sa-young pulled the wooden skewer out of the burger's center and spoke up.\n\"Anyway... So you can't taste anything either.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Well, I guess that settles it.\"\nAfter taking a large bite of his burger, Lee Sa-young slowly chewed and swallowed before wiping his mouth with his thumb.\n\"This is a space reconstructed based on the other Lee Sa-young's memories.\"\n\"...\"\n\"We know Seowon Guild has a lot of books, but I don't know what they contain... so they were all blank.\"\nHe poked the bun of his burger with the skewer.\n\"And since I don't know what food tastes like... of course, it's tasteless.\"\n\"What about not knowing about the end?\"\n\"Who knows? Maybe he was dreaming of an ideal world— one without an end.\"\nA gust of wind blew, revealing Lee Sa-young's pale forehead as his hair fluttered. Cha Eui-jae abruptly asked,\n\"Fine, let's say that's true. But then why don't I have any role?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why can't anyone see me?\"\n\"I told you... he was dreaming of an ideal world.\"\nCha Eui-jae ground his teeth, the sound sharp. Lee Sa-young, still resting his chin on his hand, muttered quietly.\n\"He probably wished for a world where no one knew about you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Except for me.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 192 - Multiple Thoughts\nA world where no one except Lee Sa-young knows J. A world where selfish and primal desires are realized. Suddenly, a faint whisper came to mind.\nA fleeting memory from the first time he encountered the Lee Sa-young who created this world. His vision, tinted with blood, slowly darkened, and within that darkness, he heard a whisper.\n\"Come back... quietly... please.\"\nCome back...\nIt was undoubtedly Lee Sa-young's voice. Though the memory was unclear, Cha Eui-jae lifted his head. Lee Sa-young was sitting with his legs crossed, staring off into the distant void. For some reason, his profile looked unusually lonely.\nCha Eui-jae, feeling restless, flicked the table with his finger, making a sharp sound. Lee Sa-young turned his head. Cha Eui-jae asked.\n\"What about you?\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Do you also want me to live like that?\"\nHis violet gaze settled on Cha Eui-jae, scanning him from head to toe as if searching for something. A faint smile played on Lee Sa-young's lips as he propped his chin on his hands and smiled.\n\"Well... what do you think?\"\n\"Hey, don't mess around. Be honest.\"\n\"Well...\"\nLee Sa-young rubbed the edge of his cup with his black fingers.\n\"No matter how much I might yell at you to live quietly... You're just not the type. Haven't I learned that the hard way since we met again?\"\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"Why? You said to be honest.\"\nCha Eui-jae loosened the fist he had clenched. Lee Sa-young's long eyes crinkled in a playful smile, but his following words were far from lighthearted.\n\"In the past, I used to want to put shackles on your wrists and ankles.\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Shackles? Lee Sa-young let out a loud sigh, his long lashes trembling delicately.\n\"If I took my eyes off you for even a second, you'd bounce around like a rubber ball... What else was I supposed to do? If I didn't chain you down, there was no way you'd settle.\"\nHis fluttering lashes and lowered eyes made him look as though Cha Eui-jae had wronged him somehow. And yet, it was Lee Sa-young who had made the frightening statement about chaining someone up! Lee Sa-young tapped his pale cheek with his black fingers.\n\"Anyway, after going through all that, I realized... It's impossible to fully restrain you. And besides...\"\nHis hand snaked across the table like a serpent. When his fingers brushed Cha Eui-jae's wrist, Cha Eui-jae instinctively flinched. He held his breath as Lee Sa-young smiled angelically.\n\"After I spent those three months lying down, I became sure of one thing.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You'll let yourself be caught now.\"\nHis fingers slipped under Cha Eui-jae's palm, curling around his wrist like a serpent coiling tightly. Cha Eui-jae's breath hitched.\n\"Do whatever you want. Because now, hesitation has taken root in you.\"\nLee Sa-young tugged on Cha Eui-jae's wrist, pulling him forward. Cha Eui-jae's torso leaned closer as his heart began to race. Just as Lee Sa-young's lips brushed against the veins on Cha Eui-jae's hand—\nSnap! White sparks burst violently from Lee Sa-young's body. Startled, Cha Eui-jae leaped to his feet.\n\"Hey!\"\n\"Ah, shit...\"\nLee Sa-young bit his lip, suppressing a groan. As he curled up, enduring the pain, a white system window popped up in front of them.\n[Warning! Please act according to your role.]\n[Lee Sa-young's role is: Beloved Younger Brother.]\nLee Sa-young barely managed to read the text on the system screen, then twisted his lips into a sneer.\n\"Wow... even kissing the back of your hand breaks the 'younger brother' role?\"\nWell, that seems about right.\nAfter all, it's not like younger brothers usually go around kissing their older brother's hand.\nCha Eui-jae stepped back, looking slightly embarrassed. The sparks surrounding Lee Sa-young gradually subsided, and once the last of them had disappeared, he slumped onto the table with a long sigh. His pale lips muttered in frustration.\n\"This system is ridiculously strict...\"\nCha Eui-jae couldn't help but feel a little grateful. He had almost lost his composure. Massaging his wrist, Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"Yeah... I can handle it.\"\nLee Sa-young slowly sat up, his delicate face twisted in irritation. Cha Eui-jae sat back down, crossing his legs.\n\"Anyway, we've figured out what this place is. Even if I can't do much, you still can, so let's keep gathering information.\"\n\"Do you think you'll be able to find anything?\"\nLee Sa-young pointed to the cup of cola. Drops of condensation had formed on the surface.\n\"Whoever made this place is obsessive... They've recreated even the smallest details to make it resemble reality. They've even erased your existence from this world. It's not going to be easy.\"\n\"No. There's no such thing as perfection.\"\nWhat if a person wandered alone in a world that had already perished? What if they were the only living being left in that world? Wouldn't they either go mad or ascend to a state of transcendence?\nCha Eui-jae thought of the pale face devoid of emotion. A face that looked completely unsaddened, even as it shed tears. If someone like Lee Sa-young had wandered for so long in that ruined world... Unable to die, forced to endure because they were tied to some mission.\nThe first thing they would have discarded...\nWould be their senses, their emotions. Anything that left them vulnerable to human loneliness. Slowly, they'd grow numb to all sensations. Arms crossed, Cha Eui-jae murmured,\n\"There's got to be something they missed.\"\nLee Sa-young spread his hands and shrugged, as if to say, 'Whatever you say'.\n\"So... where are we heading next?\"\nCha Eui-jae had already thought of that. He raised two fingers. Through the gap, he saw Lee Sa-young arch an eyebrow, waiting for his answer.\n\"First, we're going to find Hong Ye-seong.\"\nLee Sa-young turned away, as if that option wasn't worth considering. But Cha Eui-jae continued, folding down one finger.\n\"Second, we're going to find Yoon Ga-eul.\"\n\"Why are both options so terrible?\"\n\"Both of them were connected to the end of the last world. It's not like I suggested we go to the hangover soup restaurant.\"\n\"Do you not remember? How you shouted that we had to find the hangover soup restaurant in the middle of a dying world?\"\n\"Oh. That was because there was an important clue there! Thanks to the clock, we made it this far, didn't we?\"\nCha Eui-jae said indignantly.\n\"Sure, whatever you say.\"\nWith a deep sigh, Lee Sa-young set his phone down on the table and hit the call button. The name that popped up on the screen...\n'Madman.'\nCha Eui-jae couldn't help but laugh. He knew exactly who that was.\nBeep.\n—Hello?\n***\n\"Wow! It's been a while! What great timing to call me while I'm down in the mortal world.\"\nHong Ye-seong puffed out his chest like a rooster. The chicken perched on his scruffy brown hair followed suit, puffing out its chest as well.\nThey were now in the hotel suite where Hong Ye-seong was staying. He'd apparently come down to the mortal world at the request of the Awakened Management Bureau or something like that.\nWhile the guest bustled around, grabbing drinks from the fridge, Cha Eui-jae eyed the chicken with suspicion. After all, a recent nightmare involving it had been fresh in his memory. The chicken cocked its head, pecking at Hong Ye-seong's head with its beak. It looked exactly like a regular chicken, but...\n'Last time it acted like a chicken, then suddenly transformed.'\nHong Ye-seong let out a sharp \"ahem,\" as his eyes twinkled. His golden eyes seemed even more crazed than Cha Eui-jae remembered. With his scruffy hair and those spinning, insane eyes, he gave off a deranged aura. Was this because he was a reconstruction based on 'Lee Sa-young's' memory? Cha Eui-jae leaned over to Lee Sa-young and whispered.\n\"Doesn't he seem even more unhinged than before?\"\nLee Sa-young gave a slight nod in agreement. Just then, Hong Ye-seong jumped up on the spot.\n\"So, what's up? Did something interesting happen? I've been so bored lately!\"\n\"Hong Ye-seong.\"\n\"Yeah? Just say the word!\"\nLee Sa-young pointed to the spot where Cha Eui-jae stood, right next to him.\n\"Can you see?\"\n\"Huh? See what?\"\nHong Ye-seong tilted his head, peering at the spot where Cha Eui-jae stood. The chicken mimicked him, cocking its head as well. Cha Eui-jae reached out, trying to grab Hong Ye-seong's head and the chicken perched on it, but his hand passed right through the bird, just as he'd expected. Lee Sa-young spoke again.\n\"Turn on your 'Eyes of Appraisal'.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nStill blinking innocently, Hong Ye-seong closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, intricate golden patterns began swirling in his pupils. Lee Sa-young gestured towards Cha Eui-jae once more.\n\"Now, can you see?\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nThe golden light in his eyes shimmered as he squinted, focusing on the spot where Cha Eui-jae stood. After a long moment, Hong Ye-seong muttered.\n\"Hey, by any chance...\"\nHis voice had dropped to a deep, serious tone, one Cha Eui-jae had never heard from him before. Cha Eui-jae swallowed nervously. Could it be that the eyes of appraisal, used by this genius and chosen artisan by the system, was able to see even those invisible to others? A glimmer of hope flickered within Cha Eui-jae.\nHong Ye-seong beamed brightly.\n\"Got a ghost haunting you? Want me to introduce you to a good shaman? There's this one in the mountains, super legit, who writes talismans and ties them with sacred ropes.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"Yes, Hyung?\"\n\"Knock him out.\"\nThud! Lee Sa-young's hand delivered a chop to the back of Hong Ye-seong's neck.\n\"Squawk!\"\nWith a final cry, Hong Ye-seong collapsed, drooling. As Lee Sa-young laid him down neatly on the floor, he picked up the chicken and placed it gently in his hands. The bird settled comfortably in his large palms, tilting its head.\n\"Bawk?\"\nLee Sa-young muttered menacingly.\n\"He's using this bird to watch us. That other guy.\"\n\"Yeah. And that guy said this bird helped the one who created this world.\"\n\"Unbelievable... what a nuisance.\"\n\"Tell me about it. Hey, come on out.\"\n\"Bawk? Bawk?\"\nThe chicken's beady black eyes sparkled innocently. But that innocent look was deceiving.\n\"Come out, you little thing! We've got some questions for you.\"\nCha Eui-jae took off his wristwatch and brought it near the chicken's head. And at that moment—\n\"SQUAWK!\"\nA bright white light burst from the chicken.",

      "content": "Chapter 193 - Multiple Thoughts\n\"Ugh, what is this?\"\n\"Unbelievable... really.\"\nLee Sa-young's muttering could be heard within the narrowing field of view. Cha Eui-jae frowned and glared at Kkokko. The blinding light that had been flashing so noisily soon faded. Kkokko was still curled up, using Lee Sa-young's hand as a nest, its tiny eyes tightly shut. Cha Eui-jae crossed his arms.\n\"Did anything even happen?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Let's just go find Yoon Ga-eul. Leave this thing behind.\"\n\"Bawk!\"\nKkokko raised both wings and squawked loudly. A strange intelligence glimmered in its tiny eyes. But what greeted it was two pairs of cold, indifferent stares. Kkokko cautiously folded its wings and began chirping with its beak. Urgent whispers flowed out of its cute little face.\n\"Friend, don't call me! I just came to say that.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because the owner of this place is that guy, of course. This is trespassing, you know.\"\n\"So this isn't a dream, but a separate space?\"\n\"Exactly. A place like that Memorial Dungeon you visited before... Ah! Okay, I get it. I get it already.\"\nCrackle! Sparks flew from Kkokko's round, smooth body. It jumped up in place, its beak moving faster.\n\"This is bad. I need to go. Anyway, such a temper!\"\n\"Hey, at least give us a hint before you go!\"\nKkokko, no, Hong Ye-seong, swung its smooth head as if in disbelief.\n\"What are you talking about, friend? You have to find the weak spot yourself!\"\n\"Me?\"\n\"Of course! You're the most important player here. Me? I'm just a... well, a chicken about to get kicked out. Ah, sorry, I'm going, I'm going! Geez, I'm leaving!\"\nSQUAWK!— With a long squawk, another flash of light and gust of wind burst forth. This time, the light disappeared even faster than before. Cha Eui-jae frowned as he fixed his disheveled hair. Lee Sa-young gently placed the now curled-up Kkokko onto the soft bed and closed his eyes.\n\"So...\"\n\"...\"\n\"It was completely useless, wasn't it?\"\n\"...Not completely. I am the most important player, after all.\"\n\"Ugh... isn't that something anyone could figure out without being told?\"\nLee Sa-young irritably ran a hand through his hair, his black strands tangling between his fingers.\n\"This is a space created by Lee Sa-young. Of course, you're important.\"\n\"But I don't have a role—\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Sa-young cut him off firmly. Just then, a soft snore came from the sprawled-out Hong Ye-seong. Lee Sa-young, who was about to continue speaking, let out a short sigh. For some reason, he suddenly seemed unusually sensitive. What was making him so tense?\nLee Sa-young pointed to the door.\n\"Let's go. Just leave this as is.\"\n***\nLee Sa-young stepped out of the suite and began walking ahead in silence. Cha Eui-jae followed behind him with his hands in his pockets. The people on the street instinctively avoided Lee Sa-young, allowing Cha Eui-jae to walk without bumping into anyone.\nSilence stretched between them. Cha Eui-jae didn't try to initiate conversation. It didn't seem like Lee Sa-young was in the mood.\n'What's bothering him?'\nHe reflected on everything that had happened since they arrived, but nothing really stood out as a problem. Sure, Lee Sa-young's mood was as easily tangled and knotted as a thin necklace chain, but...\n\"...\"\nThis time, it was impossible to tell what was going on. Why was he suddenly being so silent? Cha Eui-jae stared at the fluttering black coat in front of him. Then, the footsteps ahead stopped. An all-too-familiar presence appeared before them.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi? What brings you here?\"\nJung Bin approached, brushing his hands off. But something about him looked different. His clean-cut hairstyle with a 2:8 part was slick, and his face was unnervingly smooth. The Jung Bin Cha Eui-jae knew was always a kind man with a gentle but firm demeanor, constantly wearing a warm smile. Cha Eui-jae muttered without realizing it.\n\"...Doesn't look like him.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why does this version of Jung Bin look so... slimy?\"\n\"Who knows...\"\nLee Sa-young muttered in disbelief. The slick-looking Jung Bin chattered on.\n\"It's convenient that you're here. I had something to contact you about...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nThe two exchanged glances. From what they could deduce, this was 'Lee Sa-young's' space, likely reconstructed from his memories and senses. Even the flavorless food had been a clue to that. But human memory isn't perfect.\nEspecially when it comes to recreating people, personal feelings and biases inevitably slip in. That's how Jung Bin ended up being reconstructed in this slimy form.\nCha Eui-jae muttered again.\n\"...Did you two not get along? Seems like there was a lot of bad blood.\"\n\"...\"\n\"His appearance is... pretty distorted.\"\n\"I didn't think of him that way.\"\n\"Of course you didn't...\"\nResponding mechanically, Lee Sa-young muttered while half-listening to Jung Bin's words.\n\"In this world, I must not have been kidnapped and experimented on.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So naturally, I wouldn't have spent time with Jung Bin or Bae Won-woo. If I had to guess, he must have annoyed me by interfering in everything. He'd probably be busy here with his government work, too.\"\n\"That sounds like...\"\n\"Let's go. If we stay and listen any longer, it'll just get more annoying.\"\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi?\"\nIgnoring the slimy Jung Bin's words, Lee Sa-young started walking again. Flustered, Jung Bin was left behind. As they walked, an empty clearing appeared. The desolate open space was completely devoid of people. Lee Sa-young stopped in the middle of it.\nSuddenly, Cha Eui-jae had a question. After seeing these distorted versions of people through Lee Sa-young's perspective, he couldn't help but wonder: what did he look like through Lee Sa-young's eyes?\nThis was a space created from Lee Sa-young's thoughts. In this world, the people didn't know about the apocalypse, and they didn't know about J. No one knew about J. Cha Eui-jae lived in the same house as Lee Sa-young. It was a home just for the two of them.\nA utopia that existed only because Cha Eui-jae was there— a perfect world 'Lee Sa-young' longed for.\n\"...\"\nSuddenly, a bright realization struck. This place was a utopia. It wasn't reality. 'Lee Sa-young' had lost Cha Eui-jae and had wandered alone for a long, long time. Perhaps by now, he was more accustomed to a world without Cha Eui-jae. After all, utopia and reality are different things.\nWhat's the purpose of someone without a role?\n\"...\"\nMaybe...\nCould it be that the real 'Lee Sa-young's' world could only appear if Cha Eui-jae wasn't here?\n'...That seems likely.'\nCha Eui-jae reached into his inventory. The spear and Basilisk's Fang each occupied a slot. The spear would be inconvenient to use. And wasn't this a space created by the original owner of the Basilisk's Fang?\nGrabbing the handle of the Basilisk's Fang and pulling it out, it began to wriggle like a fish in water.\nIt was time for something cruel.\nWhen he turned his head, Lee Sa-young was watching him with an unreadable expression. And in that brief moment their eyes met, Cha Eui-jae instinctively understood.\nLee Sa-young had known all along. He knew the weak point of 'Lee Sa-young.'\nHe also knew what needed to be sacrificed to uncover that hidden weakness, and how it had to be done. He must have realized that Cha Eui-jae would eventually figure it out. Cha Eui-jae rested the Basilisk's Fang on his shoulder and looked at Lee Sa-young.\n\"You knew, didn't you?\"\n\"Ah...\"\nA cold smile appeared on Lee Sa-young's pale face.\n\"How could I not?\"\n\"...\"\n\"After all, he's still me.\"\nLee Sa-young closed his mouth tightly. In truth, Cha Eui-jae didn't want to do this either. But sometimes, there are things in life you have to do, even if you don't want to. Especially when you're the only one who can do them.\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Do you trust me?\"\nA long silence followed. Lee Sa-young opened and closed his lips several times, hesitating.\nHow much time passed? After what felt like an eternity, his pale face slowly, very slowly, nodded up and down. Cha Eui-jae grinned.\n\"Thank you.\"\nWithout hesitation, he raised the Basilisk's Fang high. And then—\nSquelch—\nHe drove it into his own chest.\nBright red blood dripped down. The hand gripping the handle became soaked with it.\nIt didn't hurt. As his body lost strength and began to collapse forward, a strong hand caught him. Cha Eui-jae rested his forehead against a broad shoulder and caught his breath. A large hand gently patted his back in a soothing gesture. A faint voice murmured.\n\"See...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I told you this place feels... off, didn't I?\"\nRight, that's what you said.\nThat guy's a real freak...\nSuddenly, Cha Eui-jae became curious. What kind of expression was Lee Sa-young making right now? It was a pure, but therefore more cruel, curiosity. With great effort, he raised his gaze and saw a sharp jawline. Lifting his head a little more, Lee Sa-young lowered his face to meet his eyes.\nAnd—\n\"...\"\nAh.\nCha Eui-jae slightly opened his mouth. But no sound came out. The face he had seen slowly faded into darkness. Yet even as his vision blurred, his thoughts remained clear.\nHe could vaguely feel a hand stroking the back of his head. It was gentle. Which made it all the more terrifying. Cha Eui-jae struggled to swallow the blood rising in his throat. His mouth filled with blood, but fortunately or unfortunately, he couldn't taste it.\nStill, Cha Eui-jae thought.\n'Wow, this is really...'\nHe thought again.\n'I'm really fucked...'\nYeah, this is really bad.\nNo, you said it was okay. You nodded, saying it was fine...\nAnd then his breath stopped. White wind began to howl.",

      "content": "Chapter 194 - Multiple Thoughts\nA white wind blew through.\nThe peaceful city began to crumble from the edges. The once colorful world gradually lost its hue. Buildings collapsed. The asphalt cracked and split apart. The atmosphere shook with ominous vibrations. The world was falling apart— all because of one person's death.\nIn the midst of this collapsing world, Lee Sa-young carefully held the limp body in his arms. The lifeless form swayed helplessly with his movements. He wanted to pull out the sword that had pierced the body, but he didn't want to cause any unnecessary pain. Even though he knew this wasn't reality.\nLee Sa-young sat Cha Eui-jae on his lap, supporting the body. Cha Eui-jae's head, now devoid of strength, slumped down onto his shoulder. His hands were soaked with bright red blood. The wet sensation was unsettling.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young rested his cheek against Cha Eui-jae's gray hair. White ash rained down. He muttered to the person who could no longer hear him.\n\"Do you know what's really annoying?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why did you do this? What were you thinking when you did it...\"\nThe ideal world that another version of himself had carefully crafted was collapsing, revealing the real one. The towering skyscrapers had turned into ruins, and the neat streets paved with asphalt and tiles were now covered in dirt, dust, and white ash. There was no trace of intact buildings— only ruins remained. A desolate wind blew but soon stopped. A perfect silence settled.\nHow had Lee Sa-young endured in this ruined world, left all alone without Cha Eui-jae? He had probably thought it over and over again. Dreaming endlessly of a happy world where the apocalypse never came, a world where Cha Eui-jae didn't have to die, a world where he didn't have to save the world. A peaceful world where no one knew Cha Eui-jae. He must have thought about it for so long that the imagined world became more vivid than reality.\nHe must have dreamt of the possibility.\n\"Being able to understand everything...\"\nBut Lee Sa-young knew that was arrogance. He knew well that Cha Eui-jae was the kind of person who would break free of any chains placed on him. That no matter how much you tried to hide him, he was someone who shined on his own. Lee Sa-young closed his eyes and muttered quietly.\n\"It's unpleasant.\"\nBut still... I wish you would have stayed by my side.\nLee Sa-young whispered into the empty air.\n\"Hurry back, Hyung.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's a little...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Lonely here.\"\nThe white wind blew again. The air trembled. Hidden beneath the white ash, things slowly began to reveal themselves.\n***\nFlap...\nA low voice resonated in the emptiness.\nJ.\nThe unshaken number one, the hero who saved the country, the great figure who saved countless people... Although all sorts of glamorous titles followed behind his black mask, he always recoiled whenever he heard them. He'd grumble about how people were so obsessed with impressive titles and tell them to stop calling him that.\n...\nA person who did good deeds without expecting anything in return. Someone who said he liked saving people. After every major battle, he would collapse for a while, but if he was needed, he would still rush out without hesitation. As long as he was there, it felt like everything would be okay.\nCha Eui-jae was someone who gave that kind of hope.\n...\nFlap... the sound of a page turning could be heard.\n...\nHe had carefully gathered poison to save the life of a young boy who was a complete stranger to him, administered the antidote, and stayed by his side. One day, 'I' awakened— while Cha Eui-jae was away.\nUnable to control my powers, I melted my beloved cup, various objects, and even the machines connected to my body. Black poison filled the hospital room. In the end, I locked myself in the bathroom.\nCha Eui-jae rushed over as soon as he heard the news. He said he came right after dealing with a dungeon. I didn't open the door. I didn't want him to see me in such a miserable state. But Cha Eui-jae kicked down the door without hesitation. He grabbed my hand without a second thought. Even though his skin melted where we touched, he didn't even grimace. His melting skin felt hot.\n...\nEver since Cha Eui-jae saved me once more, 'I' lived with him.\nWe were always together.\nUntil the day he died.\n...\nIt took a long time, but finally, the page turned again.\n...\nCha Eui-jae wasn't in good health.\nHe said he had been like that ever since his awakening. Even when he was filmed slaying a massive monster shortly after his awakening, he collapsed soon after. His aunt had to come and take care of him. Cha Eui-jae was sheepish about it. He said he had been quite healthy before his awakening.\nSometimes he would tell stories about how he used to play soccer every lunch break at his middle school, which no longer exists. He claimed he was quite a good striker and that everyone wanted to be on his team because he always won bets. He said eating ice cream after the games was the best part. Whenever I listened, I tried to picture a younger Cha Eui-jae, healthy and running around on the field.\n...But I couldn't really imagine it.\nThe Cha Eui-jae I knew was brave but also someone with a frail body.\nAfter using his powers, he always fell ill. But very few people knew that. He said if people found out he was sick, it would cause more anxiety, so he locked himself away in a dark room. Since he was always a bit of a mysterious figure, no one thought much of it if he disappeared for a few days. They just assumed it was part of the hero's eccentricity. No one knew he was dying.\n...Was it the backlash from his powers? I didn't know. Speculation, guesses, endless days of uncertainty. Nam Woo-jin and even healers from overseas were consulted, but no one knew.\nNam Woo-jin worked tirelessly to research the issue, but in the end, even he gave up. He said there seemed to be some unknown force at play behind Cha Eui-jae's pain. That was all.\nWe didn't know the cause, and he was slowly dying. The intervals between his pain grew shorter. He used to only fall ill after major battles, but now he grew weaker even after using half his strength. Sometimes he would bleed. I would feel the empty space beside me in the middle of the night, and when I went to check, I'd find him clutching the sink, coughing up blood. It was dark red. Even after washing it away, the red stain in my mind wouldn't fade.\nThe most frustrating thing was that he had come to terms with his own death. At some point, he started saying things like, \"This is inevitable, so don't worry too much... Don't get hurt over it.\"\nWho gave him the right?\nI scraped together every bit of information I could. I worked with Nam Woo-jin and gathered people. Before the apocalypse and even after it arrived.\nHe always shone brilliantly, but his light felt precarious. Like a candle burning its life away. Just before the flame goes out, it shines its brightest. He glowed like that.\nI didn't want him to shine. I just wanted him to live a long, quiet life with a gentle glow.\n...\nThe apocalypse came.\nThe battles increased. The endless stream of monsters drained his life. His condition worsened. Though I ran around just as much to keep him off the battlefield, I couldn't fill his absence. And people were already conditioned to expect it.\nJ will save us again.\nIf it's J, he can do it.\nJ will solve everything.\nThe world flashed red.\nNonsense.\nNonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.\n...\nSilence. The sound of a page turning.\nCha Eui-jae lived up to their expectations.\nHe died.\nAnd left me behind.\n...\nAre you satisfied?\nThe sound of pages turning stopped. The world stopped. A white wind began to blow. Slowly, the darkness cleared, revealing a world of pure white ruins. Cha Eui-jae began to walk. Crunch, crunch... The ash piled like snow crunched underfoot.\nDust rose from the collapsed buildings. Something seemed to push him forward, as if guiding him somewhere. He walked aimlessly along the path.\nHow long had he walked?\n\"...\"\nThe sound of someone breathing could be heard. It was rough, like that of a beast. Cha Eui-jae held his breath and approached quietly. Amid the white world, there was something black. A worn-out leather coat that had lost its sheen, black boots dirtied with dust and ash. Messy black hair. A familiar figure.\nHe was holding someone in his arms. Through the coat, a limp leg could be seen. Without realizing it, Cha Eui-jae lowered his gaze. The boots were the same as his.\n\"...\"\nAfter taking a deep breath, he took in the scene.\nAnd then...\nHe saw Lee Sa-young's face.\n'It's the same.'\nIt was exactly the same.\nThe face he had faintly seen before closing his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 195 - Multiple Thoughts\nCha Eui-jae stared at Lee Sa-young, as if in a trance, and then looked at 'Cha Eui-jae', who was held in his arms. It was a familiar face, a reflection of himself, but it didn't feel real. It was as if he were watching a scene from a movie.\nHis gaze soon shifted to Lee Sa-young. A vacant, unfocused stare, groping at empty air. The face in front of him was strangely familiar, but it wasn't just because he had just seen it. It was from further back, from before... and then Cha Eui-jae let out a small exclamation.\n\"Ah.\"\n\"I can finally let go.\"\nYes. That expression was the same as the one Ham Seok-jeong had worn when he heard about his aunt's death. Cha Eui-jae absentmindedly rubbed his lips. For some reason, his mouth tasted bitter.\n\"...\"\nThe world hidden beneath the utopia. Lee Sa-young's true world. Unlike the flawless, impeccable utopia, this place was barren, quiet, and unchanging. A vague sense of foreboding crept over him.\nPerhaps this version of Lee Sa-young would forever hold Cha Eui-jae. His world had stopped the moment Cha Eui-jae died.\nIt was then that he heard a low whisper.\n\"Still as cruel as ever...\"\nStep, step... Footsteps approached from somewhere. Cha Eui-jae didn't turn around. The footsteps stopped three steps behind him. A voice, devoid of emotion, muttered.\n\"Tearing everything apart like a mole.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, are you satisfied?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You destroyed an entire world by sacrificing yourself.\"\nCha Eui-jae turned his body. Lee Sa-young stood there, expressionless, looking at him. His lavender eyes swirled with endless emptiness. His dry lips parted.\n\"You should've been satisfied by now...\"\nA faint gloom flickered across his delicate face.\n\"I told you... you wouldn't find what you were looking for.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I have nothing left to show you. This is all that remains.\"\nLee Sa-young walked slowly past Cha Eui-jae and stood in front of the two preserved figures. His face, as he gazed at his past self, showed no emotion. Everything had burned away, leaving only ashes. His demeanor was as dry as a desert wind. Cha Eui-jae abruptly asked,\n\"You seem... different?\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"You know, when I tried to—\"\nCha Eui-jae made a circle with his hand. Lee Sa-young glanced back and replied with a casual \"Ah.\"\n\"I couldn't help it. After spending so much time alone in a ruined world.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Even self-harm gets boring after a while. There's no excitement anymore, and the world won't change. It's quicker than you'd think, becoming like a walking stone.\"\n\"...\"\n\"When I came into contact with you in that state... well, it was overwhelming. I couldn't control myself. Were you surprised?\"\nThis guy isn't in his right mind.\nCha Eui-jae discreetly took a step back, but Lee Sa-young continued to stare at his past self. Cha Eui-jae knew he couldn't let himself get lost here. He forced himself to engage in conversation.\n\"You said you wanted us to sleep together. What were you planning to show me then? Something about memories?\"\n\"Hm? Where else would it be...\"\nLee Sa-young's pale lips curled slightly, but there was no smile in his eyes. The same emptiness swirled within.\n\"The place you destroyed yourself.\"\nA bit of Hong Ye-seong and the slimy Jung Bin floated to the surface of Cha Eui-jae's mind. Without realizing it, Cha Eui-jae muttered,\n\"...No, that place was completely distorted to your own liking, wasn't it?\"\n\"Ah, it must've looked that way to you. I tried hard to piece it together though...\"\nLee Sa-young lightly tapped his lips with his fingers. His eyelashes cast shadows over his eyes as if lost in thought.\n\"It couldn't be helped. Everyone I knew was dead...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I pieced it together from vague memories, but it seems I failed... Sorry?\"\nDamn it!\nCha Eui-jae gritted his teeth. For some reason, this version of Lee Sa-young was hard to deal with. His aura, which felt more like a system than a human, the emotionless face and voice— yet, there was still something human left about him. It was right here.\nA person who had discarded all emotions to wander for an eternity, alone. Joy, anger, sorrow, and fury— all thrown away. But there was one thing he couldn't let go of.\nCha Eui-jae was staring into the core of a human being.\nIt was heavy. Everything was.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae clenched and unclenched his fists, his tense muscles moving stiffly. Lee Sa-young murmured.\n\"Don't be so tense.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Do you really think I'd kill you...\"\nCha Eui-jae forced a lighthearted joke.\n\"You could probably lock me up, though.\"\n\"...\"\nOddly, no denial came. Even though he waited for a long time. Was he really planning to lock him up? Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened.\n\"Did you really plan to do that?\"\nLavender eyes averted slightly.\n\"Not confinement... I was planning to shelter you.\"\n\"Shelter?\"\n\"The end is coming soon, even to that world.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I could've taken you in. Into the world I made.\"\nCha Eui-jae thought of that eerily perfect world. A world obsessively committed to replicating reality, down to an almost compulsive level. A world with just one empty place, waiting for Cha Eui-jae. His utopia would have been completed the moment Cha Eui-jae arrived.\nLee Sa-young spoke gloomily.\n\"Even though you destroyed it yourself.\"\nCha Eui-jae bit his lip hard. There was so much he wanted to say, but the words wouldn't come easily. He hesitated for a long time before finally managing to ask one thing.\n\"Did you really think I'd go there?\"\n\"You wouldn't have.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Of course you wouldn't.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Even I know that. But still...\"\nHis gaze, which had been lingering on the ground, suddenly locked onto Cha Eui-jae. In the emptiness of his eyes, Cha Eui-jae's reflection stood out clearly. Only Cha Eui-jae.\n\"It was a great comfort, thinking that you might come. It helped me endure.\"\n\"...\"\nOddly enough, Cha Eui-jae understood what he meant. There were days when just thinking about what he would do if he went back was enough to keep him going.\nAt first, he thought about returning safely with his aunt and fellow hunters. After losing his aunt, he thought about returning with his comrades. And after losing them too...\nHe thought about living with the boy. That was all he had left.\nThinking about what kind of house to buy, how to decorate the rooms, and how the boy would react made the loneliness a little more bearable. Just a little.\nThat's why Cha Eui-jae understood 'Lee Sa-young.'\nAnd 'Lee Sa-young' didn't miss that moment of understanding.\nA black hand cautiously gripped Cha Eui-jae's sleeve. An empty voice spoke.\n\"Don't go. Stay here. We can rebuild the world again.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't throw your life away meaninglessly.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You've sacrificed enough...\"\nHis voice grew smaller and smaller, his head lowering as he spoke. It was the smallest and most pitiful sight Cha Eui-jae had ever seen of him.\nHad 'Lee Sa-young' ever said such things to Cha Eui-jae? No. He wouldn't have. These were probably the words he regretted never saying, finally spilling out now. The weight behind them spoke to that, words chewed over and over.\nHowever,\nCha Eui-jae took a deep breath. Then, he gently grabbed 'Lee Sa-young's' arm.\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\nEmpty eyes blankly stared at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"I may not be exactly the same as the Cha Eui-jae you knew, but I'll tell you this.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I know what you're saying. I know what you're worried about. I'm really grateful for that. But I'm going to make it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I don't have any confidence, really. I've failed twice already.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But I'm certain. Thanks to you, I'm sure.\"\nCha Eui-jae tightened his grip on Lee Sa-young's arm. His eyes gleamed blue.\n\"Hong Ye-seong said this is the last chance. That it was supposed to end in the last world. But you held onto the world and created this chance.\"\nCha Eui-jae spoke each word carefully, as if chewing on them.\n\"This is the last chance you gave me. I'm not going to let it slip by. I'm going to stop the end.\"\n\"...\"\nThe empty lavender eyes flickered with a faint light. His pale lips moved soundlessly. Cha Eui-jae released his grip. He hadn't realized how tense he was until now, breathing heavily. He sighed quietly, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.\nBefore, he wouldn't have tried having such a conversation with this guy. He would've thought it was pointless to even try.\nBut...\n\"I like us... because we're special.\"\n\"More than any other Lee Sa-young and Cha Eui-jae.\"\n\"You promised me you'd come back.\"\n\"I just kept my promise.\"\n\"Do whatever you want. Because now, hesitation has taken root in you.\"\nThanks to those words that had kept him anchored, Cha Eui-jae found the courage to face this. Because someone had held him steady on his shaky ground. Because someone had endured endless waiting.\nThere was only one way to repay that person.\nCha Eui-jae reached out his hand.\n\"Help me.\"\nHe had to stop the apocalypse. For the days they will spend together.",

      "content": "Chapter 196 - Multiple Thoughts\nA long silence passed.\nLee Sa-young stared blankly at the hand extended toward him. A hand hardened with calluses. A hand that had once melted from poison but had no signs of recovery. The dry lips asked,\n\"Can you do it?\"\nThe answer came immediately.\n\"I will.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I've already failed twice. But I... I believe there's something to learn from failure.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm sure you don't want your efforts to be in vain either, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"So help me.\"\nLee Sa-young didn't answer. But I could guess what he was thinking.\nThis is a person who clung to the world for a third chance. He wouldn't want to waste this opportunity he barely got. Silent, Lee Sa-young tilted his head. He didn't seem to intend to grab the hand, so Cha Eui-jae awkwardly withdrew it.\n\"Answer just one thing for me.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"In that world, why do you think he was in pain?\"\n\"...\"\n\"He never gave me an answer. Not even at the moment of death...\"\nThe reason he was so sick in the second world. Cha Eui-jae's mind turned. Hong Ye-seong had said it before. That in the first world, Cha Eui-jae was so powerful that even after using the clock, it didn't break.\nStrangely, Cha Eui-jae felt like he knew the answer. No, he knew it. As if someone had imprinted the knowledge into his mind, a fact he didn't know surfaced. He opened his mouth without realizing it.\n\"When I rewound time in the first world, I became the axis.\"\n\"...\"\n\"A person who becomes the axis is bound by limitations until the previous world is completely annihilated. Their lifespan keeps getting eaten away until the world is destroyed. That was the clock's penalty.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Still, because of my power, I held on longer... but I would die as soon as we returned. From the rebound.\"\n...Was that it?\n\"Aha...\"\nLee Sa-young let out a low hum and lowered his head. He folded his arms and murmured.\n\"So that's what Hong Ye-seong meant when he said he fixed it...\"\nHmm, I guess so?\nCha Eui-jae recalled the scattered fragments that suddenly surfaced. Memories— some his own and some not— were mixed up and jumbled. Lee Sa-young looked like he was about to say something, so Cha Eui-jae hurriedly raised a hand to stop him.\n\"Hey, hey! Hold on, be quiet for a second.\"\nNormally, if someone became the axis of the world—\n\"...\"\nThere should be some sort of clue, right? Cha Eui-jae quickly began sorting through his memories. Unfortunately, most of them seemed trivial, cluttered memories that could be discarded.\nThoughts about dinner menus, how cute the street cats were, the memory of enjoying the music playing in the convenience store, the nagging from Jung Bin, and the scolding from Honeybee...\n'Damn it. My memory's only good for useless things. The important stuff won't come to mind.'\nFrustrated, Cha Eui-jae ruffled his hair. Whose memories were these, anyway? But he soon adjusted his mindset. Maybe there was no point in distinguishing whose memories they were.\n'They're all...'\nThey're all Cha Eui-jae's memories.\nOddly enough, the song he'd never heard before matched his taste, and so did the yawning cat crouched on the roadside railing. Why were these memories only surfacing now?\nThe fragments floating on the surface blurred like breaking waves. And before long, they disappeared, as if they had never surfaced at all.\nDuring this, Lee Sa-young, who had been silent, suddenly lifted his head and looked into the empty air. Cha Eui-jae, still messing with his hair, followed suit. A thin, black crack had appeared in the air. Lee Sa-young, expressionless, lightly tapped his cheek with his fingers.\n\"I was wondering when you'd show up.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nAt that moment, the small crack tore open like the jaws of a snake. Cha Eui-jae instinctively took a step back and assumed a fighting stance. Soon, a black blade thrust out from the tear. The edge gleamed strangely. He recognized it instantly. Cha Eui-jae straightened his posture and scowled.\n\"...A fang?\"\nIt was the Basilisk's Fang. The one he had stabbed into his own chest.\nIn the next moment, a hand gripping the hilt of the sword shot out. A red hand, veins bulging. Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened.\n'Isn't that Sa-young?'\nAs if to confirm his thoughts, a cold voice echoed through the air.\n\"I never said I'd wait for you.\"\nA pair of black combat boots and long legs ripped through the crack, and a coat fluttered. Soon, a pale face appeared above the tear.\nSa-young, who had torn through the crack and stood in the air, lightly landed on the ground. White dust rose. He skillfully swung the sword, shaking off the blood and black goo stuck to it. The tip of the straight blade pointed directly at Lee Sa-young's throat from a distance.\n\"Time's up.\"\nWhat is this?\n\"What's going on?\"\nCha Eui-jae looked back and forth between the two Lee Sa-youngs in disbelief. From the sound of it, the two had some sort of contract or agreement. Cha Eui-jae, however, knew nothing about it.\nLee Sa-young raised both hands and shrugged as he stared at Sa-young.\n\"You're impatient.\"\n\"You're the one who broke the agreement first...\"\nA murderous aura surged from Sa-young. Lee Sa-young cracked his knuckles. At this rate, the two would probably end up in a serious fight. Damn it, and there's no time to waste. Cha Eui-jae hurriedly intervened between the two.\n\"Would you explain it in a way I can understand? What's going on?\"\nHe looked at Lee Sa-young, then turned to Sa-young and flinched.\nSa-young's expression was no different from the last time Cha Eui-jae saw him. Gloomy, and the face of someone familiar with loss. His eyes were cast in a dark shadow. His gaze was fixed behind Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae followed that gaze and turned around. Where Sa-young's eyes were directed was...\n\"...\"\nThe figure of Lee Sa-young holding Cha Eui-jae.\nAh, damn it. Cha Eui-jae bit his tongue. Come to think of it, Sa-young's hands were soaked in blood. There were a few drops of blood splattered on his face too.\nCha Eui-jae had stabbed himself in the chest with the Basilisk's fang.\nAnd now, Sa-young was holding the Basilisk's Fang, with blood-soaked hands.\n\"...\"\n\"Ah.\"\nSa-young, following Cha Eui-jae's gaze, let out a short sigh. He waved his red-stained hand slightly and curled his lips into a smile.\n\"Someone kindly informed me... that to cross over here, I just needed to use this sword.\"\n\"...\"\nA grinding noise came from someone's teeth.\n\"Thanks to that, I had a rather unpleasant experience... so, thanks for that.\"\n\"Don't mention it.\"\nLee Sa-young replied indifferently. Cha Eui-jae glanced at Sa-young's face. His pitch-black, lifeless eyes were fixated on the dead Cha Eui-jae. Damn it. Cha Eui-jae stepped to the side to block his view and asked,\n\"Are you... okay?\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\nThe tone was oddly short, but a guilty man couldn't nitpick. Cha Eui-jae cautiously glanced at Sa-young.\n\"Well, you know... that.\"\n\"Hmm... I don't understand what you're talking about...\"\nA bright smile appeared on his face. At the same time, alarms blared in Cha Eui-jae's head.\n\"I'm certainly doing better than the person who stabbed himself. I just pulled out the sword. Isn't that right?\"\n\"No, I'm really fine. Look at this. Want to check?\"\n\"No need.\"\nA curt reply!\nCha Eui-jae gaped in disbelief. Sa-young tugged Cha Eui-jae to stand behind him protectively. Lee Sa-young watched them with an indifferent gaze. Sa-young chuckled mockingly.\n\"By the way... you held out for so long. But you failed in the end, huh?\"\nLee Sa-young replied coldly.\n\"You knew I'd fail. So did I.\"\n\"Haha... That's why I told you. Don't even try. You'll fail anyway.\"\n\"Well... Cha Eui-jae had a different opinion. He said it was worth trying, even if we failed.\"\nSparks flew. The two Lee Sa-youngs were back to arguing.\nAh, seriously. Cha Eui-jae sighed briefly, then took a deep breath. And...\n\"HEY! You idiots, would you explain properly?!\"\nHe yelled at them with all the force he could muster from his gut.\n***\nAfter a moment, the two Lee Sa-youngs sat a short distance apart, each taking a seat on a piece of the crumbled ruins.\nLee Sa-young sat with his arms crossed and an expressionless face, while Sa-young rested his chin on his hand, looking sulky. Between them, Cha Eui-jae busily paced back and forth. He kept muttering under his breath, moving here and there, before suddenly blurting out in frustration;\n\"Hey... what's your problem, you two?\"\nAfter getting the explanation, Cha Eui-jae pieced together the context of how Sa-young had pulled out the Basilisk's Fang lodged in his body and torn through space to make his intrusion.\nApparently, Sa-young had been dealing with Lee Sa-young messing with his body ever since he woke up three months ago. A sense that his body wasn't entirely his own. A feeling like part of him had been stolen. Cha Eui-jae felt a surge of irritation again.\n'If that was the case, you should've told me!'\nIn any case, Sa-young, who hated losing control more than anything, had obsessively stayed near Cha Eui-jae. For some reason, whenever he was close to Cha Eui-jae, the unwanted guest— Lee Sa-young— lost his power. Cha Eui-jae suddenly recalled how strangely touchy Sa-young had been ever since Lee Sa-young woke up.\n'...'\nCha Eui-jae cleared his throat. Ahem, best not to dwell on it.\nWhile barely maintaining that precarious balance, Cha Eui-jae bolted.\nFor a whole week!\nDuring that week without Cha Eui-jae, Sa-young had no choice but to engage in multiple conversations with the uninvited Lee Sa-young. And Lee Sa-young had persistently whispered: The end cannot be stopped. It is a formless disaster that will come. We have already failed twice. But there is a way to save Cha Eui-jae. You, too, want to save him, don't you? Give me a chance to persuade him.\nAt this point, Cha Eui-jae flared up again.\n\"You believed that?\"\nSa-young, who had been resting his chin in his hand sulkily, twisted his lips.\n\"Do you think I did? Nonsense.\"",

You're the one who dismissed it.\"\n\"Reasonable? More like the rubbish of a loser.\"\n\"Aha, but if you stumble once, you'll be a loser just the same... you sure are confident.\"\n\"Hmm... already thinking about running away before even trying...?\"\nSa-young covered his mouth with his hand, a slight smirk barely visible beyond it.\n\"Oh, how strong must that inferiority complex be.\"\nFor a moment, the expressionless face cracked just a little. Sharp words like daggers flew back and forth relentlessly. The voices were so similar, it almost felt like one person was continuing the conversation. Why did I feel like my mental energy was draining? Cha Eui-jae massaged his forehead, trying to trace where things had gone wrong.\n\"Flapping your tongue like that...\"\n\"Who are you to talk about flapping tongues?\"\nIn that instant, the two Lee Sa-youngs scoffed simultaneously, staring each other down. It felt as if sparks flew between their clashing gazes. The veins bulged on their blackened hands, muscles tensed, and it was clear that they were gripping the handle of their daggers tightly.\nDamn it. Cha Eui-jae quickly waved his hands to grab their attention.\n\"Hey, hey! Didn't I tell you two not to fight?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't look at each other. Don't talk to each other. Just look at me, got it? Pretend there's no one else around.\"\nThe moment Cha Eui-jae finished speaking, he regretted it. Those violet eyes followed his every move as if they would devour him whole. Was it just his imagination, or did their gaze carry a heavy obsession?\n'It's like trying to tame wild beasts.'\nThis is insane! Cha Eui-jae sighed deeply and continued.\n\"So... you rejected it?\"\nSa-young gave a brief reply.\n\"It wasn't worth listening to.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There's no need to listen to a loser. It's not like the world's ended yet; we still have a chance.\"\nIt was a reasonable statement. After all, there was still a possibility of preventing the end. Just as Cha Eui-jae was about to nod slightly, Lee Sa-young cut in.\n\"It's just the arrogance of someone who doesn't know the end.\"\nCrash! Something shattered. The corner of the debris Sa-young had been sitting on was charred black. Smiling angelically, Sa-young dusted the white remnants from his hands.\n\"Sorry? I keep hearing nonsense.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Something about the end of the world, like a scared dog barking...\"\n\"Enough!\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly made up his mind. The tension and discomfort wouldn't go away until this three-way confrontation was over. He raised his voice slightly.\n\"Alright, let's say the first one ended in failure. What about when you came to the Awakened Management Bureau?\"\n\"Ah, back then...\"\nSa-young's violet eyes narrowed as he smiled.\n\"My patience had worn thin, after a week of listening to nonsense.\"\nHis blackened fingers tapped his temple.\n\"I felt like I was losing my mind...\"\nThe cause of the problem, Cha Eui-jae, averted his gaze. Sa-young cupped his cheek with one hand and sighed deeply.\n\"But then, you told me to sleep. To someone who wasn't in their right mind. So...\"\n\"Hey!\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly covered Sa-young's mouth. Then, sensing something, he just as swiftly removed his hand. A black tongue peeked through the lips, licking them as if disappointed.\n\"What? I was just stating the facts.\"\nThe other 'Lee Sa-young,' who had been silently watching, tilted his head. His lifeless pale purple eyes blinked with emphasis.\n\"Now that you mention it, I'm starting to hear nonsense too. Could you tell that dog to bark quickly if it's going to?\"\nSa-young sighed deeply and twisted his lips before opening his mouth—\n\"Woof.\"\nHe barked. Sa-young grinned at Cha Eui-jae's shocked expression.\n\"Satisfied? Now, I'll continue.\"\nCha Eui-jae screamed internally. What exactly was that supposed to resolve? Handling one Lee Sa-young was overwhelming, but now with two, it was like dealing with five. Their constant mental battles were fraying Cha Eui-jae's nerves. Regardless, Sa-young slowly continued.\n\"Anyway, I wasn't in the right state of mind... So, I came in here unprepared. Originally, I had the upper hand, but in here...\"\nSa-young gestured with his chin to the side.\n\"The neighbor's dog took control. There wasn't even time to reject; the contract was sealed.\"\nLee Sa-young's stoic face barely managed a smile.\n\"Seizing the opportunity... that's the more accurate description.\"\nAs Sa-young began to get irritated again, Cha Eui-jae quickly interrupted.\n\"What was the contract?\"\n\"That guy meets you and persuades you... Though I didn't expect it to turn out like this.\"\n\"Like this?\"\n\"You choose to...\"\nAh.\nSa-young trailed off. Eventually, he turned his head as if he no longer wanted to speak. Through his tousled hair, his violet eyes appear sunken in darkness.\nCha Eui-jae barely managed to calm his churning emotions. Just because he understood someone's choice didn't mean the scars disappeared. Sometimes, even if the mind understood, the heart couldn't follow. Regret lingered like a shadow.\n'I should've done it where no one could see.'\nIt was a regret Sa-young would have been angry about had he known.\nThe silent 'Lee Sa-young' spoke up in place of Sa-young, who had closed his mouth.\n\"Honestly, I didn't expect you to choose that method either. Really.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I didn't think you'd come here either.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You could say you knew my weakness well. Or maybe it was J...\"\nHis blackened hand gripped the edge of the shattered debris he was perched on. In that moment, the overwhelming pressure he exuded became apparent. It was a force that could rival any monster Cha Eui-jae had faced. Instinctively, he knew.\n'He's not human...'\nBut that didn't mean he had turned into a monster either. The figure in front of him was more like a wraith— an entity tangled in delusions and resentment, wrapped in a human shell. Yet, he was still someone you could communicate with. Cha Eui-jae had seen it clearly. In the moment they made the pact, a flicker of humanity returned to those pale purple eyes.\n\"...\"\nHe turned his head. Sa-young was still looking elsewhere. The crimson bloodstain on his pallid cheek remained vivid. In the haze of blood and his dimming vision, he recalled the last face he saw. A hollow face, like someone who had lost everything.\nNo, perhaps in that moment, he really had lost it all. Cha Eui-jae had—\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young was his first success. Even after crossing three worlds and witnessing two apocalypses, that much hadn't changed. His success was sitting right next to him. And Cha Eui-jae had the responsibility of seeing it through.\nHe chose his words carefully. But there were too many emotions to refine into speech. In any case, Cha Eui-jae wasn't one to think long about things. He always acted first.\nCha Eui-jae spread his arms wide and bent forward—\n\"...Huh?\"\nAnd pulled both Lee Sa-youngs into a hug at once. With a thud, Sa-young and 'Lee Sa-young's' shoulders collided, and their large bodies stiffened within his embrace. Their cold forms gradually warmed with Cha Eui-jae's body heat, and a sweet fragrance filled his nostrils.\nAfter a moment, it was Sa-young who first snapped out of it, annoyed, and tilted his head back.\n\"Wait... what are you doing?\"\n\"Apologizing.\"\nSa-young's eyes widened in surprise.\n\"...What?\"\n\"I'm sorry. You must have been really shocked earlier. Both of you.\"\nThe bodies in his arms remained rigid. Cha Eui-jae thought he heard a faint sigh, but wasn't sure who it came from. He continued resolutely.\n\"It might seem strange to apologize now, but... I felt like I had to.\"\n\"...\"\nSomeone carefully rested their chin and cheek on Cha Eui-jae's shoulder and neck. A hand wrapped around his waist. Cha Eui-jae easily bore the combined weight of the two leaning on him. The words he had planned to say next got stuck in his throat.\n'If, perhaps, a situation like this arises again...'\nCha Eui-jae would do what was necessary. He would not hesitate to drive a blade into his own body. After all, a hero couldn't afford even the slightest hesitation.\nHowever,\nCha Eui-jae now knew the value of the warmth leaning against him. Before stabbing himself, there would be the smallest hesitation.\nAnd...\n\"Do whatever you want. Because now, hesitation has taken root in you.\"\nHe was certain Sa-young would never let go of that hesitation.",

      "content": "Chapter 198 - Multiple Thoughts\nHow long had they been standing like that? Just when the warmth filling both arms began to feel familiar, as if it were his own, a heavy weight suddenly dropped onto his shoulder. Cha Eui-jae turned his head. Amid the sweet scent, there was a faint smell of blood. It was Sa-young's.\n\"What? What's wrong?\"\n\"...Ah.\"\n\"Sa-young?\"\n\"I can't hold on anymore...\"\nWith that last murmur, which sounded almost like a complaint, Sa-young's full weight pressed onto Cha Eui-jae's body. The arms that had been wrapped around his waist slowly slipped away.\n'What the...?'\nHe could hear the soft, steady sound of breathing near his ear. With a bewildered expression, Cha Eui-jae supported Sa-young's waist with his arms.\n\"Wait, is he seriously asleep right now?\"\n\"Hmm... I guess he's finally run out of stamina.\"\nLee Sa-young mumbled as he stood up. Cha Eui-jae adjusted his hold on the limp Sa-young. With an inscrutable look in his light purple eyes, Lee Sa-young's gaze flicked between Cha Eui-jae and the unconscious Sa-young. He tilted his head slightly.\n\"We were in a power struggle... me and him.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Still, he lasted quite a while. For a twenty-four-year-old with only half a soul.\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. So, they weren't just arguing verbally, but also fighting over territory? He couldn't hide his disbelief as he asked,\n\"Can't you two just get along?\"\n\"Get along?\"\nLee Sa-young covered his mouth with his fist. The corners of his lips twitched upwards, as if amused.\n\"Isn't this close enough to getting along?\"\n\"Why is your idea of 'getting along' so messed up?\"\nCha Eui-jae snapped. The Sa-young in his arms let out a small groan. Damn it. As he looked worriedly at Sa-young's face, a thought occurred to him. Wait, isn't this an opportunity? No one would know the second world as well as this guy. Cha Eui-jae quickly spoke up.\n\"By the way, do you know Prometheus?\"\nLee Sa-young blinked his light purple eyes.\n\"Prometheus?\"\n\"Yeah. They aim to awaken through human strength, not through the system's selection. Ever heard of them?\"\n\"Quite grand...\"\nLee Sa-young gazed into the air as if in deep thought for a moment before shaking his head. His reply was simple.\n\"No, never heard of them. This is the first time I'm hearing the name... or that such a group existed.\"\n\"Are you sure? You weren't experimented on or anything? Did you just awaken naturally?\"\n\"Experiment?\"\nLee Sa-young shook his head firmly.\n\"No way. What I received was treatment. To detoxify poison...\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's when I awakened. And that's it.\"\nCha Eui-jae saved Lee Sa-young. In the first world, the second world, and the third world. That was an unchanging, immutable fact. But things had gone a little off track after that. Especially now, in this world, things were the most different. The biggest difference was probably...\n'The West Sea rift.'\nAnd Cha Eui-jae's absence.\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Cha Eui-jae asked,\n\"Do you know anything about eroding dungeons? The phenomenon where dungeons start to take the form of a destroyed world.\"\n\"I'm not sure what it is exactly, but I can guess. Even if we tried to block them, there were bound to be a few gaps that couldn't be sealed.\"\n\"...\"\n\"My world and yours have the same origin. Originally, my world should have been destroyed and merged with yours...\"\nLee Sa-young made a small flicking motion in the air with his finger, and a black mass appeared. The black mass started to turn white from the edges. Just before it completely turned white, Lee Sa-young drew his finger across it. The mass split into two: one white and one black.\n\"But that didn't happen. The clock wasn't intact. Because of some hack of a creator.\"\nFor a brief moment, a vision of Hong Ye-seong, with his brown hair tied up in a ponytail, waving his hands wildly, flashed through Cha Eui-jae's mind before disappearing. So did the shout of 'Friend~' and the vision of him flapping his wings in frustration in the form of a chicken.\n'That guy was bragging that the restoration was this good because it was him.'\nThat probably was the truth. Cha Eui-jae had a gut feeling it was. No matter how crazy the guy seemed, he had solid skills. Cha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Sa-young. Maybe it was because he'd been alone for so long, or maybe it was because of his lack of social skills. Either way, Lee Sa-young's ability to read people was definitely skewed...\nMeanwhile, Lee Sa-young lowered his dark hand.\n\"Watch carefully.\"\nThe two divided masses floated in the air, maintaining some distance. But soon enough, the space between them began to shrink. As if they were about to merge into one again. As if returning to their origin. Eventually, the point where they met turned gray.\n\"...\"\nHis bangs fell over his eyes, obscuring his view. The color of his hair...\nGray.\nUnconsciously, Cha Eui-jae started fiddling with his own hair. The masses were gradually sticking together, becoming one. The black was slowly turning white. Lee Sa-young watched the process with emotionless eyes and spoke.\n\"When the origins are the same, they are bound to be drawn to each other. It's a primal desire... a basic instinct to return to the original form.\"\nHis light purple gaze landed on the sleeping Sa-young.\n\"Just like how the me from my world crossed over into your world using the body of another me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's something like that. I tried to block the connections as much as possible... but there were still flows that remained linked. Especially dungeons or rifts, which are like cracks. It was probably easy for them to form.\"\nLee Sa-young ran a hand through his hair. Cha Eui-jae saw it then— his dark hand was becoming faintly transparent. His heart sank.\n'Is he disappearing?'\nBefore Cha Eui-jae could say anything, Lee Sa-young spoke first, as if he knew exactly what Cha Eui-jae was going to say. His voice was indifferent.\n\"I wasn't planning on staying long anyway. Even though the other me was desperately trying to come after me, I just... acted a bit petty.\"\nPetty? Petty?!\nIf he acted petty twice, someone could die. Cha Eui-jae could vividly recall the image of someone tearfully clinging to him, crying uncontrollably, not out of choice. After a brief hesitation, Cha Eui-jae gestured as if he were about to choke him and asked,\n\"...Was that part of it too?\"\n\"Oh, are you still hung up on that?\"\nLee Sa-young's expression twisted slightly, as if he were laughing.\n\"When you tried choking me... it made me realize that I was in a living body. I didn't mean to.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And I wanted to mess with you a little too. It was fun. Watching you go wild was kind of refreshing.\"\n\"Am I meat? Refreshing?\"\n\"The Cha Eui-jae I remember... well. Most of the time, you were either bedridden or throwing a blanket over yourself.\"\nDamn. He knew how to push the right buttons. Cha Eui-jae looked away, unable to refute him. Still, he couldn't stop himself from grumbling.\n\"Why did you mess with me? Don't you know how to repay a favor...?\"\n\"Why? Because you left me behind and went off on your own.\"\nThe unexpectedly sharp response startled Cha Eui-jae. He quickly came to a conclusion. The longer he talked to this guy, the worse it would be for him. He couldn't win. Not when the guy was using a dead person as a shield. Of course, even with the Sa-young asleep in his arms, he hadn't won that many arguments either.\nLee Sa-young tapped his cheek with a finger and muttered,\n\"To begin with... it wasn't supposed to happen. Me having a self-consciousness. Things went off track a bit.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"The original plan was for me to merge into the other me's body. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't have even realized I had merged, and we would've just become one. But... something went wrong, and we didn't merge.\"\nThe day Cha Eui-jae drove a spear into the body of a whale, Sa-young had collapsed unconscious. Hong Ye-seong... Cha Eui-jae mumbled.\n\"Hong Ye-seong said it was because your soul was too big. If you forced the merge, your body wouldn't have been able to handle it.\"\n\"Hmm... That hack's good at guessing, despite being a quack.\"\nLee Sa-young shrugged, dismissing Hong Ye-seong's words like it was the most natural thing in the world.\n\"Thanks to that, we're facing each other like this now.\"\n\"...\"\nWhen coincidences keep happening, it's called fate, they say. Perhaps this moment too, where they were facing each other like this, was destiny. Cha Eui-jae stared into the light purple eyes. In those eyes, Cha Eui-jae was reflected perfectly.\nBut the Cha Eui-jae that Lee Sa-young had loved was probably different from him. A version that collapsed every time he used his strength, swallowed his blood alone so as not to cause worry, and yet saved people despite it all...\nThe Cha Eui-jae that Lee Sa-young loved.\nCha Eui-jae hugged Sa-young, who was in his arms, a little tighter.\n\"Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"...\"\nThe violet eyes blinked. Once again, words that were his, yet not entirely his, flowed out.\n\"I'm sorry. I feel like I've burdened you with something too heavy.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But... all of it wasn't meaningless.\"\nThe eyes widened slightly. Cha Eui-jae slowly blinked, opening and closing his eyes. For a moment, it felt like voices overlapped. A smile naturally crept onto his lips.\n\"Because here we are, looking at each other like this.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nA faint light flickered in the otherwise blank violet eyes. Lee Sa-young slowly lowered his head. Soon, his black hair gave a small nod. Phew, Cha Eui-jae let out a soft sigh. The other version of him had vanished quickly, as if he had never been there.\nIn place of him, Cha Eui-jae stretched out his hand and tousled the hair that had lowered to just the right height to be patted. Wide shoulders shrunk slightly.\nAfter patting for a while, Lee Sa-young, with his now disheveled hair, slowly lifted his head. The sight was rather amusing. As he fixed his hair with his black hands, he spoke.\n\"The end... it comes when it hears someone call for it.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Was he seriously talking about the end now? Out of the blue? Lee Sa-young tilted his head and asked.\n\"Why are you reacting like that... Weren't you curious? Isn't that why you came all this way?\"\n\"Well, yeah, but... you're telling me now?\"\n\"Just listen and don't respond.\"\nHe took off his black coat and twirled it in the air. Soon, the surroundings were engulfed by pitch-black walls. In the darkness, he raised his black index finger to his lips.\n\"The more you think about it, the more you talk about it, the more you say it out loud... the faster it will come.\"\nIn an eerie voice, he muttered.\n\"You should be careful. Because you can't stop people's thoughts and words.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 199 - Multiple Thoughts\nThe words that flashed through his mind were those he saw on Prometheus's website. That mankind must prevent the end. That they must gather their strength to stop it. A chill crept down the back of his neck. If what Lee Sa-young said was true, wasn't that a signal that the end was already coming?\n\"Then... you don't even know when it will arrive...?\"\n\"I don't. No one will know. But...\"\nHis violet eyes gazed into the dark void.\n\"Our worlds are merging more and more... So it will probably come faster than what I experienced.\"\n\"...\"\n\"The world that should have vanished is staying behind and merging. As your world takes on the form of the destroyed one... more people will start to recall memories of the past. That's how fear etched into the soul works.\"\nAnd as that happens, the end will come quicker. Cha Eui-jae swallowed. His throat felt swollen, as if it was difficult to pass. Lee Sa-young lightly tapped his temple with his black fingers.\n\"It would be wise to prepare well. Though preparing itself will be difficult...\"\nIt was a dilemma. To prevent the end, they needed to combine their strength. But the more they did so, the faster the end would accelerate. Cha Eui-jae sighed. It was overwhelming. A problem that couldn't be easily solved. But even if it was daunting, it had to be done. Hadn't he already sworn to see it through?\nLee Sa-young, who had been looking down at Sa-young nestled in Cha Eui-jae's arms, tilted his head slightly.\n\"That's right. Once you get out of here... how about looking for Yoon Ga-eul?\"\nAn unexpected name came up. Cha Eui-jae widened his eyes and looked up.\n\"Ga-eul... the student?\"\n\"Ah, is she still a student there?\"\nHumming softly, Lee Sa-young muttered under his breath.\n\"She's one of the few who survived until the very end after the world was swept by the end. Along with me. Most of the others died. But she survived, somehow. That's something worth complimenting. Survival is a skill, after all.\"\nIt was a cutting remark. Lee Sa-young pointed somewhere with his black fingers. Cha Eui-jae lowered his head to look where he was pointing. The watch on his wrist. The second hand on the old, worn-out watch was still ticking away diligently, as if signaling the remaining time.\n\"It was Yoon Ga-eul who told me about the watch too.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"One day, she came and said that it might be possible to turn back time using the watch. That there was a watch among your things that might do it.\"\n\"...\"\nHe recalled her eyes, glowing golden behind her glasses. Could Yoon Ga-eul have read traces of the first world even in the destroyed one? In a peaceful world, had she been the only one to read the memories of the end?\nLee Sa-young stood at an angle.\n\"Since she survived until the end... the fear etched into her soul must be deep. Try talking to her. Yoon Ga-eul seemed to like you quite a bit, after all.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well... it seems like I've said all I needed to.\"\nWith a wave of his hand, the black barrier around them lifted. The white ruins surrounded them.\nThe destroyed world. Cha Eui-jae looked at Lee Sa-young with a complex gaze. Lee Sa-young didn't avoid his eyes and met his stare. His dry lips moved slightly.\n\"My thoughts haven't changed. I still don't think you can stop the end.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That fact will probably never change. I saw the end, and you've already died once. You won't be able to convince me.\"\nCha Eui-jae knew it too. The Lee Sa-young in front of him was the sole survivor of the end. No matter how much Cha Eui-jae preached about stopping it, it wouldn't resonate with him. In his world, Cha Eui-jae had already died, and the world had perished. Lee Sa-young, having lost everything to the end, was merely drifting.\n\"Even so...\"\nHis violet gaze lowered. In his eyes, stripped of their original color, was a reflection of himself. Another version of himself, one who had not been betrayed, who had proven trust.\n\"I believe in you...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Because I confirmed that what I did wasn't meaningless.\"\nA white wind howled. Lee Sa-young's figure began to fade into the distance. Before long, the wind grew so strong it was hard to stand. Holding Sa-young close, Cha Eui-jae called out into the wind.\n\"Hey, Lee Sa-young! Wait! Hey!\"\n\"...\"\nThe wind seemed to calm down slightly. Seizing the moment, Cha Eui-jae shouted.\n\"You, did we meet at the West Sea rift?\"\n\"...\"\nThe blackness that had surrounded him, cutting off his blood-colored vision, and the voice that echoed through the still space. Cha Eui-jae raised his voice.\n\"Was that you back then? Just answer that before you go! Hey!\"\nThere was no response. The wind howled louder. He took a step toward it, but Sa-young stirred in his arms. He immediately stopped. His vision wavered dizzily. Damn it. Cha Eui-jae clenched his eyes shut.\n...The moment he opened his eyes again.\nThe room that came into view was far more desolate than the one in his dream. It seemed he had returned properly. Cha Eui-jae let out a sigh of relief but then paused.\nThe first thing he noticed was the large body pressed tightly against his. Cha Eui-jae tried to push himself up by gripping the bed, but he couldn't because of the body coiled around his waist and legs like a snake. He could have used force to break free, but...\nDamn it, this guy's got a strong grip. With effort, Cha Eui-jae twisted his body to look at the \"snake\" wrapped around him. Lee Sa-young was asleep, his mouth slightly open. He could hear the faint sound of soft breathing.\n\"...\"\nHe looks so peaceful and pretty like this. Overcome with annoyance, Cha Eui-jae couldn't resist pinching Lee Sa-young's cheek for no reason. The delicate face slightly scrunched up. With a groan, Lee Sa-young's eyelids quivered as they slowly moved. Beneath them, vivid violet eyes appeared.\n\"...\"\n\"...You awake?\"\nLee Sa-young's eyes blinked slowly, as if responding. Yeah, it looks like we're back properly. Relief washed over Cha Eui-jae, but it was short-lived as the hands around his waist pulled him even closer. His eyes widened. Being face-to-face like this, the embarrassment slowly crept up.\n\"...Hey, how about we get up? There's a lot I need to tell you...\"\nA soft kiss landed on his chin. Cha Eui-jae's eyes popped wide open. This again?! But the lips didn't stop, brushing along his chin, cheek, and the bridge of his nose. Cha Eui-jae reached out a hand to push him away.\n\"Now's not the time for this—\"\n\"Ha, when is it ever the time...\"\nLee Sa-young's low, hoarse voice murmured. His violet eyes gleamed sharply. Before Cha Eui-jae could react, Lee Sa-young's lips claimed his. A black tongue forcefully pried through the gap between Cha Eui-jae's shocked lips, attacking fiercely as if to devour him. The slick sound of tongues mingling filled his ears, as if melting him.\nAh, seriously!\nCha Eui-jae placed his hand on Lee Sa-young's forehead and shoved him back. Lee Sa-young glared at him with an unmistakably irritated look, not even trying to hide his displeasure. Cha Eui-jae shot upright, matching his glare with his own annoyed tone.\n\"Hey, what the hell are you doing as soon as you wake up?!\"\n\"Kissing.\"\n\"And why the hell are you doing that?!\"\nLee Sa-young's eyes glinted. It was the look of someone who had been waiting to say something. He ground his teeth and muttered bitterly.\n\"You don't know how much I held back. All because of some crazy bastard...\"\nThe \"crazy bastard\" was probably 'Lee Sa-young' himself. Cha Eui-jae slowly scooted backward, preparing to escape from the bed. But Lee Sa-young was also an S-grade hunter. He narrowed his eyes.\n\"Where do you think you're going?\"\n\"...To get some water.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I-I'm thirsty.\"\nThe excuse that just tumbled out unexpectedly worked. Lee Sa-young let out a deep sigh, bowed his head, and sluggishly crawled out of bed. As he grabbed the doorknob, he warned,\n\"Don't even think about going anywhere. Stay right here.\"\nHis face, now much shinier than when he had fallen asleep, looked as if he had finally found some kind of compromise with himself. After he left, Cha Eui-jae sighed with relief and began to straighten up the blankets. Then a thought crossed his mind.\n'Come to think of it...'\nLooking back, despite his abrasive personality, Lee Sa-young was surprisingly well-connected. Although Pado Guild was a small, elite group, its influence was quite large, gathering only the best. The way Bae Won-woo treated Lee Sa-young like a younger brother, Kang Ji-soo joking with him, even his interactions with Honeybee, and his noticeably closer relationship with Jung Bin compared to the second world. Although Lee Sa-young would never admit it, any outsider could see it clearly.\n'According to the Director, wasn't it Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo who supported him right after his awakening?'\nAnd that wasn't all. He seemed to have a lot of interactions with Hong Ye-seong, had met Nam Woo-jin several times, and seemed to click well with Seo Min-gi. As for Romantic Opener... that one was still a mystery.\nStill, just from this, you could see how different he was from the second world's Lee Sa-young, who had zero social skills. That version didn't care about anyone else, only focusing on Cha Eui-jae.\nWhere did the difference come from? As Cha Eui-jae carefully reviewed the differences, his mouth opened slightly. He didn't even need to think deeply to realize the biggest difference.\nCould it be...\n'Because I'm not there... he actually developed social skills?'\nWhy does that sound plausible?\nNo, this must be the answer. Should I be happy about this or not? The fact that his presence alone could alter someone so drastically made his feelings all over the place. Cha Eui-jae buried his face in his hands. He stayed like that even when he heard the door opening.\nA voice filled with disbelief asked,\n\"What are you doing? ...Does your head hurt?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"Then?\"\n\"...I was just thinking about how hard it is to raise a child.\"\n\"Hah.\"\nLee Sa-young let out a mocking laugh.\n\"Looks like you're finally starting to understand my pain.\"\nA cold sensation touched the back of Cha Eui-jae's hand, which was still covering his face. Slowly, Cha Eui-jae parted his fingers to peer through. Lee Sa-young was holding out a 500ml bottle of water.\nHe had a soft smile on his face.\n\"I found this in the fridge, but I'm not sure if it's okay to drink... It shouldn't have gone bad thanks to the preservation stone.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Smell it first. If it seems off, I'll go buy a new one.\"\nFor some reason, Cha Eui-jae's heart wavered. He took the bottle from Lee Sa-young's hand. The surface of the bottle was cold. In the clear water, Lee Sa-young's smiling face seemed to reflect, and Cha Eui-jae quickly closed his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 200 - Collapse\nA whistle echoed through the air. The hum of filters running, the mechanical sound of water filters, the thrashing of fish tails, the loud shouts of vendors... Amidst the cacophony of noise, the sound of footsteps blended naturally.\nWith each step, the young man's navy blue hair swayed. He wore a light outfit, with his white shirt rolled up to his elbows. The owners of the shops, bustling and chaotic around him, raised their hands in greeting as he passed.\n\"Hey, where are you off to?\"\n\"A customer is waiting~\"\nThe young man smiled brightly and waved back as he quickened his pace. Soon, familiar letters gleamed among the flashing signs hanging from the ceiling. \"Jangmi Fisheries.\" The young man hopped forward and stopped in front of the shop.\n\"Ta-da! I'm here.\"\nAt the same time, Jang Mi-sook grabbed his ear and tugged.\n\"Why are you so late? Those people have been waiting for ages!\"\n\"Ouch, ouch! It hurts!\"\n\"Stop whining! You're not even really hurt.\"\nShe snorted and slapped his broad back with her large hand.\n\"Hurry in. And don't go in there picking a fight for no reason.\"\n\"A fight? I'm late because I had actual work to do... Fine, I get it.\"\nKicking off his sleek loafers, the mackerel knocked on the door with his knuckles. A low voice responded from inside. \"Yes, come in.\" As if waiting for the cue, he opened the door and lifted the curtain inside.\nTwo men, both in black suits, sat side by side in the room. One was dressed entirely in black from head to toe, including his sunglasses, while the other had a bold, orange-dyed head, looking rather scrappy.\nMackerel quickly scanned them with his eyes, then entered, grinning.\n\"Sorry I'm late! A customer wouldn't let me go.\"\n\"You're thirty minutes late.\"\nThe man with orange hair, Romantic Opener, replied grumpily. Mackerel responded smoothly.\n\"Yeah, yeah, my bad for miscalculating the time. I'll make it up with some extra service, so no worries.\"\nAfter straightening his shirt with a quick brush of his hands, he laid down a cushion and sat across from the two men. He leaned on his elbow and flashed a grin, revealing a row of neat teeth.\n\"Regular customers today, huh? I thought the guild leader would be here himself.\"\nThe sound of a water glass being set down echoed as A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi responded clearly.\n\"The guild leader is busy.\"\n\"Ah, I see, I see.\"\nMackerel leaned forward slightly and whispered.\n\"I heard the guild leader's been enjoying a game of catch-me-if-you-can at the company?\"\nRomantic Opener, Choi Go-yo, who had been sipping water, spat it out with a burst of laughter. While he turned his head and coughed, Seo Min-gi remained expressionless.\n\"Is that so? This is the first I've heard of it. Perhaps you're confusing us with another guild.\"\n\"Oh, come on. A lot of people saw it. Plus, J stayed with us for a while. You're not going to deny that, right?\"\nSeo Min-gi raised one eyebrow and replied.\n\"J stayed here? That's news to me.\"\n\"You're no fun. Don't pretend you don't know. During J's stay here, you came to the fish market several times. Just admit it. Lee Sa-young sent you, right?\"\nMackerel's navy-blue eyes gleamed. Seo Min-gi's sunglasses also caught the light and sparkled. He tilted his head up as if to dismiss the notion.\n\"You must be mistaking me for someone else.\"\nMackerel pouted and shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Pretending not to know between friends, huh?\"\n\"I genuinely have no idea what you're talking about.\"\n\"You can keep denying it, but your friend here with the carrot head already spilled the beans.\"\nRomantic Opener blinked, pointing at himself.\n\"Me? ...I did?\"\nHe looked back and forth between Mackerel and Seo Min-gi in confusion. Seo Min-gi averted his gaze. The mackerel chuckled mischievously.\n\"You know, even scams need good coordination. Right?\"\n\"Well, I believe there's always room for improvement. He has limitless potential. Anyway, enough with the small talk. Let's get down to business.\"\nSeo Min-gi adjusted his sunglasses.\n\"We've come to collect the information the guild leader requested. You've prepared it, I assume.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nMackerel licked his lips and rubbed his hands together. He held up his fingers to form a circle.\n\"By the way, this information is quite expensive. You do know it's prepayment, right?\"\nSeo Min-gi, shining his sunglasses, slid a card between his fingers and asked.\n\"Do you take card?\"\nMackerel sighed and shook his head.\n\"Why would you even ask that? There's an extra fee for card payments.\"\n\"Yes, I was just joking. You never know.\"\n\"Man, you really aren't funny.\"\nSeo Min-gi made a subtle gesture, and Choi Go-yo grumbled as he retrieved a shabby, crumpled box from his inventory. On one side, the words \"Seaweed\" were scrawled in large black letters. Mackerel cracked a joke.\n\"Did you pick this up off the street?\"\n\"Jang Mi-sook-ssi provided it.\"\n\"...\"\nWhen the box hit the table, it landed with a heavy thud. Seo Min-gi opened the box with a flourish. Instead of seaweed, or dried seaweed, or even flat, blue-green money that resembled seaweed, the box was full of...\n\"Well, this should be enough.\"\nMagic stones.\nThe box was packed with magic stones, large and small, each glowing in various colors. From pebbles to stones the size of fists, they varied in size and type. Mackerel picked up a dark blue magic stone and fiddled with it, grinning.\n\"Thanks. This will help cover maintenance costs.\"\n\"And the documents...\"\n\"Oh, here.\"\nMackerel touched his temple with a finger, and a koi fish, as large as his forearm, leapt out of his head. The koi fish swam through the air and landed in Seo Min-gi's hands, where it transformed into a thick stack of papers.\n\"I'll also send you a copy through private messenger, so don't worry.\"\n\"Thank you for the transaction.\"\nSeo Min-gi bowed his head, and Romantic Opener quickly followed suit. Several fish carried the box away beyond the wall. Mackerel stood up and brushed off his pants.\n\"Aren't you guys in a hurry? The atmosphere has been rather tense lately, with the upcoming general assembly.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"Well then...\"\nAs Mackerel stepped toward the door, he turned back and winked at Seo Min-gi.\n\"Oh, by the way, could you pass on a message to hyung-nim?\"\n\"Hyung-nim?\"\n\"J.\"\n\"What should I tell him?\"\n\"Tell him to be careful of everything.\"\n\"...\"\nSeo Min-gi stared at him expressionlessly. Mackerel's lips curled into a smirk, his navy eyes sparkling.\n\"I don't know, but something big is about to happen... And sometimes, brute strength isn't enough to solve things, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You need to use your brain.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just let him know. If he doesn't get it, that's on him. This is purely out of kindness.\"\nMackerel waved lazily as he disappeared. Silence settled in the small room. Seo Min-gi signaled to Romantic Opener, and they both stood. The moment Romantic Opener rose, they melted into the shadows. Moments later, they reappeared in front of a worn-out truck.\nSeo Min-gi climbed into the driver's seat. Once Choi Go-yo settled into the passenger seat, he finally spoke.\n\"The customer Mackerel mentioned was likely Hunter Gyu-Gyu and Hunter Honeybee.\"\n\"Huh? Seriously? How do you know?\"\nSeo Min-gi pointed at his nose.\n\"The smell.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Think back. After he said he'd provide extra service, didn't he brush his shirt?\"\nChoi Go-yo furrowed his brow, trying to recall. Mackerel, who had made them wait for thirty minutes, had laughed mischievously as he entered... and yes, he had brushed his shirt. But why? Wasn't it just a peacock-like show of vanity? Seo Min-gi, meanwhile, fastened his seatbelt and continued.\n\"That's when I caught a whiff. He even sprayed some deodorant to cover it up, but under the deodorant, I could smell Gyu-Gyu's signature cologne. Honeybee's perfume, too.\"\n\"You remember those scents?\"\n\"They both wear strong fragrances.\"\n\"And he passed that off as 'service'? I didn't catch it. I didn't get it.\"\n\"That's his nature. He's saying, 'If you can't catch on when I'm being generous, then buzz off.'\"\n\"Man, what a jerk.\"\nWith a loud rumble, the engine roared to life. The prayer beads hanging from the rearview mirror rattled along with it. As Choi Go-yo fastened his seatbelt, he grumbled.\n\"When are you going to change those beads?\"\n\"Why? Don't they bring you peace of mind? They're practically family now.\"\n\"Wow, your definition of family is pretty broad.\"\nSeo Min-gi didn't respond further and began flipping through the thick stack of papers. As more pages turned, his expressionless face gradually began to change. Romantic Opener, who was putting in his wireless earbuds, looked at him curiously.\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Seo Min-gi?\"\nSeo Min-gi calmly spoke.\n\"We need to go to the guild leader immediately.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 201 - Collapse\nA black puddle-like figure appeared in front of the large door. Soon, a round head popped out of the puddle, followed by a whole body that slowly emerged. Seo Min-gi dusted off his clothes and grabbed the door handle.\n\"Excuse me, Guild Leader!\"\nWithout waiting for a reply, Seo Min-gi threw the door open. The first thing that caught his eye was a broad back standing firm like a mountain, and a red-haired head. The owner of the back and the red hair turned to look. It was Bae Won-woo and Kang Ji-soo. Seo Min-gi quickly bowed his head.\n\"Oh, you're both here as well. Good day to you.\"\nKang Ji-soo waved.\n\"Hey. What's up? Barging in like that.\"\n\"I have an urgent matter to report.\"\n\"Haa...\"\nAn annoyed sigh escaped from between the two people. Seo Min-gi tilted his head to find the source of the sigh. Lee Sa-young was sitting at a desk, wearing glasses, with piles of documents and electronic devices spread across it, leaving almost no empty space. He frowned slightly.\n\"What is it this time?\"\nJust as Seo Min-gi was about to answer, Kang Ji-soo crossed her arms, standing with a cocky posture similar to the irritated Lee Sa-young.\n\"Guild Leader, instead of picking a fight, it'd be better to flip another page. The research team's been pestering you to give them your opinion. They said they're going to sit tight until you respond.\"\n\"The official documents from the Awakened Management Bureau and the Rift Management Bureau also need your attention. You have to handle them before the General Assembly.\"\n\"Can't you take care of those things yourself?\"\n\"I've already handled the trivial matters. What's left are the things you need to look at personally.\"\n\"Haa...\"\nEven as he sighed, Lee Sa-young obediently turned the page of the document he was holding. Seo Min-gi glanced between the thick documents in his hand and the towering piles of papers on the desk. It didn't seem like this much work was here before.\n\"Why is he being buried alive in work?\"\n\"He already had three months' worth of tasks piled up, but he's been running around all over the place since he woke up.\"\nBae Won-woo clicked his tongue. Seo Min-gi asked curiously.\n\"Didn't you manage to take care of some of it?\"\n\"It all piled up again. You were always chasing after J, weren't you? You two seemed to have a lot of fun.\"\n\"And things were normal when J wasn't around? No, not at all. It's been crazy... Anyway, he's catching up on what I couldn't handle.\"\n\"How unfortunate. But I really do need to report something urgently. Would you mind stepping aside?\"\n\"Huh? Is it something we're not supposed to hear?\"\n\"That's for the Guild Leader to decide.\"\nLee Sa-young motioned towards the door with his chin.\n\"Step out for a bit.\"\n\"Aye, aye.\"\n\"Aww, but I'm curious.\"\nThough they grumbled, the two of them quickly complied and left the room. Seo Min-gi looked around the guild leader's office. The usual ash-gray hair was nowhere to be seen.\n\"Where is J?\"\n\"Off to meet Ham Seok-jeong.\"\n\"You didn't tag along for once, I see.\"\n\"I'm not a dog... I don't always follow him around.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, the report?\"\n\"Oh, we handed over information about Prometheus' lab to Honeybee, right? Mackerel had also been keeping an eye on it, but...\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"It's all been wiped out. Honeybee even pulled in Gyu-Gyu and scoured the place to the last bit.\"\n\"...\"\n\"They rescued a few hunters during the process, but most of them were at the final stage of experiments and have lost their sense of self. They've been moved to the basement of the Seowon Guild.\"\nLee Sa-young raised an eyebrow. As Seo Min-gi handed over the documents, Lee Sa-young snatched them roughly. His violet eyes scanned the words through his glasses.\n\"Any surviving labs or researchers?\"\n\"Everything on the list we gave them was completely wiped out. I didn't expect them to handle things so aggressively. I should've taken into account how blinded by rage Honeybee was.\"\nFrowning, Lee Sa-young massaged his temple. A deep sigh escaped him.\n\"It's going to be harder to track their trail now...\"\n***\nThe back door of the classroom suddenly swung open during the second recess, a time when everyone was starting to feel hungry. Yoon Ga-eul looked up. Min-ji, who had rushed over, whispered urgently.\n\"Hey! Emergency! Emergency! The tteokbokki truck is here!\"\nDa-yeon and Su-yeong, who had been lying under blankets, rose like zombies.\n\"A truck? Like a food truck?\"\n\"That's what I heard. They're selling tteokbokki in paper cups. People are going crazy, saying it's super tasty. They asked to spread the word.\"\n\"The school gate's gonna be guarded, though.\"\n\"You know that low fence? The one some crazy guy rammed into and left a dent? They parked the truck right in front of it. Let's go, huh? Let's go.\"\n\"...\"\nThat green fence. Was it just her imagination, or did it feel oddly familiar? It was the same spot where J had shown up before. Yoon Ga-eul pretended not to care but listened intently. Of all places, right there? Could it be a coincidence?\n\"And... I heard the guy is super hot.\"\nYoon Ga-eul narrowed her eyes in suspicion.\n\"How hot could he be?\"\n\"Maybe people just have low standards now?\"\n\"No, they said he's wearing a mask, but you can tell he's really handsome. Like, seriously.\"\n\"Ugh, just say he's got a nice personality instead.\"\n\"Come on! I'm curious! Let's just go! Ga-eul, come on. It's my wish.\"\nMin-ji grabbed Yoon Ga-eul's arm and tugged. Yoon Ga-eul rolled her eyes and scratched her temple with the back of her mechanical pencil.\n\"Ugh, fine... Let's go.\"\n\"Yes!\"\nAfter all, Yoon Ga-eul was still a growing high school student.\nWhen they reached the fence, it already looked deserted, as if people had swept through the area. The ground in front of the fence, where people frequently walked, was bare of grass. Just as Min-ji said, a truck was parked beyond the fence.\nIn the truck sat a man with black hair, wearing a white mask. Dressed in a black hoodie, a black cap, and a black apron— his entire outfit was black. He looked suspicious no matter how you saw it, but... her friends were too focused on the tteokbokki to notice. Meanwhile, Yoon Ga-eul was lost in nostalgia, staring at the apron.\n'That apron looks familiar...'\nJ used to wear an apron like that too. That past felt strangely distant. The man stirred the tteokbokki on the iron plate with a ladle, and a groan escaped her lips.\n\"Oh man, I'm so hungry.\"\n\"That looks amazing...\"\nThe scent of the tteokbokki was the most delicious smell she had ever encountered. The spicy aroma was mouthwatering, and the rice cakes, covered in a glossy red sauce, glistened. Even Yoon Ga-eul, who hadn't been hungry, found herself swallowing her saliva. The man politely bowed his head to the students crowding behind the fence.\n\"Welcome.\"\n...What?\nYoon Ga-eul's head snapped up. That voice sounded strangely familiar. She adjusted her glasses, rubbed her eyes, and squinted to get a better look at the man. His rough black hair, the white mask, and his eyes hidden under the cap... Just then, the man slightly lifted his head. Their eyes met directly.\nHis shadowed, cold gaze. His dark eyes briefly glowed blue. Yoon Ga-eul suppressed a scream. This can't be happening.\n'It's J!'\nThe man quickly lowered his head again. Turns out that black hair was a wig. No wonder it looked so dry! Yoon Ga-eul, who had been standing slightly back from her friends, hurriedly pressed herself against the fence.\n\"I-I'll climb over.\"\n\"Huh? Are you sure?\"\n\"I'm wearing my gym pants... I'll be fine!\"\n\"Should we give you a boost? Help you over?\"\n\"No, no. I've been working out lately.\"\n\"Damn... this girl's living her best life.\"\n\"Uh, everyone wants tteokbokki, right? One cup each?\"\n\"Yeah!\"\nYoon Ga-eul took a deep breath and grabbed the fence. Though a part of her thought she should act casual, struggling over the fence so her friends wouldn't suspect anything, that thought quickly vanished. She grabbed the fence and leapt over it with ease. Whoa, that was wild. She heard her friends exclaim in surprise as she hurriedly pressed herself against the truck.\nFor something hastily put together, the food truck was well-equipped. Aside from the makeshift price sign, scrawled on a scrap of paper reading \"Cup Tteokbokki 1000 Won,\" and the old, outdated radio in the corner, everything was surprisingly well set up. A song Yoon Ga-eul didn't recognize was playing from the radio. She lowered her voice and whispered.\n\"What are you doing here? Why are you here like this?\"\n\"Well, you know, it'd be weird for a guy to just hang around in front of a girls' high school...\"\nJ— Cha Eui-jae —lowered his mask slightly and smiled sheepishly. A small shriek seemed to come from behind them.\n\"I couldn't exactly show up wearing a disguise again... I needed to come quietly this time.\"\n\"Last time, you came in a van. That seemed better, honestly.\"\n\"...I couldn't really get help from the Pado Guild or other people this time. So here I am.\"\n\"So you're doing this instead?\"\nYoon Ga-eul swallowed as she looked at the glossy tteokbokki. This was serious! Cha Eui-jae, now with his mask back on, mumbled self-consciously.\n\"...Is it lame? The Mackerel guy said this was the best option.\"\nHonestly, it was a genius move, considering the eating habits of high school girls. Even Yoon Ga-eul, who usually stayed holed up in the classroom, had been lured out by the tteokbokki. Yoon Ga-eul muttered along.\n\"...I think it's a stroke of genius.\"\n\"Glad to hear that, then.\"\n\"Did you make the tteokbokki yourself?\"\n\"Yeah. Should I serve you?\"\n\"Yes, please...\"\nWhen Yoon Ga-eul nodded, Cha Eui-jae skillfully stirred the tteokbokki and began filling a cup. After a brief silence, he spoke while continuing to work.\n\"I have something to ask you.\"\n\"Y-yes, go ahead.\"\n\"You mentioned before that ever since your awakening, you'd been hearing a voice, but after visiting the ruined world, the voice disappeared... You said you thought it was another Ga-eul.\"\nIn that black van, with J and Lee Sa-young inside, Yoon Ga-eul had explained her situation after checking Lee Sa-young's condition.\n\"But... after I returned from the ruined world, I haven't heard that voice again. I thought about it. The master artisan said it, right? That the same soul would merge together...\"\nYoon Ga-eul nodded obediently.\n\"Yeah, that's right.\"\n\"Can I talk to the other Ga-eul? Or, could you try remembering something?\"\nYoon Ga-eul's head shot up. At that moment, a large paper cup was handed to her. Instinctively, she took it. There was a small sticky note attached to the cup. The handwriting matched the scrawled price sign on the wall.\nIt read: [Apocalypse.]\nYoon Ga-eul's eyes widened. Cha Eui-jae quickly raised a finger to his lips. Yoon Ga-eul gulped nervously. He whispered.\n\"If she's still in there, ask her about the clock.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ask how she learned about its existence. The Ga-eul from that world.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 202 - Collapse\nFor some reason, Yoon Ga-eul wasn't sure what was going on, but she knew there had to be a reason J had come in such a covert manner. Although, she wasn't entirely sure how covert it really was. She pressed her lips together and nodded.\n\"I'll tell my teacher and come out next period. It's recess right now...\"\n\"Is that okay?\"\n\"If I say it's for the Awakened Management Bureau, it should be fine. Just wait a little bit.\"\nJ's eyes, hidden in the shade, smiled coolly. Nodding slightly, Cha Eui-jae raised his voice a bit and asked,\n\"Should I pack it in a carrier? You've got a lot to carry.\"\n\"Yes!\"\nThe friends behind the fence screamed back eagerly. He skillfully took out a paper carrier like the ones used in cafés, folded it, and placed the tteokbokki cups and wooden skewers inside. Yoon Ga-eul took the cups, bowing her head slightly. Da-yeon clung to the fence and shouted,\n\"Oppa, how long are you staying here?\"\n\"Huh? Me?\"\nOppa? Does she even know who he is?! Yoon Ga-eul was horrified by her friend's casual way of addressing him. Cha Eui-jae pointed to himself with a puzzled look, and Da-yeon nodded enthusiastically. Rubbing the back of his neck, he answered,\n\"I'll be leaving soon.\"\n\"No, you should keep selling! I'll spread the word like crazy. I have tons of friends.\"\n\"No, no need to spread the word. Lots of people already came by.\"\n\"Can we come back during lunch?\"\n\"Shouldn't you be eating school lunch then?\"\n\"Tteokbokki looks better than the school food.\"\n\"Eat what the nutritionist worked hard to prepare. Don't eat junk like tteokbokki.\"\nCha Eui-jae waved them off as if telling them to get going. Yoon Ga-eul nodded, passed the carrier over the fence, and once again hopped over it with ease.\nChecking the time, she saw that recess was almost over. Yoon Ga-eul hurried her friends back to the classroom. As she glanced back one last time, Cha Eui-jae had stepped out of the truck and was packing things up.\nIn the end, they had to eat the tteokbokki while sprinting up two stairs at a time, but the taste...\n\"Hey, what the heck? This is crazy. It's so good.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ugh, damn it. I should've asked for ten thousand won's worth. I'm going to regret this forever.\"\n\"I should've skipped lunch and just eaten this...\"\n\"They'll still have some at lunchtime, right? Oh, please.\"\nWhy is this so good?\nCould J really be some kind of superhuman who excels at everything? Yoon Ga-eul, wearing a serious expression, chewed and swallowed the tteokbokki. It was the best she had ever tasted.\n***\nYoon Ga-eul crouched down and glanced around. Fortunately, it seemed she was the only student skipping class and making an escape. She quickly jumped over the fence. Although the truck was closed, the lingering scent of the tteokbokki made her mouth water. Knowing the taste only made it harder to resist.\nSqueezing her eyes shut, Yoon Ga-eul knocked on the passenger-side door of the truck. A black baseball cap suddenly popped up from behind the window. Cha Eui-jae lowered his mask to his chin and mouthed the words,\n\"Get in.\"\nYoon Ga-eul opened the truck door and climbed into the passenger seat. Cha Eui-jae glanced at her.\n\"What did you tell them?\"\n\"I said the Awakened Management Bureau had an urgent call for me, but it was classified, so I couldn't share the details. They processed an early leave for me.\"\n\"...Can you just do that? Isn't attendance important? You're a senior in high school.\"\nYoon Ga-eul shook her head firmly, wearing a resolute expression.\n\"But... if J came all the way here, it must be something important.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae tapped the steering wheel with his fingers before speaking in a serious tone.\n\"If you miss out on your dream school because of attendance...\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll ask Lee Sa-young to scout you.\"\n\"No, no, it's fine. That's really not necessary.\"\nYoon Ga-eul quickly shook her head. Just thinking of Lee Sa-young's cold tone and purple eyes sent chills down her spine. She'd rather join the Awakened Management Bureau. Hugging her bag tightly, Yoon Ga-eul stole a glance at Cha Eui-jae. Up close, he looked quite tired. Dark circles hung under his eyes.\nUnable to bear the awkward silence, Yoon Ga-eul blurted out,\n\"That tteokbokki...\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"It was really delicious. All my friends said so too.\"\n\"Really?\"\nA tired smile appeared on his face as Cha Eui-jae chuckled quietly.\n\"Looks like it was a success. It was my first time making it.\"\n\"Some of them even said they'd rather eat that than school lunch.\"\n\"That's not good. They need to eat proper meals.\"\n\"It's just their way of saying it was that good.\"\n\"Glad to hear that. Maybe I'll open a shop if I quit being a hunter.\"\nCha Eui-jae joked as he fastened his seatbelt. The way he started the engine seemed second nature. Come to think of it, J's identity was supposed to be classified. Did he get his driver's license? Under his real name? Yoon Ga-eul fastened her seatbelt as well and asked,\n\"When did you get your license?\"\n\"I don't have one.\"\n\"What?\"\nThe confident answer left Yoon Ga-eul in shock. He just admitted to driving without a license? Was this okay? Should she call Officer Jung Bin right now? Of course, even if there were an accident, neither J nor Yoon Ga-eul would be hurt. Still, Yoon Ga-eul pressed herself against the door just in case.\n\"Then how did you drive here?\"\n\"A goldfish drove for me.\"\nWas that a joke? He looked far too serious. As soon as Cha Eui-jae placed his hands on the wheel, five red goldfish popped out from the center of the steering wheel. They scattered throughout the car, and soon the truck started moving on its own. Yoon Ga-eul's mouth dropped open.\n\"H-how does this even work?\"\n\"I don't really know either... The truck was lent to me by Mackerel. I think it's up to some kind of trick.\"\n\"Wow...\"\nSelf-driving goldfish.\nYoon Ga-eul swallowed the joke that rose to her throat. Familiar scenes from her school and the morning commute passed by outside the window. Once the school was far behind, Yoon Ga-eul finally spoke.\n\"About what we talked about... I don't think I can speak with the other version of me anymore. It feels like I've completely merged with her... Since that day, even I haven't been able to have a conversation with her.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"But I can share what I've seen. I don't know everything, but... hmm, the clock...\"\nYoon Ga-eul closed her eyes and focused. Ever since merging with her other self, she would occasionally recall memories that didn't belong to her.\nShe extended her thoughts, like drawing a mind map; the clock, a ruined world, the end, J, Lee Sa-young...\nSuddenly, a bright light switched on in her mind. Yoon Ga-eul opened her eyes. Her hands were glowing in vibrant colors. She hurriedly grabbed Cha Eui-jae's arm. Though he looked at her with a puzzled expression at first, he quickly understood and closed his eyes. Yoon Ga-eul did the same. Their consciousnesses began to sink deeper, into a faraway place.\n\"You're saying you want to meet Lee Sa-young?\"\nA damp, muffled voice echoed in a stark white space. After the sound of rustling paper, a sharp voice shot back.\n\"Why would you want to find that guy who never leaves his house? Just think of him as dead.\"\n\"Honeybee.\"\n\"What? Am I wrong?\"\n\"Calm down—\"\n\"Answer me, Bae Won-woo! Am I wrong?\"\n\"Let's talk outside. Come on, let's go.\"\nA towering shadow led the sharp voice away. When Yoon Ga-eul blinked, she found herself in a dim room, surrounded by bookshelves. The flickering candlelight cast a shadow that swayed ominously, distorting into grotesque shapes.\n\"...\"\n\"As harsh as her words were, Honeybee's right.\"\nA hoarse, cracked voice spoke. A figure snapped a book shut. Strands of white hair, unkempt and wild, fell over his face. Cha Eui-jae looked up and his eyes widened.\nIt was Nam Woo-jin— but not as he remembered. Nam Woo-jin's body was emaciated, almost mummified. A heavy breath escaped him as he blinked his pale, burning eyes— those were the only signs he was still the man Cha Eui-jae knew. His rasping voice muttered,\n\"When I make plans, I leave him out. He's not a viable asset anymore.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Maybe things would've been different if J were still around. But...\"\nHis bony fingers pressed against his temple. After a weak cough, a white liquid oozed from his mouth, accompanied by the metallic stench of blood. Though it was white, it was unmistakably blood. Struggling, he finished his sentence.\n\"...We don't have J anymore.\"\n\"Are you alright?\"\nStanding beside Cha Eui-jae, Yoon Ga-eul asked with concern. She was older now, an adult, just as she had appeared in the fragmented visions. Nam Woo-jin wiped his mouth and replied,\n\"Alright? No, I'm faithfully dying, day by day.\"\nNam Woo-jin leaned back heavily into his chair.\n\"But don't worry. I'll hang on as long as I can.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If I die, this place collapses too... So I'll endure. Though it seems parts of it have already started crumbling.\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced around. A library, full of books— it had to be the Seowon Guild. But why was the library's master in such a frail state? And then Cha Eui-jae realized the truth.\nThere was no way someone could heal others without cost.\nNam Woo-jin's ability to heal must have come at the expense of his own life. Such was the law of the system.\nYoon Ga-eul bit her lip so hard it nearly bled. After a long hesitation, her hands clenching and unclenching, she finally spoke, her voice tentative.\n\"If, hypothetically...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just hypothetically...\"\n\"...\"\n\"What if we had already experienced the end of the world, and just before it all ended, time was turned back... and that's how we ended up here? What would you think?\"\nNam Woo-jin muttered with his eyes closed.\n\"If that were true...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Then we've already failed.\"\nA heavy silence fell. Yoon Ga-eul, her voice tense, pressed on.\n\"But... what if we could turn back time once more?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 203 - Collapse\nNam Woo-jin slowly blinked. Yoon Ga-eul clenched her fists tightly.\n\"I... you may not believe me, but I've seen the previous world. It was a bit different from ours... but we were there, and the end came. J fought desperately... and failed. Then, they turned back time. Using the clock.\"\n\"...\"\n\"At the very last moment, the clock J was holding didn't break. J was the last one to hold it... So if we can find that clock... maybe we can turn back time too. We could get one more chance.\"\nYoon Ga-eul finished speaking, her breath coming in gasps. Nam Woo-jin took a deep breath. Even breathing seemed difficult for him, but he forced himself to respond.\n\"If that's possible...\"\n\"...\"\n\"It would be a miracle.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And right now... we need a miracle. But...\"\nHis eyes, burning white, gazed quietly at Yoon Ga-eul. Her clenched fists trembled. Nam Woo-jin tilted his head slightly. His skeletal fingers barely moved.\n\"You're hesitating.\"\nYoon Ga-eul bit her lip. Nam Woo-jin exhaled a rough breath, eyes closing.\n\"Of course, you are. Turning back time would mean giving up on this world...\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, here's my opinion.\"\nNam Woo-jin slowly clasped his skeletal hands together.\n\"We can't give up on this world based on our judgment alone. People are still fighting against the end. We can't just abandon it.\"\nYoon Ga-eul started to say something but closed her mouth. Nam Woo-jin nodded off, almost as if dozing.\n\"I understand what you're thinking. You're wondering what's the point of fighting if we can't win against the end anyway... that it's all going to be destroyed.\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"But.\"\nNam Woo-jin rested his sharp chin on his hand. A crooked smile spread across his gaunt face.\n\"Our failure will lay the foundation for success. I believe that.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You came up with a way because of that, didn't you? I don't know how, but you saw J turn back time as a last resort.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Let's also save that as our last resort.\"\nHis eyes, burning white, searched the air and then fixed on something. It was precisely where Cha Eui-jae stood. Could he possibly be seeing him? No, that couldn't be. It was impossible.\nThen, a bright smile appeared on his lifeless face. His withered lips moved.\n\"The end comes quietly. Without reason or purpose. It just arrives. To take the life from everything. As if it were the natural order. Like a natural disaster.\"\n\"...\"\n\"There's no avoiding it. But we can reduce the damage.\"\n\"...\"\n\"To find out how... we must keep fighting until the end.\"\nHis withered finger pointed at Cha Eui-jae. Nam Woo-jin's whisper struck like a lightning bolt.\n\"We will figure it out.\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes flew open.\nHooonk! The blaring of a horn rang out. Cha Eui-jae gasped and snapped back to his senses. The truck had made its way onto a road crowded with cars. This wasn't the dark library. Cha Eui-jae quickly turned to his right. Yoon Ga-eul, who had been slumped over, let out a faint groan as she opened her eyes.\n\"Ugh... huh?\"\nYoon Ga-eul blinked, looking around, then locked eyes with Cha Eui-jae. Her mouth opened slightly. She scratched her head awkwardly.\n\"We... we saw...\"\n\"...\"\n\"The same thing... right?\"\n\"...Probably.\"\nCha Eui-jae stared blankly at the road full of cars.\n\"We will figure it out.\"\nNam Woo-jin's final words echoed throughout his body. He instinctively knew.\nThose words were clearly meant for him.\n'He was talking to me...'\nCha Eui-jae tightened his grip on the steering wheel.\n***\nA boy in a white coat hurried down the hallway. Each time he passed someone, he bowed his head in greeting, and they returned the gesture. The deeper he went, the fewer people he encountered. When no one was around, he opened the door at the end of the hallway and descended an endless flight of stairs.\nAt the bottom was a tightly sealed iron door. The boy held up a keycard to the reader next to it. Thud... The iron door slowly opened.\nIt was a massive prison.\nHands covered in spikes reached out from the prison bars, arranged in a circle around a surgical table in the center.\n\"Hey, high five.\"\nSomeone crouched in front of the bars, slapping their hand against the spiked hand. A howl echoed from within. Beneath the pale fluorescent lights, a man in a white coat with long white hair stood, along with a woman wearing a cap pulled low over her face. The boy pulled a file from his coat.\n\"Master, a letter has arrived from the Awakened Management Bureau.\"\n\"Just leave it over there.\"\nNam Woo-jin gestured with his chin. The woman shrugged her shoulders.\n\"I'll summarize it for you. They want you to attend the next general assembly.\"\n\"So, you got one too?\"\n\"They probably sent it to everyone who usually attends. And hey, stop messing with those poor souls and come over here, will you?\"\n\"I was just playing with them because they looked bored~\"\nThe man crouched in front of the bars stood up. His light blue hair shimmered in the light, turning white. Gyu-Gyu— Ban Gyu-min —stuffed his hands into the pockets of his fur-lined jacket and swaggered over.\n\"Honestly, even after turning into that mess, can they still be called hu—\"\nClang—\nA sharp metallic sound rang out. The tip of a glowing rapier was pointed precisely at his throat. A murderous glint flickered in Honeybee's eyes. Gyu-Gyu raised both hands in surrender. Honeybee's voice was a low, threatening growl.\n\"Watch your mouth...\"\n\"...Almost made a mistake. Sorry?\"\nNam Woo-jin, busy working with his hands, snapped irritably.\n\"Quit fighting, idiots. I can't focus.\"\n\"Ah, my bad.\"\n\"...\"\nHoneybee sighed and lowered her rapier. Nam Woo-jin clicked his tongue in annoyance and continued his work. Lying on the surgical table, bathed in pale light, was Matthew. Though spikes protruded from various parts of his body, he still retained his human form. Honeybee chewed on her thumbnail nervously.\n\"...How is he? Is there any improvement? Do you think it'll work?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I've used everything on the list I got from Lee Sa-young. I scraped up all I could. If this doesn't work...\"\n\"Honeybee.\"\nNam Woo-jin sighed, straightening up.\n\"Don't be too anxious. Rushing things won't help.\"\n\"But...\"\nHoneybee murmured weakly, then let out a deep sigh. She slapped both her cheeks hard enough to make a sharp sound.\n\"No, the doctor's right. There's no point in getting worked up. Matthew isn't going to wake up just because I'm like this.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'd better go. I need to prepare for the assembly. I'm counting on you to take care of Matthew.\"\n\"Got it. Leave him to me.\"\nAs she turned to stride toward the iron door, Honeybee glanced back. Gyu-Gyu was still standing there. Honeybee frowned.\n\"Why aren't you coming?\"\n\"Huh? I'm supposed to go too?\"\n\"Our contract hasn't ended yet. Follow me!\"\n\"Alright, alright... got it~\"\nGyu-Gyu gave Nam Woo-jin a small nod, then followed after Honeybee. The iron door closed with a heavy thud. From a few steps away, the boy asked quietly.\n\"Is there anything I can help with?\"\n\"Not right now.\"\n\"Are you alright?\"\n\"...I'm fine.\"\nNam Woo-jin coughed quietly, his shoulders shaking.\n\"It's strange...\"\nThe boy's clear eyes shone, waiting for more words to come.\nNam Woo-jin held his hand up to the light from the ceiling. It was withered, like that of a mummy. His skin clung tightly to the bones, barely holding on. He blinked and opened his eyes again. His hand looked normal. Was it an illusion? A hallucination? He gestured behind him, and a small figure approached.\n\"How do I look?\"\n\"178 cm tall, slim build, long white hair, glasses, white eyes, slight forward head posture...\"\n\"No, no, not like that.\"\nNam Woo-jin clenched and opened his fist. His hand had returned to that of a mummy again. Or perhaps his eyes were deceiving him. He turned around. The boy was still standing there, waiting for his command. Nam Woo-jin spread his arms wide and asked.\n\"Do I look like a mummy to you?\"\n\"No, Master. Your weight has decreased by approximately 300 grams since last week, but there are no visible changes to your appearance.\"\n\"...Really?\"\n\"Yes. Is something wrong?\"\n\"Perhaps.\"\nNam Woo-jin glanced around before picking up a scalpel to reflect light into his eyes. His face, skin shriveled and clinging to bone, and deep-set eye sockets stared back. Only his eyes, glowing with that white flame, remained unchanged. Nam Woo-jin muttered to himself with a sigh.\n\"Whatever it is, something's gone terribly wrong.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 204 - Collapse\nThe Awakened Management Bureau was especially bustling today due to the upcoming general assembly. And there was one person who cut straight through the chaotic middle of the building.\nTap, tap, tap... A cane tapped against the floor, and shoes echoed as they walked down the hallway. It was Ham Seok-jeong and Jung Bin. People hurriedly bowed their heads, but Ham Seok-jeong only nodded and swiftly passed by. Her steps were quick, and if you didn't look closely, you wouldn't even notice that she had a slight limp. As they entered a quieter hallway, she asked Jung Bin, who was following a step behind.\n\"How are the preparations for the general assembly?\"\n\"We're in the final stages. Most have confirmed their attendance, and J has also stated they'll be coming. Hong Ye-seong has expressed interest in attending as well, so I'm planning to escort him soon.\"\n\"Heh, who wouldn't want to attend if it meant escaping from the mountain? Even though he was the one who asked to be locked up.\"\n\"Haha, isn't it human nature to long for freedom?\"\n\"Anything else of note?\"\n\"Oh, there's been contact from the Pado Guild.\"\n\"What about?\"\n\"They've reported that Honeybee... destroyed the entire research facility. Yes, Lee Sa-young also warned that tracking any traces will be more difficult from now on.\"\nJung Bin handed over a file. Ham Seok-jeong frowned slightly as she took the file and quickly flipped through it.\n\"Honeybee? Was there ever a Hunter from HB Guild who turned into a mutant?\"\n\"Not that's been reported. The Pado Guild didn't provide a reason, either. However...\"\n\"Come to think of it.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nHam Seok-jeong stopped walking.\n\"I haven't heard from Matthew lately.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That kid used to send greetings every week, without fail.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, there are times you'd look all flushed, too.\"\nHam Seok-jeong smiled as she lifted the corners of her mouth.\n\"How long should we keep pretending?\"\n\"It's not that I was pretending. I intended to report it, but...\"\nBut the Director... Jung Bin swallowed the words that almost escaped his lips.\nHam Seok-jeong was a figure who had maintained her position as director solely through her abilities and composure. After the Day of Change, when J revealed themselves to the public, Ham Seok-jeong had started showing signs of unease. She became notably more sensitive when it came to discussions about J and the West Sea rift. There were times when she'd stare blankly into space or would fail to control her emotions, even to a point where Jung Bin, busy as he was, couldn't help but notice.\nBut ever since the day J visited her, she seemed to have returned to her old self. Or perhaps, she had become more detached.\nJung Bin bowed his head.\n\"My apologies. I was trying to be considerate of the Director's feelings, and that delayed my report.\"\n\"Next time, report it right away. Even if I'm out of my mind, I still have enough sense to listen.\"\n\"...Yes, understood.\"\n\"Now then, tell me what's going on. What happened?\"\n\"Yes. Matthew got addicted to a drug. Luckily, his body hasn't mutated, but he's lost his mind. I used my power to isolate him in the basement of the Seowon Guild.\"\n\"And his current condition?\"\n\"It hasn't changed. Dr. Nam Woo-jin is attempting to detoxify him, but it's only been enough to maintain the status quo. Honeybee seems to be going around research facilities, looking for materials.\"\n\"When did the addiction start?\"\n\"Well, Honeybee suspects Song Jo-heon. She said Matthew's condition worsened after cooperating with the Samra Guild, but without clear evidence, it's just suspicion.\"\n\"...Song Jo-heon, huh.\"\nHam Seok-jeong stroked the handle of her cane. Jung Bin waited patiently for her to speak. Her gaze dropped, and she muttered quietly.\n\"He's not the type for something like that.\"\nWas it trust in Song Jo-heon? Well, the two of them had been working together since the establishment of the Awakened Management Bureau, so she likely knew sides of him that Jung Bin didn't. But what she said next was,\n\"He's not the kind of person with enough backbone to pull something like this.\"\nJung Bin involuntarily stifled a smile that was about to creep onto his face. Ham Seok-jeong, her face serious, tapped the handle of her cane with her fingers.\n\"Song Jo-heon is ambitious but lacks the drive. He's someone who prioritizes self-preservation above all else. There's no way he'd risk something as dangerous as poisoning the 3rd-ranked Matthew. There must be something else...\"\n\"...\"\n\"There's no way he acted alone. Someone else must've whispered the idea into his ear.\"\n\"...Could it be someone from the Prometheus faction?\"\n\"...Ah, I wish it were.\"\nHam Seok-jeong let out a cold smile.\n\"Wouldn't it be nice if all the troublesome ones were bundled together?\"\nAs Ham Seok-jeong handed the file back to Jung Bin and resumed walking, a vibrating sound broke the air. Ham Seok-jeong pulled out her phone from her pocket and checked the screen, her face showing a hint of curiosity when she saw the name displayed.\n\"Why is this troublemaker calling me first?\"\n\"Who is it?\"\n\"Who else would call like this out of the blue?\"\nShe showed Jung Bin the phone's screen. When he saw the name, he smiled awkwardly.\n[Troublemaker 1]\nHam Seok-jeong placed the phone to her ear and skipped any greetings, going straight into a joke.\n\"The sun must rise in the west tomorrow, seeing as you're calling me first.\"\nA low, growling voice responded without any pleasantries. There was a touch of grumpiness in the tone.\n—J?\n\"J...\"\nHam Seok-jeong turned to Jung Bin and silently mouthed, 'Did J say they were coming?' After carefully watching her lips, Jung Bin shook his head. She looked down at the floor and smiled.\n\"Ah, J. Yes, what about J?\"\n—He said he was going to see you.\nJung Bin rolled his eyes, trying to suppress a chuckle. J hadn't shown up at all today. There couldn't have been any issues with J, so they must have lied and snuck off somewhere else.\nJung Bin's shoulders trembled slightly. His colleague had guts, far too much of it. Lying to both the Director and Lee Sa-young? If they got caught, what about the consequences?\nHam Seok-jeong's lips curved upwards.\n\"What I'm asking is, why call me instead of J?\"\n—Ha... Because they're not answering, so I'm calling you instead.\n\"I'll have to tell J to never answer your calls again. It feels so good getting your call like this.\"\n—Shut up.\nLee Sa-young growled sharply, but Ham Seok-jeong continued, undeterred.\n\"Don't be too suspicious. You need to learn when to let things go.\"\n—...\n\"I'll surely inform you back, so just wait. It's been a while since we met, and I have much to talk about.\"\nClick.\nThe call ended abruptly, without a goodbye. Ham Seok-jeong looked at her phone and smiled broadly.\n\"I should thank J. Finally, something fun to tease him with. He used to be like a wooden stick, no fun at all.\"\n\"Haha...\"\nJung Bin gave an awkward laugh. When they had barely managed to teach him how to control his powers and brought him to the Awakened Management Bureau, Lee Sa-young had been the epitome of bluntness. No matter who spoke to him, he wouldn't respond, nor would he even glance in their direction. Only when people like Jung Bin or Bae Won-woo approached did he offer a word or two.\nIt was the same with the Director, Ham Seok-jeong. When she spoke to him, Lee Sa-young would respond by merely nodding without uttering a single word. Bae Won-woo and Jung Bin had been flustered, waving their hands behind his back, trying to get him to engage.\nMaybe it was wariness, maybe it was a lack of socialization, or maybe, as some said, it was just plain arrogance...\n\"Well, we'll have to keep the fact that J didn't come here a secret. I'm counting on you to handle that.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nHam Seok-jeong began to walk slowly again. Jung Bin matched his pace to her slightly slowed steps.\n\"Otherwise, they might not visit me again in the future.\"\n***\nMeanwhile, back in the truck. Both were still in shock, unable to snap out of it. Yoon Ga-eul was rubbing her head against the window in frustration, while Cha Eui-jae was gripping the steering wheel, completely zoned out. Despite the driver and passenger both being out of it, the truck continued to move smoothly on its own. The goldfish's red tail fluttered. Cha Eui-jae, who had been absentmindedly staring at the tail, suddenly had a thought.\n'Wait a minute.'\nHe had just wanted to find out how they knew about the watch, but instead, he ended up hearing a cryptic message. From Nam Woo-jin. So, what should he do now? Should he go find Nam Woo-jin? But Nam Woo-jin doesn't have abilities like Yoon Ga-eul does, so does he even know anything? His mind felt hazy, as if it were floating in the air. Just then, the phone in his pocket buzzed briefly. Cha Eui-jae pulled out his phone.\n\"...\"\nHe was shocked to see 12 missed calls.\nTo top it off, every call was from...\n[Sa-young]\nWhat the hell, is this guy crazy? Cha Eui-jae rubbed his arm, which was covered in goosebumps. He'd only been wandering through Yoon Ga-eul's memories for about 20 minutes. And yet, Lee Sa-young couldn't wait for 20 minutes and called 12 times!\nBut soon, Cha Eui-jae's chills shifted in a different direction. Wait, at this point, didn't he probably call the Director too? If the Director said something like, 'J? He hasn't arrived yet?' though he didn't think the Director would do that. Cha Eui-jae's mind started working quickly. Just then, his other phone rang. It was the one Seo Min-gi had set up for him.\n[The Director covered for you. I don't know what's going on, but I hope things are resolved smoothly.]\nIt was a text from Jung Bin.\nCha Eui-jae let out a sigh and pressed his forehead against the steering wheel.\n\"...\"\nAnd then he thought.\nSince I've bought myself some time, I should probably head to the Seowon Guild, shouldn't I?",

      "content": "Chapter 205 - Collapse\nCha Eui-jae alternated between looking at two phones. Twelve missed calls from Lee Sa-young, and texts from Jung Bin. He let out a deep sigh and rubbed his forehead against the steering wheel. He wanted nothing more than to rush to the Seowon Guild and interrogate Nam Woo-jin, asking if he knew anything. But...\n\"Do whatever you want. Because now, hesitation has taken root in you.\"\nLee Sa-young's voice, echoing in moments like this— Cha Eui-jae's one and only shackle.\nYeah, fine. Lee Sa-young, you won.\nCha Eui-jae lifted his head. Yoon Ga-eul was looking at him with anxious eyes. Taking off the hat that had been pushed up from leaning his forehead on the wheel, he spoke.\n\"Ga-eul, do you have somewhere to go?\"\n\"Somewhere to go? ...Well, maybe home?\"\n\"Won't your parents find it strange?\"\n\"Oh, both of them are at work, so...\"\n\"Then I'll give you a ride.\"\n\"Huh? Um, well, I'm not sure but... don't you have more to investigate?\"\n\"I do, but...\"\nCha Eui-jae muttered as he rubbed his thumb over the phone showing Lee Sa-young's missed calls.\n\"There's someone waiting.\"\n\"...\"\nHe handed her the other phone.\n\"Can you give me your number? I'll contact you if something else comes up.\"\n\"Oh, okay.\"\nYoon Ga-eul quickly typed in her number. Cha Eui-jae saved it and let out a short sigh.\n***\nAfter dropping Yoon Ga-eul off, Cha Eui-jae parked the truck in an alley a little distance from the Pado Guild. Technically, it was the goldfish that parked it for him.\nOnce he put on his mask and changed clothes, the goldfish drove off with the truck on their own. Their ability was really handy. Smacking his lips, Cha Eui-jae walked towards the Pado Guild building.\nThe moment he entered the lobby, though no one dared to approach, he could feel it— the gazes of everyone in the room glued to him. There wasn't any ill will or hostility, mostly curiosity. After all, he was ranked number one, and the subject of a deep scandal with the Guild Leader.\n'Damn it.'\nCha Eui-jae pulled out a keycard from the inner pocket of his jacket and swiped it at the entrance. It was a temporarily issued card. Somehow, the whispers around him seemed to grow louder, but he made an effort to ignore them as he quickly disappeared from view.\nBack when Lee Sa-young was asleep, Cha Eui-jae would use the guild's private back door, thanks to Bae Won-woo's help. There was nothing to be gained from J staying in one place for too long. However, Lee Sa-young had forbidden the use of the back door and handed him a keycard instead.\n\"From now on, use the front entrance.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hmm... why that face?\"\n\"I'm fine with how it is now.\"\n\"Isn't it better to walk confidently? You're not a rat...\"\n'You little—'\nIf only it weren't for that last remark, it could have been a somewhat fond memory. Lee Sa-young always had a way of adding unnecessary words to irritate him.\nCha Eui-jae entered the elevator, inserted the keycard, and pressed the button for the top floor. The view outside rapidly receded. Once the door opened, he sensed someone's presence.\n\"Oh? It's J!\"\nKang Ji-soo waved enthusiastically. Bae Won-woo and Kang Ji-soo were crouched in front of the Guild Leader's office. Cha Eui-jae gave a small nod and asked as he approached.\n\"What are you two doing here?\"\n\"The Guild Leader kicked us out.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Looks like there's something they're being briefed on. Where have you been, J?\"\n\"Ah... uh, the Awakened Management Bureau.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nKang Ji-soo made a gagging gesture, and Bae Won-woo looked at him with a strangely sympathetic expression. Was the Bureau really that bad? Having spent most of his hunter life with the Bureau, Cha Eui-jae tilted his head.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Oh, it's just that whenever we go, we hear all sorts of nagging and end up paying fines. Captain Jung Bin— anyway, it's scary when they're angry.\"\n\"Yeah, the Director is scary.\"\n\"Hmm, I think so too.\"\nOh, right. Cha Eui-jae remembered his conversation with Ham Seok-jeong. He had mentioned that Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo had brought Lee Sa-young in. So Bae Won-woo had also been affiliated with the Bureau at one point? Since Cha Eui-jae didn't know about it, it must have been after the West Sea rift. He asked.\n\"The Director said you were part of the Awakened Management Bureau, working with Jung Bin.\"\n\"Really? Ha... well, I wasn't officially part of it.\"\nBae Won-woo scratched his head with a sheepish grin.\n\"Because of the West Sea rift... well, manpower was lacking, so they recruited hunters. It was kind of like a mercenary gig.\"\n\"Ah, I see...\"\n\"I worked with the captain briefly back then. Then we picked up Lee Sa-young, and when the brat said he wanted to start a guild, I followed him.\"\n\"Why?\"\nSomeone like Bae Won-woo could have gotten a decent position even within the Bureau. With that experience, he could have joined any reputable guild. So why did he follow a newbie like the freshly awakened Lee Sa-young? Bae Won-woo glanced around before smiling awkwardly.\n\"Well... I was concerned about his health, and... his dream was big.\"\n\"Dream?\"\n\"He said he was going to reopen closed rifts.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Isn't that an extraordinary idea? Reopening closed rifts. It's something only a kid could dream of, not the hardened minds of adults.\"\nReopen a closed rift. Anyone with common sense could understand the implications of that statement.\n'Reopening the West Sea rift.'\nAnd whatever was inside...\nAt that moment, the door opened silently. A black-haired head wearing sunglasses popped out. Seo Min-gi. He looked at the two crouched in front of the door and then at J standing there, and said,\n\"The Guild Leader says to tell the Vice-Guild Leader that he's been rambling about the past too much because he's old. Time to knock it off.\"\n\"Hey! Say that in front of someone else, and you'll get mobbed for calling them old!\"\nThe black-haired head disappeared back inside but popped out again.\n\"He says he doesn't care.\"\n\"Ah, seriously.\"\n\"Also, the Guild Leader says both Vice-Guild Leader Bae Won-woo and Hunter Kang Ji-soo should return to their posts, and J is the only one to come inside.\"\n\"See? He just wants to hog J all to himself again!\"\n\"Guild Leader! You know you have to finish that paperwork by the end of today, right?\"\n\"He says get lost now.\"\n\"This guy... it's like he's using the Guild Leader as an excuse to say what he wants.\"\n\"Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, Ji-soo.\"\n\"He says shut up.\"\n\"Hey, you're coming with me. This is ridiculous.\"\n\"Non-violence... ouch!\"\nSeo Min-gi got dragged off by his tie. Even while being pulled, he made eye contact with Cha Eui-jae and winked through his sunglasses. What was that wink for? It made Cha Eui-jae uneasy. Giving a stiff nod, Cha Eui-jae cautiously entered through the slightly open door.\nInside the spacious Guild Leader's office, Lee Sa-young was sitting at his desk, wearing a shirt without a tie, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He was flipping through a file but looked up when Cha Eui-jae entered. Was it the different outfit? For some reason, Cha Eui-jae felt unusually tense. Lee Sa-young's gaze slowly traveled from the top of Cha Eui-jae's head to his feet, and his violet eyes narrowed behind his glasses.\n\"Seems like you had fun? Not answering my calls.\"\nPropping his chin on his interlocked hands, he spoke. Cha Eui-jae, feeling oddly defensive, replied more bluntly than usual.\n\"Hey, how could I take a call while talking to an elder?\"\n\"I take calls.\"\nThat's because you're rude. Cha Eui-jae swallowed back the words. Pushing up his slipping glasses, Lee Sa-young rested his chin in his hands again. The pen between his long fingers twitched.\n\"So?\"\n\"What do you mean, so?\"\n\"What did you talk about?\"\nWhy did it feel like Lee Sa-young already knew everything? Cha Eui-jae scratched his head and answered.\n\"Just talked about the old days. Why?\"\n\"You could've told me too... I've been stuck in here all day.\"\nLee Sa-young beckoned him over with his hand. Cha Eui-jae clicked his tongue.\n\"What, waving your hand at an elder like that?\"\n\"So, are you not coming?\"\n\"...\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae finally started walking over, a low chuckle escaped Lee Sa-young's lips. Cha Eui-jae stood across from him, the desk between them. Was it just his imagination, or did Lee Sa-young's gaze look more mischievous than usual? Cha Eui-jae swallowed nervously. A pale, delicate hand stretched out in front of him, palm up. A long, thin scar ran across the center of that pretty, pale palm.\n\"...What?\"\n\"Your hand.\"\nHe wanted Cha Eui-jae's hand? Cha Eui-jae placed his hand on top of Lee Sa-young's. Lee Sa-young removed his glasses, set them aside, and gently pulled Cha Eui-jae's hand towards him. He then pressed Cha Eui-jae's palm to his cheek, closing his eyes. Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened. The cold, soft cheek filling his palm and the faint tickle of eyelashes brushing against his fingers made him feel uneasy. His lips moved to speak.\n\"Now I feel a bit better...\"\nWatching Lee Sa-young rest his face on his hand stirred a warm, soft feeling deep in Cha Eui-jae's chest, like a gentle spring breeze. He tightly clenched his other hand, hidden behind his back. Then.\n\"...But.\"\nLee Sa-young's teeth lightly grazed the plump part of Cha Eui-jae's palm. Cha Eui-jae frowned. What now? Lee Sa-young slowly opened his eyes.\n\"Did you eat something with Ham Seok-jeong? Like street food?\"\nAh, crap.\n\"It smells sweet...\"\nOf course it does, since he'd stirred the tteokbokki a hundred times with that hand!\nCha Eui-jae replied casually, trying to play it off.\n\"Yeah, I ate at a street food stall nearby.\"\n\"I see... You must have eaten well. Considering you were wearing a mask.\"\n\"...\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae awkwardly turned his head, Lee Sa-young bit his wrist. It didn't hurt. Lee Sa-young looked at the faint teeth marks left on Cha Eui-jae's wrist with satisfaction before letting out a dramatic sigh, as if on purpose.\n\"Honestly, you're always lying... And you're terrible at it too.\"\n\"What.\"\n\"Never mind. I'll let this lie slide. I won't even ask what you were doing.\"\nWhat's going on? No way. What are you planning now? Cha Eui-jae studied Lee Sa-young with suspicion. Lee Sa-young only smiled, softly tickling Cha Eui-jae's hand.\n\"But.\"\nAs expected, there's something up. No way this guy would let something like this pass so easily. Cha Eui-jae glared at Lee Sa-young through the mask, curious to see what unreasonable demand he'd make this time. Lee Sa-young interlaced their fingers, bringing Cha Eui-jae's hand to his lips.\n\"For the general assembly, enter with me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Wearing the clothes I prepared.\"\nCha Eui-jae could feel Lee Sa-young's lips curve into a smile against the back of his hand.\n\"Not as my secretary, but as J.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 206 - End\nGeneral Assembly.\nSince the Day of Change, it was an event that was established by Ham Seok-jeong to deal with rapidly changing situations. Each meeting's location, time, and attendees vary. Most of the time, it's hosted by the Awakened Management Bureau, inviting hunters, but sometimes it's hosted by individuals or guilds.\nIn the Pado Guild's conference room, only three people were present in the large space; Cha Eui-jae, Lee Sa-young, and Bae Won-woo. Cha Eui-jae was sitting stiffly in the middle seat, holding a tablet. Bae Won-woo was standing at the podium, explaining the assembly. Cha Eui-jae was sure he had heard it before, but Bae Won-woo insisted on going over it again in more detail.\nLee Sa-young was sitting a little further away from Cha Eui-jae, half-listening, busy dealing with some remaining tasks. In the end, this was basically a one-person lecture for Cha Eui-jae alone.\n'Ugh, this is too much pressure.'\nCha Eui-jae scribbled on his tablet, pretending to take notes. Thanks to the mask, at least no one could see he was distracted. Bae Won-woo pointed at the screen with a pointer.\n\"I attended while Sa-young was unconscious, right? It's been four or five meetings in the last three months.\"\nBae Won-woo said, counting on his thick fingers.\n\"From my experience, it feels like instead of the leader, their direct decision-maker attends. Usually, it's the vice-guild leader who shows up. The Director doesn't seem to expect much either.\"\n\"Are all the hunters attending rankers?\"\n\"Yes. Only rankers related to the agenda are invited each time. Influential hunters are invited repeatedly. There are a few fixed members from the Seowon Guild, Pado Guild, Samra Guild, HB Guild, and so on.\"\n\"They seem to mainly invite large guilds.\"\n\"But it's surprisingly secretive and persistent. They send official documents with different content and then follow up with personal contacts. Many ignore the initial contact, so they follow up persistently.\"\n\"What do they talk about at these meetings?\"\n\"Ah... There's always so much to talk about. Last time, the General Assembly was heated over the eroded dungeon. That was one of the main topics.\"\nBae Won-woo scratched his head with a frown.\n\"Researchers from the Rift Management Bureau requested to investigate the eroded dungeon. Well, it's not like they wanted to investigate for free; they even offered to pay a usage fee, so we said okay.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"But the Samra Guild flatly refused to allow them access to their dungeon. I mean, we weren't asking for ownership! Just to conduct research.\"\nSuddenly, Song Jo-heon's smiling face came to Cha Eui-jae's mind. Long ago, he thought Song Jo-heon was someone trustworthy. As a former soldier, he had the face of a veteran who had seen it all. To a high school student, there wasn't a more reliable adult. However, when Cha Eui-jae saw him again...\n\"...\"\nA thick black line was drawn across the tablet screen. Bae Won-woo sighed heavily.\n\"Anyway, that made the meeting drag on for another hour. I was so bored, I almost died.\"\n\"So in the end, it's just a place where people gather and talk.\"\n\"Yep, exactly. A place where people play power games to avoid losing out. Well, J, you probably don't have to worry about that!\"\nBae Won-woo gave a thumbs-up. That made sense. After all, he had nothing to lose. It's easy when you don't have much to protect. Cha Eui-jae put his tablet pen down with a tap. As Bae Won-woo flipped through files, he mumbled.\n\"The next General Assembly seems to be about dealing with Doomsayers. They're the ones who are damaging the image of hunters, spreading distrust and discord... It seems like their influence has grown.\"\n\"...\"\n\"They'll probably also discuss the hunter abductions... Seems like this one's going to be crowded.\"\n\"Are there many hunters being abducted?\"\n\"Yeah, quite a few. Mostly hunters who are unaffiliated or from small- to mid-sized guilds have been kidnapped. Once they disappear... well.\"\nBae Won-woo trailed off, clearing his throat with a loud cough. Cha Eui-jae's grip tightened.\nThe Russian bear hunter.\nAppearing with spikes all over his face and body, hideous and deformed, the Russian bear. He must have ended up like that. Cha Eui-jae glanced over at Lee Sa-young. His black hair fell naturally, and his skin was pale. If Lee Sa-young ended up like that too, unable to endure the gruesome experiments, if his body and mind were shattered—\nIf there was no way left but to kill him.\n\"...\"\nAs if feeling Cha Eui-jae's gaze, Lee Sa-young looked up. He blinked and mouthed, Why? Cha Eui-jae shook his head as if it were nothing, and picked up his pen again.\nThe roots of both groups are the same; Prometheus. People who advocate for stopping the apocalypse without relying on the system's power, but using human strength instead.\nTo prevent the apocalypse, the apocalypse must first arrive.\n\"...\"\nWhat is this unsettling feeling? Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes tightly as the sound of thunder echoed in the distance.\n***\nShhhh... Rain poured down. Plop, plop— raindrops hit the leaves and slid off. Deep in the forest, where no human footsteps reached, someone suddenly appeared on the thick grass. It was a middle-aged man in a suit, accompanied by a young man holding an umbrella. The young man grumbled.\n\"Huh, geez... where are we?\"\n\"According to the GPS... we're at Inwangsan, Guild Leader.\"\nThe young man put away the device and shook his head.\n\"Inwangsan is a place lots of people visit, though... how did they find such a remote spot? I know it's raining, but it's way too quiet.\"\n\"It's probably the handiwork of the artisan.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"People who've been to the Artisan Exhibition say they were given personal waiting rooms. Even in a subspace. I think it was meant to prevent fights.\"\n\"...Then this place must be the artisan's subspace too?\"\n\"Most likely. In terms of security, there's no place more perfect than this.\"\n\"That's a bit scary...\"\n\"Scary, you say?\"\nThe young man hunched his shoulders, but the middle-aged man scoffed and started walking. The younger man hurried after him, covering him with the umbrella.\n\"Do you even know where you're going?\"\n\"Can't you see that light up ahead? That's probably it.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nAs he said, a house emitting a faint green light appeared in the dark forest, far in the distance. The hunter ID hanging around the neck of the young man, who peeked out and looked ahead, slipped out. The name that briefly flashed was...\n\"Ryu Han-baek.\"\n\"Yes, Guild Leader.\"\nA strong hand suddenly grabbed Ryu Han-baek by the collar, pulling him close. Startled, Ryu Han-baek's eyes widened. The Guild Leader whispered, almost spitting his words.\n\"I brought you because the most recently disappeared person was your closest friend... but do not act up. Got it?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You're attending as a witness at a meeting where top hunters gather. Normally, you wouldn't even know this meeting exists... You're only here as a witness. So don't think about interfering— just stay still.\"\n\"...Understood.\"\n\"Good, that's the right answer...\"\nRyu Han-baek slowly nodded. The Guild Leader let go of the collar he had gripped and, after straightening Ryu Han-baek's wrinkled shirt, patted his shoulder.\n\"Let's do well, okay?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Let's go.\"\nThe distance that had seemed far was closer than expected. Was it some kind of optical illusion? Ryu Han-baek folded the umbrella as he looked around, shaking the raindrops off. The Guild Leader opened the door to the worn wooden house. Creeeeak... With the sound of creaking wood, the scene that unfolded was...\n\"...\"\n\"Well, this is...\"\nIt was a massive round table meeting room. It was far too large, spacious, and ornate to be the inside of an old wooden house. The candle flames flickering from the walls cast an unsteady light. At that moment, someone extended a hand toward the Guild Leader.\n\"You're here, Magok Guild Leader.\"\n\"Oh, ah, Hunter Jung Bin. Nice to see you.\"\nJung Bin, impeccably dressed as always, smiled warmly. After a light handshake, he gestured to a spot at the round table.\n\"Your seat is over there, Guild Leader. Let me guide you.\"\n\"Oh, yes, please do.\"\nThe sensation and sound of stepping on creaking wooden floorboards were vivid, making the place feel real. Ryu Han-baek, mouth slightly agape, looked around. The Guild Leader cautiously asked.\n\"Is this... a space created by the artisan?\"\n\"Oh, yes. That's right. Who knows what kind of fantasy movie the artisan watched this time... I wish they'd make things a bit simpler.\"\nJung Bin's voice trailed off. Somehow, there was a trace of concern on his otherwise gentle face. The Guild Leader, puzzled, asked again.\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"Haha, nothing. Please have a seat. The meeting will start soon.\"\nAfter guiding them, Jung Bin left to greet other guests. The Guild Leader sat down and glanced around. Ryu Han-baek stood behind him. As Jung Bin had mentioned, most seats were already filled with rankers. Blowing bubbles into the air was Hong Ye-seong, Honeybee sat with her hat pulled low, Gyu-Gyu was sprawled across a chair yawning, and Nam Woo-jin pressed his brows together, looking tired.\nEven the Director was seated, but curiously, the seats on either side of her were empty.\n'Do they always leave those seats vacant?'\nAs Ryu Han-baek wondered, the door creaked open.\nThe atmosphere shifted.\n\"...\"\n\"The scandalous duo has arrived.\"\nThe Guild Leader muttered disapprovingly. Everyone's attention was drawn to one spot. Thud. Heavy boots stepped onto the floor. Lee Sa-young, as usual, was in a gas mask and a long coat. His presence alone was imposing, but the aura radiating from the person behind him was almost suffocating. Ryu Han-baek, ignoring the cold sweat trickling down, fixed his gaze on the door. After briefly exchanging words with Jung Bin, Lee Sa-young stepped aside.\nAnd then,\nFrom the darkness, a black mask emerged.",

      "content": "Chapter 207 - End\nThe hall was engulfed in silence.\nHis ash-gray hair gleamed white under the light, his face and expression concealed by a mysterious black mask. He was dressed neatly in a perfectly tailored suit. The sound of his shoes stepping on the marble floor rang clear. His pace was neither too fast nor too slow.\nA person who naturally drew attention. An icy chill and a sense of pressure emanated from him, their source unknown.\n\"...\"\nHe was proving it. That he was the strongest person here.\nJust by his presence.\nClick. The sound of his footsteps stopped. Standing in place, J glanced around the room. Ryu Han-baek suddenly wondered. What could he be thinking right now? Did he think he didn't belong in a place like this?\nSurprisingly, his guess was half right.\nCha Eui-jae was thinking.\n'What the hell... Why does the conference room look like this?'\nNot only did it resemble a roundtable meeting hall straight out of some low-budget medieval fantasy film, but the sight of the tense Rankers sitting in a circle was equally unsettling. No matter how much Jung Bin and Ham Seok-jeong were present, as long as this group of super hamsters was gathered together, problems were bound to arise.\n'I want to go home.'\nCha Eui-jae glanced down at his smoothly fitted suit and let out a sigh. Considering the trouble he went through to get this suit tailored, going home right now wasn't an option either. Why? Because he had gone through a whole ordeal to get it made by some crazy guy!\nCha Eui-jae sneakily glanced at Lee Sa-young. Behind the gas mask lenses, his eyes were grinning.\n***\nBefore the general meeting, Lee Sa-young and Seo Min-gi were busy calling people here and there, asking questions. Only Cha Eui-jae was left with nothing to do. He sat on the sofa, hugging a cushion, and alternated his gaze between the two. Just as Lee Sa-young finished his call, Cha Eui-jae seized the moment and asked, rather begrudgingly.\n\"Can't I just wear the suit you gave me last time?\"\n\"There's no way...\"\n\"That's right, customer... I mean, J. Please be reasonable. If you make even the slightest intense movement, it'll tear apart.\"\n\"It didn't tear, though.\"\nThe suit and shoes Lee Sa-young had given him were carefully stored in a single-room flat above a hangover soup restaurant. Just in case, he had even sent them to the cleaners! Why waste money unnecessarily? Just wear it again. This guy, making so much money, seems to have no sense of the value of money. As Cha Eui-jae kept grumbling, Lee Sa-young sighed loudly enough for him to hear and squinted his eyes.\n\"You must not realize how sharp Jung Bin's eyes are.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just stay quiet and follow me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Unless you want him to realize that the secretary back then and you are the same person.\"\n\"Hm? ...Hmph.\"\nSeo Min-gi glanced at Cha Eui-jae through his sunglasses and gave a silent nod, a gesture that made Cha Eui-jae even more annoyed. A moment later, Seo Min-gi removed his phone from his ear and spoke.\n\"There's an opening at Park-ssi's shop. Someone canceled their reservation, so a spot just opened up.\"\n\"What time?\"\n\"An hour from now.\"\n\"Let's go.\"\nSuddenly, darkness engulfed his body. When he opened his eyes, he was inside a van. Lee Sa-young sat next to him, legs crossed, as if he was used to this kind of transportation. Is it really okay to move around like this, as if being kidnapped? Unfortunately, the van didn't care about his opinion and took off.\nAfter about 30 minutes, the van stopped in a narrow alley. There was a door illuminated by a flickering amber light. Was it the back door? Someone tall stood in front of the door— a woman with her long hair tied up in a bun and a shawl draped over her shoulders. Seo Min-gi got out of the driver's seat first, and Lee Sa-young whispered to Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Wait here.\"\nWhen Cha Eui-jae nodded, Lee Sa-young got out of the van. Through the slightly ajar door, a high-pitched voice greeted them cheerfully.\n\"Oh my, Hunter Seo Min-gi, and Hunter Lee Sa-young. It's been such a long time! Hmph, I've missed you since you haven't been visiting often.\"\n\"It's been a while, Park-ssi.\"\n\"Hunter Seo Min-gi! It's been a while. I've been following InHeart closely. It seems your dark circles have gotten worse? I didn't think they could get any darker than last time.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nCha Eui-jae peeked through the tinted window. Ms. Park was laughing, chatting with Seo Min-gi. Lee Sa-young, who was waiting with his hands in his coat pockets, tilted his head slightly.\n\"How soon can it be finished?\"\n\"Oh, dear! A suit and a pair of shoes, right? And you'll be choosing the fabric and material yourself again?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Since you've come to the back door in such a hurry, it must be an urgent order...\"\nMs. Park closed her eyes as if deep in thought, then smiled brightly.\n\"I'll have it finished by tomorrow. How does that sound?\"\n\"That's fine. And...\"\nLee Sa-young glanced through the slightly open door. Judging by the movement inside, it seemed that several employees were waiting just beyond the entrance. He nodded his chin.\n\"Clear everyone out.\"\n\"Everyone?\"\n\"Only you remain. The rest, out.\"\n\"Is this a confidential job?\"\n\"The most discreet of all the ones I've entrusted to you so far.\"\n\"...\"\nWhen Ms. Park knocked on the door, all the bustling sounds disappeared at once. At the same time, Seo Min-gi cast a shadow over the van and the entrance. In the sudden darkness, the only lights left were the dim ones on either side of the door. Lee Sa-young opened the van door and made eye contact with Cha Eui-jae. His eyes, visible through the gas mask lenses, squinted as if to reassure him. He opened the door wide.\n\"Come on out.\"\nCha Eui-jae stepped out of the van. His ash-gray hair, now tinged with a faint amber under the light, fluttered in the wind. When Ms. Park saw the gray hair and the black mask beneath it, her eyes widened. She covered her mouth, speechless.\n\"Oh my, oh my...\"\n\"I'd appreciate it if you could finish it as soon as possible.\"\n\"You always manage to surprise me. And now, you've brought such a high-profile figure...\"\nMs. Park flung the door wide open. Despite the narrow entrance, the space inside was vast and expansive. Perhaps the door connected to a warehouse. Every shelf, stacked to the high ceiling, was filled with items. The scent of monsters hung thick in the air.\nMs. Park quickly made her way inside, her voice sounding distant as if she were speaking from far away.\n\"Since we have such a distinguished guest, we'll need to use materials that match. Hmm, now, what do we have?\"\nThey passed several storerooms before arriving at a large room filled with desks, clothing racks, mannequins, and fitting rooms. Seo Min-gi, inspecting the desk, asked,\n\"Has the Kraken material arrived?\"\n\"The Kraken material was used by another client just recently.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Hunter Honeybee had something made with it.\"\n\"I figured.\"\nCha Eui-jae absentmindedly looked around. Do regular shops stack up this much monster material? Wait, are they actually making clothes here? He nudged Lee Sa-young, who was standing next to him, and whispered.\n\"I thought only Hong Ye-seong could make equipment?\"\n\"Hmm... It's a bit different.\"\nLee Sa-young motioned to Seo Min-gi to explain. Seo Min-gi responded in his usual mechanical manner.\n\"The artisan creates something entirely new from scratch. These shops modify the appearance of existing equipment or enhance clothes with monster materials, like leather, feathers, hearts, claws... It's more of modifying something that already exists.\"\n\"You're absolutely right!\"\nMs. Park, who had appeared with her arms full, chimed in. She spread her items across the desk and placed a red, fiery-scaled leather against a mannequin.\n\"Like this~ We choose materials and add them to a custom-made outfit. Each monster material has its own unique properties. Dungeon items are often... bizarre, you know?\"\nIndeed. Cha Eui-jae recalled the poisonous high dungeon rewards, where poison toads roamed. The gear was a thick coat with overlapping purple, yellow, and green patterns, constantly dripping with slime. It was an A-grade item, and its gas protection was top-notch, but no one ever wanted to wear it.\n\"Hunters these days want to balance both fashion and functionality. Think of it as a hunter's bulletproof vest, with some design flair.\"\nIndeed. Cha Eui-jae nodded, and Ms. Park, resting her cheek on her palm, mumbled softly.\n\"Creating equipment is the domain of the artisan... We deal more in modification and enhancement, not creation.\"\nI see. As Cha Eui-jae nodded in understanding, Ms. Park giggled.\n\"You're much more gentle than I expected, J-nim.\"\n\"...Excuse me?\"\nCha Eui-jae widened his eyes, but Lee Sa-young, arms folded, quickly cut in.\n\"Is this all? The materials?\"\n\"Oh! I have more. I just brought the most noticeable ones, A-grade or above. This is Velosraptor leather— light, flexible, and perfect for nimble movement.\"\nLee Sa-young, with a tilted head and a nod, expressed his thoughts. Ms. Park's hands were swift, but Lee Sa-young's evaluations were even quicker. Like a judge, he critiqued everything meticulously.\n\"The fabric is subpar.\"\n\"What use is third-grade monster hide?\"\n\"Next.\"\n\"The color doesn't match.\"\n\"It doesn't suit him.\"\n\"This is the best you've got?\"\n\"Hmm...\"\n\"It's not worth the money.\"\nWith each effortless criticism, even the smile of the\nprofessional Ms. Park gradually faded from her face.\nprofessional Ms. Park gradually faded from her face.",

Cha Eui-jae's smile also faded— not that he ever really smiled in the first place. He shot a glance at Seo Min-gi. What's with him? Seo Min-gi, somehow understanding, mouthed back the answer.\n'He's always like that.'\nAt the same time, Lee Sa-young shrugged.\n\"This is troubling... Park-ssi.\"\n\"Oh my... What do you mean?\"\n\"You can't run a business like this.\"\nLee Sa-young sighed deeply and dropped the piece of leather he had been fiddling with as if he had touched something he shouldn't have. He dusted off his hands dramatically. Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened. What's with that gangster-like tone? To him, the ultimate traditionalist, this scene felt way too provocative. Even though Ms. Park appeared older than Lee Sa-young, was he acting so cocky just because of her ranking?\nNoticing the tension, Seo Min-gi quickly grabbed Cha Eui-jae's twitching shoulders and swiftly folded his hand down before he could start pointing fingers. Meanwhile, Lee Sa-young kept talking without pause. He crossed his arms, sighing in disappointment.\n\"The quality of the materials... isn't it a bit too ordinary? I bet our guild's storage has plenty of this.\"\n\"...\"\nHis voice came out smoothly from behind the gas mask.\n\"Then there's no reason for me to come all the way to see Park-ssi... I came here looking for something special.\"\nWasn't it just because this was the only place with an available time slot? Cha Eui-jae glanced at Seo Min-gi. Seo Min-gi gave a blank nod, though Cha Eui-jae couldn't quite tell what it meant. Lee Sa-young tapped the filter of his gas mask and mumbled to himself.\n\"Maybe I should reconsider this deal.\"\n\"...No!\"\nMs. Park, who had been keeping her head down, suddenly lifted it with fierce determination in her eyes. She seemed to have been provoked.\n\"Why are you making that decision so soon? I haven't even shown you a tenth of what I've got.\"\n\"Really?\"\nLee Sa-young grinned.\n\"Then bring it all out... I'll pay whatever it's worth.\"\n\"Can you handle what you're saying?\"\nLee Sa-young smirked, lifting his chin slightly.\n\"Why would I say something I can't handle?\"\n\"...Ha, alright. Just sit tight and watch!\"\nMs. Park straightened her coat and vanished down the narrow hallway. Now the spacious workshop was left empty with just the remaining people. Seo Min-gi, who had been holding back, finally released Cha Eui-jae's shoulders and hands. Lee Sa-young picked up a fang the size of his face, clicking his tongue.\n\"Tsk... What am I supposed to do with this?\"\n\"Why? Isn't it cool?\"\n\"...This? Cool? Are you serious?\"\nLee Sa-young looked at Cha Eui-jae like he had just heard something absurd. Cha Eui-jae blinked. Isn't a fang cool? It's primal... Seo Min-gi muttered seriously in a low voice.\n\"This is bad. The customer's aesthetic sense... it's totally old-school hunter style.\"\nLee Sa-young leaned on the desk, lowering his head, his voice filled with clear frustration.\n\"Ha... this is the worst. How can his taste be exactly like Jung Bin's?\"\n\"You're dissing me now, right? It feels like you're lumping me in with Jung Bin for an insult.\"\n\"Pardon? Not at all. I was praising the classic taste of J and our civil servant's sense of aesthetics.\"\n\"What kind of nonsense is that!\"\nLee Sa-young pretended not to hear, turning his head away. These people... I can't hold back any longer. Cha Eui-jae finally started pointing his finger at them, something he hadn't done earlier.\n\"Hey! Back in my day, you had to wear whatever came out of the dungeon! Even if it was some ragged balloon-looking outfit, if it had good performance, you wore it! No time to be picky about aesthetics! Your life was on the line. You kids are spoiled!\"\n\"Sure, sure, got it, grandpa.\"\n\"Grandpa? Graaandpaa? You're only four years younger than me, punk!\"\n\"Sure, if you say so...\"\nSeo Min-gi stepped in between them to mediate.\n\"Alright, alright, let's stop here. J, how about showing us your superior eye for materials and picking something out yourself?\"\nSeo Min-gi gently nudged Cha Eui-jae's back. Cha Eui-jae retorted.\n\"Pick what?\"\n\"Well, as you said, if the shell doesn't matter as long as the performance is good, then you should have a much better eye for materials than us.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why not give it a try? Park-ssi's storage is said to have some interesting stuff.\"\nDamn. Well, it wasn't like he could cause a scene in someone else's shop. Cha Eui-jae glared at Lee Sa-young, who was busy rummaging through the materials on the table, and then headed toward the shelves.\nThe shelves, which reached up to the ceiling, were filled with boxes, fabrics, leather, bones, teeth, claws, and magic stones, all arranged without any real order. At first glance, it looked like a chaotic mess of junk thrown together. A strange sense of déjà vu washed over him. Where had he seen such a cluttered shelf before?\n'Wait?'\nWasn't Hong Ye-seong's workshop in the first world exactly like this?\nCha Eui-jae quickly scanned the area. Was Ms. Park always this disorganized with her belongings? He turned to Seo Min-gi, who was trailing behind him.\n\"Park-ssi... has she always been this bad at organizing?\"\n\"Hm? No. Her other storerooms are well-organized. It seems to be just this workshop that's like this.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I figured it might be because she needs to grab materials quickly here. Or perhaps she has her own system.\"\nIs it just a coincidence?\nCha Eui-jae pulled out a half-open box and examined the contents. Small odds and ends, covered in dust, rolled around inside. Just as he was about to lose interest and put it back, something shiny caught his eye.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae quickly brushed the junk aside. In the corner of the box was a...\n'A shard?'\nHe picked it up. It seemed like a broken fragment of something, maybe a bead. The smooth surface had several fine cracks, and the sharp edges looked like they could cut if handled carelessly. Cha Eui-jae held the shard up to the light. The white shard glimmered under the ceiling lights. Though it was something he'd never seen before, it didn't feel unfamiliar. A strange déjà vu.\nWhile Cha Eui-jae stared at the shard, Seo Min-gi approached and asked.\n\"What's that?\"\n\"Not sure.\"\nJust then, the sound of something being dragged grew closer, along with the presence of someone approaching. Ms. Park was pushing a cart overflowing with materials. She parked it next to the desk, wiped an imaginary bead of sweat, and, noticing what Cha Eui-jae was holding, looked surprised.\n\"Oh? That's...\"\n\"Do you know what this is?\"\n\"It must've been here for a long time. I bought this shop from someone else, and it was one of the materials left from the previous owner.\"\n\"The previous owner?\"\n\"Hmm... Oh dear? I can't quite remember... but they were a bit of an oddball.\"\nMs. Park tried to recall but soon shook her head.\n\"How strange... Anyway, it was one of the leftover items. I was going to throw it out since it looked like a broken fragment, but it disappeared one day. So that's where it ended up.\"\nCha Eui-jae examined the shard. The glossy white surface seemed to shimmer with a wave-like glow, which flickered and vanished. Each time he saw that light, his heart pounded. Was it anxiety? Restlessness? Nervousness? He couldn't tell.\nWhile busily transferring materials from the cart to the desk, Ms. Park smiled and said,\n\"Looks like it caught your eye?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young glanced at Cha Eui-jae, shrugged, and continued inspecting the new materials with a sharp eye. Ms. Park addressed Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Hoho, you can have it if you'd like~ I was going to toss it anyway. It's not much, but consider it a gift for a new customer.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nShe winked. Cha Eui-jae clenched the shard tightly in his hand before placing it into his inventory. The sound of objects clinking against the shard echoed clearly.\n***\n'...And after that, things really got out of hand.'\nThinking about it again made him feel a bit down. Among the materials that Ms. Park brought out the second time, it seemed like there were quite a few that caught Lee Sa-young's interest. Lee Sa-young and Ms. Park had a long discussion, comparing all sorts of materials against a mannequin.\nWhy did they have to make such a fuss over a single outfit? Couldn't they just take the measurements and be done with it? Cha Eui-jae had to stay by Seo Min-gi's side until their discussion was over. More precisely, he didn't have any room to step in. That place was a separate world, only accessible to people who had a keen interest in fashion.\n\"You're here, J.\"\nWhile Cha Eui-jae was lost in his gloomy thoughts, Jung Bin greeted him first. Snapping back to reality, Cha Eui-jae gave a small bow in response.\n\"Hello.\"\n\"Was it hard getting here?\"\n\"No, I just had to rip the scroll. But the conference hall...\"\n\"Haha, it's just Hong Ye-seong-ssi's taste.\"\nJung Bin smiled awkwardly. He pointed to the empty seats on both sides of Ham Seok-jeong.\n\"Your seats are over there.\"\n\"She's really going all out to show off.\"\nLee Sa-young muttered in an irritated tone. Cha Eui-jae shrugged and motioned for Lee Sa-young to take his seat.",

      "content": "Chapter 209 - End\nAs the two approached, Ham Seok-jeong smiled gently.\n\"You're here. The suit looks good on you.\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't respond and simply bowed his head. It was best to speak as little as possible in formal situations. This was a survival rule taught to him by Ham Seok-jeong. She tapped the seat to her right. Cha Eui-jae moved to sit in the designated spot without thinking much. However—\nA hand suddenly grabbed his arm. A gloved hand held him firmly.\n'What the—?'\nLee Sa-young, instead of sitting, tilted his head with an air of rebellion and crossed his arms, clearly showing displeasure.\n\"How generous... assigning seats for everyone.\"\n\"I arranged them with care. You know, it's not ideal to sit people with bad blood next to each other.\"\nProving her point, Honeybee and Gyu-Gyu sat at the seats farthest from Ham Seok-jeong. When Lee Sa-young's gaze met Gyu-Gyu's, he grabbed his shoulders, looking like he was about to cry. But when Jung Bin leaned in and whispered something in his ear, Gyu-Gyu shrugged it off. Honeybee, on the other hand, looked at them with a scornful glare.\nHam Seok-jeong observed the situation with a relaxed smile.\n\"What, are you upset because you can't sit next to the guy who's been avoiding you for three months? You don't like it?\"\n\"Since when did we get so chummy... Whatever.\"\nLee Sa-young motioned towards Cha Eui-jae with his chin.\n\"I'm the one who brought him here... I should sit next to him.\"\nOut of nowhere?\nCha Eui-jae widened his eyes in surprise at Lee Sa-young's words. Ham Seok-jeong chuckled.\n\"Oh, was that the issue?\"\n\"He wouldn't have come if it wasn't for me.\"\nWhat brazen confidence!\nHam Seok-jeong shook her head in disbelief.\n\"Since when were you two so close... Fine, do as you like.\"\nShe waved her hand dismissively as if to say, \"Do whatever.\" Cha Eui-jae, however, didn't like the idea of sitting next to Lee Sa-young under everyone's watchful eyes. He was about to refuse when his gaze met Lee Sa-young's deadly glare. His violet eyes were menacing. Cha Eui-jae swallowed back a curse.\n'What the hell is his problem now?'\nAgain. Once more, Lee Sa-young's mood was twisted up like a pretzel. Curious eyes turned toward them. Hong Ye-seong even pulled out some popcorn from somewhere and began munching on it. His overly keen hearing caught every whisper; I thought it was just for attention, but they're actually close? He grabbed J like that. So that rumor's true...\nIf he kept listening, his mental fortitude was going to run dry. Gritting his teeth, Cha Eui-jae muttered quietly enough for only Lee Sa-young to hear.\n\"Shut. Up.\"\nLee Sa-young let go of his arm and dragged the chair that was originally next to Ham Seok-jeong to his side, placing it next to his own. The hunter assigned to sit next to Lee Sa-young gasped in shock and quickly moved his entire chair away. The person next to him followed suit, and then the next— drag, thunk, drag, thunk— the sound of chairs being moved rippled down the line like a wave.\nWith a single action, Lee Sa-young had shifted half the hunters in the room. He shrugged, the gas mask on his face tilting slightly, as if to say, \"Satisfied now?\"\n'Nothing's fine about this!'\nCha Eui-jae clenched his trembling fists. Unable to shout, all his rage was channeled into his hands. When was the last time he'd felt this level of anger towards Lee Sa-young? Probably not since the days at the hangover soup restaurant, when Lee Sa-young was messing with his business.\nBut any more attention on him was even more burdensome. If he lost his temper here, there might be another article tomorrow, something like \"J Knocks Out Lee Sa-young at Conference Hall.\"\nCha Eui-jae did his best to act like everything was normal and sat down in the seat Lee Sa-young had prepared for him. He heard a low chuckle near his ear.\nIt was at that moment—\n\"Oh, it looks like everyone's gathered. Even some familiar faces! Am I too late?\"\n\"No, you arrived just in time.\"\n\"Haha, you all must be working hard as usual. Oh wow, today's meeting room is quite impressive!\"\nSong Jo-heon entered the room with a kind smile. Fortunately, everyone's attention shifted to him.\nNow that they were no longer the focus, Cha Eui-jae lowered his hand under the large table, extended his index finger, and pressed it hard against his thigh, writing letters into his flesh, applying enough pressure to cause pain.\nDo you want to die?\nLee Sa-young turned sharply to face Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae glared back. He'd never felt so resentful of the mask covering his face as he did now. Lee Sa-young's eyes narrowed beneath the gas mask lenses, as if he found the situation amusing.\nInstead of writing anything, Lee Sa-young's fingers touched Cha Eui-jae's thigh, playfully tickling him, tracing random zigzag patterns as if testing a pen to see if it worked, or doodling nonsense.\n\"...\"\nWait, this actually feels kind of...\nAs Cha Eui-jae stiffened, Ham Seok-jeong rose from her seat.\n\"Now that Guild Leader Song Jo-heon is here, and everyone's arrived... Shall we begin the meeting?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I won't waste your time. Let's just discuss what's necessary and finish quickly.\"\nSong Jo-heon responded.\n\"That's what I like to hear.\"\nHam Seok-jeong looked coldly at Song Jo-heon. He fiddled with the handle of his cane and smiled gently.\n\"Alright, let's get this over with.\"\n***\n\"Oh~ these incorrigible people~\"\nA lively, folksy tune filled the air. Shrrrk, shrrrk, a whetstone sharpened a knife. As Jang Mi-sook sharpened the blade while listening to trot music, she suddenly stretched her neck out long, peering outside. The fish market was, as usual, constantly shifting in fragments, but there were few lost wanderers or customers looking for stores today.\n\"It's unusually quiet today. What's going on?\"\n\"Ah... there's a meeting.\"\n\"A meeting?\"\nShe turned to look inside the room. In the dim room, Mackerel, wearing a shirt and slacks, was lying down, using a cushion as a pillow, tapping away on his phone. From the horizontally held phone came the swoosh of a game sound.\n\"The big shots are gathering to whisper amongst themselves. Most of our regulars are probably there.\"\n\"Why aren't you going? You're ranked pretty high, aren't you?\"\n\"We're from a rogue faction, so we can't go. That place is only accessible to those from the orthodox sect. And there's no need to go anyway— we can find out everything discussed in the meeting later.\"\nYawn, Mackerel opened his mouth wide in a stretch. Jang Mi-sook clicked her tongue at the sight of the lounging Mackerel.\n\"Why are you the only one out here? Where's your brother?\"\n\"I came out to keep our dear Mi-sook from getting bored. My hyung's still holed up in his room.\"\n\"Tell him to get some sunlight.\"\n\"Oh, come on. You know him. Going outside is a big deal for him.\"\nJust then, Mackerel's phone vibrated loudly. He sprang up and held the phone to his ear. With a warm tone, he asked,\n\"Hello, hyung? What's up? Do you need me to bring you something? Or... do you just miss me?\"\n—No... something feels off outside.\n\"...Off?\"\nMackerel narrowed his deep blue eyes. He slipped on his shoes, nodded toward Jang Mi-sook, and quickly crossed the alley, asking as he went,\n\"What do you mean by 'off'?\"\n—Th-there are strange people holding signs, lining up from Noryangjin Station all the way to the entrance here.\n\"...\"\n—I think it's Prometheus.\nMackerel stopped in his tracks. His voice dropped low.\n\"What's written on the signs?\"\n—They're saying we should stop the end of the world with human power. It's not just here... they've appeared in other places too.\n\"Where exactly?\"\n—In the main shopping districts.\n\"Did they time this to coincide with the general assembly?\"\nMackerel ruffled his hair roughly and started running toward the exit. From the phone came a shaky voice, muttering in confusion.\n—H-how did they gather so many people? There was nothing on the website about meeting up.\n\"That's not the point right now, hyung.\"\nThe moment he stepped outside the exit, what came into view was...\nHundreds of people dressed in white, standing in a long, orderly line.\n\"Are they out of their minds?\"\nMackerel adjusted his grip on the phone. With a flick of his fingers, a few goldfish appeared and swam leisurely toward the crowd. However, the people paid no attention to the bright red goldfish. They just stood there like robots, eerily still. Despite the hundreds gathered, it was strangely quiet, making it hard to tell if they were even alive.\nEach of them held the same sign, with red letters scrawled across it.\n[Let's save ourselves from the apocalypse]\n[Overcome the end of the world with human power]\n[The end]\nThe end?\nThe moment he saw the words, his vision blurred. His head spun. The air around him felt heavier.\n\"...Ah, damn it.\"\nMackerel cursed under his breath and leaned against the doorframe, feeling nauseous, as if he was about to throw up. His vision wavered. He barely managed to speak.\n\"Hyung...\"\n—Wh-what's wrong?\n\"Don't come outside. No matter what.\"\nAnd then,\nThud...\nAn eerie silence settled in, so quiet you couldn't even hear a breath.",

      "content": "Chapter 210 - End\n\"Wake up the kids next to you. We haven't even had lunch, but they're already dozing off.\"\nClick, the sound of a pen's tail being pressed. Scratch, scratch, the sound of someone doodling on paper. Rustle, the sound of clothes brushing against each other. Snap, the sound of a compact mirror closing. Giggle, giggle, the sound of stifled laughter shared quietly.\nEven during class, the classroom was filled with all sorts of noise, apart from the teacher's voice.\n'I can't concentrate...'\nSnap, the lead of her mechanical pencil broke. Yoon Ga-eul let out a small sigh. She pressed the tail of the pencil. The spring popped. The most annoying thing after her awakening was this; having to hear things she didn't want to hear. Suppressing the urge to cover her ears, Yoon Ga-eul glanced toward the window. The curtains fluttered in the breeze blowing through the half-open window.\nThe wind stopped, and the curtains settled.\n\"...\"\nDa-yeon, sitting by the window, was staring vacantly outside, her face oddly grim, her hand reaching up to touch her neck. What is she looking at? Is something there? Yoon Ga-eul followed her gaze to look out the window as well. And then,\nShe saw the group dressed in white.\n[Overcome the end of the world with human power]\nFor a moment, her breath caught in her throat. The red letters struck her eyes like a bolt of lightning. The end. Instinct screamed at her. No one can see this. But how? There's still a long time left before class ends.\nJust then, the teacher tapped on the blackboard.\n\"Alright, alright, stop looking out the window and focus here. Did an idol show up outside or something?\"\nYoon Ga-eul snapped her head up. But it was too late. The students' attention was already drawn to the window. At the same time, Yoon Ga-eul slammed her mechanical pencil down on her desk. This is driving me crazy! She shot up from her seat. However,\n\"...\"\nShe froze on the spot.\nA white hole was shining ominously bright in the sky. It hurt to look at, like staring at the sun with bare eyes. Yoon Ga-eul squinted.\nThe third apocalypse, following two previous destructions. Even though time had been rewound, the soul remains the same. And in that soul, fear is imprinted. A primal instinct.\nA chill ran down her spine. Her stomach churned, and cold sweat trickled down. Every hair on her body stood on end. Yoon Ga-eul slowly looked around. Everyone was wearing strange, uncomfortable expressions.\nSome were rubbing their necks, some their arms, others holding their eyes. Some were stamping their feet restlessly... everyone was touching some part of their body. And none of them seemed aware of it.\nYoon Ga-eul rubbed her chest, then suddenly jerked her hand away in shock. This isn't the time for that. She hurried to the window and yanked the curtains shut. Whoosh, a loud sound echoed, but no one paid her any attention.\nAfter closing all the curtains, she gripped the white fabric and tried to catch her breath. It was eerily quiet. Her vision started spinning. Am I scared right now?\nNo, it's not me. To be precise, it's the part of her that had melded into...\n'I'm scared...'\nYoon Ga-eul, who had experienced the apocalypse, was afraid. Instinct warned her. The apocalypse was coming.\nYoon Ga-eul hastily pulled out her phone. Her vision kept flickering.\n***\nBoom—\nA cloud of white dust billowed like a cumulus cloud and slowly settled. The massive goat, entangled in thick vines, collapsed. Kang Ji-soo dusted off her hands after pulling them out of the dirt. Bae Won-woo lowered the shield he had been holding in front of him. The research team, who had been standing back, rushed toward the goat. The hired gathering guild followed in a hurry behind them. Bae Won-woo scratched his head.\n\"...Maybe I should have followed them?\"\n\"Why would we follow them, Vice-Guild Leader?\"\n\"Still, sending Sa-young off alone makes me a bit uneasy. What if he breaks someone's shoulder again...?\"\n\"That's... something to worry about, I guess.\"\nKang Ji-soo scratched her head. It was Bae Won-woo who had attended the council meeting in Lee Sa-young's place while he was unconscious. Bae Won-woo didn't have any issues since he got along well with most of the hunters, but Lee Sa-young...\nBae Won-woo glanced anxiously at Kang Ji-soo.\n\"He wouldn't pick a fight, right?\"\n\"Wasn't this meeting directly hosted by the Director? You think the Director would let that kind of behavior slide?\"\n\"But still...\"\n\"You're overprotective. Instead of worrying about that, why don't you think about lunch?\"\n\"Hangover soup...\"\n\"Ugh. The hangover soup restaurant is closed.\"\n\"I know. That's why I stopped myself mid-sentence.\"\nBae Won-woo looked troubled as he watched the goat being steadily dismantled. The skilled gatherers were carefully separating the goat's hide, horns, bones, organs, and mana stones. The research team from the Pado Guild watched eagerly, their feet shuffling in excitement. Kang Ji-soo yawned out of boredom and muttered.\n\"Let's just cook some instant noodles. I'm feeling lazy.\"\n\"Sure...\"\n\"Wait, you're okay with instant noodles? That's unusual. Are you still worrying about the Guild Leader?\"\n\"No... I'm just worried the Director might call us if Sa-young causes a scene. I don't want that...\"\n\"Think positively. Even if you're with him, you can't prevent accidents.\"\n\"Vice-Guild Leader.\"\nAt that moment, the team leader of the research group hurried over. Dressed head to toe in a thick white protective suit, he bowed his head with sparkling eyes.\n\"We've finished the gathering! Thank you for bringing us here. Thanks to you, we should be able to collect significant comparative data.\"\n\"Oh, well, good work. Anything else you need to check? Last time, you were even collecting stone fragments.\"\n\"Ah, the gathering guild members are collecting those as well. Haha, things are finally looking up. And it's all thanks to you, Vice-Guild Leader, for sticking by the Guild Leader and getting the hiring approved.\"\n\"Nah, it was the Guild Leader who signed off on it.\"\nBae Won-woo waved his hand dismissively. Despite being middle-aged, the team leader beamed with the excitement of a child.\n\"I'll take this to the lab right away to examine it. Thank you again!\"\n\"Yeah, we'll be off too.\"\nThe two left the dungeon with light steps and got into the van parked near the dungeon entrance. Bae Won-woo started the engine and let out a long yawn. Sitting in the passenger seat, Kang Ji-soo shrugged her shoulders.\n\"How about we grab some pasta?\"\n\"I don't eat Western noodles.\"\n\"Fine. Then go stuff yourself with banquet noodles.\"\nThe black van rolled smoothly down the road. Kang Ji-soo, sitting cross-legged in the passenger seat, began searching for restaurants on her phone. Once she filtered out all the \"Western\" food, there wasn't much left to choose from.\nSure, the hangover soup restaurant was always a safe option, but she was sick of it from eating there too much. Kang Ji-soo clicked her tongue. Then she looked up. The car was moving strangely fast.\n\"What are you doing, Vice-Guild Leader? You trying to get a ticket?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Vice-Guild Leader?\"\nKang Ji-soo glanced to the side. Bae Won-woo had a pained expression on his face. Beads of cold sweat glistened on his temples. His hands, gripping the steering wheel, were trembling uncontrollably. And then, he slumped over the wheel. The van's horn blared loudly.\n\"What the hell! What's going on...! Vice-Guild Leader! Bae Won-woo! Hey, you bastard!\"\nKang Ji-soo hurriedly shoved her hands under Bae Won-woo's torso and grabbed the steering wheel. The crosswalk at the intersection was right in front of them. For some reason, there were strange white shapes on the road, but she didn't have time to look. That wasn't important right now. She couldn't let the van crash into other cars or pedestrians!\n\"Damn it, I don't even have a license!\"\nKang Ji-soo gritted her teeth and yanked the steering wheel as hard as she could. Screech— her body was flung to one side. Thick vines suddenly sprouted up, blocking her view. Her scream was swallowed by the blaring noise.\n***\nCha Eui-jae glanced at his wristwatch. Unfortunately, he couldn't tell the time; the hands just kept moving, but offered no clear reading. Inside his mask, Cha Eui-jae puffed out his cheeks. Despite being called a \"general assembly,\" the gathering was chaotic with raised voices, and the same points were repeated tediously. Most of the complaints came from small to mid-sized guilds that had lost hunters. Someone raised their voice;\n\"At this point, shouldn't the Bureau step in and find a solution? What, are you going to wait until only rankers are left? Are low-ranking hunters not even considered hunters anymore?\"\n\"Please calm down...\"\n\"Don't act like we don't know. People are mocking us, saying hunters who get kidnapped deserve it!\"\n\"That's absolutely not the case. I'm not sure where you heard such rumors, but—\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, I understand your frustration. Many hunters from guilds allied with our Samra Guild have also been kidnapped...\"\nSong Jo-heon interrupted with a deliberately sorrowful expression. He stood up and approached the hunter who had vented his frustration, patting his shoulder in sympathy.\n\"We, both I and the Awakened Management Bureau, have made various efforts to track them down, but we've failed to catch their trail. It's all due to our incompetence.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I sincerely apologize on our behalf. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\"Oh, no, it's not that...\"\nSong Jo-heon bowed deeply. At the same time, Ham Seok-jeong spoke up;\n\"It seems the Samra Guild hasn't found them, either.\"\n\"...\"\nSong Jo-heon straightened up and shot a sharp look at Ham Seok-jeong. Ham Seok-jeong simply shook her head.\n\"What I mean to say is...\"\n\"The Awakened Management Bureau has indeed identified the group responsible for kidnapping hunters. However, we can't move hastily against them. You all know about the drug circulating among hunters, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You've probably heard about it, known as a drug that gives hunters the gift of peaceful sleep.\"\nCha Eui-jae looked at Ham Seok-jeong, then shifted his gaze to Jung Bin, who was standing behind her.\n\"The group kidnapping hunters and the one manufacturing and distributing this drug are one and the same.\"\nJung Bin was rubbing the back of his neck.\n\"...\"\nNo, he wasn't just rubbing his neck. He was clutching it. As if choking himself. His face was strangely pale. Cha Eui-jae quickly turned to look at Lee Sa-young, who was seated next to him.\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young had his head bowed, as if he was about to collapse onto the table at any moment.",

      "content": "Chapter 211 - End\n\"The Awakened Management Bureau has been tracking down groups involved with drugs that negatively affect the Awakened. Recently, they discovered that the two groups were originally one and are working toward the same goal.\"\n\"So, who are these guys? What are they up to?\"\nCha Eui-jae placed his hand on Lee Sa-young's thigh under the table. There was no response. His muscles twitched reflexively, but that was it. Was he dozing off? It wasn't exactly something one would fall asleep to.\n'What the...?'\nCha Eui-jae looked back at Jung Bin. Jung Bin was now absentmindedly fiddling with his neck under his shirt collar. It seemed like he wasn't even aware of what he was doing.\n\"Their name is...\"\nAt that moment, Cha Eui-jae felt a slight vibration in his pocket. Was he expecting a message? He pretended to focus on the conversation while checking his phone. It was a text from Yoon Ga-eul.\nStudent Ga-eul: We're in big trouble. The end is coming.\nThe instant Cha Eui-jae's eyes widened—\nWuuung.\nIt started with a small vibration. Ham Seok-jeong stiffened momentarily, then offered a slight bow of apology to those present. There was a tense silence, though no one stopped her. She took out her phone. Cha Eui-jae stared at her intently, watching the reflection of the rectangular screen in her dark eyes. What message could the Bureau Director possibly receive right now?\n'The end.'\nCha Eui-jae quickly reached out and grabbed Ham Seok-jeong's arm.\n\"Wait a second, Director!\"\nSimultaneously,\nThe sounds of countless notifications rang in a cacophony.\nBuzzes, beeps, vibrations, and tunes all mingled together in a chaotic uproar. Hunters who had been watching Ham Seok-jeong and J pulled out their phones one by one. Even Jung Bin, who had been rubbing his neck absentmindedly, snapped to attention and checked his messages. Not even J could fend off so many incoming messages at once.\nAnd then,\nSilence fell.\nStillness. Ham Seok-jeong, Song Jo-heon, who had been staring her down, Gyu-Gyu, who had been yawning out of boredom, and Hong Ye-seong, who had been folding paper from the handouts they were given— none of them moved.\nInstead, they all began touching parts of their bodies. Some touched their necks, others their eyes, ears, arms, mouths, hearts, or stomachs. As if they were checking to make sure they hadn't lost a part of themselves. And the checks weren't one-time. People kept touching themselves, over and over again. The only sound was the rustle of clothes in the eerie silence.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae read the words on Ham Seok-jeong's phone screen.\n[Report: An unidentified group is staging silent protests worldwide. Confirmed as the group under investigation. They are spreading fear and urging civilians to participate, claiming the end is near...]\nCha Eui-jae released his grip on Ham Seok-jeong's arm. No one was looking at him. He felt completely cut off from the world. Instinctively, he took a step back. Then, he grabbed onto Lee Sa-young, as if the man were his only lifeline.\n\"Hey, hey, Lee Sa-young.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Say something.\"\nEven as he shook Lee Sa-young's shoulder, no answer came. Cha Eui-jae swallowed hard, his stomach churning. An ominous tension hung in the air. Just then, something small and white floated up from the ground. It was Kkokko.\nKkokko ignored everything else, heading straight for Cha Eui-jae. A flurry of frantic words poured out of the little beak.\n\"Hey, hey! This is really bad. What's wrong with your world? Why is everything happening so fast?\"\nCha Eui-jae pressed his hand against the pale, smooth pulse in Lee Sa-young's neck. Fortunately, it was beating normally. Letting out a small sigh of relief, he responded.\n\"Explain it so I can understand. I know things are screwed.\"\n\"What's there to explain! Some crazy bastards are summoning the end. They practically rolled out the red carpet for it! Why are there so many lunatics in this world?\"\nCha Eui-jae circled the table, checking the messages on the hunters' phones. They had all received texts from different people, but two words were common; the end. He returned to Lee Sa-young's side, ruffling his hair in frustration.\n\"So just seeing the word 'end' caused all this?\"\nAn ominous voice that had warned about the end swirled through his mind.\n\"The more you think about it, the more you talk about it, the more you say it out loud... the faster it will come.\"\n\"You should be careful. Because you can't stop people's thoughts and words.\"\nHow careful they had been. Cha Eui-jae had deliberately avoided sharing information about the end with either Lee Sa-young or the Director. They already knew about the end, but he had worried that adding more details might somehow accelerate its arrival. Yet all their efforts had been in vain. He instinctively reached for his mask.\n\"Just seeing the word makes it come faster... at this rate.\"\nHow could they fight it? Was it even possible to stop it with human power? A sudden sense of hopelessness surged up within him. But Kkokko— no, Hong Ye-seong's voice cut through his thoughts.\n\"No, that's not it. This didn't happen in the last world. I think your world is just unique.\"\nKkokko, who had been tapping Hong Ye-seong's cheek with his wings, let out a long sigh. He scurried across the wide table, muttering to himself.\n\"The souls here must already remember two previous ends. Even if they don't consciously realize it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"They're people who've already died twice because of the end. The souls will remember how terrifying it was. And this world has been merging with the second, destroyed world.\"\nKkokko pressed his two wings together, struggling to explain.\n\"As if remembering that destroyed world wasn't bad enough, the fear those souls remember is now compounding. That's why people are realizing the end is coming so much faster.\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced around. They were still touching parts of their bodies, their faces twisted in strange expressions. Kkokko perched on top of Hong Ye-seong's head, chattering away.\n\"Think about it. If you'd heard the word 'end' without knowing anything, you'd just ignore it, right? Probably laugh it off as some doomsday nonsense.\"\n\"...Yeah, I guess.\"\n\"But after you guys came back from that world, people started to slowly remember that destroyed world. Freezing in fear makes sense.\"\n\"You're saying all these people froze up because of fear?\"\n\"You're underestimating fear. No matter how brave someone is, they can't just ignore a fear that's imprinted on their soul. They'd instinctively want to avoid the end.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae let out a wry laugh. Hong Ye-seong was right. He, too, feared silence. From the moment he had felt that unfamiliar dread of quiet, to now, being comforted by Lee Sa-young. He was still shaken, still terrified by the sudden onset of silence.\n\"Then what about Lee Sa-young?\"\nCha Eui-jae grabbed the filter of Lee Sa-young's gas mask and sharply turned his face toward Kkokko. His body was limp, as if he had lost all strength. Lee Sa-young wasn't touching anything; he looked like someone who had completely passed out.\n\"He didn't even hear about the end, but he suddenly ended up like this. What's going on?\"\n\"Huh? I don't know!\"\n\"...Do you know anything?\"\n\"What I do know is that we need to do something. Let's get out of here!\"\nKkokko leaped up as if ready to dash out any second. Cha Eui-jae quickly responded.\n\"Wait! You're saying we should just leave them like this?\"\nKkokko tilted his smooth, shiny head.\n\"They're probably safer here than out there. I made this space, after all. Besides, they'll snap out of it soon enough. Fear is just a temporary emotion.\"\n\"...\"\nBut. Cha Eui-jae tightened his grip on Lee Sa-young's hand. Could he really leave him behind again?\n\"...\"\nUnfortunately, there wasn't time to hesitate.\nCha Eui-jae unstrapped the watch from his wrist, rolled up Lee Sa-young's coat sleeve, and fastened it onto his right wrist. The sound of the watch strap clicking into place was unnervingly clear. Cha Eui-jae whispered into Lee Sa-young's ear.\n\"I'll be back soon.\"\n\"...\"\n\"This time, I mean it.\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae stood up, Kkokko flew onto his head, raising his wings dramatically.\n\"Alright, buddy. Let's go!\"\n\"Get off my head, you brat!\"\n***\nThe road was packed with cars, and the bustling district, usually filled with people heading somewhere, was eerily still. Everyone had stopped and was staring up at the sky. Silence reigned as though not a single living soul was present. As Cha Eui-jae passed through them, he glanced around and muttered to himself.\n\"I thought it was only the hunters affected.\"\n\"Civilians went through the apocalypse too. It'll take longer for them to snap out of it. Their mental resilience is a bit weaker.\"\nKkokko replied, chattering away. Perched on the tip of Cha Eui-jae's spear instead of his head, Kkokko flapped his wings.\n\"Isn't that them? The crazy ones.\"\nJust as he said, people dressed in white filled the street. But they too were blankly staring at the sky, their protest signs limp on the ground. Cha Eui-jae approached and picked one up.\n[Overcome the end of the world with human power]\nKkokko clicked his tongue in disdain.\n\"They couldn't escape the fear either. Idiots... Do they even know what they've done?\"\nAt that moment.\nA shadow loomed over the sign. Cha Eui-jae quickly jumped back.\nAnd then, in the very spot he had just been standing,\nBOOM—!\nSomething massive came crashing down from the sky.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nThrough the cloud of dust rising from the impact, Cha Eui-jae caught glimpses of a giant form thrashing about. A crunching sound echoed as if it was chewing on something. Cha Eui-jae held his spear at the ready, holding his breath.\nAnd then,\nThrough the dust, a massive mouth gaped wide open. Sharp teeth filled the maw, and inside...\nCha Eui-jae cursed under his breath.\n\"...Shit, unbelievable.\"\nHe caught a glimpse of blood-soaked white clothes and mangled limbs.",

      "content": "Chapter 212 - End\nThe moment the gaping mouth closed, a wet squelch resounded, and bright red blood splattered at his feet. Crunch, crunch... The noise of bones being ground into pieces was deafening. Slowly, the white dust began to settle.\nWhat had fallen from the sky looked like a massive snake, or maybe a sea cucumber. Its limbs twitched, disturbingly short in proportion to its lamp-post-like long body. It raised its head to the sky, as if trying to swallow the last piece whole, while its blue eyes quickly scanned it. However, even with the eyes of a tracker, there was nothing particularly unusual to detect. Or rather...\n\"It's disturbingly lacking in presence.\"\nCha Eui-jae looked down at Kkokko, crouched on the ground.\n\"Hey, do you know what that thing is? I've never seen one like it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Kkokko?\"\n\"Bawk?\"\nThe small bead-like eyes blinked. The smooth head tilted to the side. It was Kkokko! It was enough to drive him crazy. Cha Eui-jae squatted down, grabbed Kkokko, and shook him.\n\"Hey! Where the hell did you go, all of a sudden?!\"\n\"Bawk?\"\n\"Hah, you always run off when things get important, despite all your 'I'll watch over you' talk!\"\nKkokko, however, just stared at him with its usual innocent eyes. While Hong Ye-seong might have been at fault, Kkokko was innocent. In the end, Cha Eui-jae placed Kkokko on top of his head. Then, gripping his spear, he glared at the monster.\nCharging recklessly at a monster you've never seen before was pure madness. What if it reflected attacks, or exploded upon death? That would be a huge problem. Moreover, this was the worst possible scenario to confront the monster. There were countless civilians nearby, and there was no way to evacuate them.\n\"...\"\nMinimizing civilian casualties was paramount.\nCha Eui-jae picked up a fist-sized piece of concrete from the ground and threw it toward an area without people. Thud! The piece hit the wall, rolled a couple of times, and stopped. A beat later, the monster turned its head toward the noise. Blood dripped from its lopsided mouth. Its head tilted slightly, as if confused. Its eyes were invisible.\n'It's slow. It has no eyes. At least it responds to sound.'\nThe monster quickly lost interest in the concrete. The large Adam's apple below its mouth bobbed once. At the same time...\n\"...It's growing?\"\nIts body had gotten slightly larger. Its blood-soaked tongue licked around its lips. If it grows every time it eats a human, that's going to be a real headache. Who knows how big it could get?\nThe monster sniffed the air, slowly crawling along. Ssssh, ssssh... Blood trails stretched out behind it wherever it went. Its massive mouth opened wide toward the Prometheus civilians. At the same moment, Cha Eui-jae sprang into action.\n'It's instinctively heading toward where there are more humans.'\nJust as the giant teeth were about to snatch up the humans,\nWham— Thud!\nCha Eui-jae's foot slammed into its mouth. The sensation of its teeth shattering against his foot was vivid. Broken teeth scattered. Cha Eui-jae somersaulted backward and landed lightly. Kkokko, who had fluttered into the air, settled back onto Cha Eui-jae's head. The monster, now toppled over, thrashed around, its short limbs flailing.\nKkieeeee... A screech echoed through the street. Cha Eui-jae brushed the blood off his pants. The monster, after wailing for a long time, started to wriggle and crawl again, heading once more toward the humans. Cha Eui-jae readjusted his grip on his spear.\n'It doesn't attack the one who hurt it... it's focused on its original prey.'\nIt would have been better if the monster had shown killing intent toward Cha Eui-jae. That way, he could lure it to an empty area. But instead of retaliating against its attacker, it was opening its jaws toward its intended meal. That must be its instinct— to eat more humans.\nSuddenly, a thought crossed his mind.\nThis won't be the end of it.\n'What?'\nMore will show up, from now on.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't hesitate.\nSquelch—\nHis massive spear pierced through the monster's head, skewering it from its mouth downward. Bright red blood sprayed out. At the same moment...\n\"...Huff, huff...\"\nA small gasp escaped.\n\"Ah, ahhh! AHHHH!\"\nSomeone screamed and collapsed, scrambling backward. It was a human, standing just a step away from the monster. His white lab coat was soaked red, making it impossible to tell its original color. He was probably a member of Prometheus. One by one, others began waking up, their screams echoing from different directions. Cha Eui-jae pulled his spear out. Squish, blood splattered everywhere. Both the spear and the hand gripping it were drenched in crimson.\nHe could feel people's eyes on him. Somewhere, there was the sound of sobbing. Was there anyone around to help evacuate the people? Cha Eui-jae looked up. From somewhere, another wailing sound could be heard. There was no time to hesitate!\nCha Eui-jae quickly gestured toward the people.\n\"You all know where the designated shelters are, right? Go to the shelter, now!\"\n\"Cock-a-doodle-doo—!\"\nKkokko crowed loudly and dashed off toward the shelter. The dazed people slowly began to follow, one by one. Cha Eui-jae jumped down from the monster and grabbed the collar of a man in a red-stained coat, who was crawling on all fours. The man let out a gasp. Cha Eui-jae yanked the coat and leaned down.\n\"Hey.\"\nThe man nodded frantically, his throat gulping.\n\"S-save me! Please, save me! I don't want to die!\"\n\"I won't kill you. Just answer my questions. Quickly.\"\n\"Anything! Ask me anything, just please, let me live! I want to live! Don't take me away! Let me return to my family, please!\"\nThe man was trembling, begging desperately with his hands clasped together. His tear-streaked face was drenched in blood. He didn't dare look at Cha Eui-jae, his eyes darting toward the empty space beside Cha Eui-jae's mask. Cha Eui-jae frowned.\n'Return to your family?'\nThat sounded like something a kidnapped person would say. Cha Eui-jae loosened his grip on the coat a little.\n\"Were you originally with Prometheus?\"\n\"Pro... No? I-I wasn't, no! I wasn't. No, no.\"\n\"Then what? Were you kidnapped?\"\n\"Huh? I, I don't... I don't know. I can't remember. Who am I? Who, who, who...\"\nThe man's eyes went dull, his lips trembling uncontrollably. Damn it. Were they brainwashed or something? Cha Eui-jae grabbed his collar tighter. The man let out a choking sound as he was pulled closer. Cha Eui-jae shouted urgently.\n\"Family, you said you had a family. Think of them!\"\n\"Fa...family...\"\nA string of drool dribbled from the man's mouth. His eyes were already glassy. The fear and terror that had once consumed him had disappeared. Damn it. Cha Eui-jae shook the man.\n\"Just answer me this. Did you know this would happen if you did this?!\"\n\"Uh, uh...\"\nCha Eui-jae brought his face closer and snarled.\n\"Damn it, did you know the world would end like this?!\"\n\"...World? End? Has the world ended?\"\nAt the word \"End,\" the man's eyes rolled back in his head before snapping back into place. His eyes were now filled with a strange light. The man groped at Cha Eui-jae's hand, despite the blood soaking them. His grin stretched unnaturally wide.\n\"Yes, the Prophet said... when the end comes... we will receive great grace... all of us.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's here, it's here. We succeeded. We succeeded...\"\nThe man's body trembled, and he was laughing.\n\"Kuh, kuhuh, kuhuhuhuh! Hahaha...\"\nThe man leaned back, laughing hysterically. But the laughter soon stopped. He bowed his head, then whipped it up to glare at Cha Eui-jae. His bloodshot eyes locked onto the black mask.\n\"You!\"\n\"...\"\n\"A fugitive who fled from the end, the enemy of the world!\"\nCrack, the sound of his nails snapping rang out. And then.\nThud.\nThe hand gripping Cha Eui-jae's slackened and fell. He had desperately scratched at Cha Eui-jae, but left no mark. The man's head bent at an unnatural angle. Cha Eui-jae released his grip on the coat. Thud, the man's body hit the ground.\n\"...\"\nNothing reflected in the lifeless eyes.\nCha Eui-jae quietly stared down at the man. He tore off a clean piece of the blood-stained coat and dusted it off. Then, he gently draped it over the man's face. The half-opened eyes disappeared under the white cloth.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae straightened up and looked to the sky. White things were falling from the White Hole everywhere. Thud, thud, thud... Heavy objects were crashing down all over.\nI need to move.\nBut his feet wouldn't move.\nThen.\n\"...\"\nBzzz, his phone vibrated. Cha Eui-jae struggled to pull out his phone and check the message.\n[Where are you?]\nIt was a message from Lee Sa-young.",

      "content": "Chapter 213 - End\nA moment ago.\nLee Sa-young opened his eyes. The landscape that appeared was a familiar one— an achromatic beach. Another \"me\" stood there, with lavender-colored eyes.\nThe uninvited guest with lavender eyes nodded his head instead of greeting. Swoosh... the gray sea moved slowly, with waves breaking before they could reach his feet. Lee Sa-young didn't hide his displeasure, folding his arms and tilting his head.\n\"I thought you said you wouldn't show up anymore.\"\nThe uninvited guest slowly shook his head.\n\"I didn't call you. You were dragged in here.\"\nBehind the uninvited guest, the waves seemed to reflect his figure. He was becoming more transparent. No wonder he had been having thoughts that weren't his own lately. Lee Sa-young and 'Lee Sa-young' were slowly merging into one. This was both welcome and unwelcome at the same time. Lee Sa-young asked again.\n\"Dragged in here?\"\n\"Yes. And... you've got a watch now.\"\nThe uninvited guest motioned toward Lee Sa-young with his chin. Lee Sa-young raised his right hand. At some point, a broken watch had appeared on his wrist. It was the one his Hyung always wore. The fact that it was now on his wrist...\n\"...Shit.\"\nWhatever this meant, it wasn't good news. A sinister energy started creeping out from Lee Sa-young. The uninvited guest shrugged his shoulders. Lee Sa-young tried to take off the watch, but it wouldn't come off. It was like a shackle. Gritting his teeth, he asked.\n\"Tell me how to get out.\"\n\"Time has to pass. Until our consciousness recovers.\"\nLee Sa-young twisted his lips.\n\"...Ha... So I have to wait months again?\"\n\"Not quite... but.\"\nSuddenly, his body felt incredibly heavy. Just like when he'd been bound by Jung Bin's chains. The agony that made even breathing difficult surged up. Lee Sa-young let out a small grunt and bent forward. Thud, his knees sank into the white sand. He fell to all fours, grabbing the sand in his fists. Controlling his power was becoming difficult. Black venom was oozing out from various parts of his body. Sticky black venom dripped from the corner of his mouth.\nThe uninvited guest continued to watch him with an emotionless gaze.\n\"You'll have to wait. Until your soul can overcome the fear of the apocalypse.\"\nOvercome fear? Something— either venom or tears— rolled down Lee Sa-young's cheek. Despite his trembling from the pain, he glared at the uninvited guest. Through his quivering lips came a cold voice.\n\"There's no... time for that.\"\n\"You're right. The apocalypse is coming.\"\n\"Think of... a way.\"\n\"Then... let's try this.\"\nShuffle... The uninvited guest stepped closer, leaving faint footprints in the white sand. Standing right in front of Lee Sa-young, he crouched down to meet his eyes. A transparent finger touched Lee Sa-young's forehead.\n\"Let's pull out your subconscious.\"\n\"Hah...\"\nHow would that help? The white sand beneath him was melting into black venom. Lee Sa-young, who was lying in the center of the venom, lifted his head. Through his ragged breathing and disheveled hair, his violet eyes gleamed with a murderous aura. The uninvited guest smiled. It was the same smile as Lee Sa-young's.\n\"Isn't there a hole in your memory?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just like you saw my memories, I saw yours. There were some strange black patches. Did you erase parts of your memory on purpose?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"Then how about we scrape off that paint... You could forget the pain, and learn more about yourself at the same time.\"\nUgh, so annoying. As expected, every suggestion from this guy was exactly how Lee Sa-young would think. If he had to endure this time anyway, it was better to gain some information, even if it meant facing greater pain. Lee Sa-young closed his eyes. The uninvited guest's transparent finger pierced sharply into his mind.\n***\nCha Eui-jae fidgeted with his phone. A message from Lee Sa-young, asking where he was. Thankfully, it seemed like he had regained consciousness. Cha Eui-jae let out a small sigh of relief. Should he send a message? Call? Hearing his voice would reassure him. As soon as he pressed the call button and held the phone to his ear—\n\"Oh my! Could it be? J, is that really you?\"\n\"...\"\nA strangely familiar voice. Cha Eui-jae snapped his head up. Through the crowd of people turning their backs and fleeing from J, a woman was approaching. She was the only one looking at J.\nDressed in a white lab coat, her long hair twisted up and pinned with a large clip. Round glasses. Shoes with a slight heel, slacks, and her white coat rolled up to her elbows. A research ID card dangled from her neck. Even amidst the chaos, her coat, unblemished by even a speck of dust or a drop of blood, fluttered in the air. Tap, her shoes stepped into a puddle of blood without hesitation. Cha Eui-jae stared at her face. She was definitely familiar.\n'Where have I seen her?'\nThe woman slowly raised her head. Behind her round glasses, her large eyes were smiling. It was a smile that seemed both fox-like and snake-like.\nWhere...\n\"...Ah.\"\nWith a confident expression, the woman thrust her hands into the pockets of her lab coat. It was unmistakable. She looked older than in his memories, but...\n\"The child's condition is gradually improving. The antidote we developed seems to be effective. It's all thanks to you, J!\"\n\"Starting today, how about you visit the child's room directly? You've always been looking through the glass.\"\n\"Oh, no rush! Stay as long as you need.\"\n\"But are you going to keep calling him 'that boy'?\"\nYes, she was the awakened potion-maker. Introduced by the hospital director himself. One of the researchers in charge of Lee Sa-young's treatment. When everyone else kept their distance from him, she was the first to approach him warmly. Cha Eui-jae cautiously pulled out a name buried deep in his memory.\n\"Ga...young?\"\n\"Oh my, oh my! You remember!\"\nGa-young, the researcher who had taken care of Lee Sa-young while he was in the hospital, clapped her hands and laughed brightly.\n\"I thought you wouldn't remember. I'm honored.\"\n\"How could I not remember?\"\n\"Really, ever since you went into the West Sea rift and disappeared... everyone's been so worried~ Are you okay? Judging by how you're walking around like this, I guess you're fine?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"That's a relief~ Really. I'm so grateful.\"\nGa-young smiled sweetly. There was so much he wanted to ask her. What happened to Lee Sa-young after he went into the West Sea rift? Where did all the researchers who took care of him go? Why had all the hospital records been erased? Where had she been until now, and why was she here now? Could she possibly be...\nBrrrrr, the dial tone stretched on.\nA strange feeling of unease sealed Cha Eui-jae's lips shut. In the end, he wiped the blood from the window and said,\n\"...It's dangerous for you to be here.\"\n\"Oh, yes, yes. But don't worry about me. We're getting everyone evacuated~\"\nGa-young remained standing there, hands still tucked into her lab coat pockets. Cha Eui-jae glanced at the rectangular card hanging around her neck. It was her ID badge. Ga-young, Samra Guild.\n\"...\"\nHer brown eyes scanned Cha Eui-jae from head to toe as if studying him. In the distance, faint sounds of wailing could be heard. The monsters that had been devouring humans seemed to have appeared elsewhere. Even though the sound was loud enough for civilians to hear, Ga-young showed no signs of fear.\n'Can a non-combat awakened like her really be this calm?'\nEven if she trusted J, it was odd for someone to show absolutely no fear in this situation. The growing sense of unease continued to swell within him. Nevertheless, Cha Eui-jae spoke again, hoping his feeling was wrong.\n\"...Why are you here? Did the Awakened Management Bureau give you orders?\"\n\"Awakened? Oh...\"\nGa-young's lively voice dropped slightly, carrying a hint of mockery. Her narrowed eyes grew even more slanted. She covered her mouth with her hand as she answered.\n\"As if.\"\n\"...\"\n\"By the way, who are you calling? The Director?\"\n\"...\"\nThe dial tone continued to ring. There was no sign that anyone would pick up. He had just sent a message. Cha Eui-jae didn't answer. Ga-young tilted her head, then raised the corners of her lips.\n\"Oh, are you calling Guild Leader Lee Sa-young? He won't be able to answer right now.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't you have so many questions for me? J.\"\nA mechanical voice spoke through the phone. The person you are trying to reach is unavailable... Cha Eui-jae hung up and turned to look at Ga-young. She was standing in a puddle of blood. Boldly. She let out an exaggerated sigh.\n\"Are you pretending not to know, or do you really not know? If it's the latter, I'd be a bit disappointed. You've realized it, haven't you? Or do you need some more time to process reality?\"\nCha Eui-jae suppressed his emotions as much as he could and answered.\n\"I hope I'm wrong.\"\nSighing, Ga-young rested her chin on her hand.\n\"You know, I thought back then too... you're such a fool. I like foolish people, really. I almost wish you weren't awakened.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, it's fine. I have fond memories of you, after all...\"\nThe distant wail of a monster cut off abruptly with a final shriek. Keeeeh... Ga-young hummed a small tune as she whistled. Then, something heavy landed behind her with a thud. A squelching sound followed as some kind of viscous liquid dripped.\n\"I'm grateful to you for many things. So let me introduce you to this.\"\nCha Eui-jae turned around. A massive figure, easily two heads taller than Cha Eui-jae, was lumbering toward him. It had limbs, resembling a human in shape, though its arms were unnaturally long. Aside from that, it walked like a person. The flesh visible beneath its black cloak was grotesquely distorted and crudely stitched together in different colors. On its head...\n'A gas mask...'\nIt was wearing a gas mask. Its eyes weren't visible behind the lenses.\nWith every step it took, thick black liquid splattered onto the ground. The asphalt hissed and melted wherever the liquid touched. Cha Eui-jae recognized that venom. The creature gave Cha Eui-jae a fleeting glance, but as if uninterested, it lumbered over to Ga-young. It knelt down before her with a heavy thud. Ga-young beamed.\n\"Good job. You took care of it well?\"\n\"Yes... ma'am.\"\nThe creature nodded slowly. At some point, Ga-young had put on black leather gloves, similar to the ones Lee Sa-young often wore. Smiling, she looked at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"Doesn't it look familiar?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 214 - End\n...He blinked his hazy eyes and twitched his fingers. Yesterday, he got scolded for getting out of bed. They said the unknown wires connected to his body were keeping him alive. That he mustn't pull them out. The people in white grumbled as they tethered him to the wires again.\nReally?\nHe blinked his blurry eyes. People had covered his eyes with a thin cloth. They said his eyes shouldn't be stimulated. Not that it made much difference since he couldn't see anyway.\n\"...\"\nA world without J was dull, and time dragged on excruciatingly slowly. He spent most of his days lying in bed. The days when even breathing was hard had passed, and now he could walk a little, but it seemed people thought staying safe was the best option.\nThe only comfort was that he slept regularly. Maybe they were pumping some kind of sedative into him through the wires attached to his body.\nIt was a small relief. At least it forced time to pass.\nIt was boring, yes, but bearable. He had something to hold onto. J had promised, after all. He promised to come back. He had always come and gone sporadically, so a bit of lateness was understandable. Unable to move his body, his thoughts wandered in all directions. Most of the time, they wandered to J.\nOn his good days, J would lift his mask slightly and let him touch his face. J's face was soft. In comparison to the stiff sheets and rough bandages, it was incomparable. Sometimes, out of greed, he would try to stretch his fingers deeper into the mask. When his fingertips brushed the hidden corners of J's eyes, J's eyelashes would tickle his fingers. The faint tremble of his cheeks, as if laughing, was pleasant. \"I can't show you my eyes. No way.\" That gently reprimanding voice was good, too. Not that he could see them anyway.\nSometimes, J would stroke his head. He would touch his marred skin without hesitation. For areas like his arms, J would even wrap them in bandages himself. Doesn't it disgust him? He must have a strong stomach.\nJ's hands always smelled of soap. Sometimes, they were even slightly damp. Isn't a hunter supposed to be someone who kills monsters? The constant pleasant smell made him curious. Perhaps J always washed up cleanly before coming to the hospital.\nThe last time J held him, there was a faint but bitter smell. Did he smoke? The more he thought about J, the more questions piled up like mountains. There were so many things he wanted to ask. He practiced speaking under his blanket. Most of the time, only hoarse, winded sounds came out.\nWhat's your name? Where do you live? How old are you? What do you like? What do you hate? What do you do? Do you smoke? Do you wash your hands before coming to the hospital?\nWhen will you come again?\nOne day, with no one to ask these questions, they just kept piling up. He wasn't sure when it started. After all, he couldn't know the seasons or the dates. But anyway, the number of visits from the people who used to come every day decreased. Now they only come twice a day to attach an IV drip for nourishment in place of meals. The wires connected to his body had lessened, and even when he sneakily got up and wandered around the hospital room, no one seemed to notice.\nBy the time the IV drip was almost empty, he pulled the needle out himself. He wiped away the blood with a bandage.\nHis thin legs touched the cold floor. He felt a little dizzy, but it was bearable. He rubbed his foot against the cold floor for no particular reason. At that moment, faint voices could be heard from outside. He carefully approached the door. Pressing his ear against it, he listened.\n\"...We're not getting supplies. No matter how much we try...\"\n\"But the detoxification process is almost finished anyway. The needles aren't even melting anymore...\"\nThey must be talking about him. He listened more intently.\n\"This all started because J funded everything. He provided all the money and materials, so it was possible.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But now that J isn't around, the support has completely stopped. We still have a flood of patients. We don't have the money or time to spare on that kid, Doctor.\"\n\"But we can't just give up on the child. He's recovering well. We just need to wait until J returns...\"\n\"...Haven't you heard the rumors?\"\nThe already small voice grew even smaller. He pressed himself even harder against the door, frowning.\n\"They say the rift entrance completely disappeared after J and the hunters went in. It didn't close. It vanished.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I have friends in government agencies, Doctor. They're already preparing.\"\n\"But the child is recovering well. We can't just give up. I'll even use my own money if I have to...\"\n\"You know that has its limits. Medicines made from monster byproducts are incredibly expensive.\"\n\"Then how about this?\"\nSomeone interrupted. It was a lively female voice. He recognized it— the same person who would hum strange tunes while connecting the IV drips in his room.\nThe woman, who suddenly joined the conversation, spoke up.\n\"I'm moving to a new team. Hehe, I was going to tell you later. Anyway, the place I'm going to has a lot of money... I think they can take care of one kid like him.\"\n\"What? Ga-young-ssi, but...\"\n\"I know! But keeping him here won't create any new solutions, will it? I've grown attached to the kid, too. I want to see him walk healthily one day.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't you all feel the same?\"\nA silence followed. The lively voice continued.\n\"I'll tell the director myself. Don't worry too much. There are people far more capable than me there. I'll even give you regular updates on how he's doing.\"\n\"...Are you sure this is okay?\"\n\"Of course. Don't worry.\"\n\"Shouldn't we tell the kid? He seemed to really like J.\"\n\"I'll handle that, too.\"\nThe voices faded. It seemed the strange woman was about to enter. He wobbled back to his bed and lay down. Pulling the thin blanket over himself, he heard the door open. The sound of footsteps approached and stopped right beside the bed. A cheerful voice spoke.\n\"Hello, you're awake, aren't you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"I assume you heard everything outside. So, how do you feel?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You should start wearing slippers. Your feet got a little dirty~\"\nTsk, he hid his feet under the sheets. Ga-young chuckled softly and bent down.\n\"You miss J, don't you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"But, hmm... J can't come back.\"\n\"...\"\nI know that. Of course, I do. J, who used to visit once a week at the latest, hadn't come in a long time. But still, he had to wait. J promised.\n\"If you come with me, you might be able to see J.\"\nLiar.\n\"And not just that, you might be able to go rescue J yourself.\"\n...\nThe grip on the sheets loosened a bit. Ga-young whispered.\n\"So, how about it? Do you want to come with me?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh~ You can't speak, so I can't hear your answer. What did J do? If you want to go, just nod your head.\"\nHis black hair scattered on the pillow. Ga-young smiled.\n\"Good, you're a good kid.\"\nHer cold hand touched his marred cheek. She smelled like medicine. It made him uncomfortable. But he endured it. If it meant he could wait for J. If it meant he could see him again.\nIf it meant he could go and rescue J.\nA small desire sprouted. Ga-young wasn't one to let such desires slip away. He removed the cloth covering his eyes. In his blurry vision, he saw red lips. Lips that curled up as if smiling.\n\"That's right. Good boy.\"\n***\n\"Doesn't it look familiar?\"\n\"...\"\nGa-young casually patted its head with her gloved hand. Then, she frowned slightly and shook off the black liquid that had stained her gloves. He mustn't show emotions. He mustn't...\n\"What is that?\"\nA voice, tight with clenched teeth, escaped. Ga-young smiled brightly.\n\"What do you think it is? Doesn't it look a bit familiar?\"\nThe skin visible beneath the black cloth was distorted and mangled. Just like the boy's skin beneath the bandages. And the black liquid seeping from various parts of its body— it was melting the asphalt. Likely toxic. Cha Eui-jae remained silent. Perhaps he didn't want to admit what he already suspected.\n\"...\"\n\"It's a cute friend. It listens well~ and fights even better.\"\n\"Is this part of the Samra Guild?\"\n\"Oh, Samra Guild?\"\nGa-young lifted the ID badge hanging around her neck, glanced at it, and shrugged.\n\"The Guild Leader was impressed with my abilities.\"\n\"Does Song Jo-heon know about this?\"\n\"Hmm, who knows?\"\nGa-young looked up at the sky as if she were deep in thought, then smiled sweetly.\n\"He probably doesn't know. Most likely.\"\n\"...\"\n\"To be honest... none of us expected the end to come this suddenly~ It caught us off guard too.\"\n\"You didn't know what you were doing when you caused this?\"\n\"The original plan was to take advantage of the hunters being away and, you know, try to shift perceptions a little~\"\nScreams could be heard from all around. Cha Eui-jae's hand trembled. He knew. He had to take her down quickly and then go save others. But he couldn't move his feet. His gaze kept drifting to the large, hunched human-like figure in front of her. Cha Eui-jae bit down on his lip.\n\"You did this for that kind of reason? Can't you see? How many people are dying right now?\"\n\"Should we not do it? Are we supposed to just sit around and twiddle our thumbs, waiting for those almighty hunters to save us? Stay back and endure this endless fear, not knowing when it will end?\"\nGa-young's eyes gleamed sharply.",

Now, we're trying to do something about it, and you have a problem with that? Are we supposed to just sit around, waiting for the awakened to save us? Always putting them first?\"\nSomething about her words felt off. Wasn't she speaking as if she wasn't one of the awakened herself? And she knew about the two world-ending events. Cha Eui-jae frowned. Ga-young crossed her arms and shook her head.\n\"Well, at least I'm a bit regretful~ Didn't expect things to happen so soon... If I had known, I would've made them taste the terror of the end first before letting them out.\"\nAn unsettling phrase. Terror of the end. Cha Eui-jae only understood it after hearing it from Kkokko. But Ga-young was accepting it as if it were completely natural. She was accepting everything. Ga-young tilted her head, looking puzzled.\n\"Huh? J, didn't you survive it too? The way you're moving around so casually.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ah, right... It's because you're a traitor to the world, isn't it? Impressive. Always ahead of the rest.\"\nGa-young twisted her lips into a grin. Her smile was filled with dark malice. People being swallowed whole by gigantic monsters, a man drenched in blood, wailing in despair— it made Cha Eui-jae feel suffocated. Were they also dragged into this against their will? Or brainwashed into walking into their deaths? Ga-young showed no sign of guilt, standing atop their blood.\n\"What's your goal?\"\n\"My goal?\"\nGa-young pulled off the ID card hanging around her neck and threw it away. Splat... The ID fell into the black liquid and dissolved without a trace. Screams echoed from all directions. Cha Eui-jae tightened his grip on his spear.\n\"Don't you already know? To stop the end of the world with human power! No more leaving it to the awakened, who've already failed twice.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And to stop the end of the world...\"\nGa-young looked up at the sky with an ecstatic expression. Cha Eui-jae followed her gaze. Monsters were pouring endlessly from a bright white hole. Ga-young let out a sharp laugh.\n\"...The end has to come first.\"\n\"From the way you talk, you're not an awakened, are you?\"\n\"Hm? That's right, I'm not an awakened.\"\n\"But the hospital director...\"\n\"Oh? Oh, that. Haha.\"\nGa-young raised her index finger and smiled brightly.\n\"That was when the Awakened registration system still had loopholes. It was pretty easy to manipulate. I didn't even meet the director during the interview. He's a very busy man!\"\nEvery time her cheerful voice rang out, Cha Eui-jae's anger simmered. He couldn't let his emotions control him. He took a deep breath, even his polite tone slipping away. He stepped forward.\n\"...You targeted him from the start, didn't you?\"\n\"No way~. At first, I didn't even know he existed. He was hidden so well. Though, I did go in expecting to find something useful.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And in the end, it was the best decision I ever made. Right, my little darling?\"\nWhen Ga-young asked sweetly, the human— her \"darling\" —who was kneeling beside her, nodded slowly. But could you even call that a human? Its mangled skin resembled what Lee Sa-young used to be, its stiff movements mimicking those of mutated creatures. Cha Eui-jae couldn't look away, recognizing instinctively that it must have been made based on Lee Sa-young's data. And...\nIf Lee Sa-young had been unlucky, he might have ended up like that.\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae clenched his teeth hard enough to make a sound. Ga-young smiled at him.\n\"This is my masterpiece. The strongest and most obedient thing I've ever created. But...\"\nShe sighed dramatically, circling around the kneeling figure.\n\"If I'd had him, it wouldn't be such a mess of patches. That's the only thing I regret~. If I had conducted a few more experiments, I might've found a way to restore that shredded skin.\"\nAt the same time, a strong hand suddenly grabbed Ga-young's throat. She gasped, her face contorting as she raised her palm toward the human. The creature, which had been poised to leap at Cha Eui-jae, knelt again. Her feet were now dangling above the ground. Ga-young struggled to smile despite the tightening grip.\n\"Oh... c-civilians... aren't you not supposed to... attack them?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Lots of eyes... o-on you.\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nCha Eui-jae's face drew closer, his voice a monotone, devoid of any emotion.\n\"I'm holding back, so just shut up.\"\n\"...\"\n\"If I could follow my instincts...\"\nHis hand tightened, and Ga-young's face paled.\n\"I would have killed you already.\"\nSuddenly, Cha Eui-jae let go, and Ga-young stumbled, clutching her throat as she gasped for breath. After several moments of wheezing, she lifted her head, glaring at Cha Eui-jae with bloodshot eyes. Her raspy voice spat venom.\n\"Why don't you just kill me then? Oh, wait... Can't bring yourself to kill anyone, can you?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hypocrite. You rely on your power and settle for weak threats!\"\nIgnoring her, Cha Eui-jae checked his phone again. Still no reply from Lee Sa-young. Did he lose consciousness again? His mind was a whirl of worries— Ga-young's words, concern for Lee Sa-young, the monsters endlessly raining down from the sky, all tangled together. He bit down on his tongue hard. The taste of blood brought him back to focus.\n'I need to take this woman somewhere. To the Awakened Management Bureau, or the Pado Guild... Maybe I should ask Hong Ye-seong. No... even the fish market could work.'\nThere was much to learn from Ga-young, not just about Lee Sa-young, but about Prometheus as well. Cha Eui-jae scrolled through his other phone quickly. Meanwhile, Ga-young staggered toward her creation. She murmured to herself.\n\"He was so useful to me.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae's fingers paused on the screen. Ga-young stared blankly into space, as if reminiscing.\n\"He didn't scream or struggle like the others. He endured the pain so well.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Do you know? He followed me on her own.\"\nGa-young laughed, her shoulders shaking. Lies. That's impossible. Lee Sa-young had promised to wait for him. He had waited all this time. Cha Eui-jae said nothing, refusing to acknowledge her words. But he couldn't block out the unsettling feeling she stirred in him.\n\"You know, J... You were active back then, so you remember, right? When civilians got caught up in a rift and lost limbs or were on the verge of death, do you know what happened to them?\"\nMost of them didn't survive, unable to receive proper treatment. Even after the Awakened Management Bureau was established, the medical system never fully recovered. There were too many casualties and too few medical staff. They prioritized treating the awakened who could fight against monsters.\n\"So, what do you think happened to him, with you gone?\"\n\"...\"\nA chill ran down Cha Eui-jae's spine, like someone had poured cold water on the boiling anger in his chest.\nTreating a dying boy like Lee Sa-young required vast amounts of money and rare materials. When Cha Eui-jae wasn't on call, he endlessly cleared dungeons that contained poison monsters to collect antidote ingredients. He paid enormous sums to the hospital in the name of charitable donations for society.\nThat kind of luxury was only possible for someone like J.\nIf J disappeared...\nCrack... The phone screen in Cha Eui-jae's hand cracked. Ga-young chuckled.\n\"If I hadn't taken him, he would've slowly died. Without any treatment...\"\n\"...\"\n\"For two months, he was fine. People still believed you'd come back by then. The resources and money you left behind were enough. But in the third month, everything ran dry.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's when I realized how important you were. The world started to break down just because you were gone. There was a shortage of manpower, more injuries, more awakened getting hurt, more resources being used to treat them, and civilians were left behind...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Isn't it ridiculous? Everything falls apart just because one person's gone.\"\nGa-young shuddered as she laughed. She adjusted her crooked glasses.\n\"Even in the hospital, they couldn't keep taking care of a kid for free, no matter how much you entrusted him. The staff was too stretched thin. And it wasn't like he was an awakened, just a dying civilian kid. So fewer people cared for him, until only the bare minimum was done.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So I took him with me. And I asked him directly.\"\nCha Eui-jae silently stared at Ga-young. She mouthed the next words slowly.\n\"Would you come with me to find J?\"",

What do you say?\"\nShut up.\n\"Oh, don't look at me like that~ It was all their choice, you know.\"\nShut up.\n\"I just helped them a little. They would've withered away there otherwise. Though I did gain something from the whole process. Let's call it mutual benefit?\"\nShut up!\n\"It would've been nice if they were still alive... I would've let them reunite with J.\"\n...What?\nFor a moment, my body lost all its strength. Ga-young murmured as if she felt sorry, and then looked at J. She clasped her hands and smiled brightly.\n\"Oh, there was an accident at the lab they were in... So, everyone died? The researchers, the test subjects... Although some data remains.\"\n'Does she not know that Lee Sa-young is that kid?'\nCould that be possible? My mind raced. Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo, who received intel and went to the lab, rescued Lee Sa-young, who melted the lab and escaped... Could Ga-young really not know? Or is what I know different from the truth?\nCha Eui-jae asked nonchalantly.\n\"...What kind of accident was it?\"\n\"Hmm, I heard it was an explosion~ I was lucky to be at another location. The Awakened Management Bureau guarded the place so tightly that I couldn't get a closer look...\"\n\"...\"\n\"If it weren't for that, I would've shown you. Too bad, really. But~ this kind friend of mine here was created based on their data.\"\nIt slowly turned its head and stared at Cha Eui-jae. Black poison dripped down beneath the filter. Its grotesquely distorted and mangled skin was probably due to the effects of the poison. Lee Sa-young had been the same.\nWas this person someone's family? Wouldn't someone be desperately searching for him? But there was no will or self in its blurry eyes. It only remembered how to obey and fight...\n\"Aren't you happy? You're looking at the gift they left behind.\"\n\"...\"\nGa-young continued to provoke Cha Eui-jae, gently pressing his most vulnerable spot, hoping he would burst with anger, expecting a more violent reaction. If he hadn't met Lee Sa-young, he might've fallen for her honeyed words. Lee Sa-young was Cha Eui-jae's reverse scale, after all.\nBut...\nEui-jae glanced around. It was a good thing he had learned where the cameras were positioned when they were at the hangover soup restaurant. Cameras were now aimed at him from all directions.\n'Good thing I didn't attack outright.'\nWell, except for grabbing her by the collar.\n'I've still got a lot to learn...'\nWithout replying, Cha Eui-jae took a step back. Then, he placed his spear horizontally over his shoulders and asked.\n\"What did you call that kid?\"\n\"...Huh? What did I call them?\"\nGa-young smirked.\n\"You're not expecting some cute name or nickname, are you?\"\n\"...\"\nGa-young stepped back with a bored expression. She raised both hands as if to say she was disappointed and answered.\n\"I called them No. 4. Because they were the fourth experiment... No, the fourth person I brought in.\"\n\"...\"\nNumber 4.\nNumber 4. Cha Eui-jae mulled over the name 'Number 4.' He thought of Lee Sa-young, who must've responded to that name, given to them without their consent. A strange ache stirred in his chest. Ga-young, who had been glancing around, spoke again.\n\"You're holding back better than I expected. I'm impressed.\"\n\"Did you want me to kill you?\"\n\"I was hoping you'd come at me~ ...a little more violently than just grabbing my collar.\"\nGa-young smiled as she tidied up her rumpled collar.\n\"But I've already accomplished my goal~\"\n\"What's your goal?\"\n\"Talking with J. Having a deep conversation.\"\nAs Cha Eui-jae tensed his muscles to grab Ga-young, the creature beside her also prepared to move. The amount of poison dripping from it increased. It placed its hands on the asphalt, and where it touched, the ground melted in the shape of its hand. A grating sound, like someone scratching their throat, echoed.\n\"...\"\nIf he rushed in, the whole area would be devastated. With poison. Cha Eui-jae frowned and glanced around. Being on the main street, there were many civilians who had taken refuge in nearby buildings...\n\"Hehe, it was so nice to see you after such a long time. We'll meet again, for sure~\"\nGa-young snapped her fingers. The creature grabbed her with one arm, leaped, and disappeared from sight. All that remained was the deeply gouged asphalt and the black puddle marking its presence.\n'...I should follow them.'\nThey would likely return to their base. Cha Eui-jae let out a short sigh, then prepared to leap after them. At that moment—\n\"Oh? It's J!\"\nRed hair lightly landed in front of him. It was Kang Ji-soo. Her hair was disheveled, and her clothes were splattered with blood, indicating she had been through a battle. She roughly wiped the blood off her face with her sleeve. For once, he was glad to see her. He needed a distraction from his thoughts. Adjusting his mask from his awkward posture, Cha Eui-jae asked.\n\"Did you just finish a fight?\"\n\"Yeah, something like that. I just threw down the Vice-Guild Leader after sorting out the mess they caused.\"\n\"A mess?\"\n\"Yeah, he started shaking, then collapsed onto the steering wheel... But while driving.\"\nKang Ji-soo bumped her fists together. It seemed there had been an accident. In the previous world, Bae Won-woo had lost one arm... His face darkened behind the mask. It seemed Bae Won-woo hadn't fully recovered from the shock of the apocalypse either.\n\"Is Bae Won-woo okay? Any other injuries?\"\n\"Luckily, no~ I passed out for a bit too, but I woke up before the Vice-Guild Leader.\"\n\"...That's good.\"\n\"Anyway, some weird things fell from the sky, so I evacuated the civilians and the Vice-Guild Leader before coming here. Weren't you at the conference?\"\n\"Yes, but everyone else... passed out. I thought I'd try to handle the situation myself.\"\n\"Oh, that's a relief. But there's probably not much left to handle.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Monsters that devour humans were falling from the sky, and there was nothing to handle? Kang Ji-soo started to untangle her messy hair with her fingers, looking annoyed.\n\"No, some weird guys showed up and started dealing with the monsters.\"\n\"...\"\n\"They move like zombies, but they fight well. They told me to get out of the way and let them handle it. People are even clapping for them, saying they're doing a great job. Ridiculous.\"\nKang Ji-soo snorted and shoved her hands into her hoodie pockets. A bad feeling crept over him.\n\"Talking with J. Having a deep conversation.\"\n\"Kang Ji-soo, what did those guys look like?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, they were just wearing white. But they didn't look like hunters. They said they were some kind of militia... I mean, how can civilians take down monsters? Even when I tried to help, they just kept telling me to go away, go away.\"\nKang Ji-soo pouted in frustration. Cha Eui-jae ran a rough hand through his hair. His ash-gray hair, which could almost look white in certain lights, was now a tangled mess.\n'They were just buying time...'\nHow could he not notice such a simple scheme? His emotions must have been really shaken. Staring down at his broken phone, he turned to Kang Ji-soo, who was still grumbling, and said,\n\"Could you call your Guild Leader for me?\"\n***\n\"Wa~ke~up.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm telling you, this is really urgent. Come on, wake up. Huh? Not waking up? This is unavoidable. If you complain about it later, you're petty.\"\nSlap! A hand sharply tapped against a pale cheek. However, the person whose cheek was hit showed no sign of getting up, though the cheek turned red. Slap slap slap slap. Despite repeated slaps, the result was the same. Hong Ye-seong scratched his head in frustration after pulling back his hand.\n\"Aww... this is troublesome. Why isn't he waking up? Lee Sa-young, where did you go?\"\nHe was crouched in front of Lee Sa-young, who was lying flat on the ground, completely still. Only the slow rise and fall of his chest indicated that he was alive. Hong Ye-seong, now sitting cross-legged, glanced over as Jung Bin approached, holding a phone with a troubled expression.\n\"This time, it's a call from Kang Ji-soo. Should I answer it?\"\n\"Ah, can't I just imitate his voice?\"\n\"Would that really work? Why not just answer it?\"\n\"No way, no way! It's terrifying to respond to J.\"\nJung Bin's gaze turned unusually cold. The Round Table conference room, once bustling, had quieted down since most people had run out as soon as they regained consciousness and checked their messages. Song Jo-heon had rushed out with a face like he'd seen a ghost, and Ham Seok-jeong, limping heavily, went out to oversee the situation.\nAs a result, the only ones left here were...\n\"Lee~ Sa~ Young!\"\nAn artisan who was utterly useless in combat.\n\"Calling him like that won't make him wake up. There must be another issue.\"\nJung Bin, who was also powerless against monsters, was there because his main task was to guard Hong Ye-seong, with Ham Seok-jeong in charge of overall command. And,\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young, lying fast asleep.\n\"But, why haven't you left yet, Gyu-Gyu?\"\n\"Hmm? Well...\"\nClick, click, click. A series of quick clicks echoed as Gyu-Gyu swiftly completed a Rubik's cube, then smiled and placed it on the table with a tap.\n\"Because this place seems like it's going to be more fun than outside~?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Go ahead and do your thing, I'll go out on my own when I'm done relaxing~\"\nGyu-Gyu started humming a little tune.",

      "content": "Chapter 217 - End\nJung Bin stared at Gyu-Gyu with a lukewarm gaze.\n\"Aren't you supposed to be out there helping to rescue people, Gyu-Gyu-ssi? The director will check on you.\"\n\"Well, was I ever really needed~? I'm a freelancer, so I'm a free spirit.\"\n\"Didn't you used to hang around with Honeybee-ssi?\"\n\"Oh... you know about that too?\"\nGyu-Gyu tilted his head lazily and smiled, resting his chin on one hand.\n\"That was then, this is now. If you want me to get involved in this situation, you'll have to pay me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You already have other people taking care of the situation, don't you~? Why would I go out there and work up a sweat for no reason... It's not like I have a guild to look after like the others. Watching the artisan slapping Lee Sa-young is far more entertaining.\"\nGyu-Gyu started inspecting his fingernails as if nothing was happening. Jung Bin stepped forward with firm strides and stood in front of Gyu-Gyu. Then, he slammed his palm on the table.\nBang!\nThe table trembled. Jung Bin bent down to meet Gyu-Gyu's gaze and asked,\n\"How much?\"\n\"...\"\n\"How much will it cost for you to go out and save people?\"\n\"...Can your civil servant salary even cover it?\"\n\"Let's hear it.\"\nGyu-Gyu stretched out his arms across the table and started whining.\n\"Ah~ I came here because they said I could meet J, but I couldn't even get a proper word in. J just disappeared somewhere. I'm depressed. And the civil servant is pulling scams.\"\n\"Well, you met him anyway. Just name your price.\"\n\"My price?\"\nGyu-Gyu rolled his light-colored eyes and then grinned.\n\"Let me meet J one-on-one.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Look at that, I'm being considerate of your wallet with this condition. How much do you earn a year?\"\n\"That's confidential.\"\n\"What level of civil servant are you now? My father's church has a lot of high-ranking civil servants.\"\n\"That's confidential too.\"\n\"Ah~ so boring.\"\n\"Heh.\"\nJust then, a snicker was heard nearby. Both Gyu-Gyu and Jung Bin immediately turned their heads toward the source of the sound. Sitting cross-legged next to Lee Sa-young, Hong Ye-seong was chuckling intermittently with little \"heh\" sounds. What's that? As the two stared in confusion, Hong Ye-seong didn't even bother hiding his smirk and sneered. Gyu-Gyu raised an eyebrow.\n\"What? Artisan?\"\n\"I just find it funny, how you're so hung up over a mere fan meeting.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm super close to J, you know? If there's ever a problem, they come to me first. They even came to visit me in the deep mountains.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm J's pillar of support, you could say. Hm? I'm like a master key, or like Doraemon.\"\n\"...\"\nFor once, Gyu-Gyu's expressionless face turned to Jung Bin, shaking his head. Jung Bin also nodded. It was a gesture filled with deep meaning and, in essence, a thorough disregard. Hong Ye-seong, his fist raised high, burst out in anger.\n\"You don't believe me, do you! Hey!\"\nSo he didn't notice.\nLee Sa-young's eyelids were trembling.\n***\nKang Ji-soo lowered her phone and shook her head.\n\"Not answering.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But you know, it's strange when our Guild Leader actually answers the phone on time. He always ignores my calls. And he ignores the Vice-Guild Leader's calls too.\"\nHe always answered my calls. And if he couldn't reach me even for a moment, he'd call like a madman. Cha Eui-jae fidgeted with his cracked phone. Kang Ji-soo stretched nonchalantly.\n\"He'll call when he feels like it. So don't worry too much.\"\n\"...\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't respond.\n\"Are you worried? That he might have fainted again?\"\n\"...When I saw him before leaving... um, he didn't look in great shape.\"\n\"But the Vice-Guild Leader even caused an accident, didn't he? He'll recover soon. I passed out and woke up quickly too.\"\nKang Ji-soo clumsily patted Cha Eui-jae on the back. Was his concern really that obvious? Cha Eui-jae rubbed the back of his neck with his hand, feeling awkward. Just then, Kang Ji-soo checked her phone again. She stepped a few steps away, pretending to answer a call. Unfortunately— or fortunately— Cha Eui-jae could hear every word of the conversation.\n\"...Yeah, yeah. What? So what should we do? Just wait?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ugh, stop saying such nonsense. Then what about them?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...The director said not to approach them at all? Why? Because we look like a threat? What does that even...\"\nAfter a while, Kang Ji-soo returned, puffing in frustration. Her face was now sulky. Before Cha Eui-jae could even ask, she pointed her chin toward the distance.\n\"Orders came down from the higher-ups. Those people in the white tents have popped up all over the place, and hunters are being told not to approach them.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I don't know, but it looks like they're the same group that was protesting and fighting monsters earlier... They're treating the injured, calming people down, doing some kind of relief work.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But if hunters get close, they make a huge fuss. Saying it's the hunters' fault that people got hurt because we were too late or something...\"\nCha Eui-jae frowned. The same people who brought about the apocalypse were now putting all the blame on the hunters?\n\"Talking with J. Having a deep conversation.\"\nWas this why Ga-young had kept him here?\n\"People don't know what's real or fake anymore. And hunters did lose their minds and react too slowly...\"\nKang Ji-soo scratched her head in frustration.\n\"Anyway, that's how it is. You be careful too.\"\n\"Thanks for letting me know... What will you do now?\"\n\"Mm, I'm going to check on the people at the shelter where the Vice-Guild Leader is... Then I'll take him and head back to the Pado Guild. We've got to clean up this mess.\"\nCha Eui-jae took a step back.\n\"Then I'll head off.\"\n\"Huh? You're not coming with me? Where are you going?\"\nCha Eui-jae fiddled with the black mask covering his face. Its smooth texture still felt unfamiliar. He glanced in the direction Jisoo had pointed earlier.\n\"I'm going to see what those people are up to, up close.\"\n\"How? They told hunters to stay away.\"\n\"I have my ways. Don't worry.\"\nThis young man, Cha Eui-jae. Former part-time worker at a hangover soup restaurant.\nHe had some confidence in his acting skills.\n***\nTap. Worn sneakers stepped onto the cracked sidewalk. Faded jeans, a gray hoodie, slightly damp black hair, and a black ball cap. Under the brim of his cap, Cha Eui-jae glanced around before quickening his pace.\nAfter parting ways with Kang Ji-soo, Cha Eui-jae had visited the hangover soup restaurant for the first time in a while. Other than a light layer of dust, nothing had changed. The old tables, the chairs, the hunters' signed pictures on the wall, Honeybee's poster, and even the glowing magic stone at the center of the automatic side dish machine were all the same.\nWould he ever be able to reopen the restaurant?\nCha Eui-jae looked around the place with a hint of longing. But there wasn't time to dwell on this. He entered a small room and rummaged through a pile of gifts he had carefully set aside. Finally, he found what he was looking for.\n[Change your Color! Kraken Ink Black]\nIt was the hair dye Honeybee had given him as a gift.\nCha Eui-jae looked at his reflection in the mirror. Even if he took off the mask, walking around with his ash-colored hair might draw attention. He could claim he dyed it this way because he was a J fan, but...\n\"Better to minimize any risks.\"\nThere was no way the Prometheus group would welcome J's fans. And it wasn't like he could get a wig in this situation.\n\"I'll just have to dye it.\"\nResolutely, Cha Eui-jae tore open the packaging of the hair dye.\nNow, back to the present.\nThe streets were quiet. Everyone had likely evacuated to shelters or taken refuge inside buildings. Strangely, instead of hunters, people in white clothing were walking around. They were busy, either stabbing their knives into monsters that were already dead or moving large boxes.\nAre they all from Prometheus?\nJust then, two people dressed in white approached Cha Eui-jae.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"You look like a civilian... Did you fail to evacuate?\"\nHere's my chance.\nCha Eui-jae lowered his head and trembled slightly.\n\"Y-Yes... I was just coming back from the convenience store, and outside it's like this...\"\n\"Oh, my. I see. Would you like to come with us? There's a place to rest in one of the tents over there.\"\n\"Oh, then maybe I could impose for a moment...\"\n\"Wait a moment!\"\nBeeeep— A loud whistle blew, piercing the air. The men in white hurriedly fled from Cha Eui-jae's side in a panic. What? If they'd stayed still, he could've infiltrated easily. Cha Eui-jae frowned and raised his head. And then—\n\"...Oh my gosh, part-timer?\"\nCha Eui-jae's eyes widened. Part-timer. It was a title he hadn't heard in a long time. Instinctively, his body turned toward the voice, as if by habit.\n'Shit.'\nA woman stood there, staring at Cha Eui-jae in shock, as if she'd seen a ghost.\nWearing a bright neon green vest that was hard to miss even from afar, the woman was a regular at the hangover soup restaurant and a Rift Management Bureau civil servant— Hunter Yang Hye-jin.",

      "content": "Chapter 218 - End\nOh, shit. Cha Eui-jae quickly pulled his cap down deeper. Of all places, why did they have to run into each other here? Ignoring his panic, Yang Hye-jin strode forward and firmly grabbed Cha Eui-jae by the arm.\n\"Part-timer, you're the part-timer, right? The one who worked at that hangover soup restaurant in the alley. Am I right? You're the part-timer, aren't you?\"\n\"Uh...\"\nThe acting skills he had meticulously honed completely failed him in this sudden crisis. A hundred different scenarios flashed through his mind like a panorama. Greet her warmly? She'd probably accuse him of laughing in this situation. Pretend not to recognize her? She'd accuse him of ignoring her. Pretend he lost his memory? Would that even work?\n\"Oh my gosh... you really are the part-timer.\"\nBy now, Yang Hye-jin had already sized him up from head to toe, mumbling in disbelief. Unfortunately, he was wearing his hangover soup restaurant uniform, so denying it seemed pointless. Cha Eui-jae held up his hands, trying to calm her down. But Yang Hye-jin, far from calming down, glared at him.\n\"Hey, where the heck have you been all this time? Do you know how worried we were?\"\n\"W-what?\"\n\"You suddenly closed up the restaurant and disappeared! Do you have any idea how many people thought you were kidnapped and went looking for you?\"\nBut I posted a sign in front of the restaurant...\n\"Of all times, there've been a lot of hunter kidnappings recently! And you disappeared right when all of that was happening? You made everyone worry!\"\nKidnapped?\n\"We even searched dungeons, thinking you'd been taken as a laborer!\"\nA laborer?\n\"We even made a group chat! A 'Find the Part-Timer' chat. You know, we've got an all-star lineup in there. Hunters who normally don't even bother to answer texts were all in it.\"\nA group chaaaat?\n\"If your grandmother hadn't told us to stop searching, we'd still be looking for you. Man... I need to update the chat again. Oh my gosh...\"\nWith a groan, Yang Hye-jin massaged her forehead and hurriedly pulled out her phone. Cha Eui-jae, who felt like he had been hit by a sudden storm, wanted to smack his own forehead.\n'What the hell were these people doing...?'\nHe had only disappeared as a part-timer for a little while. Meanwhile, while his regulars were busy looking for him, Cha Eui-jae had been out drawing all the attention to cover up Lee Sa-young's absence...\n'...'\nYet, strangely, his heart felt warm. Like when he held a piping hot stew bowl. After frantically typing out messages, Yang Hye-jin sighed and put her phone away, twirling her signal baton absentmindedly.\n\"At least you look healthy. That's a relief. What have you been doing all this time?\"\n\"I, I had some work to take care of.\"\n\"Well, I guess there's always work in a world like this. I won't pry into what it was. But is your work finished now?\"\n\"Uh... not yet.\"\n\"Hah... so that's why you're wandering around in such a dangerous place? Are you affiliated with a guild? Are you out here gathering information? Who's the head of your guild?\"\nAt the mention of \"head,\" a certain face popped into Cha Eui-jae's mind— Lee Sa-young, smirking smugly. Well, technically, he was working with Pado Guild, so... he rolled his eyes, trying not to laugh. Unfortunately, Yang Hye-jin must have taken it as confirmation. Her face flushed with anger.\n\"This is unacceptable! They're sending a D-grade hunter out here all alone? What's your Guild Leader's name? If it's hard to say, just give me the initials. Is this some black-market guild?\"\nSuddenly, Pado Guild had become a black-market guild. Seeing Yang Hye-jin ready to launch into another tirade, Cha Eui-jae quickly jumped in first.\n\"Oh, it's nothing like that. Don't worry. By the way, who were those people? The ones you chased away earlier?\"\n\"Who? Oh, those guys in white?\"\nYang Hye-jin stepped closer, lowering her voice conspiratorially.\n\"They're nuts. Stay away from them.\"\nIt was a sharp assessment. Interesting. Cha Eui-jae leaned in, listening intently. Yang Hye-jin, who apparently had a lot to get off her chest, continued quickly.\n\"They pretend to be some kind of charitable or relief organization, helping people and whatnot, but... they're a cult.\"\n\"A cult?\"\n\"Yeah. Didn't you notice how they had tents set up, just waiting for something like this? It's obvious they're up to no good. Seriously, don't go near them. And they're extremely hostile toward hunters.\"\n\"Why are they hostile to hunters?\"\n\"I have no idea! When some of our people tried to ask them a few questions, their whole demeanor changed, and they were practically throwing us out. They looked at us like we were trash.\"\n\"So, should I go ask them?\"\n\"Huh? You? But I told you, they're hostile to hunters. And you're a hunter, too.\"\n\"Do I look like a hunter?\"\nBaggy gray hoodie, worn-out jeans, dusty sneakers with worn soles, and a deeply pulled-down black ball cap. His face and physique were sharp, but his outfit was loose and casual. As far as hunters go, they were usually decked out in flashy, high-end gear. Yang Hye-jin seriously looked him up and down.\n\"Can I be honest?\"\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"You look like an unemployed guy on his way to buy beer from the convenience store.\"\n\"...\"\n\"That's a compliment, by the way.\"\nYang Hye-jin patted Cha Eui-jae on the shoulder and whispered.\n\"Part-timer, are you good at acting?\"\n\"I'm good enough to debut as an actor.\"\n\"Where's this confidence coming from? Are you signed with an agency, prepping for a celebrity debut? ...Then can you approach those guys and figure out what they're up to, why they're doing this, if it's related to the monsters falling from the sky, and what their goal is?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Do you have a phone?\"\n\"No, it broke.\"\n\"Ah... it's hard to get a new phone right now. Hold on a sec.\"\nYang Hye-jin rummaged in her pocket and pulled out something that looked like a smartwatch. A square screen instead of a clock face. She tapped it a few times.\n\"This is a watch we use. Less noticeable than an earpiece, and it looks ordinary. Functions like a regular smartwatch. You can't surf the web or anything since it's for official use, but it can track your location and send messages and make calls. Take it.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nCha Eui-jae put on the smartwatch and fiddled with it. He soon found a glaring issue.\n\"...The background screen...\"\nIt was emblazoned with the Rift Management Bureau's logo. A smartwatch that practically screamed, \"I'm with the government.\"\nYang Hye-jin awkwardly cleared her throat.\n\"Ahem, it's a government-issued watch. Just... change it to the default screen.\"\n\"...Got it.\"\n\"Anyway, be careful. Don't get too deep. It's fine if you don't get any information. If it seems dangerous, just get out. Your safety comes first, understand?\"\n\"Of course. Don't worry.\"\nCha Eui-jae smiled and whispered.\n\"Can I ask you for one favor?\"\n\"Hm? Sure, what is it?\"\n\"Could you get mad at me?\"\n***\nBeneath a large white tent, the kind you'd see at a sports festival or a neighborhood gathering, people were bustling around. Those hit by flying debris, people injured by monsters, or others who twist their ankles while running away lay on the white sheets spread on the ground, groaning in pain. Moans and quiet sobs leaked out from various places. People in white clothing moved among the wounded, doing their best to treat them.\nIt was then.\n\"...Get out of here right now!\"\nA sharp woman's voice rang out. People's eyes turned toward the outside of the tent. In the distance, a woman wearing a fluorescent vest was pointing angrily at a man in a gray hoodie. She continued to shout something at him before spinning on her heel and disappearing. Left alone, the man awkwardly rubbed the back of his neck and kicked at the ground before glancing around. A man packing up some supplies clicked his tongue.\n\"That Awakened woman again...\"\n\"Is it a fight between Awakened?\"\n\"No, that guy seems to be a civilian. I was about to bring him over here, but that Awakened woman stopped me. Tsk...\"\n\"Should we try bringing him here now?\"\n\"No need. He's coming on his own.\"\nThe young man in the gray hoodie trudged slowly, his steps heavy, toward the tent. The people in white exchanged glances, then put on friendly smiles. One of them stepped outside the tent to greet him.\n\"Hello. What brings you here?\"\n\"Uh, I was just wondering... Is my sister here by any chance?\"\nThe young man mumbled in a small, almost inaudible voice. The people in white exchanged glances again, wearing sympathetic expressions.\n\"Oh no... Did you lose your sister?\"\n\"Yes... We just stepped outside for a moment, and then... the monsters came. Everyone was running, and... we lost hold of each other.\"\n\"Ah, I see... That must have been tough.\"\nThe man sighed, taking the young man's hand. Despite their apparent strength, the young man's hands were trembling badly. The man spoke gently.\n\"Could you describe your sister for us? Or, would you prefer to come inside and take a look? There's a bit of blood around, so if it's too much, you don't have to.\"\n\"Can I... really look for her myself? My sister is a high schooler, wears glasses...\"\n\"Of course. Right this way.\"\nThe man took the young man's hand and led him to where the injured lay. The young man followed him closely, glancing around nervously. After a moment, the man glanced back at him and asked.\n\"There was some shouting earlier... Can I ask what happened?\"\n\"Oh, that... It's nothing, really...\"\nThe young man trailed off, lowering his head.\n\"I just asked if that Hunter had seen my sister... She got mad at me for asking something like that when she was busy.\"\n\"Ah, I see.\"\nSo that's how these Awakened people are. Instead of helping others, they only look out for themselves and lash out at civilians. The man frowned slightly but patted the young man's shoulder.\n\"You've been through a lot. Go ahead and take a look.\"\n\"Thank you...\"\nThe young man began walking quickly through the space between the cots, scanning each one. His steps were unusually fast. Is he an Awakened? But he's dressed too poorly for that. And his story seems genuine. After all, I saw the Hunter yelling at him.\nThe young man reached the end of the row of cots and returned with slumped shoulders.\n\"...She's not here. Thank you for letting me look...\"\nPeople who've suffered loss often have gaps in their emotional armor.\nThe man gently took the young man's hand.\n\"My colleagues are stationed in other areas. Would you like us to check with them too?\"\n\"Really? You'd do that?\"\nThe young man's head snapped up. He had a handsome face, hidden beneath his baseball cap. If used properly, he could become a useful asset. The man smiled brightly.\n\"Of course. Why don't you wait here while I contact them?\"\n\"Yes, please. Thank you so much!\"\n\"Ha ha, no problem. Are you hungry? We don't have much, but there's something to take the edge off your hunger.\"\n\"Oh, that's really... too kind.\"\n\"It's nothing. We all have to help each other, right?\"\n\"You're really kind. Thank you so much.\"\n\"Well then, I'll go make some calls. Please have a seat outside on the bench while you wait.\"\n\"Okay!\"\nThe man disappeared outside the tent where the wounded were gathered. The young man adjusted his baseball cap. His eyes, hidden beneath it, glowed a bright, icy blue.",

      "content": "Chapter 219 - End\nThe corners of his lips twitched. But despite his efforts, he couldn't hide the smile creeping up.\n'That was... a pretty good performance, wasn't it?'\nIt was clear that his acting skills had improved quite a bit compared to before. Cha Eui-jae rubbed his chin and straightened his hunched back a little. A sense of pride bubbled up inside him. At this rate, maybe he really could debut as an actor, just as Yang Hye-jin had suggested.\nIn fact, given the world they lived in, it wasn't unusual for hunters to also work as celebrities. There were quite a few who balanced being both a hunter and an actor or model. Actors, in particular, thrived in action roles since they could naturally perform stunts that would take an ordinary person years of training to master. Then there were models, like...\n'Honeybee's been working as both a model and a hunter, right?'\nCha Eui-jae absentmindedly fiddled with his black hair. He could roam around so freely thanks to the hair dye Honeybee had given him.\n'Maybe I should send a gift once this job is over.'\nCha Eui-jae glanced back. Some people were holding their injuries and sobbing, while others stared blankly at the ceiling. One man was writhing in pain, held down by several others. It was a familiar scene. More so than people laughing and a peaceful world.\n\"...\"\nThe smell of disinfectant, blood, and dust mingled in the air, creating a strange odor. Eui-jae closed his eyes. The murmuring faded. Strangely, he felt at ease. It was as if, after a long journey, he had finally returned to where he belonged.\nHe rubbed his thumb across the corner of his mouth, then pulled back the curtain. People in white clothes moved about busily like ants. Though they wore white, the guards by the door were quite large. Their eyes were dull and unfocused. Most likely...\n'Modified hunters... or test subjects?'\nCha Eui-jae inspected their faces. Thankfully, none of them were familiar. Maybe the incident with the Russian bear had been more shocking than he'd realized. A sudden flash of red passed before his eyes, and he swallowed a bitter smile.\nHe could feel the furtive glances of the busy people around him. Cha Eui-jae sat down on a plastic chair. The chair scraped against the asphalt with a grating sound. Almost immediately, someone approached him.\n\"I've been informed. You're looking for your younger sibling, correct?\"\nIt was a woman with clear eyes, perhaps in her 30s. Instead of answering, Cha Eui-jae simply nodded. The woman politely bowed her head and handed him a notepad and pen.\n\"My name is Lee Mi-jin. Could you describe your sibling's appearance in detail? The earlier description you provided was too broad, so we think it might not yield meaningful results.\"\n\"Alright... I understand.\"\nCha Eui-jae gripped the pen and paused in thought. The vague description he'd given earlier was of Yoon Ga-eul. She was someone he actually knew, so he could answer sudden questions without seeming suspicious. And besides...\n'She should be at school by now.'\nAt least, he hoped so. Yoon Ga-eul might be an S-grade, but she wasn't a combat-specialized hunter. Cha Eui-jae began writing down a description of her appearance: Yoon Ga-eul, 19 years old, female, brown hair, round face, glasses, school uniform... Meanwhile, Lee Mi-jin poured a cup of warm water and slid it toward him. After finishing the description, Cha Eui-jae handed her the notepad and cautiously asked.\n\"Would it be okay if I kept the pen? It's just that... my hands feel kind of empty. I'll return it when I leave.\"\n\"Oh my... of course. Feel free to hold on to it.\"\n\"Th-thank you.\"\nLee Mi-jin glanced over the notepad and handed it to someone passing by, nodding. The person who received it hurried away. She then sat down beside Cha Eui-jae.\nCha Eui-jae picked up the paper cup. Steam rose lazily from it. The warmth barely registered in his hands, but...\n'Could be a test.'\nHe made a show of holding the cup by its rim and blowing on it.\n\"It's hot.\"\n\"Warm water is better for calming the mind than cold water.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"No need to thank me. You must have been quite shocked.\"\n\"Yeah, a little...\"\nHe was definitely shocked. It wasn't every day you saw people collectively lose their minds. Cha Eui-jae glanced at Lee Mi-jin and asked.\n\"You don't seem very surprised, though.\"\n\"Do I? Maybe it's because I've been preparing for this for a long time.\"\nLee Mi-jin covered her mouth with her hand and laughed. Cha Eui-jae made his eyes go wide on purpose.\n\"You've been preparing? For what?\"\n\"For this mentally. I might sound crazy saying this, but...\"\nLee Mi-jin gazed off into the distance with a somewhat wistful look on her face.\n\"I've known for a long time that a day like this would come.\"\n\"...\"\n\"By any chance, have you ever recalled memories that felt strange? Like they're your memories, but you don't remember ever doing those things.\"\nCha Eui-jae hesitated, fidgeting with his hands. Lee Mi-jin, as if trying to reassure him, added softly:\n\"Don't worry, I won't think you're strange. I experienced it too.\"\nAt that, Cha Eui-jae slowly nodded. He needed to go along with her if he wanted more information. Stammering slightly, he began speaking.\n\"Well, um, since the Day of Change... it's been happening. I haven't told anyone about it, though...\"\nShe smiled warmly.\n\"Ah, I see. Don't worry. A lot of people have experienced similar things since the Day of Change.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Could you tell me what kind of memories you've been recalling?\"\nShe's pressing for details now. Cha Eui-jae hesitated to answer. Lee Mi-jin, perhaps sensing his discomfort, gently encouraged him.\n\"Is it a memory that's hard to talk about?\"\n\"No, it's just... I've never shared this with anyone before, so it feels a bit strange.\"\nCha Eui-jae scratched his cheek with a sheepish smile.\n\"You know, talking about something like this... it'd make people think you're crazy.\"\n\"That's true. Many people are afraid of that. But I believe that the more difficult it is to share something, the more important it is to open up. Humans need to rely on each other, after all.\"\nWow, she talks so smoothly. It seemed clear now that Lee Mi-jin wouldn't leave until she heard what she wanted. She'd probably come over just to have this conversation. There was no avoiding it. He'd have to make something up. Just then—\n\"Mmph! Mmmph! Mmph!\"\nA muffled scream echoed from somewhere. It was faint, but clearly a woman's voice. Lee Mi-jin, either not hearing it or pretending not to, maintained her serene smile as she looked at Cha Eui-jae. Everyone else around them seemed to be ignoring the noise as well.\n'If I react now...'\nThey'd know. They'd figure out he was awakened. Cha Eui-jae feigned a deep breath, as though to collect his thoughts, and took a sip of the water. It tasted strangely bitter. At the same time, his vision briefly swayed before returning to normal. He recognized this sensation. He'd felt it before it was detoxified by Basilisk's Venom.\n'Ah... fuck. Wait.'\nVeins bulged on Cha Eui-jae's temple.\n'These bastards spiked the water...'\nCarefully, he ran his tongue along his mouth. What had they put in it? It wasn't poison, at least. If it were, his system would have notified him that it was being neutralized. A sedative? A tranquilizer? Drugs? Maybe it was a special kind designed for awakened people. Had they spiked it in case an awakened individual infiltrated?\nBut seriously, messing with food?\nCha Eui-jae looked up at the ceiling, not forgetting to sigh as if troubled. He really was troubled, after all.\n'This is a complete mess...'\n\"Mmmph! Mmmph!\"\nThe woman's screams grew louder. There were even sounds of struggling now, thuds and bumps. A few people glanced around, hesitating. It was about time to react. Cha Eui-jae looked at Lee Mi-jin with a face of concern.\n\"Um, don't you hear that?\"\n\"Hear what? What kind of sound?\"\n\"That, the 'mmph' sound... like someone's gagged?\"\n\"Hmm... I don't hear anything.\"\nLee Mi-jin tilted her head, looking puzzled. Cha Eui-jae barely listened to her response as he shot up from his seat. He headed straight for the source of the sound. Lee Mi-jin hurried after him.\n\"Wait! What are you...\"\n\"Sorry, it's just... that voice, it sounded like my sister. Sorry, call me crazy if you want, but I have to check!\"\nCha Eui-jae muttered nonsense as he yanked open a nearby tent. And then—\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nThere she was, being dragged away with her mouth gagged by a large man.\n\"...Yoon Ga-eul?\"\nHe came face to face with Yoon Ga-eul.\nYoon Ga-eul, her glasses askew, was struggling in the grip of a bulky man's arm. In the midst of her desperate flailing, she suddenly heard her name and widened her eyes at Cha Eui-jae. Her gaze filled with shock. Cha Eui-jae likely had the same expression on his face. Why was a student who was supposed to be at school here? And being dragged away, no less!\nCha Eui-jae turned to Lee Mi-jin, his face stricken with disbelief. Lee Mi-jin sighed deeply, covering her face with her hand.\n\"It would have been better for both of us if you'd just had a chat and gone quietly. Curiosity is a sin, you know.\"\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n\"Now that you've seen this, there's no choice. We'll have to take you along too.\"\nLee Mi-jin snapped her fingers, and the bulky man nearby approached with heavy footsteps. She waved her hand gracefully.\n\"Don't hit him too hard. Don't make him a fool either. Just hit him hard enough to knock him out. He seems like he might be useful.\"\nSo they were planning to knock him out and take him along. Wait, wasn't this actually turning out well?\n'Aren't they just taking me straight to their base?'\nThe bulky man approached with loud, heavy breaths. Cha Eui-jae backed up, silently praying.\n'Please hit me with something strong.'\nHe prayed again.\n'Please hit me with something solid!'\nIf it's a thin iron rod, it'll just bend!\nFortunately, the bulky man was holding a hefty club. That should do the job. Whoosh— the club cut through the air as it swung toward Cha Eui-jae. At the moment the club was about to make contact with his face, Cha Eui-jae flung himself backward, pretending he had been hit.\nCrash—!! Cha Eui-jae toppled onto a pile of ice boxes and cardboard crates.\n'I've even mastered Hollywood stunts now...'\nProud of his performance, Cha Eui-jae closed his eyes. Yoon Ga-eul let out a muffled scream. Lee Mi-jin snapped her fingers again. A firm hand grabbed Cha Eui-jae by the ankle and started dragging him.\n\"They say Yoon Ga-eul is your sister? Well, at least you won't be lonely. Hey, put them both in the car.\"\nLee Mi-jin chuckled to herself. The bulky man hoisted Cha Eui-jae up by his ankle. His baseball cap fell helplessly to the floor. After swinging him back and forth like a pendulum a couple of times, the man flung him somewhere.\nThud! Thud! Cha Eui-jae hit a wall a couple of times before finally crashing onto the floor. Clang! Click! The door slammed shut. Darkness enveloped him.\nAt that moment, Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes wide.",

      "content": "Chapter 220 - End\n'Alright then...'\nThe air was filled with the metallic scent of rust and oil. The floor, which Cha Eui-jae's cheek rested on, was cold and trembled rhythmically. He listened closely. He could hear the hum of an engine and the exhaust. Was it a container truck? Given the state of the road, a truck would be necessary. As Cha Eui-jae took in his surroundings, he overheard Lee Mi-jin scolding someone.\n\"Hold on, I told you not to throw them so roughly. What if they end up getting hurt? Cleaning up the container would be a hassle...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Ugh, never mind. What's the point in talking to idiots? It's like talking to a wall...\"\n\"Hyung-nim.\"\nAnother voice interrupted. It was the man who had shown Cha Eui-jae around earlier, introducing various parts of the camp.\n\"Where should we put this one?\"\nThere were muffled sounds, as if Yoon Ga-eul was struggling, followed by a few thuds. Lee Mi-jin responded nonchalantly.\n\"Didn't you lock the container door?\"\n\"We can always open it again. There's no space in the passenger seat.\"\n\"Check the body of the guy we threw in first. If he's dead, make room and put this one in the front. I don't want anyone losing their mind sitting next to a corpse.\"\n\"He seemed like an Awakened, though. Even if his grade is low, he survived a hit from the club earlier.\"\n\"Oh, really? Then he's probably not dead... Such annoyingly sturdy people. Put him in the container, and don't throw him this time!\"\n\"Mmmph! Mmm!\"\n\"Miss, if you keep being uncooperative, we'll have no choice but to respond with violence...\"\n\"Mmm! Mmmph!\"\n\"You seem like you have a lot to say. Go ahead and untie her mouth for a moment.\"\n\"W-Why are you doing this to me? Please, let me go! I need to get home...\"\nYoon Ga-eul shouted defiantly, but Lee Mi-jin only responded with a mocking laugh.\n\"Do you really think we don't know you're an S-grade Awakened?\"\nYoon Ga-eul fell silent. Cha Eui-jae strained to listen more closely. They knew about Yoon Ga-eul? How? Even among Hunters, very few people knew that Yoon Ga-eul was an S-grade Awakened. At most, they might know that there was a hidden S-grade who was a high school senior and had mental-type abilities.\nLee Mi-jin's tone suddenly shifted, becoming almost pleading.\n\"We know all about your abilities, too. You remember the ruined world, don't you? Are you going to run away again? Without stopping it? While brainwashing yourself into thinking it's inevitable?\"\n\"...\"\n\"We also want to prevent the apocalypse. We're willing to try anything to stop it, wouldn't you?\"\nAfter a pause, Yoon Ga-eul asked.\n\"...What do you want from me?\"\n\"Our leader wants to meet you.\"\nLee Mi-jin's voice changed slightly when she mentioned \"the leader.\" It had a fanatical quality, the voice of someone who believed deeply in something— almost like a madwoman.\n\"Our leader has remembered the apocalypse for a very long time. He foresaw that it would come to this world someday and gathered us together.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Though you are an Awakened, you possess a rare ability. We can cooperate. Talk to our leader, see if we might find a solution to this crisis.\"\n\"...Is that really all?\"\n\"Of course. We'll just talk, and then we'll return you safely to where you came from.\"\n\"How can I believe that? You kidnapped me out of nowhere...\"\n\"I apologize for the rough treatment. I did tell them to bring you in safely... Seems like these idiots didn't understand. They can be slow on the uptake.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Will you come with us?\"\n\"If I say no, you'll just drag me there anyway, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...Fine, just tell them to let go of me. I'll walk on my own.\"\nFootsteps approached. There was a clicking sound as the lock was undone. Cha Eui-jae quickly shut his eyes. A man entered the container before Yoon Ga-eul. He approached Cha Eui-jae, crouched down, and checked for a pulse at his neck. Grumbling, the man muttered.\n\"What the... Still alive, huh? Sturdy as hell.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Alright, miss. Get in.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don't try anything funny. Let's keep things civil.\"\nLight footsteps approached Cha Eui-jae. Yoon Ga-eul sat beside him, curling into a small ball. The door shut again, and the lock clicked into place. At that moment, Cha Eui-jae opened his eyes wide and quickly lifted his head. Yoon Ga-eul gasped, stifling a scream. In a small voice, Cha Eui-jae whispered.\n\"Why are you here, Ga-eul? Weren't you at school?\"\n\"A-Are you okay? That was a pretty hard hit!\"\n\"I was pretending. Didn't even tickle. But why are you here?\"\n\"How could I be at school... with all this going on? After I woke up, I informed the director and was on my way to the Awakened Management Bureau. But then...\"\nYoon Ga-eul sniffled and adjusted her crooked glasses. The vehicle shifted heavily to one side as it started moving.\n\"Some people in white clothes grabbed me. They asked if I was Yoon Ga-eul. I denied it, but...\"\nShe held up the student ID hanging from her neck, showing her name, Yoon Ga-eul, printed in large letters. Cha Eui-jae nodded in understanding. Yoon Ga-eul sniffled again.\n\"I didn't think about the ID... I was too out of it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And that's how I ended up here. What about you, J?\"\n\"I was investigating these people. Thought I'd blend in with this look.\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"I said I was looking for my lost younger sister, and I used some of your information as cover. I figured you'd still be at school, so it made for a good excuse.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Didn't expect to find you here though...\"\nWhat a cruel twist of fate. Yoon Ga-eul hung her head in despair.\n\"I'm sorry, it's my fault...\"\n\"No, I got in here of my own will.\"\nIf he wanted to, Cha Eui-jae could escape anytime. He could rip the container door off and jump out. Sure, he'd roll on the road a bit, but that wouldn't even leave a scratch. Lying face down on the container floor, Cha Eui-jae began to think. This might actually be for the best. From what he'd heard, it sounded like they were about to meet the person responsible for creating Prometheus. He couldn't pass up such a great opportunity. Cha Eui-jae muttered.\n\"Ga-eul, I'm really sorry for saying this, but...\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I could take you with me and escape, but I won't.\"\nYoon Ga-eul pushed up her glasses, rubbing her eyes with her sleeve, and nodded. Cha Eui-jae glanced sideways at her.\n\"You've noticed the apocalypse speeding up, haven't you?\"\n\"Yes, those huge monsters... I remember them. They appear at the start of the end.\"\nThis world had already set itself on a path toward destruction. There was no escaping it. The apocalypse would chase them until the very end. The only way was to push forward. Cha Eui-jae muttered again.\n\"In our world, there's a massive wild card called Prometheus. A variable we don't fully understand. Even if we want to stop the apocalypse, we can't make a plan without accounting for them.\"\n\"You're right.\"\n\"If we can't exclude them... we need to find out more about them.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'm planning to gather as much information as I can from this chance. What do you think?\"\n\"...Do you think we can escape?\"\nYoon Ga-eul looked at Cha Eui-jae with anxious eyes. Cha Eui-jae propped himself up on his elbows and gave her a confident grin.\n\"I'm J, remember?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Trust me.\"\nThe anxiety in Yoon Ga-eul's face faded, replaced by a faint smile. She nodded, reassured. Cha Eui-jae spoke solemnly, and Yoon Ga-eul seemed to tense up as well.\n\"And we should get our story straight.\"\n\"O-Okay.\"\n\"How about we pretend we're siblings with different last names? It's pretty common after the Day of the Rift, with non-blood relatives forming families.\"\nYoon Ga-eul's expression softened into exasperation. Cha Eui-jae suddenly checked his watch, his mind drifting briefly. He remembered how he had longed to be part of a family with Lee Sa-young. He knew his aunt would never return, so maybe that was why he had clung to Lee Sa-young so much. He wanted to bind them together as a family— because they were each other's only ones.\n\"Do you kiss your younger brother?\"\nA teasing voice echoed in his mind. At that moment, Cha Eui-jae slammed his head into the floor. Yoon Ga-eul let out a small squeal of surprise.\n...He hadn't expected things to turn out this way.\nCha Eui-jae rubbed his forehead against the metal floor. His once-scattered thoughts were now focused on one name.\nLee Sa-young.\nWas he alright? Cha Eui-jae let out a short sigh.\n***\nJung Bin said that he melted the entire research facility. He stood alone amidst the ruins, covered in poison.\n...I don't remember it well.\nDid my brain erase the memories to protect my body and mind? I can't be sure. Lee Sa-young's last memory is of a suffocating sensation, hot and overwhelming, like boiling lava. Even that was recalled with difficulty.\nDuring the time spent with Jung Bin and Bae Won-woo in the old house, they would ask him every night. What was the research facility like? Do you remember anything? Is there anyone you recall? It would be helpful if you could remember something. That way, we can track them down and punish them... But every time, Lee Sa-young would shake his head. The only answer he could give was;\n\"I don't know.\"\nIt's strange. His memories of being in the hospital were so vivid, yet no matter how hard he tried, nothing about the facility would come back to him. Lee Sa-young remembered holding Ga-young's hand, and with difficulty, they left the hospital and got into a strange car. That's where the memory is cut off.\n\"It's probably a defense mechanism.\"\nA black shadow muttered. Lee Sa-young looked up. The shadow, which had suddenly risen from the ground, was staring at him silently. Then, it curled its lips into a smile.\n\"You ran away.\"\nAt the same time, Lee Sa-young glared at the shadow.",

It's the only way to save the life of J, whom you love so much.\"\nA black shadow approached. It was much larger than Lee Sa-young. In front of it, Lee Sa-young was shrinking smaller and smaller. The once-clear vision blurred into distortion. A pain long forgotten returned. Lee Sa-young stifled a groan, bowing his head. The hand that touched the ground was grotesquely mangled and deformed. No sound escaped him. Even the short moments of breathing were agonizing. The shadow rested its hand on Lee Sa-young's head, who was gasping from the pain.\n\"I'll help you.\"\n...\nA lazy voice, mocking, whispered.\n\"Retracing memories is my hobby, after all...\"\n***\nCha Eui-jae and Yoon Ga-eul reached an agreement, albeit dramatically. Instead of changing his surname to Yoon, Cha Eui-jae would keep his own name. Aside from that, there wasn't much else to decide. It was easy enough to explain away the age gap since they weren't blood-related. Cha Eui-jae, muttering and memorizing the details they had agreed on, lifted his head.\n\"Come to think of it, Yoon Ga-eul, don't you have a phone?\"\n\"Oh, uh, no... it got taken away.\"\nYoon Ga-eul answered gloomily.\n\"They took anything that could communicate.\"\n\"I see...\"\nCha Eui-jae glanced at the smartwatch on his wrist. He hoped Yang Hye-jin would notice something was off and track them. It was at that moment that the car's engine stopped, and the vibrations ceased. The sound of several footsteps approached the container.\nThe lock clicked open, and the door swung wide. Light suddenly flooded in. Both Cha Eui-jae and Yoon Ga-eul squinted against it. Armed men marched into the container with confident steps. They pointed their guns at Cha Eui-jae.\n\"W-wait a second!\"\nYoon Ga-eul stepped in front of Cha Eui-jae, shielding him with her body, glaring at the men.\n\"He's my brother. If you're rough with him, I won't cooperate.\"\n\"What? Hey, miss...\"\nThe shorter man sneered in disbelief.\n\"Do you think you're the boss here? Do you even know where you are?\"\n\"You brought me here because you want something from me, right? Didn't someone important say they wanted to meet me?\"\n\"...\"\n\"If you lay a finger on us, I won't say a word. And when they ask why, I'll say it's because of you.\"\nThe shorter man exchanged glances with the man behind him. The other man lowered his gun.\n\"...But we're still going to restrain him. We're civilians, and that guy's an Awakened. This is for safety, no room for negotiation.\"\nYoon Ga-eul turned to Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae, expressionless, nodded slightly. He could always break free if he needed to. Yoon Ga-eul nodded as well, following his lead.\n\"...Okay.\"\n\"Hey, put your hands together.\"\nThe man grumbled as he moved forward to handcuff Cha Eui-jae. With a metallic click, the cuffs snapped shut. They were thicker and heavier than the ones used by police, resembling the ones from the Awakened Management Bureau.\nIf it was the same kind, that was actually good news. Cha Eui-jae could easily break them with his strength. But the man pulled out one more thing— a short, thick chain. Yoon Ga-eul, who had been watching quietly, intervened.\n\"Wait, what's that?\"\n\"A safety measure. I told you, it's necessary.\"\n\"How is that a safety measure? There's no need for something like that!\"\n\"It's not up for debate.\"\n\"Yoon Ga-eul.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It's okay.\"\nCha Eui-jae gestured to her with his eyes. There was no need for her to make enemies here. Aside from being an Awakened, she was just an ordinary high school student. She couldn't handle violence. And no matter how strong the restraints were, they wouldn't stand a chance against Cha Eui-jae's grip. Yoon Ga-eul bit her lip and lowered her head.\nThe man scoffed in annoyance and motioned with his fingers.\n\"Look up.\"\nCha Eui-jae raised his head. A rough hand secured a collar around his neck. The moment the metal clicked into place, something sharp jabbed against his skin from the inside. It didn't pierce through, but it was clear that it could.\n'So it's meant to dig into the skin if necessary...'\nIt was hard to breathe; the collar squeezed his neck uncomfortably. Cha Eui-jae grimaced as he ran his fingers along the edge of the collar. The man sneered threateningly.\n\"Don't try anything. I can set it off anytime.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It'd be better for your sister if you just stayed still. Got it?\"\nCha Eui-jae didn't reply but simply nodded. The man pulled out a black cloth next.\n\"Both of you are wearing this. Refuse, and I'll rip your eyes out. You can still flap your mouth even if you've got no eyes.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Understand? Nod if you do.\"\nYoon Ga-eul glanced anxiously at Cha Eui-jae. Cha Eui-jae nodded again. The man roughly blindfolded him with the black cloth, tying it tight. How excessive. He then grabbed the chain attached to Cha Eui-jae's collar and yanked him to his feet. In the distance, Yoon Ga-eul let out a small shriek. Had she seen the tension in Cha Eui-jae's arm? The man taunted.\n\"How protective of your sister. Don't worry, I'm just making sure you can walk straight.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Walk straight! Don't stumble.\"\nAnother man kicked Cha Eui-jae hard in the back. Should he keep his balance? Should he fall? Two choices raced through his mind, but Cha Eui-jae quickly made a decision. It would be better to fall here.\nThunk! Cha Eui-jae collapsed face-first onto the ground. The dry scent of sand filled his nose. He wasted no time grabbing a handful of dirt. Rough sand, small pebbles, gritty against his skin.\n'...A mountain? An open field? A construction site?'\nThen, a scream erupted behind him.\n\"Aaaah! What the fuck!\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"M-my leg... I think it's broken, aaagh! What is he, made of stone?\"\n'That's what you get for kicking people.'\nServes him right. Ignoring the wailing voice, Cha Eui-jae rolled his eyes behind the blindfold. Thankfully, dim light filtered through the cloth. They were outside... were there trees? They hadn't come that far, had they?\n\"Aaaaagh!\"\nThe man who kicked Cha Eui-jae screamed in agony. The other man clicked his tongue in irritation.\n\"Idiot. How many times do I have to tell you not to attack an Awakened?\"\n\"Damn it! We should just kill them! They're monsters, not even human!\"\n\"Shut up. Hey! Take this idiot to the medics.\"\nA few footsteps brushed past Cha Eui-jae. The man grabbed the chain around Cha Eui-jae's neck and yanked hard. They were treating him like a dog. Cha Eui-jae staggered to his feet. Something cold and round pressed against his back.\n\"Just keep walking straight.\"\n\"...\"\nThe sound of sand and gravel beneath his feet gradually faded, replaced by the smooth texture of concrete. The air shifted from the scent of sand to the harsh smell of disinfectant and bleach.\nIt seemed to be a large space; distant voices echoed faintly. He wanted to hear more, to learn about the current situation... the Management Bureau's movements... J... the Rankers... But they were too far away. And with the gun pressing into his back, he couldn't stop walking.\nHow long had they been walking? A soft ding sounded, followed by the sensation of doors opening to either side. The man pressed the gun into Cha Eui-jae's back.\n\"Take three more steps and stop.\"\n\"...\"\nSo there was an elevator. The door closed with a thud. The elevator hummed as it descended. Quite some time passed before the man yanked at the chain around Cha Eui-jae's neck.\n\"Follow me.\"\n'Yes, yes.'\nCha Eui-jae grimaced, scanning his surroundings. The bright lights made it possible to see faintly through the blindfold. White floors, white ceilings, white walls, and people in white lab coats bustling around. And scattered about, steel bars.\nBehind the bars...\nClang! Clang! Clang!\nSomeone grabbed the bars and shook them violently, howling like a beast. A person in a lab coat sighed dramatically, muttering in frustration.\nDid someone forget the sedatives again? Was it you? There they go again...\nWhat should we do?\nWhat do you mean? Isolate them and dose them until they're out of it...\nThe sound of a doorknob turning reached his ears. The door creaked open. The man grabbed Cha Eui-jae's leash and dragged him inside. He muttered.\n\"Don't try anything.\"\nIt was time to speak. Cha Eui-jae rolled his eyes under the blindfold, scanning the surroundings. A square room with steel bars at the front. Nothing was visible beyond the bars. Had they installed a one-way mirror?\n\"Where's my sister?\"\n\"She'll meet hyung-nim.\"\n\"Will she be released?\"\n\"If things go well.\"\n\"How long will I be like this?\"\n\"Until she finishes talking.\"\nThe man grabbed Cha Eui-jae's hair and slammed his head back into the wall with enough force to bang it. Then,\nClink!\nHe fastened the chain to the wall and removed the blindfold.",

It was as small as a back room in a hangover soup restaurant. The man fastened the chains firmly to the wall, then grabbed a fistful of Cha Eui-jae's hair, yanking him. Cha Eui-jae tried not to strain his neck and let himself be dragged quietly.\n'The nerve of these bastards...'\nIf I escape, I'll grab your head first. Did his irritation show on his face? The man tapped Cha Eui-jae's cheek lightly with the back of his hand.\n\"Look at that face... Behave yourself, you punk. Got it?\"\n'Screw you.'\n\"If you don't want to see your sister in a messed-up state, you better behave.\"\nThey're holding Yoon Ga-eul as a hostage to control Cha Eui-jae, and holding Cha Eui-jae to control Yoon Ga-eul. A cost-effective method of blackmail. That's something to learn from. Cha Eui-jae nodded obediently. The man jabbed a gun into his side and then left the room. The door was to the left. He couldn't see outside through the metal bars in front of him; he didn't know what they'd done to block the view. The man's voice could be heard.\n\"Don't touch the guy in that room until we get further instructions.\"\n\"...Wasn't it...?\"\n\"No, leave him for now. That's the order from hyung-nim.\"\n\"Ah, understood...\"\nGood. No need to go smashing everything as soon as they walk in.\nIt seems they intend to keep him alive for now, probably as a bargaining chip to control and manipulate Yoon Ga-eul. Cha Eui-jae fiddled with the collar around his neck and sat down. Lucky for him, he was tall. If he were any shorter, the chains would've made it impossible to sit.\n'Seems pretty spacious.'\nYoon Ga-eul was likely headed to the center of this place. That's where the VIPs tend to be. What will they talk about when they meet? The end of the world? Cha Eui-jae snorted. There's no way Prometheus knows more than Yoon Ga-eul. They probably dragged her off to extract information about the apocalypse...\nWhy are they so obsessed with stopping the apocalypse with human power?\nIt's too organized to simply be because they hate awakened ones.\n'Too systematic.'\nAt that moment, he heard movement near the bars again. Cha Eui-jae lowered his head and closed his eyes.\n\"A new test subject? This one looks pretty intact. Are you sure he's been drugged?\"\nTwo people. From the sound of their rustling coats, they were probably researchers from outside. Cha Eui-jae kept his eyes closed and focused on their conversation. He heard the faint sound of paper being flipped.\n\"Let's see... Have you scanned his face?\"\n\"Not yet.\"\n\"That should've been done first.\"\n\"We can do it now. He doesn't seem like a high-ranking one anyway.\"\n\"How can you tell?\"\n\"Never seen his face before. Probably some lowlife scraping by on the streets.\"\n\"Think the scanner will work with his eyes closed?\"\n\"No idea. Let's try it.\"\nClick. The sound of a camera shutter.\n'Of course.'\nFrom inside the bars, he couldn't see out, but from outside, they could see in. One of them spoke in a mocking tone.\n\"Got it, got it. See? Just a D-grade.\"\n\"Name Cha Eui-jae, D-grade... Huh, nothing special. I thought he might be something since they dragged him in personally. Can we use him as a test subject?\"\n\"No. We've been told not to touch him.\"\n\"Does he have any special abilities? There's nothing unusual in his data.\"\n\"No. But those are the orders from above.\"\n\"Too bad. We're running low on subjects.\"\nCha Eui-jae twitched his fingers. These people could identify his name and grade just from his face. And not only that— he was only a common D-grade awakened. There's only one way that could be possible.\n'The Awakened Management Bureau's database...'\n\"Is he drugged?\"\n\"We've given him some, but probably a small dose.\"\n\"Wouldn't it be better to completely incapacitate him? Just in case.\"\n\"He doesn't seem too aggressive, so let's leave him for now. We don't want to screw this up and look like fools.\"\n\"Man, I was hoping we'd get to experiment on this one.\"\nTheir voices faded as they walked away. Cha Eui-jae slowly opened his eyes. The Awakened Management Bureau's database is strictly managed as a national secret. Every awakened person is considered part of the country's assets. Even A Small Miracle Seo Min-gi had to separate Jung Bin before they could manipulate the database.\nBut these people were able to get information on hunters just from a single photo. Even down to Cha Eui-jae's basic info.\nCha Eui-jae leaned his head against the hard wall.\n'Come to think of it, no matter how drugged I was...'\nIt's nearly impossible for civilians to abduct an awakened person so easily. Especially if the awakened one's powers are out of control due to the drugs. There must've been an accomplice. And that accomplice...\n'A fellow awakened.'\nA chill ran down his spine. There's a traitor among the awakened, selling out their own kind. And considering they can freely access the Bureau's database...\n'...It's someone connected to the Awakened Management Bureau?'\nCha Eui-jae groaned, rubbing his face with both hands. He had come to uncover Prometheus's base and its purpose, but it seemed like he'd stumbled upon something even deeper.\n'No, this might actually be good.'\nThud, thud, thud... Cha Eui-jae kept knocking the back of his head against the wall. Maybe it's because he's been thinking too much, but his head started throbbing painfully.\nHe closed his eyes. Even with them closed, the light was so bright it shone through his eyelids. Would the lights ever turn off? Or would they just leave them on like this? He stared blankly at the bright ceiling. The light hurt his eyes. The lack of darkness was more of a problem than he expected. He wouldn't be able to sleep properly.\nHumans— and all living things, really— need sleep. Without proper rest, the brain slowly deteriorates. Mental strength crumbles. Little by little. That's what was most agonizing about the West Sea rift.\nIn the ruined world, night never came.\nTrapped in an endless white night, constantly on guard for monsters that could appear at any moment. Using the keen senses of an awakened. Yeah, the West Sea rift was the perfect environment for going insane. He couldn't even remember the last time he had a deep sleep. All they did— all Cha Eui-jae did— was endure. Stubbornly.\nAs time passed, people became more irritable. Even the comrades who used to laugh eventually lost their smiles. Small arguments turned into big physical fights, and eventually, blood was shed...\nDamn it. Cha Eui-jae bit his tongue hard. Thinking about the West Sea rift while stuck in this small, bright room was the worst. Think about something else, anything else.\nSuddenly, a question flashed in his mind.\n'Was Lee Sa-young trapped in a place like this too?'\nHe opened his eyes wide and looked around. A small, white room, with blinding white lights, and a silence so deep that he could hear every breath and heartbeat. Was Lee Sa-young stuck alone in a place like this? Foolish Lee Sa-young, who chose the worst path. All because he was waiting for Cha Eui-jae.\nCha Eui-jae clenched and unclenched his fists. His calloused hands had turned pale. The scars that criss-crossed his palms lingered in his vision like afterimages.\n\"...\"\nDamn it.\nCha Eui-jae buried his face in his hands.\nRight now, at this very moment.\nHe missed Lee Sa-young so much.\n***\n\"Aren't you going to introduce yourself to the people you'll be living with?\"\nA cold hand gave his back a push. Lee Sa-young stumbled, unable to keep his balance, and only barely managed to steady himself with his crutches. He glared to his side, but with his blurry vision, he could only make out light and dark shapes. Guessing from the pale figure, he assumed it was Ga-young. She widened her eyes as if confused, then curled her lips into a smirk.\n\"Oh, sorry, sorry. It's still hard for you to walk, isn't it? I must have been a bit inconsiderate.\"\n\"...\"\n\"This here, hmm, let's just call you Number 4, okay? Since you can't say your own name. Is that fine?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Number 4 here is a very precious person who managed to survive even after being poisoned by a monster! Let's all work hard to help Number 4 get better, okay?\"\nA round of applause broke out. It was loud. Too loud. He wanted to cover his ears. He already missed the quiet hospital room. The cold hand rested on his shoulder. A shiver ran down the back of his neck. Disgusting. He could hear the scurrying sound of many legs moving busily. Probably a spider...\n\"First, let me show you to your room. You'll be staying there from now on.\"\nGa-young continued guiding him without care. The long, white hallway stretched endlessly. Lee Sa-young's breathing grew labored. He soon had to stop, gasping for breath, leaning on his crutches to support himself. Ga-young didn't express concern. She didn't even come closer. She just waited for him, standing far away.\n\"Hurry up.\"\nDamn it.\nGrinding his teeth, Lee Sa-young forced himself to move again. He was breathing harshly, each breath more labored than the last. The taste of blood filled his mouth. His sweaty, unkempt bangs stuck to his forehead. By the time he finally reached Ga-young, the door creaked open. With a voice full of laughter, Ga-young whispered,\n\"Good job. This is where you'll be staying.\"\n\"...\"\nThe room was all white. Even with Lee Sa-young's terrible vision, he could clearly see how utterly white it was. The floor, the walls, the ceiling— everything was pale and lifeless. The cold, spider-like hand shoved him again. With a crash, Lee Sa-young fell into the room along with his crutches. He painfully lifted his head. Click.\nThe door closed.",

      "content": "Chapter 223 - End\n\"...Huh.\"\nAt the same time, Lee Sa-young gasped deeply and opened his eyes. Everything before him was white. He couldn't see a thing.\n'Ah.'\nHis entire body grew cold. His fingertips trembled uncontrollably. He hastily looked around, but the blinding white light remained. Panicking, Lee Sa-young covered his eyes with both hands. Darkness returned. But his breathing, once rapid, didn't easily calm down. Then, a voice came from beside him.\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi! Are you alright?\"\nWho is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?\nLee Sa-young gritted his teeth so hard a grinding sound could be heard. Another voice interrupted.\n\"Should we splash some water on him? Should I fetch some from the stream? There's a mountain right outside!\"\n\"Would that help? Lee Sa-young-ssi... are you alright? Is your condition bad?\"\nDon't come closer. Don't come closer. Don't come closer.\n\"Officer-nim~ I think you shouldn't get too close.\"\n\"What? But we can't just leave him like this, having a seizure...\"\n\"No. If you get close now, he'll attack. That one's acting strange right now...\"\n\"Hey, Kkokko... wait? Where's Kkokko gone?\"\n\"Kkokko hasn't been here since we came to our senses.\"\n\"Oh? Really? So did Kkokko follow J?\"\nJ.\nJ?\nHis trembling slowly subsided. Lee Sa-young blinked heavily. Through his fingers, he caught a glimpse of a dark ceiling. Hesitant, he lowered his hands from his eyes. A chandelier, overly ornate and adorned with candles, and a wooden ceiling. Catching his breath, Lee Sa-young turned his head. A little distance away, Jung Bin and Hong Ye-seong stood awkwardly, while Gyu-Gyu stood beside them, clattering dice in his hand.\nHong Ye-seong, clinging to Jung Bin's waist, asked.\n\"Sa-young? Are you okay?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Lee Sa-young-ssi, are you alright?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Seems like he's more himself now~\"\nWithout answering, Lee Sa-young continued to catch his breath. Through his fingers, he scanned his surroundings. This place...\nA space created by Hong Ye-seong. They were in a meeting. A lot of people had gathered. I...\n'I came here with J.'\nJust then, something shiny caught his eye. Lee Sa-young raised his hand. A watch slid slightly down his wrist before stopping. It was broken and worn. Among the many clock hands, only one was moving.\nIn a hurry, Lee Sa-young sat up. He demanded urgently.\n\"Where's J?\"\n\"Probably off saving the world~\"\n\"Shut up.\"\n\"Could you please be quiet, Gyu-Gyu.\"\n\"Yes, yes~\"\nJung Bin, now kneeling closer to Lee Sa-young, met his eyes. Worry was etched on his face.\n\"When we woke up, J had already disappeared. It seems he left to deal with the situation outside first. However, there are reports, so there's no need to worry about his safety.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Sa-young didn't answer and hung his head. He felt nauseous, like he was about to vomit. Jung Bin glanced at Hong Ye-seong and raised his voice slightly.\n\"Um, how about a little change of pace? The part-time worker from the hangover soup restaurant has shown up. You may not be interested, but you used to visit that place often, Lee Sa-young-ssi...\"\nJung Bin's voice trailed off as he widened his eyes. Lee Sa-young's expression had twisted strangely. He moved his lips a couple of times as if he had much to say, messed up his hair, stared at the air, swept his bangs back, took a deep breath, and finally opened his mouth.\n\"...The part-time worker from the hangover soup restaurant?\"\nMaybe the shock of collapsing was too great. When looking at Lee Sa-young, a feeling of pity would arise. Was it because of those sleepless nights he spent tossing and turning at the straw-roofed house? Bae Won-woo used to agree that it was like a father's concern. Lee Sa-young still seemed unable to shake off the shock. Jung Bin looked at him with sympathetic eyes.\n\"Well...\"\nThinking about it, it wasn't strange that Lee Sa-young didn't know. He had been asleep for three months. Jung Bin kindly explained.\n\"After the Day of Change, the part-timer closed the shop and disappeared. Everyone was very worried. But earlier, Hunter Yang Hye-jin said she ran into him.\"\nShit. It seemed a small curse slipped out. Lee Sa-young, after rubbing his face dry, asked.\n\"...What was he wearing?\"\n\"Um, they said he was wearing a gray hoodie. The same as before, so they recognized him immediately.\"\nCrack, Lee Sa-young's hand scratched roughly at the air. He staggered as he got to his feet. His violet eyes gleamed coldly. He dragged his feet as he walked toward the door. Gyu-Gyu, still tossing his dice, asked.\n\"Where are you going~?\"\n\"...\"\nBang! Lee Sa-young kicked the door, escaping from Hong Ye-seong's cozy love house. Now clinging like a cicada to a pillar instead of Jung Bin, Hong Ye-seong muttered.\n\"Wow~ Lucky he's too out of it to notice. I don't think he realized I texted J using his phone, huh?\"\n\"No way he did~\"\n\"But why did you even do that in the first place?\"\n\"Hm?\"\nHong Ye-seong slid down the pillar.\n\"I don't know. It just felt right!\"\nJung Bin, his eyes cold, stared at Hong Ye-seong for a moment before turning away.\n***\nCha Eui-jae opened his eyes.\n\"...\"\nIt seemed the order to leave him alone was real, as no one approached him anymore. They must have stashed him away in some back room. Out of boredom, Cha Eui-jae wiggled his fingers. The room offered little information.\n'And it's dull.'\nIf Lee Sa-young had stayed in a room like this, how did he manage? There's only so much you can think about and imagine before you reach a limit. Cha Eui-jae was already itching to move.\n'Is that why his personality turned out that way...?'\nCha Eui-jae smirked. The researchers hadn't come near him since their last visit either. They must have been strictly following the orders of \"Hyung-nim.\" He rubbed his head against the wall out of frustration.\n'Is \"Hyung-nim's\" command really that absolute?'\nIs \"Hyung-nim\" their leader? Cha Eui-jae wanted to meet him, to figure out what was going on in his head to make him do all this. By now...\n'Ga-eul must have met this \"Hyung-nim\" person.'\nHe should've arranged a way to contact Ga-eul.\n'I was a bit too overconfident.'\nYawn. Cha Eui-jae let out a big yawn and clicked his tongue. Well, how could he have known without trying to infiltrate? Maybe relying too much on power isn't the answer... Just then.\nSsshhh... He heard a hissing sound. Cha Eui-jae lifted his head. A faint mist was seeping through a slight gap in the ceiling. Thud, thud, thud... The distant sounds gradually faded. Cha Eui-jae raised his wrists to check the time. 5 p.m.\n'Do they release it at set intervals?'\nDamn it. Cha Eui-jae frowned. There was no avoiding the gas in a small room like this. He could only hold his breath for so long. In the end, he would have to breathe it in. Cha Eui-jae glared at the ceiling in frustration. The room was slowly filling with a hazy gas, thick enough that he could no longer see ahead.\n***\n\"Something just came to mind.\"\nA man wearing clear goggles suddenly spoke. The other man, who was jotting something down on a tablet while observing the liquid dripping drop by drop, answered halfheartedly.\n\"Mm-hmm.\"\n\"That room earlier. The one hyung-nim told us not to touch.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Doesn't gas get released in there too? It's on a blanket release system, right?\"\nThe busy hand stopped. The man holding the tablet frowned.\n\"Aw, crap... Were we also supposed to not release gas in there?\"\n\"He did say not to do anything reckless. Said to leave him alone.\"\n\"Ah, damn it... Now we have to get him out.\"\n\"Can't believe we didn't think of that.\"\n\"See, I told you we should have installed separate ventilation systems, but no one listens.\"\nGrumbling, the two grabbed protective suits hanging on the wall. After putting on the full-body suits, goggles, and gas mask filters that only covered their mouths, they tightened their gloves. Once fully suited up, they headed to the last room at the end of the long hallway. The rest of the rooms were already silent.\nThe iron cell at the end was already filled with a hazy gas, and through the fog, a faint black shape could be seen. It looked like someone sitting on the floor. Something about it was unsettling. The man with the tablet frowned deeply and stepped back.\n\"Hey, you go get him out.\"\n\"What? Why?\"\n\"Ugh, I don't wanna go in there.\"\n\"How am I supposed to get him out alone?\"\n\"Figure it out. I'm swamped right now, seriously.\"\n\"Ugh, fine...\"\nThe man wearing goggles grumbled as he opened the side door and disappeared into the gas. He has the nerve to ask me to handle it with him, even though it's his fault for not paying attention. Some people have no conscience. Left alone, the other man quickly skimmed through the data on his tablet. Valuable time was being wasted... Then,\nThud.\nA heavy sound echoed. The man lifted his eyes from the tablet, looking for the source. The sound had come from inside the cell.\n\"...\"\nHe frowned. What was that? He knocked on the iron bars twice with his fist.\n\"Hey, everything okay in there?\"\nNo answer. Instead, there was a clinking noise. It sounded like chains rattling.\n\"...\"\nCould something have gone wrong in there? No, he's probably too drugged to think straight. Plus, he's tied up. Should I have gone in with him? Is something going wrong over something so trivial? A whirlwind of thoughts swirled in his mind. He anxiously glanced down the hallway before knocking on the bars again.\n\"Hey, do I need to come in? Or should I call security?\"\n\"...No.\"\nA low, oddly calm voice replied. Was that his colleague? Or not? The man frowned and listened carefully. A throat-clearing sound, followed by a voice tinged with amusement.\n\"The chains are just too tight, that's all.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why're you so freaked out over something like this? You scared?\"\nThe joking tone eased his tension a bit. His stiff shoulders relaxed. Bastard. He should've just answered right away. The man responded curtly, hiding his embarrassment.\n\"Scared? Nah... I just thought you'd passed out from the gas. You sure you're okay? Nothing weird, right?\"\n\"Yeah... but the chains won't come off. How about we just leave it?\"\n\"What? You think that's a good idea? What if hyung-nim finds out later...\"\n\"It's fine.\"\nWhite smoke swirled beyond the iron bars. The man instinctively stepped back. Creak. The door opened, and the figure in a white protective suit emerged from the gas, fumbling with the filter. He waved his hand.\n\"Move back a bit. There's too much gas in here.\"\n\"Uh, yeah, okay.\"\nThe gloved hands brushed at his body. The man suddenly felt an odd sense of discomfort and tilted his head. What is it? Something's off. Aren't the sleeves of his gloves a bit rolled up? I could've sworn I saw him put them on properly. And those shoes... aren't they a bit too loose?\nAt that moment, the man stopped.\n\"...Aren't you busy?\"\n\"...\"\nThe man gulped. Something's wrong. This can't be the same guy who was just with me...\n\"Go on ahead. I'll catch up after I shake this off.\"\nBut he didn't want to think about it any further.\nHe wanted to avoid it.\nThis situation.\nHe wanted to run away.\nFrom that... thing.\n\"O-okay, yeah...\"\nThe man awkwardly shuffled away. It's probably nothing. No way it's what I'm thinking. Step by step, his pace quickened, and soon he was running. His hurried footsteps echoed down the long hallway.\n'Was this hallway always this long?'\nHe felt anxious. Cold sweat soaked his back. What should I do? What's happening?\nAnd then—\nA sharp pain struck the back of his neck. He collapsed without even a scream. Behind him, the figure in the white protective suit appeared. The eyes behind the transparent goggles were blue.",
