      "content": "Chapter 1: Chapter 1: Beginning with the Slaying of Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow\n\"There are always a few times in life when you feel like you’ve seen the gates of Heaven open. I’ve waited seventeen years, and at my lowest moment, the gates finally opened.\"\nLin Li looked at the back of the classmate in front of him and said softly.\n\"Do you have a lion hiding in your eyes too?\" His deskmate Bai Bufan turned his head to look at the suddenly eccentric Lin Li and teased, \"Lu Mingli, could you use a quarter of your lifespan to trade me a girlfriend like Jiude Mayi?\nIf that’s too much to ask, trading nothing is fine too—no other reason, just want to waste your lifespan.\"\n\"Bufan, between us, there’s already a pathetic thick wall.\" Lin Li turned his head to look at Bai Bufan, and though there was no lion in his eyes, there was a lofty compassion.\nBai Bufan rolled his eyes, clasped his hands in a fist salute, \"Master Tree-man, please continue your eccentricity, I haven’t memorized the vocabulary for tomorrow morning’s English class yet, I have to continue cramming, farewell.\"\n\"Foot fetish, disgusting.\" Lin Li shook his head with some disdain.\nBai Bufan, who had already turned his head, took three seconds to realize he was being insulted, turned his head sharply back:\n\"Cramming on the eve of exams counts as foot fetish?! You owe an apology to that saying! Besides, what’s wrong with foot fetishes, apologize to the Arknights players! Finally, apologize to me for wasting another precious minute of my life!\"\n\"No apologies, I prefer Azur Lane.\"\n\"I’m quite interested in having a passionate XP battle with you, but definitely not during tonight’s study session. Wait till after I survive tomorrow’s English class, you’ll pay for your ignorance.\" Bai Bufan sneered, then turned his head back, immersing himself in his English textbook.\nAnd Lin Li also took a deep breath, gently exhaled, and pressed down his inner excitement.\nHe really wasn’t suddenly acting crazy.\nJust now, he activated the system, and this was a heartfelt expression.\nThis kind of thing truly happened to him.\nThis is a system that can lead him to the pinnacle of life, and having observed others’ reactions just now, he confirmed that at least in this classroom, only he activated it.\nLin Li was both nervous and excited now. If not for being in a crowded classroom, he might not have been able to resist humming softly to himself.\nAfter joking with his deskmate, his mood had calmed a bit, and Lin Li officially started checking his system.\n[Loading 99%...]\nNot fully loaded yet, Lin Li was so excited he couldn’t wait to sing and dance while waiting.\nTwenty minutes later, the progress didn’t change.\nLin Li waited excitedly.\nForty minutes later, it was still unchanged.\nLin Li frowned while waiting.\nSixty minutes later.\nLin Li waited with a peaceful smile, as if entering the Wise One mode, seeing through the worldly desires.\nAll is empty, Amitabha, free from worldly desires.\nYour mom—\n[Binding complete.]\n[Congratulations on successfully binding the Ascension System. This system will guide and assist your growth, helping you gradually become supreme in this unfamiliar world!]\nYour mom is in good health.\nJust kidding, this humble monk shall return to secular life first.\nGood, that’s the spirit! It should be like this!\nWhat’s wrong with waiting a bit longer? Good things should be like this.\nLike some items are originally priced at 33.9, after discount 32.9, does that mean the seller is stingy? It clearly proves it’s a good item, that’s why it can only be one yuan cheaper.\nThe long loading time simply represents the abundance of content, as precious as the fingers of the Laughing God of Cooking Little Blessing.\nIt certainly couldn’t be a bug, what a joke.\nThe illusory screen in front transformed into the initial UI.\nVery simple, [Panel], [Shop], [Warehouse], [Quest].\nClick [Panel].\n[Name: Lin Li]\n[Age: 17]\n[Physique: None]\n[Passive Abilities: None]\n[Active Abilities: None]\n[System Currency: None]\nA very simple introduction, and the content is straightforwardly none.\nThe system probably doesn’t account for those conventional abilities, Lin Li at least had some specialties, or maybe those specialties weren’t recognized.\nBut this didn’t deter Lin Li, it excited him even more—if all his abilities weren’t recognized, does that mean only superpowers could be recorded?\nWouldn’t that prove the system would grant him superpowers?\nLinking to the system’s initial words of \"becoming supreme,\" he could become a superhero in modern times!\nFor Lin Li, this was even better than those systems that offered money and power.\nClick [Shop].\n[Unlock after accumulating 300 system currency.]\nIt seems this door cannot be opened from this side for now. Lin Li then clicked on [Warehouse].\nAs expected, it was empty, but Lin Li still felt a bit disappointed, as he still held hopes of the system giving him a newbie gift package or something.\nNo worries, having a system is already great, Lin Li comforted himself.\nIt seems that getting something for nothing is not the system’s theme, Lin Li locked his eyes on [Quest], praying that the system’s task wouldn’t be too difficult.\n[Entering the Cultivation Realm, even mortals should have the ambition of swans, to cleanse the world of demons, starting from now!]\n[Quest Triggered!]\n[Quest One: Slay ten Little Demon Heaven Blood Crows that frequently attack and kill villagers around your village.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption speed increased by 100%; System Currency * 50.]\n\"...\"\nLin Li crossed his hands, resting them below his nose.\nSilence.\nNo, no, something is very wrong ten out of ten.\nLin Li patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder, and once he looked over, Lin Li sincerely asked:\n\"Bufan, I have a friend who just downloaded a game. The newbie quest asks him to kill ten Little Demon Heaven Blood Crows, but he has no idea where they are. What should he do in this situation?\"\n\"Tell him to ask the nearby NPCs.\" Bai Bufan shrugged and said.\n\"Hmm...\"\nNo wonder we’re good buddies, we think the same way.\n\"That option was just tried by a friend of mine, and it seems even the NPC doesn’t know.\" Lin Li’s expression drifted back to Wise One mode, devoid of joy or sorrow.\n\"Then it’s one of those disgustingly forced map exploration games. Your friend better hope the map isn’t too big.\" Bai Bufan waved his hand dismissively.\nThe map shouldn’t be too big, just 5.1 billion square kilometers, and that’s not including the outer space DLC.\nLin Li’s gaze continued to fixate on the system.\nActually, it’s not like there’s no guidance. The task did say something about the Blood Crow appearing \"around the village.\"\nLin Li was at school, a key high school at the county level, unrelated to any village.\n\"... \"\nLin Li felt he had to confront something; he could no longer deceive himself.\nHis sight locked onto \"First Entry into the Cultivation Realm\" and \"in this unfamiliar world,\" which were mentioned in the initial system message.\nLooking outside the window, the classroom was on the second floor. There wasn’t much of a view, as usual, no resurgence of Spiritual Qi.\nJust the ordinary world he had lived in for seventeen years.\n\"Ha—\" Lin Li took a deep breath.\nCould it be...?\nDid he skip the step where he was supposed to actually cross over?\nLin Li thought more about it and found the situation might indeed be so.\nThese days, where would you find creatures daring to frequently appear and hunt humans? Bold creatures would have long been gunned down by humanity’s adherence to truth.\nBut...\nIf he hadn’t crossed over, this task was probably impossible to complete, right?\nWithout completion, the store couldn’t be activated, and rewards couldn’t be claimed...\nThen what use was this system?!\nOh right, when he had Alzheimer’s in the future, it could be brought up at any time to check his age and name.\nHis kids would never have to worry about their granddad forgetting their names, wow, he really was a genius!\nJust like that, he was no... fuck, still upset.\nLin Li clicked through the entire system interface but couldn’t find an option to traverse.\n\"System bro?\"\n\"Customer service?\"\n\"After-sales?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Daddy?\"\n\"If you don’t reply soon, I’m going to send the Earth coordinates to the Trisolarans!\"\nLin Li tried many methods and finally confirmed one thing—the system wasn’t alive.\nWhat a backward, low-level system, couldn’t they install an AI?\nCould the failure to load successfully just now actually have been due to a bug?\nSilence, an utterly painful silence.\n\"Bufan, do you know which road around here has a lot of dump trucks driving by?\" Lin Li turned his head mechanically.\nMaybe it’s still not too late to cross over.\n\"How would I know that, what are you planning?\" Bai Bufan was puzzled.\n\"I want to make a video with me hiding in the bushes, and when a dump truck approaches, I suddenly appear in front of it to give it a scare. It seems like there are no bloggers doing such content on the internet. I might go viral.\" Lin Li said with a bitter smile.\n\"... \"\n\"You’re talking about going viral as in getting cremated, right?\" Bai Bufan gave a thumbs up, then looked at his desk mate with amusement and curiosity: \"What’s up with you? You look constipated.\"\n\"I’m breaking down,\" Lin Li said truthfully.\n\"There’s nothing you can’t get through. Go home tonight and do some calculus; everything will be fine once you derive it all.\" Bai Bufan casually comforted him because, from his perspective, Lin Li suddenly turned like this within an hour, which in his mind meant it wasn’t anything serious.\nMust be those few days a month that happen to men.\n\"You wouldn’t understand me, the kind of breakdown where I’m just one dump truck short of achieving the pinnacle of life.\" Lin Li sighed.\nThe system was right in front, but unable to run.\n\"No, I might understand you; I’ve been broken down before, and it was recent,\" Bai Bufan’s expression turned to one of experience, with melancholic vibes emanating from him: \"Last weekend, I finally found a movie I was super excited about, but right when it was getting to the peak, the network lagged, and the screen froze on the male lead’s eyeless face.\nI staked everything, gave it my all, but couldn’t hold out; it backfired.\nIt’s irritating! It’s irritating! It’s so irritating!!\nWhen I think about it now, it’s still immensely dissatisfying. That self-righteous damn guy, I’ll never forgive him in this lifetime!\"\nDue to evening self-study, Bai Bufan lightly tapped his fist on the desk, but his face looked somewhat hideous.\n\"... \"\nBai Bufan was undoubtedly a genius at comforting people; Lin Li suddenly found he wasn’t too broken after all.\nOh well, what he lost was just what he had just gained. Rounding up, he realized he was just fooled for two hours.\nLin Li couldn’t actually bet that a dump truck could take him to cross over; that would be too silly.\nHowever, the ups and downs made it unrealistic for him to concentrate again on studying. He decided to do nothing, let his mind go blank, and wait for school to end.\nSleeping should make everything a little better.\nHowever, an oblivious mosquito with an annoying buzz flew over and landed on Lin Li’s hand.\nThe classroom was on the second floor, and mosquitoes were always plentiful in summer.\nI’m already so miserable, and you’re still here sucking my blood?\nWhy not go suck Bai Bufan’s instead?\nIf it was just before, he might have willingly treated all the mosquitoes in the room to Bai’s blood to share his joy. But now, enough was enough!\nLin Li’s left hand remained still, his right hand pretended to scratch his head, and then, in a lightning-fast move—\n\"Snap!\"\nA corpse lay in his palm, with barely any bloodstains as it hadn’t been able to suck much blood.\nJust about to ask the front desk for a tissue to wipe his hand, Lin Li paused.\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (1/10).]\nEh?!?!\"",

It’s just an ordinary mosquito, right!\" Lin Li’s voice rose with excitement.\nA creature without any connection to something with a fancy name like Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow, even from a biological standpoint, it’s just an arthropod insect in the diptera order!\nLin Li had just researched for a long time and found no abnormalities in this mosquito’s size or body details.\n\"Actually, it’s not ordinary. It died in the hand of someone who’s never held a peer girl’s...\" thinking about it, the genius Bai Bufan decided to recite the spell again.\n\"Snow leopard, shut up.\"\nIt seems unnecessary to ask the front desk for a tissue. Taking advantage of Bai Bufan’s distraction, Lin Li wiped his hand on his school uniform, cleaning off the Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow’s corpse, feeling much better.\nThe two stopped talking, Lin Li looked out the window, falling silent once again.\nThis time, the excitement that was previously covered by disappointment and frustration reappeared in his heart.\nLin Li thought he might have figured out what happened.\nThis system should have been activated and bound after I went to the Cultivation Realm, but now there’s a bug, skipping the crossing step, leaving me in the modern world.\nBut the system... it seems to forcibly start running.\nBad news: The system has a bug.\nGood news: It runs relying on the bug.\nThis world has no Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow, but the system, with sole official explanation authority, thinks there can be, so—\nMosquito: I am a mosquito.\nSystem: No, from now on, you are the Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow frequently attacking villagers!\nMosquito: So can I mutate? To have abilities worthy of this name?\nSystem: Well, on that note...\nUnderstanding everything, Lin Li smiled comfortingly.\nLife is indeed full of ups and downs, rising and rising again.\nAs long as it rewards normally, Lin Li doesn’t care if the system runs normally.\nMoreover, in the current situation, compared to the unseen Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow, it’s obviously easier to deal with mosquitoes, right?\nSpeaking of which, this is still good news, as the difficulty of completing tasks has decreased.\nLooking at the task reward, I am about to become sensitive to Spiritual Qi, and from now on I can really cultivate in the modern world. The era of being the sole master is about to come!\nHehehehe!\n\"Why is your laugh so sinister? Weren’t you under the Jade Jade symptom just now, have you reached the don’t laugh challenge phase now?\" Bai Bufan turned his head, looking at Lin Li’s smile, moving his chair a bit to the side with a chill.\nAs someone destined to become an Immortal, of course, Lin Li wouldn’t bother to argue with a mere mortal.\nLin Li didn’t rush to complete tasks.\nSince over an hour was wasted waiting for the loading just now, self-study was about to end, and compared to before, the class already had more rustling noises.\nAlthough my seat is near the window, opening windows on this side of the corridor at night in summer would be criticized by the class for attracting a lot of insects to the light source; not necessarily mosquitoes, and now many unknown moths and insects are already clinging outside the window.\nBetter to wait until home to do the task, the tasks aren’t time-limited, not urgent now.\nFirst enjoy the future, now it’s time for imagination.\nWhen one prospers, the entire household prospers. Feeling good, Lin Li patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder compassionately, saying:\n\"Bufan, as long as you work hard and be my loyal dog, I won’t let you down.\nFrom now on, if I eat meat, you will have soup to drink too.\"\n\"? What does this meat and soup have to do with me?\"\n\"Because when I have soup, you will have a bowl to wash.\"\n\"How magnanimous, Lord Lin, even South Korean exchange students get better treatment than being your loyal dog.\" Bai Bufan earnestly cupped his hands in admiration.\n\"Then how about this, tomorrow I will treat you to breakfast, bring it for free.\" Lin Li sneered lightly.\n\"Lord Lin, you have always been my most respected Lord Lin.\" Bai Bufan sincerely, \"In that case, I won’t be polite, the usual, rice rolls with egg.\"\nNansang Middle School is a boarding school, but Lin Li is a day student.\nEvery day student inevitably experiences helping dorm students smuggle goods.\nThe contents include parcels, charging electricity for power banks, and breakfast.\nThe dorm provides breakfast, and the Nansang Middle School canteen isn’t bad, the food can’t be used as a weapon at least, but as the saying goes, domestic flowers are less fragrant than wild ones.\nThe potential of humans is infinite. Lin Li once carried breakfast for fourteen people in one go under extreme circumstances, was once stopped at the school gate by security thinking he was delivering takeout.\n\"Dun dun~~ Dun dun dun~~\" The bell for the end of class came as expected, and the sound of desks and chairs moving instantly filled the classroom, most students got up and started packing.\nEager to return home, Lin Li told those who also wanted him to bring breakfast to contact him through Bai Bufan, who had a mobile phone, then dashed downstairs.\nFinding his bicycle at the school gate, he hit the road home.\nThe distance isn’t far or too close, leisurely cycling takes fifteen minutes, hurrying only takes ten.\n[Slay Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (2/10).]\nThe sudden notification startled Lin Li, causing him nearly to bid farewell to the world while speeding. It’s truly dangerous to consult the system while driving.\nProbably a mosquito collided and died, hope it transmigrates to the Cultivation Realm to become a true Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow.\nThinking this, Lin Li suddenly noticed another message from the system.\nDid another one collide to death?\nLin Li decelerated, clicked open the message.\n[During demon slaying, unexpectedly discovered a major secret! The Hehuan Demon is hiding here, accepting money and absorbing Yang Qi from people! Countless cultivators have had their Dao Heart broken and lost their lives and wealth, this cannot be tolerated by heaven!\nThough current cultivation is insufficient, cannot overlook this, should devise a plan to exterminate!\nAdvisors enter the game, can seize half the sky!

      "content": "Chapter 3: Chapter 3: Look closely, this man is the Blood Crow Assassin\nLin Li stepped on the brake, and the bicycle came to a complete stop by the roadside.\nHe really didn’t see wrong; a new task popped up.\nAnd the original task wasn’t overridden, meaning the system can handle at least two tasks simultaneously, rather than only completing one task at a time.\nIt’s just that... this task...\n\"If Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow is the mosquito, then this Hehuan Demon’s base is probably...\" Lin Li thought his expression must be quite spectacular, maybe like the Flame Fist transformation.\nLin Li pushed the bicycle backward to the approximate position where he triggered the broadcast just now.\nAnd beside it, there was a foot massage parlor with grand decor, although the style was somewhat outdated—the Light Noble Health Club.\nThe most likely and reasonable target could only be this place.\nCould this be the legendary Red Romance?\nOpenly about health, secretly about raising chickens?\nLin Li marked a spot.\nAfter thinking for a while, he pedaled his bicycle back home.\nNo rush to deal with this chicken farm for now; it’s not something he can handle casually, possibly needing involvement from the Demon Suppression Bureau, which is akin to the police. Even if he reports it, he needs to think about wording and evidence first.\nAny action should wait for the weekend.\nThe task has no time limit anyway; it’s more important to go home and deal with mosquitoes first.\nThe house was, as usual, empty.\nLin Li had an accident when he was young, losing his father and taking a year off from school, so at seventeen, he’s still in the first year of high school. His mother has a decent job but is often away on business trips.\nTechnically, Lin Li is more suited for boarding, but since he insists on commuting and the house is quite close to the school, his mother lets him be.\nClearly, opening the window to let mosquitoes in is an irrational act, and swatting them one by one, even if it means just eight mosquitoes, can be quite tiresome.\nWhile he was locking his bicycle downstairs, a lot of small insects were already hovering above, but Lin Li knew these were non-bloodsucking chironomids or gnats, definitely not the task targets.\nSo upon returning home, without even taking off his shoes, he grabbed the electric mosquito swatter and sleeves, heading back to the community park.\nNo, what he took was the special tool, the \"Electric Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow Swatter\"!\nWith this killer weapon, the Blood Crows are in danger!\nLin Li walked to the bushes, swinging in a horizontal sweep, crackling and thrashing, worthy of a path filled with sparks and lightning.\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (3/10).]\nAs expected, other mosquitoes were not counted; the sound just now was absolutely more than one.\nSo Lin Li continued to swing the electric mosquito swatter—heavy chops, upward strikes, slanting cuts...\nAll in all, wasn’t he pretty much a Cultivator wielding a weapon to eliminate the Little Demon Heaven Blood Crows?\n\"Mom, what’s this brother doing?\" At this time, a mother holding a child walked past Lin Li, and the child in her arms pointed at Lin Li curiously.\nThe somewhat embarrassed Cultivator didn’t dare look back.\n\"Little Bao really dislikes mosquitoes, right? Brother is helping us get rid of these mosquitoes.\"\n\"Oh, brother is so amazing!\"\nThank you, unknown auntie! When I succeed in cultivation, I’ll see that you and Bai Bufan ascend together!\nThe footsteps behind him had already gone far, and Lin Li, touched, continued to swing the Electric Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow Swatter in his hand.\nHowever, Lin Li still had the feeling that the footsteps behind him had suddenly sped up.\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (9/10).]\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (10/10).]\n[Task one completed.]\n[You’ve acquired Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption rate increased by 100%; System Currency*50.]\n[Born with extraordinary talent! Unexpectedly, you successfully eliminated ten Little Demon Heaven Blood Crows in less than an hour! Neighbors and fellow villagers are all amazed at your speed, and they hail you as a hero!\nWhy not strike while the iron is hot, and engage in one more thrilling battle, thoroughly shocking the Blood Crow Race, so they dare not offend again!]\n[Time-limited task triggered!]\n[Task one: Within twelve hours, personally eliminate a hundred Little Demon Heaven Blood Crows frequently marauding and attacking villagers in your surrounding village.]\n[Rewards: Title: Blood Crow Assassin (When worn, the Blood Crow Race will feel genuine fear towards you, and no strong member of the race will dare approach you);\nPhysical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption rate increased by 100%; System Currency*50.]\nUnexpectedly, an additional derived task was triggered, with quite generous rewards: a title in addition to the original task rewards.\nHowever... do normal cultivation systems even issue game-like titles like this? Isn’t it more fitting to directly modify physique to be a nemesis of the Blood Crow Race?\nWell, such is my system, after all.\nAfter a brief mental complaint, Lin Li continued swinging his divine weapon.\nA fairly easy task, making Lin Li feel like he was in a badminton game.\nHowever, Lin Li soon noticed something off.\nDespite swinging so many times, the task progress was still at 0; it couldn’t be that he didn’t hit any mosquitoes with all that crackling and thrashing.\nWhat’s going on?\nFrowning, Lin Li compared the differences between the two task one’s descriptions and noticed that the latter’s task description contained the two additional words ’personally.’\n\"...\" Lin Li swallowed.\n\"Slap!\" With the electric mosquito swatter stuck at his waist, Lin Li clapped a mosquito dead by his ear with his hands.\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (1/100).]\n\"...\"\nNo way, what kind of dumb system is this?\nWhen the task description says ’personally,’ does it really mean it has to be personally done?\nSystem, be glad you’re not sentient, or I would thoroughly question your familial relations in four languages.\nLin Li sighed, placing the electric mosquito swatter on the bench next to him.\nAs the system with the sole right to interpret, he had no choice but to comply.\nAlthough it’s slightly troublesome, after all, it’s merely a task without difficulty, just taking more time.\nPoor thing, being in the midst of summer, he had to stand alone in the grass, slapping left then right.\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (2/100).]\n...\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (46/100).]\n\"Mom, what’s that brother doing now, why isn’t he even using the mosquito swatter?\"\nThe familiar voice returned, seemingly that mother and child had come back from a walk around.\nThis time, facing the child’s question, the mother hesitated for a moment.\nLin Li, still clapping, wore a bitter smile and dared not turn around.\nAfter a long while, the mother finally spoke:\n\"Little Bao, remember when mom told you, there are many people in this world less fortunate than you, born missing something, for some it’s part of their body, others it’s part of their brain.\nBut Little Bao, remember, you must never discriminate against these people for their deficiencies, instead, treat them kindly.\"\n\"Oh, so this brother is intelligence...\"\n\"Hush!\"\nThe footsteps behind him turned into almost a run.\nNow deemed part of the intellectually challenged group, Lin Li showed a neutral smile, while his hands kept on ’clapping.’\nHate you, unknown auntie! When I succeed in cultivation, I’ll make sure you and Bai Bufan ascend together (physically)!\n...\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (99/100).]\n[Killed Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow (100/100).]\n[Task one completed.]\n[You’ve acquired the title: Blood Crow Assassin (automatically equipped); Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption rate increased by 100%; System Currency*50.]",

Why did nothing happen to him?\n\"Is it because I don’t actually know how to absorb spiritual qi? So no matter how many times zero is multiplied, it’s still zero?\" Lin Li concluded.\n\"Shouldn’t the first reward of a normal cultivation system be an advanced Foundation Establishment Method...\"\n\"How am I supposed to absorb spiritual qi?\"\nLin Li searched online for some mystic things, attempting meditation and breathing exercises.\nNo effect.\n\"Wait,\" Lin Li raised his head, \"Did I overlook a major issue?\"\n\"I didn’t transmigrate, is it possible that there’s simply no spiritual qi in the modern world?\"\nHe fell silent.\nEven if he becomes an ultra-sensitive spiritual qi skin in the future and masters the top spiritual qi star attraction method, if there’s no so-called spiritual qi in the modern world, the ultimate result is still zero.\nAfter all, as the saying goes, one cannot make bricks without straw.\n\"...\"\nThe more Lin Li thought, the more he felt that there’s no spiritual qi in modern times; otherwise, those exotic treasures from novels should’ve appeared long ago.\nThis... this...\nSpiritual qi sensitive skin is meaningless, currency can’t be used, so summing up today’s gains, didn’t he just get a mosquito repellent aura and become a walking Liushen?\nReally want to greet the system’s family.\nLin Li, somewhat heartbroken, lay on the bed in a wooden figure posture, sighed at the sky.\n\"Buzz~~~\"\nA mosquito flew over at this moment, landing on Lin Li’s nose.\n\"?\"\n\"Snap!\"\n\"Dude, isn’t my aura still active? How dare Blood Crow approach me?\"\nLin Li carefully examined the mosquito corpse in his hand, then his pupils shrank drastically!\nGoddamn it! It’s a flower mosquito!\nAedes albopictus, the easiest way to differentiate it from ordinary mosquitoes is its white stripes, more viruses it carries, the itchier the bites, and the longer healing time required!\nLin Li remembered, the Blood Crow Assassin title effect noted that it only intimidates the weak among the Blood Crow Race, ineffective against the strong!\nDamn!\nOrdinary mosquitoes are Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow, then this flower mosquito is at least Great Demon Heaven Blood Crow! Yes, it’s absolutely a strong individual in the Blood Crow Race.\nAura is ineffective against it!\nLin Li silently got up and reinserted the electric mosquito repellent.\nThen he heavily plopped onto the bed again, the appearance of this flower mosquito dealt Lin Li another heavy slap to his candle-in-the-wind-like gains today.\nHe’s not even as good as Liushen...\nOriginally, Lin Li thought that his future would inevitably be smooth sailing, now he somehow feels... it might be a tad more bumpy than planned.\nLin Li picked up his phone, Bai Bufan had already sent over tomorrow’s breakfast list and money.\n「Lin Li: Bro, when I said I’d treat you to breakfast earlier, I was kidding, forget I ever said it, rice noodle rolls with egg for six bucks, not a penny less.」\n「Bai Bufan: ? Are you even human?」\n「Lin Li: Life’s like this, plans always can’t keep up with changes.」\n「Bai Bufan: Forget it, I’ve been making money in the stock market lately, don’t care about this six or eight bucks, giving you four more, consider it a reward, Xiaolin.」\n「Bai Bufan: ’Congratulations on getting rich.’」\n「Lin Li: ?」\n「Lin Li: What stocks are you messing with, are you even of age to play with stocks?」\nBai Bufan’s only sixteen, can’t open an account, how could he trade stocks, even if using a family account, all trading hours are during class, never seen him play with his phone for this either, can’t possibly be a high-end long-term player.\nBai Bufan hasn’t used the class’s interactive whiteboard to show off K-line charts either.\n「Bai Bufan: You don’t get it, do you? I not only trade stocks but have never lost money in trading so far.」\n「Lin Li: Really? How do you do it?」\n「Bai Bufan: Haha, would I lie to you? Seeing you’re my good brother, I’ll bestow my secret method to you as a master!」\n「First, you must join various investor groups, study stock trading knowledge seriously, obtain various inside information.」\n「Congratulate group members profusely when their stocks hit limit-up, prompting them to send celebration red envelopes; comfort them when their stocks hit limit-down, encouraging them to send turnaround red envelopes.」\n「Remember, the most important thing is to never buy stocks.」\n「Hehe, the stock market seems good tonight, I actually grabbed dozens of bucks in red envelopes, delightful.」\n\"...\"\n「Lin Li: Bai Bufan, I admit it, you’re absolutely a stock trading genius.」\n「Bai Bufan: Talent and hard work, both indispensable.」\nPutting the phone aside, Lin Li, in a good mood again, began searching for the path of life once more.\nIt’s definitely not hopeless; not mentioning an unopened [Shop], there should be plenty of useful items inside.\nEven right now, in the task two hanging in my taskbar, its reward includes a ’Spirit Stone’.\nThere must be spiritual qi in Spirit Stones, then I can certainly rely on Spirit Stones to embark on the path of cultivation.\nOnce I cultivate to a point where my body can self-generate spiritual qi, I can achieve inner circulation.\nBut Lin Li’s facial expression is a bit twisted now.\nNo other reason, just that he discovered the prerequisite condition for the task to eradicate the Hehuan Demon hideout, four blank characters— enter the fray personally.\nThis broken system, Lin Li has already grasped a bit of its nature from the previous two tasks.\nIf it asks you to complete personally, you must complete personally.\nIf it demands you enter the fray personally, you must do just that.\nYet... this is an anti-vice task, how the hell am I supposed to enter the fray personally?\nOkay, to be honest, entering the fray in person is actually quite simple, but isn’t it really inappropriate?\nWhen I become part of those being busted, how will I explain?\nIf I can’t explain clearly, even if my cultivation path becomes bright from then on, my life will certainly be darkened.\nHaving spent the night fighting mosquitoes, Lin Li found his exercise levels a bit over the top, as sleepiness crept over while reflecting, eventually closing his eyes.\nLeaving behind a final murmur before sleep:\n\"System, I fucked it up like a blessing...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 5: Chapter 5 According to Unofficial History\n\"Beep beep beep! Beep beep beep!\"\nLin Li uses an Android phone, but that doesn’t stop him from setting the Apple heart pacemaker as his wake-up alarm.\nHonestly, this sound is at a level that can cause a heart attack just by hearing it.\n[A day’s plan starts in the morning! The rising sun from the east can shatter the darkness! Those who ascend the supreme path all have unwavering hearts and firm faith; becoming the strongest begins in the morning!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task 1: Get up and start earnest physical training by 5:00 AM, accumulating at least half an hour before 7:00 AM.]\n[Reward: Cultivation Technique: Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.]\nThis was not triggered when Lin Li woke up, but was only seen after waking up.\nYesterday he was complaining about not getting the cultivation technique first; it seems the system activation time was a bit off. If it were in the morning, this task should have appeared first.\nFrom 5:00 to 7:00 is the specified time, meaning the system wants him to wake up before 5:00 and train for at least an hour before 7:00.\nIt doesn’t seem too hard, but it can only be done tomorrow.\nGet up, wash, and ride a bike to school.\nSometimes you really have to admit, when the teacher says you can hear our class from the stairwell, it’s true.\nBai Bufan’s voice is quite distinctive, and now it seems like he’s telling a story:\n\"According to unofficial history, back then Zhao Zilong slaughtered so many that the army at Changban Slope was in disarray, but that Changban Slope was no pushover either; she was the top courtesan of Yihong Courtyard!\nAt the speed of light, Changban Slope unleashed a move, and Zhao Zilong instantly lost his footing, never to...\"\n\"Your unofficial history is too wild.\"\n\"Nothing but history remains wild!\"\n\"Is this too wild? Then let’s change to another. According to unofficial history, Lv Fengxian was never really a traitor with three allegiances; that’s a complete fallacy. He was actually...\"\n\"This one’s even more of a heavyweight.\"\n\"Kids, it’s meal time!\" When Lin Li appeared at the back door, it was like a zookeeper entering the zoo at feeding time. Instantly a group of people swarmed toward him, each taking away their breakfast.\nLin Li doesn’t charge extra fees, as they’re all classmates. Generally, they would invite him to share some food as a reward, and Lin Li doesn’t mind that.\nBut Lin Li has also told them, if he wakes up late, he won’t risk being late himself to get everyone’s breakfast. Of course, those who end up with no breakfast can go to the school shop during breaks to buy a pack of toast.\nNo one complains about such trivial matters—those who do complain, Lin Li doesn’t bother befriending, let alone fetching breakfast for them.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan returned to their seats.\nWatching Bai Bufan eat, Lin Li pondered his second task and sincerely asked, \"Bufan.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Have you ever visited a prostitute?\"\nBai Bufan almost sprayed out the rice noodle he just put in his mouth. After taking a sip of water to calm down, he looked at Lin Li in shock: \"Huh?\"\n\"Do you know the process?\" Lin Li thought Bai Bufan didn’t hear clearly, so he repeated the question.\n\"I... am very interested, please elaborate.\" Bai Bufan seemed not to answer the question; he sat upright, listening more attentively than in class.\nOrdinary people rarely ask such questions, so Bai Bufan lowered his voice and asked:\n\"Brother Zilong, are you planning to find a Changban Slope too?\"\n\"You left so hurriedly yesterday; could it be...\" Bai Bufan gradually understood everything, followed by a betrayal’s inquiry and confusion: \"So you’ve already betrayed our Virgin Association, haven’t you?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"How did the conversation get here? I was just asking if you know about it.\"\n\"How would I know about this? How are we any different? We’re both just people who stick around in the Daoist temple.\nAnd although I’m very interested, if you actually asked me to do such a thing, I wouldn’t dare. I can’t even imagine how awkward life would be if I got caught.\" Bai Bufan shook his head.\nLin Li nodded deeply in agreement.\nHe didn’t get the information but could understand.\nIt’s at least a county-level key high school, so asking here is indeed a bit too much.\nIt would be more effective to find a Huang Mao thug on the street, but it’d be easy to get beaten up.\nBetter to scout around these days and take formal action over the weekend.\nAt this moment, Bai Bufan suspiciously glanced at Lin Li: \"You’re really not going?\"\n\"I abhor gambling and drugs, how could I do such a thing.\" Lin Li snorted.\n\"Although I’m not quite convinced, Lin Li, if you really intend to do such a thing, you’d better be careful. In recent years, the crackdown on prostitution has been severe; I’m actually part of it myself, deeply aware of its ways.\" Bai Bufan patted Lin Li’s shoulder, offering advice sincerely.\n\"You’ve been caught in a sweep?\"\n\"I’m freaking part of the anti-prostitution team!\"\n\"Heh.\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"You don’t believe me? You should know, I once dismantled multiple obscene groups in just one day!\" Bai Bufan said with a blown-up voice and glaring eyes.\n\"You have the nerve to call me a traitor!? It’s people like you, turning informer in sage mode, who are the true traitors to humanity!\" Lin Li got angry.\nA person like Bai Bufan doesn’t deserve to be his brother.\n\"I didn’t break them up by reporting. I despise such spies, how could I do something like that.\" Bai Bufan showed a hint of sadness in his eyes.\n\"Huh? Then how did you do it?\"\n\"I dissolved them.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"So you were the group leader, afraid of getting caught, so you dissolved it?\"\nThat logic was indeed correct.\nSo he really did dissolve the group chat completely.\nBai Bufan ate his rice noodle mournfully, without answering, yet the silence was an answer in itself.\n\"You, my friend, you are the true hero.\" Lin Li said solemnly.\nA person like Bai Bufan, Lin Li must be lifelong brothers with him.\n\"Wait, you never added me to your group!\"\nRevoke the lifelong brother statement; Bai Bufan remains purely a scoundrel.\n\"This is my middle school story, ten years ago, I didn’t know you, you didn’t belong to me~\"\n\"Haha, as expected of my brother, a young hero!\"\n\"Language test papers need to be collected.\" As it was nearing morning reading, the classroom had become nearly full, and the class’ language representative stood up to tell all group leaders.\n\"Guangzhi, save me!\" Lin Li froze for a moment, then shouted abruptly.\nSince last night, all he had in his mind was Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow; who would remember this stuff!\nAnd the hardest to copy, with the most words: the language homework!\nCursive script, activate!\nNo matter Zhang Xu, Huang Tingjian, Wang Xizhi, in front of an extremely angry Lin Li, he truly is the king of cursive script.\nCan you even write grass for real?\nI freaking copy-copy-copy-copy-copy!\nLuckily this test paper doesn’t require composing an essay, otherwise Lin Li would have had to pull out the story of his mom carrying him through rainy days to the hospital again.\nFortunately, it only needs to be collected before the language class, and the group leader, seeing Lin Li writing furiously, didn’t make things difficult for him.\n\"Ding ding ding!\" The class bell rang.\n\"Turn to ’The Ten Thoughts of Advising Emperor Taizong’, and begin morning reading.\" The language representative was already standing at the podium.\n\"I’ve heard that those who wish trees to thrive must ensure their roots; those who aspire to long rivers must...\"\n\"What’s the song today?\" Taking out the textbook, Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li and asked.\n\"Whatever.\"\n\"Then, ’Silence’ it is.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Only the piano remains to accompany me all day long~\" With Chinese language book of compulsory dictation two held in front, Bai Bufan sang emotionally.\n\"The sleeping cello, quietly and old~\" Lin Li, with hands constantly moving and head unwavered, joined in right after.\n\"I think you’ve already made it very clear~\"\n\"...\"\nTwo of them sang to each other, deeply.\nBecause they both knew very well.\nIf there’s no effort in morning reading, singing K will only lead to sorrow.",

I have time now, let’s do a quick correction,\" the Chinese teacher asked.\nThe group leader cast a sympathetic look towards Lin Li.\nLin Li also understood, you can never be too proud, even in your heart, karma will come.\n...\n\"I have to say, this Binbin is pretty lame, just letting you off like that. At least make you write a 300,000 to 400,000-word reflection paper, or hang you at the school gate or something,\"\nDuring the break after morning reading, Bai Bufan watched Lin Li, who emerged from the staircase corner, limbs intact and mentally healthy—just having been scolded by the Chinese teacher—and said with some regret.\n\"300,000 to 400,000 words? Did I violate the heavenly rules?\" Lin Li raised his middle finger and then joined the boys’ Jenga group.\n—— At school, when a boy leans against the corridor railing, other boys will inexplicably stack up on him.\nDescribing it using hieroglyphics, it’s probably like—州.\nLuckily, they were all wearing pants.\nThe Chinese teacher is in her forties, has a good personality, and is quite nice to students.\nOf course, the most important reason might be that she’s not the homeroom teacher for Class 4 of Grade 10.\nAs everyone knows, whether a teacher is a homeroom teacher or not can greatly impact their demeanor.\nThe Class 4 homeroom teacher remains the stern middle-aged math teacher Xue Jian, who practically carries a terror aura full of buffs.\nStrangers, beware.\nGood brother Bai Bufan once suffered a big loss in front of him.\nIt was a weekend when Bai Bufan and Teacher Xue met outside school, and they were going the same way.\nOnly those who have experienced that situation know how awkward it is, the time after ’hello teacher’ is all torture.\nThe then despairing Bai Bufan saw an old grandpa carrying something, struggling, so he came up with a plan—help the grandpa.\nThis way, he could do a good deed and also escape the homeroom teacher, so he immediately decided to help.\nThe plan was actually quite perfect.\nBut the problem was he was too flustered at the time, and he said to the old grandpa, \"Hey, old thing, grandpa, let me help you carry this.\"\nWhat happened afterward, Bai Bufan wouldn’t say.\nHis eyes were full of stories, or accidents.\nOne slip of the tongue becomes a lasting hasty regret.\n\"Buzz buzz buzz——\" the preparatory bell rang.\nThe break at Nansang Middle School is ten minutes, but at the eighth minute, the preparatory bell rings to remind students that class is about to start.\nThe unfair part is that when class reaches 32 minutes, there is no preparatory bell for the end of the class.\nLin Li thought this was still necessary, as many teachers felt like they didn’t prepare for a forty-minute class but for a fifty-minute class.\nEveryone returned to the classroom, and soon the formal class bell rang, and the first class was Chinese, and the Chinese teacher walked in.\n\"Class begins.\"\n\"Stand up!\"\n\"Hello, students.\"\n\"Hello, teacher.\"\n\"Sit down.\"\n\"Everyone, open your textbooks to page 144, let’s continue with ’The Ten Discourses on the Duties of a Monarch’...\"\nLin Li’s action of flipping the book paused as the system sent him another notification.\n[Just one day into the Cultivation Realm, you were quickly recognized and taken as a formal disciple by the Nansang Sect, stirring up the storm, stepping onto the ladder of destiny.]\n[Experience of predecessors, treasure of future generations, Elder and Sect Leader are willing to generously impart knowledge and skills, you should study diligently! Make them your own!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Three: During the teachings and lessons given by sect leaders, stewards, and guardians, listen and study seriously, accumulating six hours.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Memory Boost by 100%; System Currency *50.]\nNansang Middle School just turned into Nansang Sect all of a sudden.\nIt seems this low-tier system was probably troubled, as I was already a sect disciple when it was activated, so it had to make do this way.\nLin Li was quite gratified.\nBecause this time, the task reward is definitely useful; though the absorption base for spiritual qi might always be zero, memory certainly isn’t, and the task isn’t difficult to complete, just a matter of accumulating time.\nTwelve hours, the counting method is not specific numbers; the system displays an elongated progress bar, but it doesn’t show the specific percentage, only an estimate.\nBut according to eight classes a day, each forty minutes, it could be completed in three days at the fastest; if any teacher extends the class, or uses self-study time for teaching, maybe two days would suffice.\nFuture is promising.\nLin Li looked up, smiling at Elder Li of the Nansang Sect.\nUnconsciously, even Li Binbin’s face became clear and attractive.\nThe sect elder also smiled, \"Lin Li, can you answer the question I just asked?\"\nWithout having listened, Lin Li stood up: \"...\"\nLooking at Li Binbin’s encouraging gaze, the other party genuinely meant no harm this time.\nDamn, I forgot, it’s taboo to make eye contact with the teacher during class, especially since I brought it upon myself by smiling.\nDoesn’t this look like I’m eager to answer the question, signaling that I know the answer?\nFrom Li Binbin’s perspective, it seemed like Lin Li didn’t do his homework and wanted to make a good impression in class to make amends.\nAs a true back-row student, when asked by the teacher, one should seriously admire the desk and sigh at how desk-like the desk is!\n\"Choose C.\" Bai Bufan, with his head down, transmitted his voice over a whisper.\nLin Li stepped on Bai Bufan’s shoe.\nIt’s a Chinese class discussing a text, and you’re telling me to choose C, don’t I know what you’re up to, Bai Bufan, you troublemaker!\n\"It’s really option C, we were just discussing an example question!\"\n\"...\"\n\"It should be option C.\" After ’serious consideration,’ Lin Li said to the sect elder.\n\"Correct, sit down. Remember, in this translation, never translate as ’of’ or use personal pronouns...\" Li Binbin nodded, signalling Lin Li to sit down.\nLin Li sat down, let out a sigh of relief, but someone’s resentful gaze made him uneasy.\n\"I’ll keep watching you, keep watching you, keep...\" The resentful voice also came through.\n\"Lunch on my meal card.\" Lin Li, looking guilty out of the window, said with little confidence.\nActually, it’s not Lin Li’s fault; among brothers, there should be bonds like this.\nSwitching places, if Bai Bufan were in this situation, Lin Li would undoubtedly have tripped him up as well.\nWait, thinking this makes me feel even more ashamed.\n\"Dinner on my meal card too.\"\n\"You better not backtrack like last night.\"\nConversation ended for the moment, before attending the lesson, Lin Li glanced at the system again.\nTask Three’s progress bar was at zero.",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Chapter 7: When Kabuta is lonely, will he lift weights?\nThe progress bar was long, but it was empty inside. Although the time spent in class was short, it shouldn’t be like this.\nAfter reviewing the mission again, Lin Li thought he knew the reason — he wasn’t serious enough.\nThe mission description contained the word \"serious.\"\nThe rigid system naturally doesn’t recognize uncommitted study.\n\"Damn, zoning out isn’t permitted either.\" Realizing this, Lin Li rubbed his temples.\nIt certainly couldn’t be completed in two days, because it’s difficult for normal people to stay focused for a long time. But Lin Li wasn’t making excuses; he had started paying attention in class and trying to keep up with the Sect Elders.\nSure enough, after more than ten minutes had passed, during a short break when the teacher was drinking water, Lin Li activated the system, and the progress bar had moved a little.\nLin Li took a deep breath, \"Come on! Study seriously!\"\nThis mission was a win-win for Lin Li; both emotionally and logically, there was nothing that could stop him from giving it his all to complete it.\n\"Lin Li, I suddenly have a question. Tell me, is the stuff that Optimus Prime emits engine oil?\"\nIf he excretes too much and gets exhausted, does it turn into windshield washer fluid?\"\nSuch questions often arise during class, so Bai Bufan turned his head to ask.\nLin Li responded with a cold glare, sitting upright as if a first-grade teacher had taught him ’follow what I do, and I’ll mimic you,’ with his normally slightly hunched back now straight as an arrow.\nBai Bufan, just a stumbling block on the road to learning, no need to bother with.\n\"When Zhao Zilong gets lonely, he looks for Changban Slope. Does Optimus Prime book an online ride when he’s lonely?\" The genius Bai Bufan continued to ask.\nShit!\nLin Li’s fists clenched, his gaze locked on Li Binbin. Now he wasn’t afraid of eye contact because Lin Li was truly paying attention in class and could answer if called upon.\nHold it in!\nDidn’t hear it didn’t hear it didn’t hear it, dear ears, please automatically block out Bai Bufan’s silly mouth.\nBai Bufan? Just bullshit.\n\"But here’s another question. If Optimus Prime got caught booking an online ride, would the police station or the DMV handle it?\" Without getting a response, but that’s okay, Bai Bufan, being such a strong character, could carry on by himself.\n\"Hey, does Optimus Prime look on a used car platform for separated housewives?\"\n\"...\"\nSeeing that Lin Li still hadn’t responded, Bai Bufan stopped pursuing Optimus Prime and gave Lin Li a puzzled glance before turning his head back.\nFinally, it’s quiet.\nLin Li let out a long sigh, feeling as if he had climbed over the biggest hurdle on his journey of studying! This is the strong determination a Cultivator should have!\nIf I, Lin Li, cannot attain immortality, who can?\nHonestly, Bai Bufan is truly quite dim; how could Optimus Prime possibly book an online ride?\nOnline car services only summon small vehicles, and seeing Optimus Prime’s size, they’d surely opt for a refund immediately, wouldn’t they? Those cars would be totaled just for picking him up!\nIt’s common for a small horse to pull a big car, but having a big horse pull a small car is quite rare.\nSo even if Optimus Prime got lonely, he’d definitely go for a cargo truck service. Bai Bufan’s thinking isn’t thorough enough.\nBesides, Optimus Prime is a Cybertronian robot. If he called a cargo truck service and got caught, it would be an interstellar issue, definitely not something the DMV could handle. It would certainly need to be reported...\nLin Li’s subconscious thoughts paused.\nShit!\nDamned Bai Bufan!\nI thought I had made it through, only to get distracted again!\nForget it, forget it. Adjust the mindset and start paying attention again.\nStudy!\nLin Li rode through the ocean of Chinese literature.\n\"Lin Li, do you think Kabuta lifts weights when he’s lonely?\" Just then, Bai Bufan’s eerie voice came through again.\nShit! Damn it! Dammit! Screw!\nBai Bufan’s silence was not for quiet but to mess with Kabuta after Optimus Prime!\n\"Teacher! Bai Bufan is disrupting my studies, I request he be moved to the back of the class!\" Lin Li became what he once despised - the teacher’s pet, the sneaky tattletale.\nLin Li turned his head, while Bai Bufan looked back at him, bewildered.\nAfter a brief confusion, the emotion showing at the bottom of his eyes was called the sorrow of betrayal — Lin Li, have you forgotten all our good times?\nBut because their relationship was so close, Lin Li felt no burden facing such a gaze, even showing a faint smile — Yes, indeed.\n\"Teacher, I’m innocent, that’s not how it was, actually Lin Li is disturbing my study.\" The two brothers turned against each other, Bai Bufan asserted firmly.\n\"You, stand at the back.\" In fact, the view from the podium is a lot clearer than most people imagine. It’s just that most teachers have no time to manage everyone’s little antics, so Li Binbin easily discerned ’who was right and who was wrong.’\n\"Lord Li, seriously, I’m being framed. You’ve been blinded by Lin Li, the treacherous minister——\"\n\"Quiet.\"\n\"Oh.\" Bai Bufan stood up and moved to the back.\nThis was much more comfortable, though that resentful gaze hadn’t disappeared, and there seemed to be a sound from hell wafting through:\n\"I’ll keep watching you, forever~~\"\n\"Bufan, stand further back, towards the backboard.\" Noticing this, exorcist master Li Binbin spoke again at this time.\n\"...Oh.\"\nLin Li was completely comfortable.\n...\n\"Are you human? Say something! Bai Bufan, are you even human? Five dishes, not even adding rice, do you take me for a slaughtered pig? How can this world have a beast like you?\" In the cafeteria, after finding a place to sit, Lin Li erupted, heartbroken.\nThe school cafeteria offers a select-your-own dish system, and because of subsidies, the prices are actually quite cheap — a meat dish starts at four yuan, a vegetable dish at two yuan, with rice and soup free, and the soup contains lots of ingredients.\nIf you use a big ladle and spiraled it at the bottom, you could scoop up a bowl full of ingredients from the soup.\nLin Li, a day student, rarely eats out either at noon or at night, always dining in the cafeteria together.\nUsually, one would get one meat dish with two vegetables or two meat dishes with one vegetable; no one ever does like Bai Bufan getting five meat dishes, especially without even adding rice like some rich Brother Fu.\nBecause he’s using his own card, Bai Bufan isn’t a Brother Fu, but a beast.\n\"This is what I deserve; if there wasn’t a lack of space, even five wouldn’t stop me!\" Bai Bufan laughed triumphantly as if great revenge had been taken.\n\"If you don’t finish them, just wait for me to keep watching you closely.\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"Hehe, I’ve considered that. Didn’t you notice, the portions here are actually quite small. I’ve even asked the auntie to shake her hands more, just in case I can’t finish! But don’t worry, the price hasn’t been reduced at all!\" Bai Bufan proudly patted his chest.\nLin Li coldly watched Bai Bufan.\nHe needed a word more offensive than beastly.\n\"I’ve decided, I’ll study medicine in the future, so when I stab you, I can ensure to avoid vital spots as much as possible, making the pain last longer.\" Lin Li declared.\n\"Rebound,\" Bai Bufan asked more curiously, \"Seriously, Lin Li, I’m really curious, what’s gotten into you today, why have you been studying so intensely the whole day.\"\nHe was intensely focused, almost entirely absorbed in class.\nIf it were just for one language class, Bai Bufan would think Lin Li was just being erratic, but Lin Li maintained this state for the entire morning!\n\"Hehe, people change, from now on, I’ve decided to reform.\" Lin Li replied ethereally.\nBai Bufan swallowed a gulp.\nThen suddenly got up, made a hand seal in front of Lin Li, then pointed at him:\n\"Om mani padme hum! Om mani padme hum!\"\n\"Hah! Monster!\"\n\"I don’t care who you are, come off my good brother immediately! Or I’ll be impolite!\"",

I didn’t expect you still have some skills, then I’ll have to ask my old man to possess me!\nMonsters and ghosts, leave quickly, monsters and ghosts, leave quickly—\"\nFacing Bai Bufan’s antics, Lin Li looked up at him and said nothing.\nBut silence is more eloquent than words.\nBai Bufan understood the meaning of that look—where’s this silly boy from, don’t want to admit I know you.\nDoing this in the canteen is indeed a bit embarrassing, feeling the surrounding gazes as if looking at a foolish child, Bai Bufan sat down sheepishly, and then asked with interest:\n\"So what’s really up with you, did something trigger you?\nDid Chen Yu Ying tell you if you rank in the top hundred of your grade you can confess to her? Or did your relatives mock you as a loser, prompting you to set a three-week goal to make them see you in a new light?\"\nChen Yu Ying is the class president of Class Four, already considered the best-looking girl in the class, plus she knows how to dress up, so her looks are top-notch in Class Four.\n——Nansang doesn’t allow makeup, dressing up means managing a hairstyle that suits oneself, paired with small accessories like hair clips, wristbands, necklaces, and slightly adjusting the loose school uniform and other methods.\nLin Li has a good impression of her, but it’s out of an appreciation for beauty, frankly, it can even be understood as attraction, a kind of liking all boys have for pretty girls.\nAs for liking or even loving to that extent, absolutely not.\nOf course, if Chen Yu Ying were to confess to him, Lin Li thinks he’d be happy to accept—though it’s daydreaming, but teenage boys mostly hold such little fantasies.\nAs for why Bai Bufan brought this up, it’s purely because Lin Li helped Chen Yu Ying bring breakfast a few times, under these circumstances, even if friends know the inside story, they would deliberately tease.\n\"Bufan, your top priority now is to uninstall Qidian Reading, you’re a good kid, why did your brain get silly from reading novels?\" Lin Li sipped some soup and said somewhat regretfully, skipping Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Hehe~\" Bai Bufan scratched his head, then realized: \"So you’re purely suddenly wanting to study hard? Just like I planned to quit indulgences before?\"\n\"You can interpret it that way, I feel guilty if I don’t study hard, I need to strive. But, please don’t equate it with your quitting indulgences.\" Lin Li warned very formally.\nAt the time, Bai Bufan quit indulgences for a week, during those seven days:\nDay one of quitting indulgences.\nDay one of quitting indulgences.\nDay two of quitting indulgences.\nDay one of quitting indulgences.\nDay two of quitting indulgences.\nDay three of quitting indulgences.\nMinus two days of quitting indulgences.\nThe reason it was minus two days by the seventh day was because that day he went to a temple for practice as revenge, the frequency was too much, one day was better than three.\n\"Haha, don’t speak too soon.\" Bai Bufan responded, \"I don’t think you’ll last long.\"\n\"...Maybe not.\" Lin Li didn’t refute Bai Bufan because he thought, after completing this mission, it might be challenging to maintain such high-intensity focused studying, no need to boast.\nMoreover, Lin Li discovered a point he couldn’t help but criticize about the system.\nIn the morning, he had five periods: Chinese, English, Physics, General Technical, Mathematics.\nFor English class, regardless of how seriously Lin Li studied, the progress bar didn’t increase at all.\nThat low-functioning system doesn’t recognize English as a subject, though if you forcefully try to understand, it’s not impossible—after all, in the Cultivation Realm, English is probably considered a useless foreign language.\nYou say: \"How are you?\"\nExpert: \"What gibberish are you speaking? Not speaking human language, die!\"\nThis system has its own personal preferences.\nHowever, Lin Li’s English performance was average, and his speaking was a disaster, so he agreed with the system.\nKeep in mind, the first word in the English college entrance exam 3500-word dictionary is ’abandon’, give up.\nBut after improving memory, English grades will naturally rise, English once you have the vocabulary, and once you can understand the content, it’s actually really quite simple.\nAlso, Lin Li tried, after class, even if he engaged in serious focused preview and review segments, it still didn’t affect the progress bar.\nYou can only say this system remains extremely old-fashioned, saying it must fulfill the prior condition of having a master teaching within the sect to be acknowledged.\nIt seems he’s destined to get involved in the system.\nAfter lunch, Lin Li went to the convenience store to buy some snacks, mainly because when focused, people quickly become fatigued and need to supplement some nutrients.\nThese days, he must have some on hand.\n...\nWhen the evening self-study dismissal bell rang, Lin Li dashed out of the classroom just like yesterday.\n\"Lin Li must have someone outside keeping him company behind my back.\" Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li’s back and commented with deep meaning.\n\"Think positively, maybe it’s not a person, but a Komodo dragon.\" Bai Bufan’s roommate Zhou Baowei came to console him.\n\"As long as it’s not a girl, it’s fine.\" Bai Bufan said.\n\"You really like guys? Damn, are you still wearing white socks! You’re not allowed to sit on my bed in the future!\" Zhou Baowei covered his butt and retreated.\n\"Silly boy, I’m genuinely afraid Lin Li might find a girl outside,\" Bai Bufan scratched his hair, a bit frustrated, \"if my brother lives well, that’d hurt me more than being killed! I’m willing to trade half my single life for Lin Li’s lifelong singleness.\"\n\"Extreme one-to-one trade, your brotherhood is acknowledged.\" Zhou Baowei raised his thumb, \"Lucky I’m not close to you.\"\n\"Who do you think I would use the rest of my half-life to trade for lifelong singleness?\" Bai Bufan looked up at Zhou Baowei.\n\"...\"\nZhou Baowei: \"Damn you——\"\n...\nLin Li didn’t know he was already being cursed.\nHe had already cycled to the location of mission two, the chicken farm.\nHowever, he didn’t rush inside. Instead, he cycled opposite and took out his phone, pretending to make a call while walking back and forth across the street.\nIn reality, he was surveying the enemy situation.\nThis kind of chicken farm should have a bit of vigilance, if he stared at the shop without any covering from the outside, he might unconsciously be marked.\nGoing in would definitely get more information, but Lin Li wasn’t planning to do that.\nIt would easily alert the enemy, and the group buying app showed the lowest exploration cost starting at 99.\nStudent IDs couldn’t get discounts, very frustrating.\nHe couldn’t just go in, ask a bunch of questions, then leave directly, that would easily leave troubles for when he really immerses himself later.\nLin Li ’called’ for about half an hour.\nDuring that half an hour, only one group of customers went in, they should be coming for legitimate services—because there was a girl among them inside.\nAt least it wasn’t worthless, got one piece of information, this store doesn’t check IDs.\nThe customers didn’t voluntarily show them, and the front desk didn’t even mention it.\nThink of it, it’s a place hiding chickens in the back, how could it care about these things.\nEven regular places, the age limits for this aren’t strict.\nMoreover, Xiling Town isn’t a big place.\nMost internet cafes here don’t strictly conduct one-by-one ID and face verification either.\nJust bring an adult ID, and you can open a machine—but not excessively, like using grandparents’ IDs, those internet cafes really can’t turn a blind eye.\nSixty-nine-year-old grandma online at the internet café shooting on the battlefield, if checks come, the boss can’t easily avoid responsibility.\nThough today only got this one message, it’s still a harvest, and certainly good news for Lin Li, helping him dive in deeper.\nAfter only observing for half an hour, Lin Li continued to bike home.\nWasting any more time, completing the wake-up task tomorrow would grow exponentially in difficulty.\nSleeping early and waking early, delightful!\nSleeping late and waking early, deadly!\nLuckily, there’s still an English class tomorrow, sorry, English teacher.\n```",

Beep beep beep!\"\nThe devilish sound of the apple heart pacemaker flooded Lin Li’s mind, waking him up.\nAt this moment, the time is 4:30 in the morning.\nThe sky is like a painting with ink slowly emerging, casting a soft glow, as the eastern horizon gradually lightens up, turning from ink to blue, with unknown birds singing melodiously.\nLin Li never thought Xiling Town could be so beautiful at 4 AM.\nLao Da, I finally understand you. I’ve finally become a true man.\nNo one can resist such a beautiful time and scenery. In such circumstances, how can one not do something meaningful?\n——Let’s sleep for just five more minutes, damn, who the hell gets up this early.\nEveryone knows that thirty plus five equals fifty.\nAt 4:50, Lin Li finally reluctantly got out of bed.\nIn fact, he really wanted to get up at 4:59, but he was worried that the stupid system would register the time point for starting exercise just when he finishes washing up and gets downstairs, which would be almost five by then.\nYawning, Lin Li came out from the first floor.\nAt five in the community was not exactly deserted; in fact, when Lin Li arrived at the community park, there were already quite a few people.\nMost of them were old men and women, either chatting or exercising in the park, and some middle-aged people running around the park.\nBut young people like Lin Li were rare, so the elderly around him glanced at Lin Li more than once.\nLin Li felt like he saw a side of this community he had never known before, and it was quite shocking.\n\"Boom-boom-boom, poof-poof, catching and attacking assassins boom-boom-boom——\"\nAn elderly lady, who was obviously over sixty, unexpectedly demonstrated a B-BOX performance in front of Lin Li!\nAnd another elderly man, just as old, was moonwalking, scraping-scraping, it’s the devil’s stride!\nWhat the heck is going on, is this still the country I know?\nIs six o’clock the watershed between two worlds?\nDoes this world really have an inner and outer world?\nOr are these grannies and grandpas trendy Old Dengs with Shanghai IDs?\nBut anyway, Lin Li never hesitated to compliment such strong individuals: \"Grandma, your B-BOX is amazing!\"\n\"What B-thing are you talking about?\" If it weren’t for the questioning tone, Lin Li felt she was scolding him.\n\"What you were just performing...\"\n\"A dandelion flew into my mouth just now, rotten luck.\" The granny got angry again, boom-boom-booming a few more times.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHe looked at the moonwalking grandpa, already losing confidence: \"Grandpa, you just...\"\n\"I stepped on dog poop.\" The old man continued to scrape the sole of his shoe without even looking up.\nBack to the reality, all back to reality, it turns out I’m indeed still in the country, suddenly everyone felt more familiar, of course, that didn’t stop Lin Li from staying a bit away from the Dog Poop Old Deng, while also paying more attention to his own feet.\nLin Li didn’t forget his task, heading to the park plaza.\nA large group of elderly ladies were neatly practicing square dance, but very considerate, without playing music to disturb others, in a way, wasn’t this silent dance the cutting edge of trends?\nAnd quite relaxing.\nLin Li didn’t join them, but found an empty space, near the pavilion, with only one old man in martial arts attire practicing Tai Chi.\nYes, it has a nice Body Refining atmosphere.\nLin Li used the phone stand he brought to fix his phone, then opened the Ba Duan Jin tutorial from a website that appeared once on the Mongolian top single list, then took a deep breath and began to learn exercising.\nSpeaking of which, there’s a lot of roast chicken on B-site, why doesn’t it trigger some tasks or something.\nThe reason for practicing Ba Duan Jin is the task description required Body Refining, Lin Li just tried it, on the way here, the progress bar hadn’t changed, running doesn’t count.\nSo practicing cultivation techniques is necessary, luckily these methods are abundant in the five-thousand-year heritage.\nOnce he saw the progress bar starting to move, Lin Li let out a sigh of relief, his thought was correct, as long as the body also seriously follows along, it counts as practicing seriously.\nThen next, just need to practice diligently for an hour.\nThe old man practicing Tai Chi beside him initially thought Lin Li was just acting on impulse, his movements were very clumsy, barely worth paying attention to, but unexpectedly Lin Li practiced with such dedication.\nEach limb stretched out straight every time, with all his strength, it’s not difficult, but it’s important to note, this was under no supervision, the self-control and perseverance of this young man were terrifyingly strong, the old man nodded with satisfaction.\nA pillar of the nation!\nInfluenced by this emotion, he switched from health-preserving Tai Chi to martial arts Tai Chi, each punch roaring fiercely, he couldn’t lose to this kid!\nThe old man’s hot blood is boiling too!\nYouth!\nThe old man feels youthful craziness! Restores kidney deficiency, sugar-free!\nLin Li didn’t know a fiery elder-themed anime was unfolding beside him, if he knew the old man’s thoughts, he’d definitely ridicule.\nNo supervision? This old fellow really has no supervision, I’ve got an all-round, no-blind-spot stupid system supervising me!\nIf I make any lazy or easing moves, the progress bar will hit me hard on the head.\nCan only say studying theory seriously and practicing seriously, the difficulty gap between the two far exceeds Lin Li’s imagination.\nLin Li’s physical condition...\nLet’s put it this way, Lin Li thinks Bolt is just so-so, 100 meters in 9.58 seconds, but he doesn’t need 100 meters to run 9.58 seconds.\n——In reality, Lin Li is a softie who takes four and a half minutes to run a thousand meters during physical testing, his daily exercise volume only consists of cycling to and from school.\nAlong with the morning in summer, as time passes, the temperature keeps rising too, the progress bar over half, Lin Li was already sweating profusely, his clothes showing noticeable color difference because of sweat stains.\nAt this time, Lin Li’s movements were no longer standard, but the good news is the progress bar was rising normally, after all, the system knows whether Lin Li was practicing seriously, he’s not unwilling now, just physically unable to make standard movements anymore.\nLin Li started practicing at five, but only at half-past six did he finally take a long breath and sat on the ground, finally free.\n[Task one completed!]\n[You have acquired the cultivation technique: Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.]\n[Learning is not an achievement of one day, nor is martial arts! The body-transforming celestial path has taken a critical step, the great achievement initially gained, but the way is long and difficult, if you stop here, all will be regretted!]\n[Task triggered!]\n[Task one: For a week, get up before 5:00 AM to practice Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique diligently, accumulating at least half an hour before 7:00 AM.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Qi Blood increase by 50%; System currency*100]\n[Without practical combat experience, ultimately hard to become a great talent, a cotton needle pillow in vain. The weight of tempering cannot be ignored.\nNow, by coincidence, there’s a martial arts youngster nearby, why not invite him for a friendly spar right away?]\n[Limited-time task triggered!]\n[Task four: Within an hour, have a friendly spar with the martial arts youngster nearby until either side falls and admits defeat.]\n[Task reward: Martial arts related random ability*1.]\n\"Huh?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 10: Chapter 10 Done, Encountered a Scammer\nThis time, completing the task unexpectedly triggered two new tasks.\nThe first new task is basically an extension of the original task, requiring me to persist in getting up and practicing for a week like now, but the fixed cultivation technique is the newly obtained Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, which I haven’t yet examined in detail.\nBut Lin Li felt that the reward was quite generous.\nThe percentage boost in Qi Blood is like a percentage boost in memory, which is also quite useful for oneself in reality—at least next time during the fitness test, it won’t be so embarrassing, right?\nFor students who are not good at sports, facing the pain of a fitness test is simply beyond words.\nWhenever there’s going to be a fitness test, they’ll be in panic a week in advance, then the day before the gym class, hoping for rain tomorrow, experiencing labored breathing before the start of a thousand meters, and always feeling the urge to go to the bathroom...\nThen, after finishing the thousand-meter run, swallowing a mouth full of bloodstreaks, gasping with sentiment: finally, it’s over, back to life.\nI’ve heard that university boys have to run three kilometers every semester, and just thinking of that number makes Lin Li want to die.\nExercise!\nStart from tomorrow morning, persist for a week!\nLin Li had a premonition that tomorrow morning would be a very difficult battle; today’s exercise would determine the lactic acid accumulation pain he would feel tomorrow; but Lin Li didn’t want to delay, choosing to rest tomorrow would only make him choose to rest more often in the future.\nOnce you decide to persist, just keep persisting!\nEven if tomorrow the body warns that it really needs a rest, Lin Li would choose to sit downstairs in the park to rest.\nBut for now, whether to rest or not is a matter to be discussed later.\nLin Li’s gaze shifted to the limited time task four.\nThe reward for this task was a ’power’ never seen before; how could one miss out on a superpower?\nMartial arts prodigy? Who?\nLin Li looked around, then again, and finally a third time in twelve directions.\nHmm, beside him was only Old Deng, who had just stopped his Tai Chi, but his condition was a hundred times better than Lin Li’s; he stood straight with white hair and beard.\nHim? Martial arts young Deng? Should I spar with him?\nLin Li had absolutely no intention of looking down on the other; on the contrary, he was well aware of his own abilities and had indeed heard the fierce punches of the old man just now, fearing that he might be punched to death.\nShouldn’t the system assign a little kid still wearing open-crotch pants, call him a martial arts prodigy, and let me have a vigorous battle with the kid?\nWhy not let me replicate Zeng Xiaoxian’s heroic battle with the kid’s group?\nHas the pattern changed again? This crappy system has become even more stupid.\nAnd at this moment, as if noticing Lin Li’s gaze, the old man who seemed about to rest took a deep breath and posed again to continue his punches.\nWatching for a while, Lin Li, who was just worried about being punched to death, breathed a sigh of relief, no longer worried.\n— Because he was sure now that he would definitely be punched to death.\nThis Old Deng was as healthy as a young Deng. In contrast, Lin Li felt like a flickering candle and a withering flower.\nHowever, the task was not without a solution.\nHe, too, was a genius in his own right.\n\"Grandpa...\" Lin Li stepped forward and called out.\n\"I don’t take disciples,\" the old man said flatly, \"but I do take mounts.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nNo, am I not in a game now? Why do I have to be ridiculed from the start?\nIs the QQ farm going to tell me next that my crops have died?\n\"Young man just joking, grandpa has been getting mocked like this while gaming recently, so now I’m putting myself in their shoes, and it’s kind of enjoyable, I understand them,\" the old man said, scratching his head and grinning.\nIt felt like these two idioms were misused, but Lin Li could see that this old man had a rather youthful mindset; this was good as communication would be much easier.\n\"Young man, what can I do for you, are you interested in Tai Chi?\" the old man inquired again, looking kind and gentle.\n\"No, grandpa, I want to have a vigorous martial arts sparring session with you!\" Lin Li directly got to the point.\n\"Eh?\" This answer was definitely unexpected to the old man, who scratched his head in a bit of a daze and pointed to his nose, \"Spar in martial arts? Me? But I’m not really fit for Baduanjin...\"\n\"It doesn’t matter, grandpa, I have some understanding of Tai Chi,\" Lin Li said confidently.\n\"Oh? Health-improvement Tai Chi or True Tai Chi?\" the old man’s eyes lit up.\nThe so-called understanding of Tai Chi Lin Li had was taught by Master Zhao Benshan, who said Tai Chi is about shuffling, arranging cards, drawing cards, looking at cards, drawing cards, looking at cards, and winning.\n\"Health-improvement Tai Chi, I guess.\" Thus, Lin Li said.\n\"That figures.\" The old man nodded. If he had truly practiced Tai Chi systematically, he wouldn’t have struggled so much with Baduanjin just now.\n\"Then let’s spar.\" The old man assumed a stance, smiling.\nTowards this future pillar of the nation, he had also developed a fondness for talent.\nThis stance indicated an intention for a Tai Chi push hands and free-hand sparring, where they could engage with their feet touching to contest. This not only determined who was stronger and tested inner strength but was much safer than real combat.\nThe result... the old man saw Lin Li adopting a Wing Chun stance, which was quite inaccurate, while making an ’A Do’ sound effect.\n\"Tai Chi, Lin Li!\"\nOld man: \"...\"\nNo, kid, do you really understand anything about Tai Chi? You’re not here to play tricks on this old man, are you?\n\"Young man you...\"\nThe old man hadn’t finished his sentence when he saw Lin Li punch towards him.\nThese days the youth have no martial ethics, they’re pulling sneak attacks!\nHe quickly made a defensive move and instinctively neutralized and counterattacked.\nNo, where’s the strength?\nTai Chi emphasizes using softness to overcome hardness and leveraging force, but this young man’s punch just now, where was the force?\nHaven’t eaten?\nThinking this way, the old man already had his palm on Lin Li’s shoulder.\n\"Whoosh—\"\nLin Li flew directly away, rolling on the ground twice, then lying there, seemingly even spitting blood which looked more like saliva.\nOld man: \"...\"\nIt seemed he didn’t use much strength either.\nWait a second.\nThe old man opened his eyes wide, pupils contracting slightly.\nDamn it, a scam!\nHe looked around, in eight directions, and then twelve directions: indeed, there were no surveillance cameras in the park!\nThis young man was actually here to scam him!\nNo, what a breakdown of propriety and decorum! This is a reverse Tiangang! How can the young people be like this nowadays, just when he had taken quite a liking to him!\nWhat national pillar, this one’s an enormous parasite of the country!\nThe world is going to hell in a handbasket, it is!\nIt’s not that there are fewer bad people; bad people have just gotten younger!\nThe old man, well-conditioned for over sixty years, held his chest, feeling the breathlessness and chest tightness for the first time.\nOnly magic can defeat magic, he thought for a while and decided to lay on the ground himself.\n\"Ouch~~ Ouch~~\"\nLin Li, smiling broadly, got up at this moment, then seeing the old man lying on the ground, was taken aback and stepped back two steps with hands raised, indicating his innocence:\n\"Grandpa, you’re scamming me? Don’t mess around! I didn’t even use much force just now, broad daylight, there’s no point in doing this.\"\nLin Li was somewhat disappointed; there’s no trust in people anymore. Unexpectedly, such a kindly old man was trying to scam him; to think they were probably neighbors in the same community, he couldn’t believe it.\nThe world is going to hell in a handbasket, it is!\nIt’s not that there are fewer bad people; bad people have just gotten older!\nBreathing wasn’t coming easily; this remark was choking the old man: what nonsense about a thief crying \"stop thief,\" turning the tables, he pointed a trembling finger at Lin Li: \"You, you—\"",

Be careful when practicing in the future. If I hadn’t come today, the consequences of you being here alone would be unimaginable.\" Lin Li helped the old man to a stone bench and took the thermos bag that seemed to belong to the old man, earnestly advising him.\nLook at that, look at that, now the old man just sat down and got out of breath again!\nTurns out the body of a martial artist is much frailer than I imagined.\nIndeed, even martial artists can’t withstand the test of time.\nOld Deng ultimately ends up as just Old Deng.\nThe human body is still too fragile.\n\"You people, you people...\" The old man, frustrated with Lin Li’s scattered thoughts and nostalgia, was momentarily speechless.\nHe said things would be unimaginable if he weren’t here, but it’s because you’re here that I’m so annoyed!\nAnd now he’s lost in thought again!\n\"Don’t worry, Grandpa Zhou, you don’t need to praise me. There are many people like me in this world. If one disappears, thousands more like me will stand up.\" Lin Li snapped out of it. He wasn’t someone who liked being complimented, and quickly waved his hand modestly upon hearing.\nThere was the old man’s name, Zhou Youwei, on the thermos cup, so Lin Li changed his address to Grandpa Zhou.\nThen Lin Li got up and said to the old man, \"Grandpa Zhou, since you’re fine and your breath is steady, I’ll get going now.\"\nIt’s already late, he’s all sweaty, and he has to go back to shower before heading to school. If he doesn’t hurry, he won’t even have time to grab breakfast.\n\"You—\"\n\"No need to thank me, it’s what I should do. Bye-bye!\"\nHearing the old man’s call from behind, Lin Li waved his hand, thinking the old man must be looking at him with a grateful gaze now.\nBut a true man never looks back.\n\"—Whose child is this!\" The old man’s voice still chased after him, filled with strong emotion.\n\"Just call me the passing Kamen Rider.\"\nLin Li chuckled, thinking it wasn’t necessary to go door-to-door to thank him.\nDoing good deeds doesn’t need a name, success doesn’t need to be credited to me.\nAnother morning left with tears of emotion for himself.\n\"...It’s hopeless, this world is completely hopeless!\" Watching Lin Li’s departing figure, the old man nearly furious, spoke in despair and helplessness.\n...\nIn the bathroom, Lin Li checked his rewards while showering.\nTime-limited task four has been successfully completed.\nAfter reading the prerequisites, Lin Li decided to throw the match.\nThe system didn’t specify with positive adjectives like diligently or wholeheartedly; it only asked for \"friendly,\" and either party admitting defeat would count as completion.\nIf this isn’t friendly, what is?\nSure enough, when he admitted defeat, the system prompted the task was completed.\nTo give the old man more sense of accomplishment in beating him, he even rolled on the ground a few times, a thoughtful touch.\nWait.\nWasn’t the old man just faking it?\nLin Li’s pupils contracted suddenly, realizing the truth and feeling a bit guilty.\nThe old man was too excited! This kind of emotional rollercoaster isn’t suitable for the elderly. For them, big joy and big sadness are dangerous.\nHe should be more careful next time, can’t let good intentions lead to bad outcomes.\n[Task four completed]\n[Random martial arts-related ability in process.]\n[You have received the reward: Passive ability: Catching Blades with Bare Hands.]\n[Catching Blades with Bare Hands: When your hands hold no objects, you can predict the path of melee weapons with extreme precision.]\nIs it you, Li Jing?\nSadly, this ability doesn’t come with \"100%\" success rate, losing the qualification to become a conceptual deity immediately.\nA bit disappointed, as Lin Li hoped to get an active ability, something like Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms or Wave Riding Light Steps.\nLin Li then shifted his gaze to [Warehouse] and the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\nCome on, method of immortality, pour into my brain, read!\nA thick book appeared before Lin Li, plopping to the ground, getting doused by the shower water.\nThe system proved surprisingly reliable in being unreliable.\n\"...\"\n\"My cultivation technique!\"\nLin Li hurriedly picked up the cultivation technique, only to find, surprisingly, that the water on the floor had not affected it at all. It was still perfectly dry without a single wet spot.\nLin Li raised an eyebrow and directly aimed the showerhead at the book.\nWater droplets slid across the pages, seemingly as if covered with a water-repellent layer.\nUpon discovering he couldn’t tear it apart and could still store it back in [Warehouse] by touching it, Lin Li nodded with satisfaction, it was finally somewhat impressive.\nIt’s a pity watching great experts who view cultivation techniques with just a sweep of their spiritual sense, committing it entirely to memory. Meanwhile, he’s left to honestly read laboriously.\nHowever, it makes sense, as he is still just an ordinary person with a natural mosquito-repellent aura.\nReturning to the book, Lin Li opened to the first page and began to attempt reading.\nYour mom.\nClassical Chinese, Traditional Characters.\nZhang Yu’s Defensive Book.\nFor the first time, Lin Li deeply understood how incredibly useful language is.\nFortunately, Lin Li isn’t completely illiterate, and with the human action diagrams on nearly every page, he can understand the gist.\nInterestingly, when Lin Li mimicked the movements shown, he felt a warm stream flowing through his body, a totally different sensation from practicing the Eight Brocade Exercises earlier.\nIt’s truly good stuff, otherwise, it wouldn’t have such a fantastic effect.\nWait, why do I still feel warm streams flowing even after stopping the practice?\nLin Li thought seriously, then raised his head.\nHe turned off the shower above him and tried to redo the movements.\nHmm.\nThe warm stream is gone.\nDamn it.\n—Whether it’s good stuff remains to be studied for now.\n...\n\"No, Lin Li, are you crazy? It’s one thing to be serious in class, why are you doing exam papers after class?\"\nSpeaking to Lin Li, who rejected his toilet duo invitation, Bai Bufan spoke with sorrow and despair.\n\"It’s not exam papers, I’m watching tiny people fight.\"\n\"Huh?!\" Bai Bufan leaned in like a curious dog, and Lin Li handed him a sheet.\n\"They’re really fighting? How boring.\"\nUpon seeing that Lin Li’s \"tiny people\" weren’t what he thought, Bai Bufan shook his head in disappointment and handed back the paper.\nWhat Lin Li was reading was the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, but not the original. Taking it to school and if anyone discovered its invulnerable properties and other peculiarities, wouldn’t be appropriate.\nThis was a ’copy’ Lin Li had photographed with his phone and then taken to a print shop to print out—seems a bit redundant, but Lin Li was concerned about something happening if he went for direct copying.\n\"What on earth is this stuff, it’s in Classical Chinese, totally unreadable.\" Zhang Yu Bai Bufan said, face full of confusion.\n\"The content is martial arts, I found it online, using it to practice Classical Chinese translation, and maybe learn a thing or two.\" Lin Li said with a mix of truth and bluff, then performed a few movements.\nIt actually looked somewhat like the real deal.\nBai Bufan stepped back, stood tall, clasped his hands together and bowed: \"Mr. Lin, this fist strength, it’s obvious you’re a practitioner, skilled to perfection. We should spar sometime, I’m coincidentally a modern inheritor of the Bai Family cultivation technique.\"\n\"If your BYD practiced martial arts, you wouldn’t only beat me by two seconds in a thousand meters, we’re both just average.\" Lin Li scoffed.\nBy now, Lin Li knew perfectly well what to expect from Bai Bufan’s nonsense.\n\"Are you doubting my Bai Family cultivation technique?!\" Bai Bufan widened his eyes, \"I swear by my Optimus Prime, the Bai Family technique is definitely stronger than your bullsh*t.\"\n\"Betting so big?\" Lin Li raised an eyebrow.\nThinking about it, the Bai surname indeed sounds impressive, maybe there’s something passed down, so Lin Li asked, \"What is your Bai Family technique?\"\n\"White Tiger - Scar Light Auto Rifle.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Speak, bastard! Is the Bai Family technique stronger or your unknown technique stronger!\"\n\"Screw your CrossFire game!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 12: Chapter 12: I will strike the Hehuan Demon stronghold as a guest!\nLin Li lost.\nThe Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique really can’t beat the White Tiger automatic rifle.\nAfter all, beyond seven steps the gun is fast, within seven steps the gun is both accurate and fast without needing to aim.\nBai Bufan, like a victorious general, turned his head pridefully, swaying his hips like a peacock as he pranced to the bathroom.\nLin Li chuckled and followed suit, thinking that a ’Thousand Year Kill’ would calm down such a silly kid.\n\"Lin Li, you son of a—\"\nLin Li ignored him because after practicing martial arts, he felt his body needed to release some heat.\nSo he stood up and went to the bathroom as well.\n...\n\"For the math weekend homework, just finish the exercises corresponding to these two sections. Class dismissed, and everyone be safe when you go home.\" Today is Friday, the last class was Xue Jian’s math class. When the bell rang, he didn’t hold the class over time. After a simple reminder, he left with the thermos a middle-aged man invariably carries.\nNo one knows why, even when drinking plain water, Xue Jian uses the thermos lid to skim off the tea leaves.\n\"Sweet!\"\nEveryone immediately got up, packed their things, and prepared to leave the classroom.\n\"Lin Li, are we gaming tonight?!\" Bai Bufan jumped up like he’d come to life, grabbing his backpack and getting ready to go without bringing anything else.\n——At this boarding school, the weekends basically don’t last a full two days but go from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon, with regular self-study on Sunday nights. So as long as there’s not too much homework, everyone usually saves it for then.\n\"Playing with you shortens my lifespan; I might not play this weekend.\" Lin Li waved his hand.\nAlthough the main reason is that he has to go fight demons this weekend, playing games with them really is a pain.\nBold words in the beginning, nonsensical talk in the middle, silence at the end; tilt a cigarette, point it, and your teammates’ parents are in danger; blaming others, plucking strings, this time it’s really bothersome; chatting casually when winning, discussing family when losing; occasionally losing, but often just occasionally...\nThis is the state of playing games together.\n\"So many people beg me to play games with them, yet you don’t appreciate it.\"\n\"Like who?\" Lin Li asked with a smile.\n\"Oh man, my grandma’s giving birth to my dad; I have to check if it’s a boy or girl, can’t talk, bye.\" Hearing this question, Bai Bufan quickly made a run for it.\nLin Li chuckled, glanced at the system, and saw the progress bar for the ’serious study task’ was nearly three-quarters complete, meaning he’d have to finish next Monday.\nHe casually packed up his things. If it weren’t for needing to take the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique photocopy home, Lin Li typically wouldn’t even carry his backpack home for the weekend.\nThe reason he was taking it back was that the photocopy had been filled with Lin Li’s notes and annotations.\nIt’s all sweat and effort.\nBecause he had to complete his tasks and couldn’t not pay attention in class, this was the result of utilizing every minute and second during breaks, lunchtime, and irrelevant classes like English.\nAlthough due to insufficient knowledge and the inconvenience of searching on a phone at school, he hadn’t completely translated it yet, Lin Li found that when translating and understanding it himself, he remembered the content particularly well. Sometimes when he ’guessed’ the meaning right, it felt like a revelation.\nLike smoothly solving the final big question in mathematics, feeling an inner sense of satisfaction.\nOf course, that’s under the assumption that the answer looks like an answer.\nIf the solution yielded an overly complex fraction with three or four radicals and additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions, then it’s not satisfaction but utter failure.\nAs the Cultivation Technique describes, this is a manual to strengthen the body through martial arts, divided into eight Chapters. From the translation of the first two Chapters, the second Chapter seems to require Spiritual Qi to nourish the body, but the first Chapter doesn’t need it at all.\nAfter confirming the uncertain translation points when I get back, I can practice this Chapter tomorrow morning.\nThe morning’s excessive training has already shown signs; Lin Li’s limbs feel weak and sore.\nJust the right time to hit a wellness center for some recovery.\nMom already said she wouldn’t be home this weekend, so Lin Li first ate out and then went back to change clothes.\n——Wearing a high school uniform to the brothel would be too disrespectful for them, considering it basically screams ’underage’.\nSlicking his hair back like an adult, dressed in a hoodlum outfit, the imagined beauties awaiting him~~\nSinging while watching a few anti-vice videos and learning the ropes about such places, Lin Li bolstered himself with the resolve to potentially face social death, heading into battle.\n...\nEight o’clock in the evening.\nThe weekend made the store seemingly much busier; by the time Lin Li went in, there was even a queue at the front desk.\n\"Hello, have you already purchased a package on the platform? Then just scan the code.\" It was quickly Lin Li’s turn, and the receptionist, after glancing at him, looked down to continue tapping at the computer, asking.\n\"I haven’t bought it yet.\" Lin Li said calmly, \"The packages here aren’t to my satisfaction, my local friend recommended me here and mentioned that there are more attractive deals than on the platform. I’d like to see what they are.\"\nThe receptionist glanced at Lin Li again and then called someone over the intercom. Soon, a woman in her late twenties or almost thirty came over: \"This way, young man, follow me.\"\nThey bypassed the second floor, Lin Li followed her straight to the third floor; though the lighting was bright instead of the purple ambient lights he imagined, most rooms were tightly closed.\nIt looked really busy today, business was good.\nGuided to a corner room with an open door, Lin Li entered; the layout inside wasn’t anything special, just two massage chairs and a large projector.\nThe massage chairs could recline and lay flat, barely usable as a bed.\nThe woman closed the door, handed a tablet over, and asked, \"What services would the guest like? Here is the list of projects and prices.\"\nLin Li didn’t take the tablet, knowing what he wanted wouldn’t be on there, given its likely hidden nature. So he directly asked, \"The options my friend recommended aren’t here; are there any others?\"\n\"Sorry young man, we only have these projects.\"\n\"While my friend didn’t explain in detail, we all know what’s up, no need to dance around. If these are all you have, I’m leaving.\" Lin Li feigned impatience.\nFrequent spa-goers know many places offer clandestine services with extra time, but according to the system’s task description, this place wasn’t just about skirting such lines.\nThe woman seemed convinced, smiling as she put away the tablet and then introduced:\n\"Apologies young man, this is a necessary procedure, after all, none of us want to get caught, right? Our store has four hidden packages, 399, 699, 1299, and 3699, which would the guest like to choose?\"\nIt’s here, finally here!\n\"What do each of them include?\" Lin Li quietly released the recording function on his phone from the moment he entered, so it could better capture audio.\n\"The 399 package includes an hour-long massage with hand and mouth services...\"\n\"699...\"\nLin Li broadened his horizons.\nThe adult world is truly extravagant.\nEven though the play style is varied and novel, 3699—is this gold-plated?\nAlthough Lin Li’s never eaten pork, in his recent studies, he’s seen plenty of pigs running around.\nIsn’t it said that the high-quality companions charge about the same?\nRemember, this is Xiling Town; most people working half a month don’t even make that income—before tax.\nfor one night means ten thousand a month, a million a year, doesn’t it?\nGet through this bit of hardship, and the future will be no more hardship, wow!\nLin Li calculated the numbers, feeling an urge at this moment to enter the ’farm’ and become a duck.\nIf only a 175 cm loyal and devoted 36D millionaire girlfriend could keep him, he’d be okay with living large in a mansion with a luxury car.\nWith practice of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, those baseline qualifications should be top-tier among ducks...\nDammit!\nAs a Cultivator, I almost lost my mind to it!",

      "content": "Chapter 13: Chapter 13: To Be Honest, Worthy of Being Called a Conscientious Enterprise\nNo wonder it’s the Hehuan stronghold, the demons are already casting spells silently, destroying their own mind.\nExtremely dangerous indeed.\nIf not for his own strong resolve, he might have almost fallen for it.\nLin Li took a deep breath, clearing his mind of all distractions. Unless a 36D rich woman devoted to him appeared, he would never embarrass himself like this again.\nOf course, this condition could be relaxed as needed, Lin Li’s bottom line was quite flexible most of the time.\n\"Can I take a look at the technicians first?\" Lin Li did not choose a price right away but inquired instead.\nAs a ’veteran’, how could he not first inspect the merchandise’s quality and grade?\n\"Of course, no problem, please wait a moment.\" The woman took out her phone, operated it for a while, then handed it to Lin Li and introduced:\n\"Today, the only three technicians who are currently working and available to serve you right away are these three individuals. The others are off today, but if you’re interested, you can schedule an appointment in advance for later.\"\nThe madam smiled. Her business was rather special; although visitors were rare, the retention rate was high, with most becoming regulars.\nNiche, but sticky.\nIn her eyes, the person in front of her was a new customer developing into a regular, something she rarely saw these days.\nLin Li looked at the phone, much like how models have specific introductions, the girls at this store also had corresponding \"chicken certificates\".\nStage names, height, weight, sizes, all this information was clearly written.\nFurthermore, each one had videos where beauty filters weren’t overused; some didn’t even have any filters added.\nMainly because Lin Li was already in the shop, and he was going to see the merchandise offline shortly. If the goods didn’t match the description, it would be troublesome for both sides to handle a refund.\nThey were all quite good-looking, all in their twenties, and none of those old broads who could sit and inhale dirt from the ground.\nHoly shit!\n— Not a verb, but an exclamation.\nLin Li was shocked as he scrolled down.\nBecause every girl actually had her own health certificate! And judging from the date on them, they were all issued within the last few weeks.\nWow, this is genuinely reassuring!\nCould it be that every girl also gets regular check-ups to provide a safer, more reassuring experience for customers? This was surprisingly a conscientious establishment.\nExpensive, but there’s a reason for it.\nToo bad, no matter how righteous you are, as someone from the righteous path, today I must carry out justice even against my relatives.\n\"Customer, how did you find the selection? Have you decided on the technician you would like to serve you?\" The woman asked, seeing that Lin Li had almost finished the introductions of the technicians.\nLin Li pondered for a moment and then asked, \"Can I order more than one at a time?\"\nMadam: \"?\"\nThe main task was to clear out the place, so perhaps he should gather evidence of each person’s crime?\nThe woman’s face turned somewhat serious: \"Little brother, although we each have our own reasons for engaging in this not-so-glamorous industry, we also have our dignity that should not be trampled upon.\"\n\"I apologize, pretend I didn’t say anything.\" Lin Li waved his hand.\nHe was overthinking it, the cleansing probably didn’t require him to act. Once the officials from the Demon Suppression Bureau arrived, they would be responsible for uprooting this place; he didn’t need to fight against many alone.\nLeave it to the professionals.\n\"No, no, no, customer, that’s not what I meant...\" Now it was the woman’s turn to wave her hand, she hurriedly added, \"What I mean is, it’s possible, but it’ll cost extra.\"\nLin Li blinked his eyes.\nDamn, he actually believed she was emphasizing the value and dignity of the profession and her colleagues.\nTurns out it was all about negotiating the price.\nAt seventeen, he was still too naive.\n\"No need, I’ll try out the single service this time.\" Lin Li rejected once more.\n\"So which technician do you wish to have serve you?\"\n\"Let’s go with Xiaojing.\" Lin Li picked one randomly since it wasn’t too important.\n\"Which price range?\"\n\"It’s my first time here, let’s go with the 399 and try it out first.\"\nThe woman showed no signs of disappointment over him choosing the lowest price range.\nThey had ways of getting customers to extend their time.\nLove rises with the clock, and it’s hard to quell when the clock stops.\nThis was the service requirement for all employees.\n\"Do you have any requests for the technician’s outfit? We offer various uniforms, currently including JK, flight attendant, corporate...\"\n\"Additionally, would you like to purchase some small tools to enhance the experience? Such as jelly, pop rocks, ice cream...\"\n\"Our Xiaojing is best known for the dual cold and hot experience, so we highly recommend you buy...\"\nDamn, professional madam.\nThe introduction was comprehensive, leaving Lin Li, this fake know-it-all pretending to understand, genuinely stunned.\nWhat kind of model enterprise were you, the top of the lawless brothel industry.\nTo be honest, Lin Li usually sneered at the sales pitches for other products outside, but for the introductions here, he even wanted to analyze frame by frame.\nIllegal but informative knowledge increased.\nJelly sounds good, jelly needs to be learned.\nHowever, Lin Li held himself back and bought nothing.\nAfter all, he didn’t know if the Demon Suppression Bureau would return his seized money afterwards, and if he couldn’t recover the 399, Lin Li would be heartbroken for a long time, there’s no way he’d spend more.\nHey? Lin Li suddenly became curious about one thing.\nWhat would happen if he skipped out on paying after using the service?\nBut Lin Li quickly got the answer.\nBecause it was pay-first.\nIt’s a direct transfer via Alipay, with no tax filing; evidently, this enterprise wasn’t entirely conscientious.\nAfter receiving the money, the woman nodded: \"Sir, please wait a moment, Xiaojing will be over very soon.\"\n\"I need to use the bathroom, by the way, you guys should have robes available, right?\" Lin Li stood up and asked.\n\"Yes, just go this way, head straight and turn right at the end, there’s the bathroom and the changing room, but you can wait till Xiaojing comes to help you change, there’s no extra charge for that.\" The woman led Lin Li out of the room, pointing in a direction.\n\"Alright, thank you.\"\nLin Li nodded, parted ways with the madam, and headed to the bathroom.\nEntering the stall, he saw a man standing at the sink smoking, looking at himself in the mirror, mechanically washing his hands.\nThe man saw Lin Li enter, took the cigarette out of his mouth with his wet hand, with a weary and vague expression, sincerely asking:\n\"Little brother, what is the meaning of us being alive? Since we are destined to die, then what is the purpose of our living?\"\nIf it was any other time, hearing this, Lin Li might consider the other person to be a depression patient, and say something nice.\nBut now he was at the brothel.\nSo this wasn’t depression.\nThis damn guy was just dumbfounded by visiting prostitutes.\nThe return to gold leaf stimulates the brain, a high-level player controls thought; the little head controls the big head, the body obeys the urge.\n\"To get some fries at the dock.\" So Lin Li perfunctorily replied.\n\"Come to think of it, I am feeling a bit hungry, you reminded me, I’ll have roast pigeon tonight.\" The man nodded.\n\"Want one?\"\n\"Thanks.\" Lin Li didn’t smoke, but after briefly contemplating, he accepted the cigarette but didn’t light it.\nThe man was about to leave, but suddenly turned around, asking, \"Little brother, want some oil, it can make you last longer, I still have some leftover, you can have it for free.\"\n\"... No, thanks.\" Lin Li couldn’t hold it together this time.\n\"True, you look young, indeed you wouldn’t need this stuff, okay, I’ll head out first.\" The man waved and turned to leave.\nBrother, I hope you really left.\nWatching the man’s back, Lin Li silently wished him well.\nIf you left, then you are lucky.\nBecause the Demon Suppression Bureau likely wouldn’t pursue those who already left, even if this man just left moments ago.\nBut if you didn’t leave, you can enjoy state-provided meals.",

      "content": "Chapter 14: Chapter 14 Miss, Please Respect Yourself!\nLin Li carefully checked the stall first to ensure no one was inside using the toilet before he moved to a position by the window, leaning against the wall, facing the entrance door.\nThis way, if someone came in, he could notice immediately.\nAnd even if someone did come in, seeing him with a cigarette in his mouth making a phone call, they wouldn’t think much of it.\nLin Li took out his phone, paused the recording only then, and directly dialed 110.\n\"Hello, 110.\" The call connected quickly, and the operator’s voice came through, concise and to the point.\n\"Hello, I want to report Light Noble Health Club at No. 623 Hu Yue Road, Xiling Town. They are secretly providing prostitution and other illegal sexual services there. Please send someone to make arrests quickly.\"\nLin Li spoke softly to ensure people outside couldn’t hear him.\nUpon confirming it wasn’t a major case like a homicide, the operator had time to verify the authenticity of the case and asked:\n\"Are you sure this information is accurate? Or do you have any evidence to provide us? If we send officers and the situation turns out to be false, and you cannot provide corresponding evidence, we may need to hold you legally accountable, and you might have to compensate the business.\"\n\"Confirmed, very confirmed. They are providing such services on the third floor right now. If you come directly, you can catch them red-handed.\"\n\"Alright, I’ll contact the police officers in the jurisdiction where the incident happened shortly. However, we now need you to provide some of your personal information. Where are you currently?\"\n\"Light Noble Health Club, third floor.\"\n\"Alright, so it’s Light Noble... hmm?\"\nThe other party suddenly fell silent.\nThus, Lin Li and the operator both remained quiet.\nSilence was tonight’s Kang Bridge.\n\"... You said you’re... where?\" The operator asked again, as if unsure of what they just heard was correct.\n\"Light Noble Health Club.\"\n\"The very place you reported?\"\n\"Yes, hello.\"\n\"Still on the third floor?\"\n\"Yes, hello.\"\n\"May I ask what you’re doing there?\"\n\"Uh... In a little while, I’m going to receive those illegal services, so please hurry up.\" Lin Li pinched the cigarette in his hand, feeling somewhat awkward in his speech.\nThe operator once again fell into silence.\nAs a 110 operator, hadn’t she seen all sorts of situations?\nYet she had never seen a bizarre case like this.\nShe even found it hard to define what was happening now—was this considered a confession?\nBut the caller hadn’t committed an actual illegal act yet?\nIs this a bloody advance confession?\nPhantom Thief Kid may announce crimes beforehand, could this caller be announcing a confession?\n\"Alright, I understand. I’ve already notified the nearby police station to send officers. As for further details, let’s save it for when you’re caught... Oh well, rather not disrupt you—actually, let’s disrupt you a bit, sir, take the chance to turn back before it’s too late!\"\nThe operator had never said anything this awkward before.\nWeird, truly weird.\n\"Success doesn’t need to happen in my hands; some things missed are missed. I can’t go back.\" Lin Li finished speaking, hung up the phone, pretended to take a drag from his cigarette, and then flicked the whole cigarette out the window.\nCool lines, Lin Li felt like a hero ready to perish with the enemy. If he ordered more trendy takeout, he might be even cooler.\nWho says a hero must stand in the light?\nThe main concern here is that the current environment is somewhat dangerous, and his motives and reasons for doing this are difficult to explain clearly at the moment.\nEven if no one comes in, staying in the bathroom for too long could raise suspicions, explanations can be made once they get to the Demon Suppression Bureau.\n\"Love me for visiting a brothel alone, love my unyielding appearance, love me confronting the masseuse without releasing a shot~\"\nHumming a song, Lin Li arrived at the changing room and casually picked out a massage robe to wear.\nTurning the recording back on, when he returned to the private room, a masseuse named Xiaojing was already inside.\nHmm, she’s indeed not as good-looking as in the video, heavily made-up—not really Lin Li’s type.\nWhat should be exposed was, but not everything, did it reveal? Like revealing.\nLin Li’s gaze naturally locked onto her chest, indeed it was quite fair.\nDamn, forgot to turn off the auto-aim function.\nLin Li pulled back his gaze.\nThen those pesky eyes, defying the brain’s warnings, looked over again.\nTraitors among the organs.\nDamn, more than one traitor, after the eyes took their fill, other organs also betrayed Lin Li’s thought process.\nNeed to go home later to teach them a good lesson.\nThough Lin Li wasn’t particularly satisfied with her, she found Lin Li quite pleasing to the eye.\nAfter all, the usual clients she served were often the types with big bellies, able to only see their toes by looking straight down, middle-aged men, lively street Huang Mao...\nYoung guys like Lin Li, with decent height and looks, could certainly be considered quality customers.\nSadly, he only ordered the 399 package.\nLooks like she’ll have to give it her all later, she doesn’t believe a young guy like this could withstand her onslaught.\nThe package includes extended service, and if he could manage, well, hehe, Xiaojing would quit this business.\n\"Come on in, boss~ lie down first~ the service will begin soon~~\" Xiaojing’s voice was sickly sweet as she simultaneously opened her own clothes a tad wider.\nDamn claw, watch the sword!\nBut it was really white.\n\"Mmm.\" Lin Li lay down on the massage bed beside him, face down, butt up.\nXiaojing raised an eyebrow; this one was so well-behaved.\nUsually, by the time they pass by her, they’re already reaching up and groping down.\nGood manners, bonus!\n\"Boss, with your back facing up, how can people properly serve you?\" Xiaojing’s hands already pressed on Lin Li’s back, gently rubbing as she continued in her sultry voice.\nMore directly, she started rubbing Lin Li’s leg with her own thighs.\nThis is how you’re testing the cadre?\nLin Li shivered all over, he’d really never experienced such stimulation.\nBrain throbbing, feeling very uncomfortable.\n—Oh right, not that brain.\nIt’s truly without solutions, just at this age full of youthful vigor, once those thoughts flashed in his mind, the other brain seamlessly took control of the body.\nCan only say Lin Li as a cadre has indeed gone through too few tests.\nBut accepting the service was never an option for Lin Li, firstly not to mention he knows the Demon Suppression Bureau will come shortly, knowingly breaking the law is clearly a foolish act. When it comes down to it, explaining himself would require informing the guardian.\nFurthermore, Lin Li isn’t willing to end things here, not yet waiting for that 175 loyal 36D rich woman.\nSteer clear of unclean stuff.\nWho knows if their health certificates are forged.\n\"No need for now, you guys do normal massages, right? Start with a normal massage first, my body’s a bit fatigued these days, special services can wait.\" Lin Li waved his hand and said.\nCan’t have that.\nXiaojing’s plan was to use up the 399 package quickly, then seductively entice Lin Li, making him unbearably uncomfortable in an hour, and compelled to extend the time—delay was unacceptable.\nMen in Wise One mode never extend the time.\nThis is why normal massage services are included in packages, for guests to use the time to recover energy.\n\"Boss, what could be more relieving for your fatigue than that? Rest assured, Xiaojing will make you feel good.\"\nInciting Lin Li to jump up, exclaiming loudly:\n\"Miss, please have some decency!\"\nXiaojing: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 15: Chapter 15 Lin Li: Bring me the medicine!\nMiss, please have some self-respect?\nAre you even human to say such a thing?\nI’m a hooker, dude. You’re asking a hooker to have self-respect? If I had self-respect, would I be here being a hooker?\nWhen I wasn’t a hooker, others told me to have some self-respect. Now I’m a hooker, you still want me to have self-respect. Was I a hooker for nothing?\nRounding it up, isn’t it an insult to my character already?\nSelf-respect my ass. Let me be automatic, that’s more like it!\nThis guy’s got the looks, but how come he’s purely a moron?\nHonest and simple yet brainless, suitable for taking over, but not fit for this current stage.\nWait a second.\nXiaojing, who’ve been in this industry for years with plenty of customer-handling experience, realized the truth after a moment of stunned silence.\nThis young hottie...waiting for the drugs to kick in, huh?\nIt’s not the first time I’ve had such clients. At first meeting, they talk about life, ideals, full of romantic notions, the four seasons, quite the literary charm.\nAt that time, I really thought they came to me just to relieve their loneliness, even felt a bit touched.\nThen as we talk, I see them suddenly reach downwards.\n— Not towards me.\nThe client reaches towards his own down there, and then —\n\"Damn, it’s finally working!\"\n\"Boss, let’s continue chatting...\"\n\"To hell with romance, who the hell likes this? I wanna pound, pound, pound!\"\nAnd then it’s pure pounding.\nObviously, the young hottie in front of me now is in the same situation.\nOtherwise, who in their right mind would come to a brothel and not partake?\nIf you really wanted a massage, why order a hidden package and waste your money?\nHowever, Xiaojing was a bit disappointed.\nI didn’t think of it because Lin Li looks so young. People at this age rarely need to resort to drugs.\nWho’d guess, Lin Li has the looks, age is right but turns out to be a flashy spear with no substance.\nBut whatever, I’m not in this business for my own pleasure. In fact, most services I provide, including making noise, it’s all to satisfy the client.\nAs long as there’s money to be made, it’s fine. Moreover, with the drugs, even if I provide service later, Lin Li would probably extend the time. After all, the effects don’t just dissipate after one session.\nDoesn’t matter if it’s before or after the service then.\n\"Sir, please lay down again. I’ll massage you first. Once you’re ready and it’s the right time, we’ll proceed to the real service.\" Naturally, Xiaojing, with her emotional intelligence, didn’t mention anything about the drugs, replying cooperatively.\n\"Okay.\" Lin Li was quite pleased with Xiaojing’s understanding, truly a commendable employee cultivated by a conscientious business, really empathetic.\nIf Lin Li knew what Xiaojing was thinking, for the sake of male dignity, he might just drop his pants.\nThis is intolerable.\nDamn, harder than steel, stronger than iron! Nothing else, just the confidence of a seventeen-year-old!\nNot only strong am I, but so is my seventeen-year-old self!\nHe’s lying on the massage table feeling awkward.\nBut honestly, after high-intensity training in the morning, the sensation of sore muscles being massaged is really nice.\nIsn’t this more comfortable than a full-service bathhouse?\n\"Xiaojing, your massage technique is quite something. Why would you choose this path?\" Unable to play with his phone, Lin Li instinctively engaged in a classic male tendency — persuading a virtuous girl to leave the trade.\n\"Boyfriend getting married, needed money. My mom wouldn’t listen to me, so I helped him save for the bride price.\" Xiaojing said softly.\nWhat an explosive scandal?\nTo have such a girlfriend, that man’s previous life must have saved...saved Satan, and now Satan is here to repay him?\n\"Does your boyfriend know?\"\n\"Of course not.\"\n\"Hard to...comment.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nAfter tonight, your boyfriend will know, damn. Did I do good or bad?\nJudgment belongs to future generations.\n\"Seems like you’re not the type to get excited by such a backstory, boss?\" Seeing Lin Li’s silence, Xiaojing blinked, wondering why it went differently than expected, even sensing Lin Li’s guilt. She quickly explained.\n\"What kind of backstory do you like? I can adjust mine for you.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nYour mom.\nAdaptive background stories, customized for every client, this is to satisfy strange preferences, role-playing, huh.\nI actually believed it.\nThis so-called conscientious company trains their staff too comprehensively, and I, at seventeen, am too naive.\nNaive is not I, but my seventeen-year-old self.\nRealizing Xiaojing wouldn’t spill any truths, Lin Li continued chatting whimsically, mainly enjoying the massage.\n...\n\"Sir, it’s already been forty minutes. Aren’t you ready yet?\" Xiaojing’s hands were sore from massaging, she’d covered all of Lin Li’s back, yet he seemed in no hurry to move to the main topic.\nSurely it’s not that the drugs haven’t kicked in yet?\nWhat kind of bad quality meds are these, it’s worth warning about.\nBeing stingy on such matters is really irresponsible to oneself.\nIf it drags on, time will run out.\nAfter all, the 399 package includes services not combat, Lin Li hadn’t added extra props; if the stimulation isn’t enough, it’ll take a lot of time.\nMeanwhile, Lin Li.\nYour question is a good one, I’d like to ask myself!\nDemon Suppression Bureau, it’s been forty minutes, aren’t you ready yet?\nForty minutes, if Bai Bufan were here, he’d be done with ten rounds and be a dried up man by now!\nWait.\nI clearly told the operator I was here, yet they haven’t come. Are they deliberately waiting for me to finish so they can arrest me and boost their stats?\nIt’s not even year-end yet!\nEntrapment! You’re deeply wounding a minor’s core!\nOnce I’ve succeeded in my cultivation, I’m taking them, Bai Bufan, and that unmet aunt together to heaven (physically)!\nLin Li, lost in thought, felt his hand lifted, then landed in something soft.\nSomething’s wrong, Lin Li looked up sharply, Xiaojing performed a magic trick of making her clothes disappear.\n\"Sir, the drug has clearly taken effect. Why didn’t you say something? Let’s finally get to the main event.\" Lin Li’s side position gave something away, Xiaojing flirted with a wink.\nThis guy really is hiding depths.\nWhat kind of drug is this, so powerful, should be recommended.\n\"No! Leave me alone!\"\n\"Jingjing is right here.\" Xiaojing reached out her devilish hand towards a completely innocent Lin Li.\nHe tries to evade, she goes after, he’s trapped like a bird in a cage.\nIt’s over, I’m about to be defiled.\nA slightly noisy sound emerged outside the door at that moment.\nThe sound swiftly amplified, becoming clearer.\n\"What’s going on?\" Xiaojing also noticed, turning her head towards the door in confusion.\nLin Li snapped his eyes open, looking at Xiaojing: \"Quick, you need to put your clothes—\"\nYet Xiaojing stepped away to open the door. Before she could scream, someone introduced themselves:\n\"Don’t move! Police!\"\nLin Li rolled his eyes.\nGreat timing, indeed.",

      "content": "Chapter 16: Chapter 16: A Slight Shock to the Anti-Pornography Team\nXiaojing instinctively raised her hands.\nLin Li suddenly remembered a children’s song.\nTwo little bunnies... forgot the middle, forgot the back.\n\"...Whatever, just move, first put your clothes on, then squat down with your head in your hands!\"\nA strong voice coldly urged, and then a Demon Suppression Envoy, not wearing a uniform, walked past Xiaojing and locked eyes with Lin Li, who was still lying on the massage bed.\nThe Demon Suppression Envoy’s eyes widened.\nIn his life, he had never seen anyone with this kind of expression during an anti-vice raid.\nNot only was there no panic, now even with him inside, Lin Li was still lying on his side, propping his cheek with his hand, looking at him helplessly.\nHe could even see a hint of resentment and disappointment in Lin Li’s eyes, as if annoyed that his good moment had been interrupted.\nUnbelievable, Yangliang had conducted so many anti-vice raids in his life, he had never seen anyone so brazen.\nDoes he think just because he’s fully clothed, he can escape responsibility? The state of the technician at the door had already explained everything, leaving no room for excuses.\nLin Li was indeed resentful.\nWhy wouldn’t he be? He almost got turned over and taken advantage of by force, his chastity ruined.\nAll because of the Demon Suppression Bureau’s delay.\n\"Get up quickly! Squat with your head in your hands! Squat in the corner!\" Yangliang pointed at Lin Li with a baton, commanding coldly.\n\"Uncle...\"\n\"Don’t try to get chummy! Get your hands on your head and squat down!\"\nLin Li stopped himself from speaking further. After thinking it over, he said nothing and obediently squatted in the corner with his head in his hands.\nThe experience was novel, it would make for an impressive story even if it was useless.\nThe main reason Lin Li didn’t reveal his ’identity’ now was because Xiaojing was still here.\nRemember, running a chicken farm isn’t a capital offense. Even the management level organizing the flock would at most be locked up for a few years and then released. Those who came to enjoy the chickens, and the chickens themselves, would at most be detained for a short period.\nAfter the time has passed, they return to being men, most of whom are locals.\nIf he were to reveal now to the Demon Suppression Bureau that he was the one who reported them,\nif Xiaojing heard, or if the Demon Suppression Bureau people let it slip here, who knows what his life in Xiling Town could become.\nPeople’s minds are hard to fathom.\nFrom a certain perspective, his actions were indeed a bit despicable, harming others without benefiting himself.\nThe risk of retaliation was too great, better to keep quiet for now.\nHe’d explain once taken to the police station, and just enjoy the novel life experience.\nAt this moment, Yangliang frowned. With Lin Li’s voice and appearance, he could tell the other was very young, so he asked, \"Are you of age yet? Answer honestly, lying to me now will cost you!\"\n\"Not yet.\" Lin Li couldn’t be bothered to lie at this point.\nFinally fully dressed, Xiaojing turned pale upon hearing this answer.\nIt’s over! Completely over! Another sin added! The release date pushed back again, damn the company, why don’t they screen their clients, letting in such low-quality guests.\n\"Damn it, such a young age and already not learning well! You’re fourteen at least, right?\" Unaware of Lin Li’s background, Yangliang cursed directly.\n\"That was a while ago.\"\nAt this, Yangliang walked away swearing.\nBefore coming, Lin Li had briefly researched relevant laws: Ages 14-18 receive lighter sentences, under 14 results in no punishment.\nHe’s seventeen, so what typically gets others fifteen days might only be five for him, maybe none at all, depending on the local attitude.\nYangliang soon returned, holding a mask, which he tossed to Lin Li: \"Put it on.\"\nLin Li took it and saw it wasn’t the type used for escorting death row prisoners with no holes, but had eyeholes for observation.\nIt seemed to be specifically for protecting a minor’s personal information, as Xiaojing didn’t have this privilege.\n\"Thank you, Uncle.\" Lin Li eagerly put on the mask.\nSometimes putting on a mask was actually taking one off.\nLin Li felt like he was Daniel Wu, with a group of Jackies waiting outside for him.\n\"You’re quite happy, aren’t you?\" Seeing Lin Li’s wide grin, Yangliang couldn’t help but crack.\nHe actually saw excitement and joy on Lin Li’s face, did he even realize his situation?\nWhen Lin Li’s family arrived, Yangliang would definitely have a good talk with them.\nHe was very curious what kind of family upbringing could produce such an extraordinary youngster.\n\"Put on your own clothes and come out!\" Seeing Lin Li was still wearing the chicken farm’s massage robe, Yangliang ordered.\nWhen Lin Li came out dressed and with his phone, the hallway was crowded with crouching people, all looking pitiful and miserable.\nWow, things got spicy. One guy had ’pig’ written in Chinese on his face, while his partner wore leather, seeming to have been playing a letter game.\nHey, that flight attendant costume looks good, someone had already picked her out from the chicken certificates he saw earlier, she seemed to be the top pick.\nThis one, this one is totally off, look at that figure.\nLin Li was analyzing everyone when he suddenly caught Yangliang’s gaze.\nYangliang just silently stared at Lin Li.\nLin Li was starting to feel embarrassed, scratched his head, realized it was the mask, and put his hand down: \"What is it, Uncle?\"\nYangliang took a deep breath, then another, seemingly to calm himself, and then said word for word:\n\"Can you, this darn kid, have a little awareness you’re a criminal? Get back here and squat with your head in your hands! Why are you walking around!\"\nYangliang was nearly out of breath from anger.\nThe scene just now was truly mind-boggling.\nAfter Lin Li came out of the room, wearing a criminal mask, he wandered back and forth in front of the others squatting in the hallway, with his hands clasped behind his back, as if evaluating each crouched person, shaking his head, nodding, even sighing.\nEven Yangliang felt like Lin Li wasn’t a criminal; the kid was a supervisor inspecting their work, expressing regret and disappointment at these misguided people!\nEspecially since this kid was quite tall, he had to slightly look up when making eye contact before.\nThis kid’s guardian better provide an explanation to Sanqiao Police Station, or he’s not taking him home.\nA true scourge of society.\nReleasing into the market would surely overthrow it.\nIf possible, Yangliang wanted to suggest the family start over with a new kid, since the current one was a lost cause.\n\"Oops, sorry, I momentarily forgot my identity,\" Lin Li realized and quickly apologized, then moved to squat with the others.\n\"Uncle.\" But after observing the others’ situation, Lin Li looked towards Yangliang.\n\"What—now?\" Yangliang asked with a drawn-out sigh.\nHe really hated the juvenile protection laws now, just look, look, look at what’s being protected!\n\"They all have handcuffs, I don’t, can I get one too, Uncle?\" Lin Li looked enviously at the others’ cuffed hands, earnestly asking.\nWanting to fully experience being captured; not wearing handcuffs would waste this valuable opportunity.\nYangliang: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 17: Chapter 17 Sorry, I’m Late (Tears) (Trembling Voice) (Crying on the Ground)\nI can’t catch my breath, brother. Yangliang has been in the business for years, but he’s never heard such a request.\nHouses can be rebuilt if they collapse, but what Lin Li built can’t be rebuilt.\nYangliang decides to go back and write a proposal to abolish the juvenile protection law.\nOr maybe clarify that the law only protects minors who are human. For creatures like Lin Li, there should be a heavy-handed approach.\nThe brothers and sisters squatting around all cast admiring glances at this moment.\nSuch a composed guy, even at a time like this, he can still joke with the cops. Feels like his dad is at least Li Gang, a bit of envy there.\n\"Bro, do you have connections?\" the person squatting next to him asked in a low voice.\nLin Li looked up, staring at the empty ceiling, \"Where? I don’t see anyone.\"\nPerson beside: \"?\"\nIf I say you have connections below, are you going to look at the Underworld?\nIn fact, the reason for Lin Li’s frivolous and casual behavior is quite simple, because no matter how you put it, he believes he hasn’t done anything wrong; from the outcome, he’s done a good thing by reporting.\nIf Lin Li hadn’t provided assistance to the Demon Suppression Bureau, he certainly wouldn’t be acting like this but would behave properly.\nSince he’s not wrong and even meritorious, he might as well try out all the things he wants to say and do. This might indeed cause some trouble for the Demon Suppression Bureau and the Demon Suppression Envoys, but Lin Li thinks once the truth is clear, the merits and demerits will offset, and the Demon Suppression Envoys will forgive him.\n——I bled for the Emperor, so now I want to be a bit cheeky!\nLin Li got his wish and wore silver bracelets, though Yangliang had a bad attitude when cuffing him, and was quite rough, with a hint of violent enforcement.\n\"Have you checked everything? You didn’t let anyone hide and slip through, right?\" Yangliang, seemingly a senior Demon Suppression Envoy, looked to the other officers, asking as a command.\nAfter confirming nothing was missed, he waved his hand, \"Take them all away!\"\nDownstairs, the situation was a bit better, and there were more people; most were just answering simple questions, unlike those on the third floor who were directly apprehended. Many people were also emotional, loudly protesting their innocence.\nWith confidence.\nAfter all, they were just here for normal massages and foot baths, it was truly an innocent disaster for them.\n\"Damn, I didn’t know this place offered such services, good job on the sweep, really, you’ve done a great job! This harmful thing must be swept away, yes! must! be! swept! away!\" Lin Li heard someone saying this as he passed by.\nOkay, fine, but why do you look so regretful and remorseful, reciting every word through gritted teeth?\nBro, is the tear in your eye from your deep love for this land?\nThe Demon Suppression Envoy questioning him seemed to understand his meaning and impatience, waving dismissively, \"Alright, alright, since you’re here just for a massage, you can leave soon.\"\nAs the officer stepped away, the man could finally let out his restrained emotions, \"I was born when you were old! Why did I miss the springtime?! Sadly, blossoms fall, when will the swallows return?\"\nWow, still a literati, too bad the Demon Suppression Envoy who couldn’t stand it directly shooed him outside.\nBy this time, Lin Li was also outside the Light Noble Health Club with everyone else.\nA middle-aged man was just parking his electric bike and about to dismount, only to see the scene of a large group being apprehended and escorted out.\nAll the Demon Suppression Envoys quietly watched the man who seemed to want to enter, every single one of them.\nLooking at each other, only to be left disappointed.\nAre you touched? Too scared to move, with one leg still hovering in the air.\nEven afraid to breathe.\n\"Do you want to come in?\" After a standoff, Yangliang asked calmly.\n\"I’m not here for this shop.\"\nThe man, dripping with sweat, kept his face unchanged as he shook his head, got off the bike, and smoothly walked into the shop next door.\nAs for why a scruffy man in his forties is visiting a women’s nail salon at night, let’s ignore that—species diversity must be embraced.\nWho forbids an uncle from getting a manicure? Frustrated, is an uncle not entitled to pursue beauty?\nLin Li was certain, even if the place next door were a coffin shop, the uncle would still take a stroll and buy few wreaths.\n\"Bring over the car.\" Some Demon Suppression Envoys followed Yangliang’s order and left.\nIn just a minute or two, a large crowd of onlookers had gathered outside the shop, with heads poking out from surrounding shops and residential buildings.\nThere’s just something captivating about an anti-vice operation.\nMany people were already taking pictures with their phones; Lin Li felt a bit lucky he was wearing a mask, otherwise, it would be awkward to wrap up.\nAmong the crowd, Lin Li spotted the guy from the restroom asking about life’s meaning, now staring dumbfounded while holding half a roasted pigeon.\nA lucky one who escaped.\nHis luck is indeed good; he chose to flee at the most opportune moment. A good guy willing to share his miraculous oil gets his reward.\nLin Li’s unique appearance caught the guy’s attention, and he recognized Lin Li from his clothes, so after thinking for a moment, he sighed and slowly raised his hand.\n\"Hmm?\"\nYangliang noticed someone saluting him, though the gesture wasn’t standard, and the guy was holding a roasted pigeon, but since it was directed at him, he responded with a proper salute.\nFeeling much better.\nFeeling the people’s support is the unique allure of his job.\nThe ’damage’ caused by Lin Li, this unlucky kid, was somewhat healed.\nLin Li hesitated to speak—no surprise if that guy just saluted him.\nAs for the salute’s meaning, it was probably ’Take care, we’ll look after your wife and kids’.\nSince he couldn’t salute back due to the handcuffs, Lin Li could only cup his hands in appreciation.\nAfter all, they were buddies who shared the same trenches.\nBy now, many cars had begun to arrive one after another, but not as Lin Li expected; they were all private, not a single police car.\nYet, thinking about it, it made sense; all the Demon Suppression Envoys were in plain clothes here. It was likely meant to be a covert operation. With police cars, the disguise would be pointless.\nBut Lin Li felt disappointed.\n\"Uncle, is there no police car for me to ride? Didn’t anyone drive one here?\"\nLin Li immediately shut up.\nBecause Yangliang just gave him a strange look, feeling like he was on the verge of breaking the law.\nSuspecting a violent tendency, possibly a domestic abuser—ladies, beware.\n\"If I ever get the chance to take you back, I’ll make sure to drive a police car with all the razzle-dazzle to drop you off, let everyone know what you did! Get in this car, now!\" Yangliang said through gritted teeth.\nLin Li shrugged innocently and got into the car.\nInitially, Lin Li wanted to clarify everything in the car, but to his surprise, it wasn’t a dedicated vehicle, there was someone else next to him, so Lin Li had no choice but to keep it to himself.\nWatching the scenery pass by outside, Lin Li recognized they weren’t heading to the nearest police station, stretching his neck to check Yangliang’s navigation—it seemed their destination was the branch office.\nProbably there were too many people to interrogate today, the police station’s holding cells and interrogation rooms wouldn’t be enough, so they had to be taken to a bigger stage.\n\"Get out.\"\nSure enough, the car went straight to the Public Security Bureau.\n\"Uncle...\"\n\"Shut up, no way.\"\nNo, he hasn’t even said anything yet. Seeing Yangliang’s cold refusal, Lin Li felt a bit upset.\nRealizing his lack of empathy, possibly thinking Lin Li had an urgent need like a bathroom request, Yangliang asked proactively, \"What is it?\"\n\"I wanted to squat with my head down and take a photo with you...\"\n\"Shut up, no way.\"\nDamn, I shouldn’t have asked at all.",

I went out to buy gold last night, and the salesgirl accidentally touched my hand. It threw me completely off, and I ran back in a panic, sigh.\"\n\"Is that why you committed robbery and harassment?\"\n...\n\"Here’s the thing: when I was staying at the hotel, a small note slipped under the door. It said ’Duck, 100 per session, strong and fit, guaranteed to last an hour, or you get a refund of 400.’\nI thought it was a good deal, so I called for him. But that weakling finished in five minutes, tossed 400 bucks at me, and that’s when you guys came in.\nSo you really can’t judge me based on the seller! I’m the buyer here, cut me some slack, detain me for a few days just for appearances, alright?\"\n...\n\"Listen to me explain, I’m in the business of buying second-hand phones. How was I supposed to know the customer would send me a hotel location? But there was money to be made, so of course I went. Buying phones inevitably involves haggling. We both worked up a sweat, so naturally, we had to shower, and as for the transaction records on the phone you mentioned, that’s just the money for the phones.\"\n...\n\"Guardians of Liberation West\" really is a documentary, Lin Li was greatly amazed listening to the conversations coming from the various interrogation rooms.\nThis place is truly full of talent; everyone speaks eloquently. It really is a kindergarten of enlightened dragons.\nThey caught quite a lot of people at once tonight, coupled with the other cases that already needed handling, and for the moment, the interrogation rooms were running out.\nHowever, perhaps because he was the only minor, even though the car he was in wasn’t the first to arrive, he managed to cut the line and was interrogated early.\nHis chair was the classic stainless steel interrogation stool. Yangliang was a good comrade; Lin Li had barely mentioned \"uncle\" before cuffs were added to his feet.\nLin Li felt a bond forming between them—as if patting Uncle Yang’s back would instantly communicate the desired position.\n\"Is it really necessary to cuff this kid’s hands and feet?\" The requirement is for at least two Demon Suppression Envoys to be present during interrogation. So, there was another one here who seemed to rank slightly above Yangliang. He looked questioningly at Yangliang when he saw Lin Li’s handcuffs.\n\"This little bastard begged me to cuff him,\" Yangliang grunted heavily, expressing his irritation.\nAnother Demon Suppression Envoy: \"?\"\n\"This brat’s brain is likely messed up, a minor plus a mental case, damn it; he’s full of debuffs. I don’t even want to interrogate him. Just call his family to pick him up.\" Yangliang spoke with a face full of headache.\n\"It’s not that simple. Actually, I’m also a cross-genderist. Male physically, female mentally. But since I have a transvestism fetish, I still wear men’s clothes, and I’m homosexual, so I like females. Plus, I’m a mix of Jewish and Black, but due to a rare case of albinism and gene mutation, I look local...\"\nAt that moment, Lin Li raised his hands and began chanting.\n\"Foreign buffs don’t work here, shut up.\" Yangliang had become quite skilled in telling Lin Li to shut it, and said it smoothly before looking at the nearby Demon Suppression Envoy, \"See? I told you he’s nuts, right?\"\n\"You’re right. Let’s finish the proceedings quickly and get his family to take him away,\" the Demon Suppression Envoy nodded.\n\"I know, let’s start the interrogation! We ask, you answer.\" Yangliang nodded and then turned to Lin Li, slamming the table hard.\n\"Is it because two people in love can’t call each other’s names that they have to endure interrogation?\" Lin Li said with a laugh as he threw out his final line: \"Just missing a chance to experience it.\"\nYangliang: \"...\"\nInterrogations are such a hassle.\nHe wanted to use a major memory restoration spell.\nIt was well known that this nation had long been called the Land of Etiquette.\nWhich meant one should wield fists like a bam! Bam! Bam!\n\"Alright, you two uncles, we’ve experienced pretty much everything that needed experiencing. It’s time to reveal my identity. I’m done pretending, I’m laying my cards on the table now,\" Lin Li paused slightly, a mysterious smile on his face: \"I’m not an idiot, I’m one of your own, I’m undercover.\"\nAnother Demon Suppression Envoy: \"Definitely a lunatic.\"\nYangliang: \"I told you.\"\nLin Li: \"I’m not!\"\nAnother Demon Suppression Envoy: \"It’s unlikely we’ll gather any information from him. Did he have any ID when he was caught?\"\nYangliang: \"No ID seen, but he had a phone. Let’s go check the phone.\"\nLin Li: \"Acknowledge me, will ya?\"\nAnother Demon Suppression Envoy: \"Would’ve been nice to mention that earlier. I thought it was just this guy.\"\nYangliang: \"Then let’s go.\"\nAnother Demon Suppression Envoy: \"Yeah.\"\nLin Li: \"No, uncle, damn it, I’m not being abstract about it, really just acknowledge me!\"\n\"...\"\nThe two continued their rather mundane conversation, never glancing at Lin Li, and were getting ready to leave.\nBit disrespectful, isn’t it?\nSeeing both Demon Suppression Envoys about to go, Lin Li quickly explained: \"No, you two uncles, I’m really undercover! You could round off and say this operation was led by me! You acted tonight because you got a tip-off call, didn’t you?\nThat tip was from me! My name is Lin Li, and my phone number ends in 9749. You can definitely match it up!\"\nLin Li’s statement instantly drew the attention of the two Demon Suppression Envoys, and the three of them were speechless for a moment before Yangliang widened his eyes and exclaimed:\n\"You’re the mentally... not so normal informant the head office mentioned?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDimwitted, they meant to say dimwitted, right?\nYour head office sure talks dirty.\n\"It’s not me, I’m not dimwitted, quite normal actually,\" Lin Li shook his head and then gently led them on:\n\"Surely your head office also mentioned another normal, great, caring, and admirable informant, right? That’s me.\"\nOnce again, the three of them were speechless.\n\"It’s definitely this guy.\"\n\"If it’s this strange kid reporting, I can understand. It’s the kind of thing he would do.\" Yangliang suddenly laughed, relieved, and nodded to his colleague, \"No wonder I didn’t see anyone approaching me at the scene; turns out it was this kid.\"\n\"Then leave him with you for now; I’ll go help others. We’re shorthanded here tonight.\" The other Demon Suppression Envoy’s face showed amused resignation as he stood up.\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Even though you’re the informant, according to rules, we can’t just let you go. We still need you to cooperate with me and make a statement. Let’s go, follow me to the office.\" Yangliang stepped forward to unlock Lin Li’s handcuffs and shackle, lifting his head with intuition:\n\"We can’t, the interrogation room is tight on schedule tonight, lots of people waiting in line to use it, we just can’t make a statement here like this.\"\nLin Li widened his eyes, swallowing the ’uncle’ he was about to say.\nHe actually got predicted.\nHe didn’t need to pat Uncle Yang’s back; he already knew what position he wanted?\nNevertheless, Lin Li quickly nodded. While he wanted to experience things, there was no need to cause real trouble for others, and he had at least sat in the interrogation chair. Just cherishing the moments, not seeking eternity.\nThis thing isn’t meant to last long, either.\nRegaining his freedom, Lin Li stretched, then followed Yangliang to the office to retrieve his phone.\nLin Li unlocked his phone and displayed his call logs, confirming his identity as the informant.\n\"His grandma, I don’t even know where to start with this statement. I’ve been a cop for so long, and you’re the first of your kind I’ve met.\" Yangliang sat down, at a loss between laughter and tears, his head cradled in his arms, body leaning back, then he spoke gently:\n\"Xiaolin, anything you’d like to say first?\"\nThere was a noticeable change in the Demon Suppression Envoy’s attitude toward him.\nFrom arrogance to humility, it’s quite amusing upon reflection.\nThis idiom might not be aptly used, but never mind, it’s not important.\nIn truth, if Lin Li weren’t certain that his act of reporting was virtuous, he wouldn’t have been this bold at the Demon Suppression Bureau.\nAfter all, he did have some ’merit’.\nLin Li nodded, then delivered his last line that hadn’t found a chance to be spoken:\n\"Before my lawyer arrives, I won’t say a word.\"\nYangliang: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 19: Chapter 19: We Are Professionally Trained, No Matter How Funny, We Just Laugh Out Loud\n\"Just joking, Uncle, I’m just trying to lighten the mood,\" Lin Li said, thinking that saying ’hire a lawyer’ sounded cool.\nIf it weren’t for the fact that adding curse words wouldn’t be appropriate, Lin Li really wanted to emulate Carl from \"Shameless.\"\n\"Do you know my blood pressure has been constantly high because of your ’livening up’? Are all kids of your generation this abstract?\" Yangliang was genuinely frustrated.\nHe was now more eager to meet Lin Li’s parents, to ask for parenting tips so he can completely avoid pitfalls.\n\"Not really, I’m quite exceptional, and there are few like me.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nAmong those around him who could clearly outshine him, maybe only Bai Bufan could, which is why they are best friends.\n\"Great, there’s still hope for the country,\" Yangliang heaved a sigh of relief.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nA truly vulgar comment.\n\"I’ll ask, you answer,\" Yangliang waved his hand, realizing that if he left the initiative to Lin Li, things might go unexpectedly haywire.\n\"First, how did you know that Light Noble Health Club secretly offers erotic services?\"\n\"A friend told me,\" when in doubt, involve a friend. \"As for the friend’s name, I don’t think it’s necessary to mention it, right?\"\n\"Actually, even if you mentioned it, we wouldn’t investigate him, but we understand if you choose not to; it’s your freedom.\" Yangliang nodded, this was only natural, then he asked the real question he was curious about:\n\"So, Xiaolin, why didn’t you report directly to us initially but instead went to... experience it firsthand before informing us?\"\nAsk me? Ask the system!\nYou think I wanted to sacrifice myself for the greater good?\nI didn’t want to be personally involved either.\nBut I obviously couldn’t put it like that: \"Firstly, my friend also heard this as a rumor and hadn’t actually been there, so to avoid reporting a false alarm, I had to verify the authenticity of the information and gather evidence.\nSo I went for a field investigation, and by the time I called you, I had already gathered the evidence.\nSecondly, I must clarify that I truly remain pure and untainted despite being surrounded by troubles, my chastity is intact...\nUncle, what does that expression mean? You’re laughing, aren’t you? I’m being serious here.\"\n\"We’ve received professional training; no matter how funny the situation, we won’t laugh,\" Yangliang said earnestly, pressing his hand against his mouth.\n\"Unless you can’t help it?\" Lin Li said, grinding his teeth.\n\"It’s not that, Xiaolin, I don’t want to believe you; it’s just that when I entered your room, none of you were wearing clothes,\" Yangliang recalled the scene, finding it hard to keep a straight face.\n\"No, speaking of that really gets me upset. First of all, it wasn’t ’none of us,’ it was only Xiaojing who wasn’t dressed, and only the top wasn’t clothed,\" Lin Li said more loudly this time, \"And secondly, thankfully I have a recording to prove my innocence.\"\nLin Li took out his phone, played the latter half of two long recordings on fast forward, occasionally dragging the progress bar.\n\"...\"\n\"Miss, please behave yourself!\"\n\"...\"\n\"Listen, listen, Uncle, I’m really innocent; I even said something silly like ’Miss, please behave yourself!’\"\n\"Forty minutes, it’s forty hours! I’ve waited for you guys a whole forty days! Do you know how I’ve suffered pain and endured torture in these forty years of solitude, Officer!!\"\nLin Li stood up, shouting hoarsely, his eyes slightly red, a bit too lost in the act.\nYangliang didn’t speak, took the phone from Lin Li, pulled the progress bar back a little, releasing Lin Li’s own voice:\n\".... A little to the left, yes, just press the calf muscle there, a bit more force, oh yes, yes, yes~~~ oh yeah~~~\"\n\"In these forty years, were you suffering? Were you tortured? I didn’t hear that,\" Yangliang looked at Lin Li seriously and asked earnestly.\nListening to one’s own moans is quite embarrassing, knowing now that he was so loud, the years of undercover rage going to waste Lin Li scratched his head, sat down again, a bit sheepishly saying:\n\"Putting that aside, though my body felt comfortable, my mind was constantly tortured and tormented...\"\nYangliang: \"...\"\nDid you finish saying everything?\nBut he indeed believed now that Lin Li didn’t accept the shady services; it made sense. Even abstract thinking wouldn’t lead him to knowingly jump into a pit when they were about to arrive.\nPulling the recording to the end, when Xiaojing was about to force services on him, Lin Li said:\n\"You heard it, right? I didn’t know she undressed; if you guys had arrived a bit later, I would have been forced! Forty minutes, where is the delay? When I get back, I’ll report your negligence!\"\nLin Li’s tone was grieved.\nClearly, Yangliang’s training on restraint wasn’t enough, he laughed heartily.\nLin Li looked over with even more grievance: \"No explanation?\"\nYangliang explained: \"My teeth got too warm, I need to cool them.\"\n\"Not that explanation!\"\nYangliang finally addressed Lin Li’s previous question: \"Cough, cough, as for your point, we need to clarify that we received the notice immediately, and didn’t waste any time, but these places are cautious enough to have lookouts several street corners away to warn them.\nTo ensure the success of the operation, as you saw, we went in plain clothes, drove our own vehicles, additionally assembling the personnel, which took time. In fact, getting there in forty minutes was quick; you can’t blame us for this.\nFurthermore, in your case, even if something did happen, after due consideration, we wouldn’t hold you responsible.\"\n\"What? You didn’t say so earlier? You’ve misled me!\"\nYangliang: \"?\"\nSeeing Lin Li’s remorse, Yangliang chuckled and shook his head, this kid really takes every chance he’s given.\n\"How is this brat so arrogant after being caught? You even wanted to sit handcuffed in a police car. Was it because you knew you’d be fine, and you wanted to experience it all?\" Yangliang amusedly confirmed.\nIt’s clear to him now.\n\"Kind of, besides I couldn’t acknowledge myself to you guys right away; those caught were still there. What if there was retaliation afterward?\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"You were indeed right to be cautious there, it should be so. Well, I have enough information for my report now; you’re free to go. I can give you a ride home.\nIf you want to take a picture at the door now, you can go directly to shoot, and I can drive you home in a police car to fulfill your last wish.\" Yangliang put away his notebook and pen, then said.\n\"Alright, but Uncle, I have one more thing.\"\n\"What is it, speak.\"\n\"It’s... for this undercover operation, I spent 399, which is an exceedingly expensive cost, you know, I’m still a student and it’s significant for me. There’s no need for you to reimburse it, but giving it back to me shouldn’t be a problem?\"\nLin Li cautiously said.\nThis is 399! 798 packets of spicy sticks! 133 bottles of iced Lao Da tea! 1 Spring Breeze Elf (Zhang Fei edition)!\nYou could ride the rocking chair all day with that money.\nIf this money isn’t returned, Lin Li would be upset to death.\n\"But you got a massage, didn’t you?\" Now it was Yangliang’s turn to tease Lin Li.\n\"That was at most a 99 service! I categorically refused the parts with extra charges! Uncle, can you return me 200, and the rest counts as your commission?\" Lin Li argued.\n\"Commission my foot!\" Yangliang laughed and cursed, \"The money can certainly be refunded to you, and if there’s no mistake, as the informant, you should also be able to apply for a certain reward.\nBut right now, directly transferring money with her phone is illegal; I can’t do it like this, there needs to be procedure and steps to follow. If you’re short on money, I can transfer my own money to you, and once you get the refund, you return it to me.\"\n\"No hurry, I can wait.\"\nLin Li waved his hand indifferently; he still had plenty of living expenses, as long as the money came back, it’s all good.\n\"Is there anything else?\" Yangliang asked.\n\"Yes,\" Lin Li thought for a moment, then nodded.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Can Xiaojing and I go out alone for 20 minutes? Ten minutes would do... Five minutes... no, five minutes is too short.\"\nSeeing Lin Li eager, Yangliang: \"?\"\n\"I have important things to ask her, oh and prepare me a 1.8 by 2-meter bed with a Sealy mattress, also jelly, popping candy, ice cream——\"\n\"Shut up, go home.\"\n\"Okay, Uncle!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 20: Chapter 20: I Deserve to Die!\n\"What’s the point of life anyway, Xiaolin?\"\nThis was the second time today Lin Li heard this question.\nThe problem was, this time it wasn’t a person with Jade Syndrome or a guest from a chicken farm, but rather the driver of his car.\nAnd following this was the acceleration of the vehicle beneath him.\nDamn it.\n\"Uncle, don’t be like this, I’m scared.\" Sitting in the back seat, Lin Li silently fastened his seatbelt.\nWhere are you taking me? Is this still a police car, or has it become a hearse?\nI was just curious about the profession of a Demon Suppression Envoy, so I asked Yangliang about wages, overtime, promotion prospects, how easy it is to write work reports, and whether it’s simple to handle disputes— just a few small questions, not enough to cause such a rapid emotional shift, right?\nHis mental composure is seriously questionable.\nYangliang gave Lin Li a deep look through the rearview mirror: \"If you’re scared, then shut up.\"\nIn the previous conversation, he had mentioned that he actually had already gone home after work, but came out again temporarily.\nAs a result, Lin Li had asked him why.\nWhy? Why isn’t this ’culprit’ who caused the overtime clear about it.\nLin Li remained silent, watching the streetscape retreat outside the window while actually checking his system.\nTask two had not yet been notified as complete, but Lin Li thought about it and figured the reason might be that it required follow-up from the Demon Suppression Bureau since some Hehuan Demons chilling at home after hours hadn’t been captured yet, not meeting the ’eradication’ requirement.\nHopefully, it’s as he assumes.\nAnyway, he’s already done the best he can, but he’s still a bit disappointed and dejected, thinking that it would be done immediately.\nA light sigh escapes him.\n\"This is the neighborhood, right? Get out and hurry home, don’t keep your parents waiting. Also, say hi to them for me and, by the way, consider starting over with a new account, kiddo, you’ve pretty much wasted this one.\" Yangliang parks slowly, unlocks the car door, jokingly talking to Lin Li.\n\"Okay, thanks, Uncle, but don’t worry. My dad’s already gone, my mom’s working out there, I’m the only one at home, no one’s in a hurry. As for a new account, that’s even less likely.\" Lin Li finished speaking and jogged back home.\nThough it’s just approaching nine, he has to get up early tomorrow, plus he’s got some research to do on the first Chapter of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique— Lin Li’s quite busy.\nYangliang, who just prepared to get out for a relaxing smoke, trembled slightly, and the cigarette fell straight to the ground.\nHe then extends his trembling hand, places the cigarette into his shaking mouth, and shakily grabs the lighter, failing to ignite it after several attempts.\nHis ears are still ringing with Lin Li’s response, while the image of Lin Li’s just noticed disappointed and dejected face flashes before him.\nPrior to this, he had never seen such an expression on Lin Li’s face.\nWhat sadness, what sorrow.\nHe turned his head to look at the silent and solitary figure running toward the neighborhood in the distance, mouth moving, but none of the words made their way out.\nAfter three seconds.\n\"Bang!\"\nYangliang slapped his own face: \"Damn it, I’m really an idiot!\"\nThe child’s expression just now, why has the always-present smile on his lips disappeared? Clearly, my words poked at his sore spot!\nYangliang suddenly realized something— the abstraction may not be Lin Li’s true nature after all. It’s just the shell he forged to protect his fragile heart!\nHe’s just a pitiful child hiding behind a smile.\nDamn it, what did I dare to say to such a child!\nAs a cop, hurting a child in this way is unforgivable!\nDamn it, I’m really an idiot!\n...\nCompletely unaware that his normal statements got misinterpreted, Lin Li, whose abstraction was just an inherent nature, was at this moment enthusiastically completing the modern body refining technique.\nBecause of his efforts during the day, this didn’t take much time.\nSubsequently, in his living room, Lin Li officially practiced the content of the first Chapter of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique— no way he’d practice while reading the paper tomorrow, definitely must memorize the contents first.\nThe translation is accurate.\nThis time, there’s no spraying all over his head, nor the urge to pee, and indeed no warm stream, but Lin Li truly felt a profound change coming from his body, sensing his muscles and bones seem to be spreading open.\nThe effects aren’t exaggerated, a single time won’t have an immediate effect; after all, the cultivation technique itself said it requires time and sweat to accumulate.\nMore than anything, it’s an indescribable, subtle, future-promising feeling as if the flesh is expressing joy— Boxing King Tyson? Eventually, he’ll be nothing remarkable!\nPracticing eight hundred times a day might really make one become Saitama.\nHe takes a shower, casually video calls his mom, and then Lin Li prepares to go to sleep.\n...\n10:20 PM.\nLin Li stares at the ceiling.\nDamn it, been lying here for forty minutes and can’t sleep.\nEven though he was quite tired this morning, after enjoying forty minutes at the massage parlor, he’s not that tired anymore.\nPlus, today’s experiences were rather novel, combined with finally being able to practice an Earth-unrelated cultivation technique, making Lin Li’s mind quite excited.\nToday’s the weekend, and his biological clock seems to refuse to allow him to sleep now.\nLin Li sighs: \"Let’s count sheep.\"\n...\n10:40 PM.\n\"Five hundred sixty-two sheep, five hundred sixty-four sheep, five hundred sixty-five, five hundred... Damn it, what was the last number of sheep just now?\" Lin Li suddenly sat up, full of energy.\nHe picked up his phone, somewhat defeated.\nThe voice chat of their usual gaming group was still buzzing with conversation; curious, he clicked into it.\nA cheerful atmosphere pervaded the voice chat, everyone laughed and chatted, but Lin Li somehow felt like someone was talking about someone’s mother or something?\nApart from mentioning mothers, words like ’useless trash,’ ’even a chicken throwing keys could play better than you’, ’are you even human?’ echoed classically in there.\nLin Li distinguished that out of the five people, only Bai Bufan was gentle and calm, and stayed silent.\nThe mystery was solved; it was him they were cursing.\nAnd between 1 to 10, he seriously committed an unforgivable offense.\nOtherwise, he would always talk back.\nA good chance for Lin Li, he joined in, and amidst the chaos, also took a few shots at Bai Bufan.\n\"Lin Li, what brings you here?\" Being the one cursed, Bai Bufan keenly noticed Lin Li.\n\"Quick, quick, Lin Li, log in, hurry up and replace this beast Bai Bufan, can’t stand him, he’s become the tallest wall on our road to victory.\" Others quickly chimed in.\n\"Don’t blindly bash, my favorite player once said, there’s no hero called ’Wall’ in League of Legends, if you don’t know the game, don’t narrate it here.\" Bai Bufan argued stubbornly at this moment.\n\"Nah, I have to get up early for something tomorrow, but I can’t sleep now, and I don’t have things like melatonin at home, so I don’t know what to do. Came up here just to see you guys, made me feel a lot better seeing you like this.\" Lin Li declined.\n\"Are you still part of the forum, man? Do you even need to ask for this sort of thing? When in doubt, conquer the land— play a county!\"\nOne phrase awakened a dreamer!\nIs there a possibility that after such an exciting day, it’s not his brain that’s excited but his cerebellum!\nLin Li immediately hung up the voice chat and went to the bathroom.\nEntered a URL.\nwww.____.com.\n...\nBai Bufan is indeed a miracle worker.\nLin Li got sleepy.\nYawning, he lay on the bed and closed his eyes.\n...\n3:20 AM.\nLin Li...\nLin Li was naturally already asleep, sleeping soundly, almost five hours in, and soon enough, his alarm would ring.\nBut someone at that moment still couldn’t sleep.\nA few kilometers away, a woman getting up in the night found her husband was not in bed, rubbed her eyes, then found him smoking on the balcony, looking perplexed:\n\"Yangliang, what are you doing, it’s already this late, why aren’t you sleeping? Didn’t you agree to take the kids to the amusement park tomorrow?\"\nYangliang turned his head to look at his wife, his expression a bit worn-out.\n\"I want to go downstairs.\"\nBut he seemed unwilling to use the stairs or take the elevator.\nThe woman was shocked by Yangliang’s state, immediately concern showing: \"What’s wrong?\"\nYangliang slapped his face:\n\"Damn it, I’m really an idiot!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 21: Chapter 21: The Naturally Evil Uchiha Brat!\nWho invented \"Good morning\"? What the hell is good about the morning anyway?\n\"Lin Li, keep it up! If you can wake up so early on a weekend at seventeen, you can succeed in anything you do!\"\n\"Lao Da, grant me power!\" Lin Li wiggled his hands like helicopter blades and finally got out of bed.\nHey buddy, no helicopters can park here.\nRealizing there was no suitable helipad at home—and confirming it was only 4:40—Lin Li lay back down, as usual, for another five minutes of sleep.\nOnce again, pushed himself to the limit to leave the house on time.\nThey say it takes 21 days to form a habit, but can I really persevere for seven days?\nMaybe it was thanks to Xiaojing’s massage yesterday; today the lactic acid buildup was not nearly as bad as Lin Li expected.\nXiaojing, thank you. Long time no see; I wonder how you’re doing these days.\nI wonder if you, in the detention center, also miss me?\nThe speed of falling cherry blossoms is five centimeters per second, yet the distance between our hearts can’t be bridged by even one centimeter.\nR.I.P.\nWeekend mornings might still be important for Lin Li, but for the elderly folks, they’re practically the same.\nWhich is why the number of people in the community park today is about the same as yesterday.\nLin Li jogged lightly to his usual spot, and sure enough, the old man who looked healthy but was actually frail, who tried to scam him before, was here again, wearing the same practice clothes as yesterday.\nLin Li is not one to hold grudges; he forgot all about Bai Bufan stealing snacks last month on the third at noon. So even though the old man tried to scam him before, Lin Li politely greeted him:\n\"Good morning, Grandpa Zhou.\"\nZhou Youwei turned his head when he heard the greeting, and upon seeing Lin Li, felt his steady breathing falter.\nThis kid is back again today; who’s he planning to scam now? It’s outrageous!\nWhen he thought about the hopes he pinned on his junior being like this, Zhou Youwei was filled with anger and snorted coldly: \"Grandpa? Who’s your grandpa? From now on, you’re more like my grandpa!\"\n\"Huh?\" Lin Li scratched his head, hesitated for a moment, but eventually nodded:\n\"Isn’t this Xiaozhou? Good morning, here to exercise so early, that’s great.\"\nAfter all, Lin Li is a well-educated young man of the new era; he attentively watches every session of Youth University Studies without stealing anyone’s screenshots. Therefore, he knows very well the importance of respecting the old and caring for the young.\nSo, although he didn’t understand Grandpa Zhou’s request, he had no problem fulfilling an elderly person’s wish.\nIt’s just something you say.\nRespect first, then understand.\nMaybe Grandpa Zhou found that his grandfather as a young man looked very much like him.\nWait a minute, how did Grandpa Zhou see his grandfather at seventeen? Photos? For someone of grandparent-grandparent generation, being photographed as a child was a privilege only for the wealthy or noble, right? Grandpa Zhou’s background is not simple.\nWhile Lin Li was lost in his thoughts, Zhou Youwei stared at him blankly, even tapping his ear, wondering if his hearing was starting to fail with age.\nWait, did this kid really take on being my grandpa?\nHow is he calling Xiaozhou so smoothly? Didn’t catch the sarcasm at all?\n\"You, you, you, you—\" Pointing his finger, feeling his breathing stagger once more, Zhou Youwei launched into his mental verse of criticism again: \"The illustrious twelve volume military book, in every volume, your name!\"\n\"Xiaozhou, Xiaozhou, what’s up with your health, come sit down, why’s your breath staggered again?\" Lin Li hurriedly went forward to support his newly recognized junior to a nearby stone bench, opened a water bottle, and gave it to him.\nThe first time’s awkward, the second time’s familiar—this time, Lin Li handled it with ease.\nThen, with a tone and manner that lamented, \"Xiaozhou, I’m just saying, what’s up with your family? How do they trust you to exercise alone every morning with this weak constitution? I need to talk some sense into them, seriously.\"\n\"Call me grandpa!\" Zhou Youwei had spent all his energy to say these four words.\n\"Alright, Grandpa Zhou, it feels awkward for me to call you that, and others hearing it might think we have some unspeakable secret.\" Lin Li sighed in relief.\nAre you even feeling awkward at all? You called Xiaozhou pretty smoothly, didn’t you?\nThis kid, he’s just shaving years off my life.\nZhou Youwei felt that he was originally destined to live to 100 years old but now could only make it to 101—keeping bouncing for another year even after getting in the coffin.\n\"Our unspeakable relationship? We’re a scammer and his target!\" Zhou Youwei tapped the water cup he was holding. This kid is still young, there’s hope, as long as he’s properly guided, he can be put back on the right track.\nI can’t watch this kid continue like this.\nLin Li was stunned for a moment, looking at the serious Zhou Youwei, wondering why the old man brought this up directly.\nBut after thinking it over, Lin Li was at ease, smiling brightly and waving his hand, \"No worries, Grandpa Zhou, I don’t mind, I forgive you.\"\nA mistake recognized and corrected is still a good elder.\nOnce again, stressing that Lin Li is broad-minded—on the 12th of last month, during the third game on Saturday afternoon, the beast Bai Bufan as support flashing to steal his first kill didn’t even bother him.\n\"Let’s put this matter behind us.\" Therefore, when Lin Li said this, it was understandable.\nSeeing Lin Li’s bright and warm smile while saying such things to him, Zhou Youwei once again felt the contrasts of the world and the fragility of an elderly body.\nYou forgave me?\nYou actually forgave me?\nWho said there’s hope for this kid, who said he can get back on track? Shut up, this kid is completely hopeless!\nThis kid is inherently as evil as that Uchiha brat.\nIn the aftermath of intense emotional turmoil lay empty calmness, a bland Zhou Youwei shook his head in disappointment, giving up on teaching and asked, \"So kid... young man, what are you doing here this morning again?\"\n\"Here to exercise, of course.\" Lin Li replied.\n\"Exercise, huh, exercise! Kid, I’m going to keep an eye on you!\" Zhou Youwei sneered and then said seriously.\nStill looking to find someone to scam, I absolutely won’t allow it!\nIf it weren’t for my quick reaction yesterday, I’d have fallen for it. But the kind-hearted elders around aren’t as quick as me, I can’t allow my neighbor friends to fall into this trouble!\nLin Li makes any suspicious moves, and Zhou Youwei will take out his phone!\nHe will launch as Dragonfly Captain, record and judge all sins!\n\"Rest assured, no need for you to supervise, I’ll be diligent on my own.\" Lin Li waved, understanding Zhou Youwei’s goodwill as a fellow martial arts practitioner, but it wasn’t necessary; the system is monitoring him from all angles.\nSince Zhou Youwei seemed insistent, Lin Li just let it go.\nAs for his martial techniques being stolen, Lin Li honestly saw no need to fret. First of all, living like that is exhausting.\nSecondly, without the marks indicated by a cultivation technique, noticing certain details with the naked eye is hard, plus, entering the second Chapter stage needs Spiritual Qi. Besides himself, who else has this condition?\nDamn it, thinking about this just irritates me, even I don’t have this condition now.\nCan the Demon Suppression Bureau move a bit faster?\nSettling at his old spot, placing his water bottle down, taking a deep breath, Lin Li immersed himself into practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\nThus, an hour or so passed in immersion.\n[For a week straight, get up before 5:00 AM and diligently practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique. Before 7:00 AM, accumulate at least half an hour. (1/7)]\nLin Li once again regressed as a species—tired like a dog.\nBut the feeling from last night became even clearer on his body; although he was more exhausted than yesterday, every part of him was thrilled, giving him a very complex sensation.\nDamn, achieved physical suffering but mental pleasure.\nThis was an experience completely absent during serious practice of the Eight Brocades yesterday.\nIf it goes on like this, I will definitely get stronger.\nBut I hope I don’t go bald.\n\"Grandpa Zhou, I’m heading back for a nap, goodbye.\" Dragging his tired body, Lin Li picked up his water bottle, smiled at Zhou Youwei, who was still watching from a distance, and said.\nHe didn’t wait for a response and just left; he was too exhausted and just wanted to shower and get back into bed.\nWatching Lin Li’s departing figure, Zhou Youwei smiled in relief.\nUnder my watchful eye, this kid didn’t get a chance to scam anyone today.\nSacrificing the individual for the collective good.\nToday was a successful morning, guarding the neighborhood against that Uchiha scammer brat.\n——From the silent guardian of the neighborhood elderly patrol team, respectfully, Zhou Youwei.",

      "content": "Chapter 22: Chapter 22: You said there’s a calamity in your fate, but you didn’t say it’s a Porsche\nAfter returning home, Lin Li took a shower and went to sleep. When he woke up, it was already noon.\nAfter having a Chinese buffet at the community cafeteria, he went back home to continue translating the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\nTime passed quickly like this. With the previous accumulation, the subsequent speed was quite fast. The translation was nearing completion within two days.\nLin Li originally felt great, the sense of conquest from getting the correct answer after a painstaking translation, until—\n\"Why is there a reference answer at the end!\"\nBut Lin Li quickly realized something was off. He had browsed through it all at the beginning. With such a long modern text, it was impossible for Lin Li not to notice.\n\"Is translation a necessary process? Does the answer appear only after comprehending it by oneself, to prevent messing up because of details?\"\nThen this cultivation technique is more intelligent than a system.\nIt’s a good thing, so Lin Li didn’t think much about it.\nChapters one, three, five, and seven don’t need Spiritual Qi assistance, but the other four do.\nThe odd Chapters are considered one set of body refinement techniques, while the even Chapters are another set. Not learning the second doesn’t hinder starting the third directly after the first.\nAs for the grand promises the cultivation technique made, if mastered thoroughly—even without relying on Spiritual Qi—one’s physical abilities can rapidly grow, nearing the limits of humanity.\nOf course, this humanity doesn’t include Fan Ma Yongcilo.\nThe Sea King Lie is also an exception. The image of the Sea King Lie living with only a head and a baby’s body is something Lin Li can never forget in his lifetime.\nAnd the Spiritual Qi Chapters transform your body into a shape loved by Spiritual Qi, turning into a plush ball for Spiritual Qi.\nIt increases the efficiency of using Spiritual Qi, allowing you to split one portion into two when using or absorbing it later.\nFor Lin Li, this is more important than having super-sensitive Spiritual Qi skin.\nAfter all, he is indeed ’poor’.\nEven if splitting 0 results in two halves, it is still 0.\nSeeing the grand promises, Lin Li was even more passionate.\nOn Sunday morning, Lin Li practiced even more vigorously, even doing one extra round beyond the task’s requirement.\nHowever, the result was that the body’s feedback was not as great as before.\nHis body was more fatigued, and his spirit wasn’t as uplifting as before.\nLin Li thought it through and realized the schedule set by the system must be the most appropriate timing and duration for cultivating the technique. He saw no need to overdo it.\nBut Lin Li also noticed.\nUncle Zhou was genuinely planning to steal his cultivation technique.\nDisrespectful for his age.\nThese past two days, he didn’t practice Tai Chi seriously, or when he did, he pretended to practice while his gaze was always on Lin Li—Lin Li would notice this every time he took a short break.\nLuckily he’s an old man, otherwise, it would definitely be a secret crush.\nPerhaps because of his martial arts background, he could see the extraordinariness of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique at a glance.\nOne still shouldn’t underestimate anyone in the world.\nIt’s just a bit too audacious. Facing Lin Li’s gaze, Zhou Youwei never flinched, meeting his eyes with a look of righteousness.\nHow could someone steal with such righteous audacity?\nHowever, Lin Li didn’t plan to change his practice location because of this.\nHe’s at least a martial arts enthusiast who helped him complete a task before, so this also counts as feedback for Zhou Youwei—besides, it’s hard to successfully steal. If he succeeds, kudos to him.\n...\nSunday evening.\nAlthough it’s still technically the weekend, for the students of Nansang Middle School, everything was already over.\nThus, when Lin Li arrived at the classroom, everyone looked soulless and lifeless, as if their bodies and souls had separated.\nMost were already seated, starting on the untouched weekend homework.\nThe abstract kids in the back row didn’t count as part of this majority.\nIt’s not because they had finished their homework, but because they were cherishing the last ten minutes of freedom.\n\"Yellow Heaven above, if I listen to ’Clockwise’, can I go back to the weekend?\" Bai Bufan was loudly praying at the back of the classroom, standing on the storage closet with Zhou Baowei.\n\"Listening once probably won’t work, but if you listen for five days, you can return to the weekend.\" said Lin Li, who had just put down his backpack, to Bai Bufan.\n\"...\"\n\"Don’t say it, really don’t say it, Lin Li, you really are a genius of time management.\" Bai Bufan hesitated, then gave Lin Li a thumbs up.\n\"Thanks, come on, Bao Wei, what did you do over the weekend, got your Yang energy sucked out?\" Lin Li walked over to the two of them, noticing the dark circles on Zhou Baowei’s face, and was astonished.\n\"He probably played soldier like crazy this weekend.\" Bai Bufan shrugged.\n\"Soldier is fine, guarding Ying Zheng is satisfying, everyone understands, but don’t overindulge.\" Lin Li immediately understood Bai Bufan’s meaning but still advised.\n\"No way, you know about Bao Wei’s self-control, one day without ’being a toilet soldier’ builds up Yang virtue, two days without builds up more.\" Bai Bufan sighed deeply.\n\"Then there’s no hope for him.\" Lin Li nodded in agreement.\nZhou Baowei, standing to the side with a head full of black lines, said, \"Can you two bastards stop making yellow rumors without considering the party involved? I look like this because I’ve been staying up all night gaming.\"\nTwo beasts doing stand-up comedy, not caring about the life and death of the people involved, right?\nThe main concern is that the female student who just came to the locker looked at me weirdly!\n\"Was it Genshin Impact?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"That’s great, you still have hope.\" Bai Bufan sighed in relief.\n\"What got to you?\"\n\"So you weren’t playing soldier this weekend?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"...One thing doesn’t relate to another.\" Zhou Baowei laughed dryly and then lowered his voice, saying, \"But haven’t you heard? There seems to be a massage parlor near our school that got busted because it secretly offered certain services, and word has it someone reported it.\"\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\"My brother’s blind date, who loves traveling, got involved, and they sniffed it out. My parents have cursed out the matchmaker’s family tree already.\"\n\"Is that considered traveling? Isn’t that flying nationwide!\" Bai Bufan chuckled.\n\"Yeah, my brother heard she liked the sea, but now he knows it’s the Mediterranean she likes. She said she grew up early, turns out the CEO had already adjusted the format.\" Zhou Baowei pouted, \"I’m pretty thankful for whoever reported it, otherwise my straightforward brother might have become the one picking up the slack.\"\nLin Li smiled smugly.\nAfter all, he was involved in the whole process, and neither Bai Bufan nor Zhou Baowei would have guessed that the protagonist was right next to them.\nAfter the affairs, leave quietly, hiding merits and names, that’s totally me.\n\"No need to thank, it’s what he should do.\" Lin Li smiled mistily.\n\"I never planned to thank anyone.\" Zhou Baowei shook his head.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWas just saying, you’re really not thanking?\nWhy don’t you represent your whole family and bow a few times for me?\n\"One thing doesn’t relate to another, I declare he’s expelled from manhood, relegated to being one of the sisterly crowd, wishing him ten centimeters shorter.\" Zhou Baowei shook his head.\n\"Indeed, I guess he spent a lot of money, ended up too fast, finished in a minute, the more he thought about it, the more he regretted, so he backstabbed in return.\" Bai Bufan laughed heartily.\n\"Fast? That’s unacceptable!\"\nThe two began to speculate about the hero with the greatest malice.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nSeems a bit rude.\nThe man’s face changed a bit too quickly.\n\"I think you shouldn’t harbor such animosity towards a stranger.\" Lin Li shook his head, \"The informer did a good thing, it’s completely different from the nature of a report website or group chat.\"\n\"The principle’s right, and he did well, but I want to curse him.\" Bai Bufan nodded and shook his head.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because I’m vulgar, my views were solidified by big strong kids helping me consolidate.\" Bai Bufan said aloud.\n\"...\" Lin Li was left speechless.\nSincerity is truly a killer move; Bai Bufan’s life was effectively over.\n\"I suddenly have an urgent matter, gotta go.\" Bai Bufan noticed the students entering through the door with a change of expression.\n\"Lin Li! Hold this bastard down, damn it, he actually hid back in the classroom, you knew the most dangerous place is the safest, luckily we looked back.\" The other group of classmates who had teamed up for gaming over the weekend approached aggressively, shouting.\n\"What happened?\" Lin Li curiously asked.\n\"Hehe, I admit I had a bit of a problem gaming over the weekend, so I agreed that if you caught me before class, I’d let you aruba, but sorry, class is about to start, once I run out the back door, all matters are settled.\" Bai Bufan laughed heartily.\nThe meal comes when the person is hungry.\nNo wonder he was chosen as the system’s protagonist, Lin Li smiled with gratification.\n\"Lin Li! Hold him down!\"\n\"Lin Li won’t back—\"\n\"Click.\"\nBai Bufan’s words cut off as he turned to see Lin Li locking the back door.\nLin Li wasn’t looking at him, but instead addressed the classmates at the door, \"I’m not that strong, afraid I can’t hold him down, locking the door is steadier.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n...\n\"Why would you do this to me?\"\nAs Bai Bufan, head down, feet up, slowly advanced towards the door beam, the burning sadness was reflected in the golden eyes of his upside-down best friend, like an ancient bell had struck within him, hiding a lion that had lost everything in his eyes.\n\"Because my views were solidified by ’Family Guy,’ giggity, giggity, all right~~\"",

      "content": "Chapter 23: Chapter 23: Do You Admit This is Your Butt?\nThe fourth day of persevering to get up early, the third day of completing Task One.\nWanna die.\nAt least in the past two days after getting up, I could go back to sleep. Just thinking of going straight to school after today’s training makes Lin Li feel even more miserable.\nEvery morning, Lin Li can only console himself with Kobe.\nMan! What canned food can I say? Black snakes go away!\n[Update complete.]\nThen he noticed a message from the system.\nStartled for a moment, Lin Li was a bit surprised and then frowned.\nSurprised that the system can still update.\nThe frown was due to the worry that the system had fixed the BUG. You should know that Lin Li is currently surviving on the BUG.\nAs everyone knows, even if there is a BUG, as long as the code runs properly, even if it’s a pile of crap, don’t touch it.\nThere’s no way he can time travel to deal with the Hehuan Demon now, right?\nThen Lin Li carefully checked the system and came to a conclusion:\n\"What the hell did you update?\"\nThere was nothing new, nor did anything old disappear.\nAnyway, Lin Li himself couldn’t see any difference, and there wasn’t even an update log or anything.\nForget it, just don’t care about it, and can’t do anything anyway.\nThe idea of hoping for an incompetent system is also a kind of mental incompetence, isn’t it?\n\"The sun shines brightly, Hua’Er smiles at me. The little bird says chirp chirp chirp, why does your brain have a blister~~\" Singing a gentle and harmonious song, Lin Li arrived at the residential area once again.\nStrange, where’s Xiaozhou with the dual personality of Master Sun today?\nFor the past three days, each time he came, Xiaozhou was always here earlier than him.\nHopefully, he’s not sick or anything. Although Xiaozhou once tried to frame him and wanted to steal his cultivation technique, the generous Lin Li doesn’t mind these things.\nBut if Xiaozhou is indeed sick, Lin Li wouldn’t be surprised, since Lin Li can be considered a witness to how fragile the other person’s body is.\nAn old man who can sprain himself just by standing and breathing or sitting and resting.\nBut still hope he’s okay, training and refining the body alone is really lonely.\nSuppressing these thoughts, Lin Li put serious effort into his training.\n[On weekdays, get up before 5:00 AM and sincerely practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique for at least half an hour before 7:00 AM. (3/7)]\nTransformed into a dead dog, Lin Li felt pleased yet in pain as he slowly returned home for a shower.\nA few minutes later.\nFrom the bushes nearby, an old man with camouflage paint on his face slowly poked his head out, looking perplexed yet solemn.\nToday, deliberately not monitoring this kid in the open, I hid in the bushes early. Without me, the local guardian, why hasn’t this kid gone to frame other elders?\nIs the disguise that serious?\nI’m exhausted from squatting here, but luckily there aren’t many mosquitoes in the early morning.\nCould it be that this kid has discovered me? I hid so well, using all the skills I learned during my military days.\n\"Old Zhou.\"\nUpon hearing someone call him, Zhou Youwei turned his head and saw Zhang Fang, an elderly lady he knew.\n\"Old Zhang, what’s up?\" Zhou Youwei showed a gentle smile, the elderly lady before him was one of the most elegant and refined in the community, regarded as a beauty by the old men despite her age where looks didn’t matter much.\n\"The community belongs to everyone, and maintaining it requires everyone’s effort. Even if you’re in a hurry, the public toilet is just over there, why don’t you go solve it there?\" Zhang Fang, after some thought, cautiously advised with her chosen words.\nZhou Youwei was stunned at first, then reacted, his old face blushing red: \"I didn’t use the toilet here.\"\nThe granny looked embarrassed, glanced down under Zhou Youwei, and said nothing more.\nLooking down, Zhou Youwei suddenly stood up: \"Who the hell dumped shit right under my ass? I wondered why it smelled so bad!\"\n\"See, you did admit it’s your ass, didn’t you, Old Zhou? Hurry up and deal with it, I’ll pretend I saw nothing,\" the granny said, walking away quickly to give him a less embarrassing space.\nZhou Youwei: \"?\"\nWhat does it mean I admitted it’s my ass?\n\"No, Old Zhang, come over and see, this is dog shit, a dog did it!\"\n\"Don’t talk about yourself like that...\"\n\"I’m not saying I’m a dog, what kind of understanding do you have, I, I—\"\nElder Zhou, who finally didn’t get sprained yesterday, got sprained again today.\nIt’s a pity Lin Li didn’t see it.\n...\nLin Li arrived in the classroom and brought breakfast for a few classmates.\nEver since starting to get up before 5:00 AM, he hasn’t been late bringing them breakfast.\nBenefiting this bunch of sons of his.\n\"Just the thought of having to attend classes for five consecutive days makes me want to die,\" Zhou Baowei said languidly, shoveling glutinous rice into his mouth.\n\"Then make sure to pick a bad day for it, that way you can turn it into a good day,\" Lin Li replied with a yawn.\n\"Don’t die these days, my little aunt is due soon, I’m afraid you might reincarnate in my family,\" Bai Bufan tenderly told Zhou Baowei.\nThe glutinous rice in Zhou Baowei’s mouth dropped into his bowl with a plop as he dazedly stared at Lin Li and Bai Bufan, his deskmates.\nOne playing the bad cop, the other... also being the bad cop, for god’s sake.\nSuch strong attack power, no wonder they can be desk mates.\nLin Li was already lying on the table, rubbing his head in the elbow crook to find the right spot and shape.\n—Today I have to listen seriously to the sect’s guidance, if I fall asleep at that time it’s over, fortunately, the first period and morning study session are in English, I’ll use them to recharge a bit.\n\"Bufan, let me know when the English teacher arrives, I’ll take a nap.\"\n\"Alright.\" It’s normal to feel sleepy on a Monday, so Bai Bufan just nodded without making any jokes.\nWhen someone is truly tired, they can fall asleep instantly, even if Lin Li, being quite slender, doesn’t find resting his bare hands on them comfortable during summer.\n...\nLin Li stood above the void, accepting the villagers’ submission.\nAn icy fairy from the righteous path was embraced on his left, a hot demoness from the demonic path was held on his right, his expression was unrestrained and indulgent.\n\"It’s merely a trivial matter to kill a demon, you don’t have to do this, please rise,\" Lin Li said dismissively, indifferent to his recent good deed, \"If you really want to thank me, prepare a 2.4*2 meter bed for me, also some sucking jelly, popping candy, ice cream...\"\nWhy did Xiang Yangliang only ask for 1.8*2 last time, but now needs 2.4, because last time he only slept with two people, this time it’s three. That’s called being rigorous.\nLin Li’s demands were not yet finished when pain hit him.\nThe demoness in his arms suddenly gave him a heavy elbow strike.\nLin Li wanted to ask her why, but when he saw even the Saintess elbowing him and making noises in Bai Bufan’s voice, he realized something was wrong.\n...\n\"Lin Li, get the hell up, Lin Li, get the hell up!\"\nLin Li suddenly lifted his head, grabbed the prepared English textbook, and pretended to read.\nHe realized there was total silence, as if no one was doing morning reading.\nPutting down the textbook, Lin Li found a slightly scary scene—every classmate was staring at him at that moment.\nIncluding the English class representative standing on the lectern.\nOh no oh no oh no oh no oh no.\n\"Did I just talk in my sleep, Bai Bufan, I’m begging you, please shake your head.\" Swallowing a gulp, Lin Li fearfully looked at Bai Bufan.\nWhat kind of joke is this, this sort of thing is unfixable, ah!",

      "content": "Chapter 24: Chapter 24: Husband, say something!\n\"Sleep talk? What sleep talk?\" Bai Bufan looked puzzled.\nLin Li finally breathed a sigh of relief, feeling alive again.\nIt wouldn’t matter much if he said those words to the guys, but saying them to the whole class of girls, Lin Li didn’t really want to become an organism.\n\"So why is everyone looking at me?\" Lin Li suddenly turned his head. The English teacher wasn’t standing behind him giving a death glare, after all.\nThen he looked towards the door: \"Is there a senior outside calling me to confess?\"\n\"Pretty much.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\n\"Really? Damn, is my hair messed up from sleeping?\" Realizing it, Lin Li instantly perked up, starting to feel nervous.\nHoping it’s a 175cm tall, deeply devoted, and exclusively 36D beauty millionaire senior.\n\"Pretty much, except it’s not a senior; it’s the principal calling you, whether it’s a confession or not is still uncertain for now.\" Bai Bufan shook his head.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"What do you mean by ’pretty much’? What’s Old Deng calling me for?\" Lin Li’s hand froze while fixing his hair, clenching his teeth as he spoke.\nAnd as if to verify Bai Bufan’s words, the broadcast repeated the previous announcement again: \"Student Lin Li from Class 1-4, please report to the principal’s office, student Lin Li from Class 1-4...\"\nAt this time, the homeroom teacher, Xue Jian, appeared at the front door, not coming in, just waving to Lin Li in the back row by the window from afar.\nThere was no time to inquire about the situation now. Lin Li swallowed, stood up silently.\n\"If Bao Wei reincarnates into my aunt’s house, I’m unwilling, but Lin Li, if you don’t mind, discuss it with King Yama after you die. I will remember you forever.\" Bai Bufan’s eyes were filled with tears.\n\"What on earth did you do to have Old Jian come and personally arrest you to the principal’s office?\" Zhou Baowei looked curious.\n...\n\"Teacher, what happened?\" Lin Li honestly walked over to Xue Jian, who was as tall as him, asking without much confidence.\n\"I just received the notice too. The principal asked me to bring you over; you don’t know either?\" Xue Jian shook his head.\n\"No.\"\n\"I see.\"\nThen the two of them had nothing more to say.\nDamn it, Bai Bufan, I completely understand your pain now. Can’t some old thing come over and let me help you out too?\nNansang Middle School is divided into two areas, one for grades one and two, and a separate small campus for grade three. The administrative building is on the first and second grades’ side, not requiring much walking.\nBut just thinking about facing the principal’s office next, he felt even more anxious.\nAt the door of the principal’s office, Xue Jian knocked: \"Principal Wang.\"\n\"Has Lin Li and Teacher Xue arrived? Come in, come in.\" The door was actually ajar, and Principal Wang’s voice immediately came through. Before Xue Jian could push the door open, it was pulled open from inside.\nA strong light pierced his eyes, hitting Lin Li’s head hard.\nNot good, it’s a show of authority.\nIt’s over.\nHowever, Lin Li soon realized he had judged wrongly.\nIt was just the morning sunlight reflecting off the principal’s bald spot.\n\"Is this student Lin Li? Very good, very good, looks like a talented young man, very nice.\" Principal Wang’s face smiled like a blooming chrysanthemum, appreciatively patting Lin Li’s shoulder, recognizing him with admiration.\nHis tone was as warm as a spring breeze, though the middle-aged decay on his body (a fusion of smoke and tea scent) made Lin Li hold his breath.\nWhat on earth is happening?\nHe turned to see Xue Jian, whose face also showed a trace of surprise.\n\"Good child, come in first and sit down, come, come in.\" Principal Wang led Lin Li into the principal’s office.\nThen Lin Li was stunned because he saw a familiar face he had just met a few days ago, Demon Suppression Envoy, Yangliang.\nNext to him was another person he hadn’t seen before but was also wearing a uniform, a female Demon Suppression Envoy.\n\"Come, Officer Yang, is this the kid you were talking about?\" Principal Wang had Lin Li sit on the guest sofa, just beside Yangliang, and spoke to Yangliang with a smile.\n\"Yes,\" Yangliang nodded, then turned to Lin Li with an exceptionally gentle voice: \"Xiaolin, we meet again.\"\nThis voice was so gentle and cordial that it felt a bit strange to Lin Li. A few days ago, this guy wasn’t like this towards him, was he? Could it be that with a female officer present, he needed to present himself as a gentle man?\nHmm hmm hmm.\nThis is what men are.\nHaving understood it all, Lin Li didn’t bother to expose it and simply nodded: \"Hello, Uncle Yang.\"\n\"I’m Sun Ying.\" The female Demon Suppression Envoy introduced herself with a smile.\n\"Hello, Sister Sun.\"\nThen Lin Li, somewhat hesitantly, asked Yangliang cautiously: \"What’s the purpose of your visit to our school today?\"\nThinking of something, Lin Li’s expression turned unsightly. Leaning in to whisper into Yangliang’s ear, he said:\n\"Uncle, I admit I was a bit arrogant towards you the day before yesterday, but there’s no need to report it to the school. I promise I won’t do anything abstract in the future, okay?\"\nWhy is Yangliang so petty? I only made a few jokes, didn’t cause much trouble, did I?\nForget about the facts, isn’t Yangliang in the wrong too?\nAnnoyed, trembling, cold, why does the world have so many biases against a seventeen-year-old handsome guy?\nI beg you, don’t mention it.\n\"No, Xiaolin!\" Yangliang suddenly shook his head.\nAbstraction was Lin Li’s last protective shell, and asking him to remove it would make him inhuman; he didn’t want to lose sleep again.\n\"Abstraction is great! Youngsters should stay abstract! Just continue being abstract! The more abstract, the better! Keep abstracting, keep symbolizing!\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nUncle, you are more abstract than I am now.\nWhat are you even saying?\nI wake up at four every morning hiding under my blanket memorizing memes just to be this abstract, but the esteemed Demon Suppression Envoy Yangliang before me...\nIndeed, anyone able to get an official position must have some talent in some aspects.\nYangliang realizing Lin Li likely misunderstood something, further explained:\n\"Didn’t I say before, you helped us break such a big case, of course, we have to return your money, and our agency will also offer you a reward.\nToday, the two of us are representing the police station to deliver a commendation letter, banner, gifts, and a bonus to you. It’s not a bad thing; it’s absolutely a good thing!\"\n\"Phew—gave me a scare.\" Lin Li heaved a long sigh of relief.\nSo it’s about this after all.\nNo wonder Principal Wang was smiling like a blooming chrysanthemum, being so friendly to him.\n\"Yes yes yes! It’s definitely a good thing! Student Lin Li, just by looking at him, I can tell he’s a man of talent! A great representative of our Nansang Middle School’s appearance, able to assist the police in solving cases, excellent, excellent!\" Principal Wang still hadn’t sat down, standing beside Lin Li, saying with satisfaction,\n\"This is also related to the educational philosophy and policies of our Nansang Middle School. I believe every one of our students, whether boy or girl, will stand out like Student Lin Li when assistance is needed, assisting just like him!\"\nPrincipal Wang’s excitement wasn’t fake.\nWhat an achievement, this student Lin Li has greatly brightened the face of Nansang Middle School.\nEven boosted his own reputation!\nHis position might even advance thanks to his help—principals generally hold more than just the title of principal.\nFor some, the principal role is more of a transitional post during job transitions.\nHe even planned out a grand announcement.\nThe official account must share, all teachers must repost to their circle of friends, announcements need to be posted, even find a few news video accounts to interview Lin Li and publish it!\nThen pretend to unintentionally capture it, who’d have thought it would go viral online.\nListening to this, Lin Li suddenly felt something was off.\nIt wasn’t strange for Principal Wang to boast about their thing; it’s normal for the school to want to maintain its image if something like this happens.\nBut...\nIs everyone supposed to assist the Demon Suppression Bureau in solving cases like this, just like me?\nLin Li looked towards Yangliang, asking quietly: \"Uncle, how did I help you solve cases, did you tell the principal?\"\nYangliang, hearing this, stayed silent.\nSilence remained.\nSilence.\nYangliang averted his gaze.\nYangliang.exe not responding.\nLin Li: \"?\"",

How significant was it?\"\nPrincipal Wang immediately, slightly agitated upon hearing this, couldn’t help rubbing his hands.\nIf it weren’t inappropriate right now, he would’ve stomped his feet.\nHe’s prepared to memorize every single detail! This is all important material! The more detailed, the better, so that it can be more shocking when widely publicized!\nPrincipal Wang firmly believed that the case Lin Li assisted in solving must be significant.\nIf it were just an act of good citizenship like returning a lost wallet, the police might come to the school to express gratitude, but at most, they’d send a commendation letter, nothing more. But this time is completely different.\nNot only did the officers bring a commendation letter, but also a banner, and if he wasn’t mistaken, they even brought a bunch of various gifts or prizes. Sun Ying even mentioned needing a brief interview and photos.\nThis isn’t the sort of treatment you get for just returning lost property! It must be a major case!\nIf they were to tell him now that Lin Li helped them solve a nationwide shocking murder case or helped them arrest drug dealers, or even if Lin Li personally engaged in a life-and-death battle against criminals, Principal Wang would be willing to believe it!\nThinking of this, Principal Wang’s gaze towards Lin Li appeared more admiring and affectionate.\nNansang Middle School, how did it produce such a prodigious youngster.\n\"I’m also quite curious, Lin Li, what case did you assist in solving?\" Under such circumstances, Xue Jian couldn’t maintain a calm expression, asking with curiosity.\nLin Li clenched his left hand into a fist, pressing it against his mouth, and lightly coughed, glancing at Yangliang.\nYangliang clenched both fists, pressing them against his mouth, and lightly coughed, glancing at Sun Ying.\nSun Ying clenched her right hand into a fist, pressing it against her mouth, and lightly coughed, glancing back at Yangliang.\n\"Sorry, sorry, not much ventilation, the office air isn’t great, the smoke hasn’t dispersed.\" Realizing his enthusiasm led him to neglect hospitality, Principal Wang quickly opened the windows to let the air circulate.\nReally, how could he make such a rookie mistake.\nAs he turned back, seeing the two officers looking gently at Lin Li, Yangliang began:\n\"Let’s let Lin Li explain it himself.\"\nFeeling everyone’s gaze on him, with encouragement from the two Demon Suppression Envoys, Lin Li showed a kind smile.\nWhat the heck.\nYou two are embarrassed to say it, so you think I’m okay with saying it?\nDo you guys not understand how thin-skinned a seventeen-year-old is?\nAt Lin Li’s age, he was still occasionally feel a little guilty after secretly borrowing Bai Bufan’s power bank to charge his own!\nYet now, it seems inappropriate to shove this responsibility onto someone else.\nUseless.\nLooks like I have to stand up and do it myself.\n\"I assisted the police in dismantling a large-scale prostitution ring.\" Determined not to hesitate, Lin Li loudly and proudly stated word by word.\nEarth-shattering!\nWhat presence!\nEar perked in anticipation, Principal Wang immediately applauded:\n\"Prostitution is great! This is what our new era youth should be like. I’ve already decided, not enough time today, next Monday under the flag, Lin Li, you will deliver the speech, urging all our teachers and students to help police tackle prostitution together!\"\nLin Li, Yangliang, and Sun Ying: \"?\"\nThis... doesn’t sound quite right.\nWhen the Dragon King returned, discovering his wife and children sold into a brothel, the Dragon King called his ten thousand soldiers to boost performance, helping them become the top performer.\nAs even Xue Jian cast strange looks towards Principal Wang, the smile on Principal Wang’s mouth froze.\nBelatedly aware, with squinting eyes carefully opened, he tentatively addressed Lin Li:\n\"Lin Tongxue, just now, you said you assisted in solving what case?\"\n\"I destroyed a chicken farm.\"\n\"And what role did you play in that? How did you assist Officer Yang?\" The principal asked more cautiously.\n\"I was one of Uncle Yang’s accomplishments.\"\nPrincipal Wang: \"?\"\nLin Li made an indelible contribution to improving Xiling Town’s security because he got caught.\n\"Principal, are you alright?\" Seeing Principal Wang plopping onto the ground, Xue Jian promptly came to help.\n\"I’m fine, I’m fine,\" Principal Wang rose somewhat shakily, then slowly sat on the sofa opposite, looking at Lin Li: \"Lin Tongxue, you were arrested?\"\n\"Yes.\" Lin Li nodded matter-of-factly.\n\"Principal Wang, Principal Wang!? Wake up! Wake up!\"\n\"I’m fine, just suddenly got a little tired, I’m okay now.\" Almost fainting, Principal Wang waved his hand, pressing his palm to his aching forehead.\n\"Hey, Lin Li, don’t joke at a time like this, let me explain.\" Yangliang couldn’t bear anymore.\nLin Li, this guy, really never plays by the rules.\n\"Principal Wang, the truth is not as Lin Li said.\"\nLike grasping for a lifeline, Principal Wang’s spirits lifted, thinking indeed, if Lin Li were truly one of the suspects apprehended, how could the police come to deliver a commendation letter and banner! This kid, really likes to joke!\nWhat a humorous prankster! Mischievous!\n\"Honestly,\" Principal Wang, appearing helpless with Lin Li, chuckled while shaking his head, \"Lin Tongxue couldn’t possibly be arrested.\"\nYangliang, hesitant yet resolved: \"Arrested... well he indeed did get arrested.\"\nPrincipal Wang: \"?\"\nWhat on earth, another humorous big prankster.\n\"What nonsense are you two up to!\" Sun Ying finally couldn’t take it anymore, face exasperated, stood forward, smiling at the despairing Principal Wang: \"Here’s what actually happened...\"\n...\nAs ’an outsider,’ Sun Ying proceeded to clearly narrate the whole story, finally letting out a long sigh.\nThe principal’s office briefly fell silent.\nPrincipal Wang and Xue Jian’s expressions were more entertaining than two pretty women brawling on the street.\nIt must be said, Sun Ying likely works in public relations, her descriptive skills and mastery are excellent, if only listening to the last sentence, Lin Li is undoubtedly Nansang’s glory.\n\"—Without Lin Tongxue bravely venturing into danger on his own, obtaining critical clues and evidence, and stringing along, outsmarting the suspects to lower their guard, we could never dismantle this ring so easily!\"\nThose words were too impressive.\nWhat young hero, sharp and astute, courageous and talented, all essential.\nIf Principal Wang and Xue Jian could overlook the fact this was a massage health parlor, then it’d be incredibly impressive.\nThis doesn’t need to be a kidnapping or drug-making operation, catching counterfeit food production factories is good too, but why must it be under the context of a sweeping prostitution crackdown?\nThis was supposedly venturing into danger alone?\nIsn’t this really sneaking off to a cozy place behind a friend’s back?\n\"Knowing the truth made me cry.\"\nThe principal began singing a love song.\nThe sadness didn’t seem fake.",

How about we just skip the speech under the flag next week?\" Lin Li tentatively suggested at this moment.\nSaying this in front of all the teachers and students of the school is really too much for a seventeen-year-old boy.\nIt’s more embarrassing than telling the whole class about the dream I just had of being embraced left and right.\nHeadache, Principal Wang is really having a headache now.\nIf Lin Li hadn’t mentioned it, he would have almost forgotten.\nNow, all the original plans have been disrupted.\nShould the public account still post? Should the announcement be made? Should interviews still be arranged?\nAfter doing all this, can I really make progress on the path to promotion, and not become a laughing stock among friends?\nThought I was being ruthless, but now it seems like I just made a huge mess.\nDamn, why did I use the broadcast to call out Lin Li just now? Didn’t expect I’d regret it this fast! Now students from first and second year are probably all curious about what this ’Lin Li’ classmate did. If I had known, I would have quietly asked Xue Jian to bring Lin Li over.\n\"Since you’re feeling embarrassed, I definitely respect your wishes. If you really don’t want to go on stage, let’s just drop it.\" Principal Wang slid down the pole, nodding with a smile.\nIs the principal scared? It seems like he doesn’t want to see that scene even more than I do, so I’m not afraid then!\n\"If you treat me as a statesman, I will surely repay in kind! It’s okay, Principal! Since you think it’s necessary, how could I care about my own face, I’ll take on this speech!\" Lin Li said loudly, moved.\nPrincipal: \"?\"\nWho the hell needs that, and who the hell treats you like a statesman.\nDon’t understand when there’s no need to be sensible!\n\"No no no no no—\" The principal quickly waved his hand, \"I checked the weather forecast, and next Monday’s morning assembly will probably be canceled. We can talk about this later, later.\"\nMan, even if it doesn’t rain next Monday, the morning assembly must be canceled, put it off until there’s no morning assembly this semester, or even until my term is over.\n\"No, I want to speak!\" Lin Li’s voice was strong and powerful.\n\"No, you don’t want to speak!\" The principal’s voice was no weaker than his.\nBecause of the close distance, Yangliang could see Lin Li’s slight smile.\nThis kid is indeed causing trouble on purpose, but Yangliang feels even more sympathy for Lin Li, always playing this role to hide his true heart, it must be tiring, right?\nLin Li got goosebumps because of this look, why is Yangliang still playing the gentle and mature male act.\nSister Sun, why don’t you just go along with him.\n\"To prevent Lin Tongxue from possible retaliation afterward, this matter is not suitable to be brought to the forefront for now.\" Sun Ying spoke at this moment, finally saving the sweating Principal Wang.\n\"In that case, it’s a pity, but our Nansang Middle School will definitely fully cooperate with the police’s arrangements.\" Saying it’s a pity, but the principal, with a smile as wide as a Nike swoosh, wiped the sweat from his forehead and heaved a long sigh of relief.\nThen Sun Ying turned her gaze to Lin Li:\n\"Lin Tongxue, due to our publicity needs, we still need to take a few photos of you, and your case will be recorded, um, but rest assured, in the article to be published, your image will be pixelated, and you’ll be referred to with a pseudonym, also... we’ll only briefly describe the part where you collected evidence and reported it.\"\nAs long as it isn’t said that Lin Li was one of the guests that day, those people wouldn’t suspect Lin Li even if they were released.\nOf course, the main reason is that the Demon Suppression Bureau can’t afford to lose face like this either.\n\"Okay.\" Lin Li nodded, \"But can the pseudonym be Xiaoli?\"\n\"Ah? Why?\" Sun Ying was a bit curious.\n\"Because my nickname is Li Feiyu.\" Lin Li said earnestly.\n\"That’s not a problem, I’ll mention it.\" Sun Ying nodded nonchalantly, then said, \"But Lin Tongxue, we need you to help us take two photos now, one of you holding the banner, and another one with the bonus, please cooperate.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nLin Li nodded, taking the banner from Yangliang, shaking it open on the coffee table.\n[Anti-Pornography Vanguard]\nLin Li: \"...\"\nUnder Yellow Heaven, I didn’t mean to betray you.\nThe principal, who initially thought of asking if he could join the group photo, was glad he hadn’t spoken up yet.\n\"It’s a double-sided banner, if you don’t like it, there’s another side.\" Yangliang said at this moment.\nThe back says [Heroic Youth].\nThe principal heaved a sigh of relief, glad there was an alternative, even an idiot would know which one is more fitting.\n\"Let’s stick with Anti-Pornography Vanguard.\" Lin Li immediately flipped it back over.\nPrincipal: \"?\"\nDamn, there’s really an idiot.\nLin Li actually just thought heroic youth sounded too ordinary, and he’d be pixelated anyway, with his name changed to Xiaoli, holding the Anti-Pornography Vanguard banner looked cooler.\nPrincipal Wang pondered how his school nurtured a talent like this.\nXue Jian was even more puzzled as to how there was such a student under his charge.\nSun Ying didn’t mind, fighting pornography was one of their duties, it was just a title, nothing embarrassing, otherwise, they wouldn’t have chosen to print it.\nIt could even draw some attention and facilitate educational promotion.\n\"Principal, aren’t you joining the group photo?\" Sun Ying thoughtfully asked Principal Wang.\nThe principal sheepishly waved his hand: \"I’m more indifferent to fame and fortune, I’ll just help take the picture, Teacher Xue, why don’t you stand next to Lin Tongxue?\"\n\"I’m also indifferent to fame and fortune, I’ll just be a second perspective.\" Xue Jian firmly refused.\nSo only the two Demon Suppression Envoys could stand one on each side of Lin Li.\nAfter the banner photos were taken, it was time for the red envelope Lin Li had been looking forward to.\nDamn, 3699!\nThree days ago, this could get one imperial-level service at the Light Noble Health Club!\nA whole group of ten Spring Breeze Elves (Li Kui replicas)!\n\"3300 is the bonus we applied for, the remaining 399 is your own capital.\" Sun Ying explained.\n\"Thank you very much.\" Lin Li gave an extremely sincere smile.\nAfter the photos were taken, Sun Ying handed over another red envelope and said:\n\"Besides these, this is a supermarket card, but specific goods, it’s all listed, you can go to the designated supermarket to exchange for daily necessities like oil, rice, and flour. It’s also part of your reward, and it’s an extra prize that Officer Yang specially helped you obtain, taken from his own police station’s share, you can thank Officer Yang.\"\nMore money!\nLin Li doesn’t really know how to cook, but such cards are really easy to offload. Even with a five percent discount, someone would take it.\n\"Thank you, Uncle Yang!\" Hence, Lin Li sincerely thanked Yangliang separately again.\nWho said the warm-hearted uncle persona of Yangliang was fake?\nThis is the true nature of Yangliang! If Lin Li hears this claim again in the future, Lin Li will certainly argue with that person!\n[Task Two Completed.]\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: 100% increase in charm resistance, 50% increase in internal Yang energy concentration; lower-grade Spirit Stones*5; System Currency*200.]\n[Sacrificing the small self to achieve the greater self, a true hero! Your debut has already brought shock to the Demon Suppression Bureau!\nThe Demon Suppression Bureau bestows upon you the title of Exorcism Vanguard, if not for your lack of cultivation, they would love to directly recruit you as a local Demon Suppression Envoy!\nIf you are treated as a statesman, you will repay as a statesman! With this title, you must continue to carry out the task of exorcising demons!\nSearch for more hidden dens of the Hehuan Demon locally, and assist the Demon Suppression Bureau in purging them.]\n[Time-limited task triggered!]\n[Task Two: Within one month, discover and deeply cooperate with the Demon Suppression Bureau to cleanse three Hehuan Demon hideouts.]\n[Reward: Title: Light of Xiling; Random Ability*1; Lower-grade Spirit Stones*5; System Currency*200.]\n[Light of Xiling: When equipped, will exude the light of righteousness, 50% increase in the speed of righteous cultivation techniques, 50% decrease in the speed of evil cultivation techniques, evil spirits and demons will subconsciously fear you.]\nLin Li raised an eyebrow.\nAgain?",

      "content": "Chapter 27: Chapter 27: Lin Li, Be My Son! (Whitebeard Voice)\nThe reward for this task is undoubtedly generous, the most generous I’ve seen so far.\nThis title of \"Light of Xiling,\" no matter how you look at it, is better than my current downgraded version of the Six Gods Aura.\n——Summer is almost over.\nBut, does the system really want me to be the pioneer in suppressing vice?\nSpeaking of which, what exactly is Xiling Town? Why are there so many chicken farms hidden here?\nNo, I might be understanding this too narrowly—this involves a basic human need. Regardless of the size of the town, there are actually countless chicken farms and free-range chickens hidden away. They just don’t make it to the mainstream and each has its own way of survival, so outsiders don’t know about them.\nAfter all, if outsiders know, it’s all over.\nUnlike the niche second dimension, this is truly stepping out and asking for a funeral.\nJust like the classic line from Ghost Academy: Go and tell the world, you’re skyrocketing into a funeral!\nHowever, Lin Li quickly realized the hardest part of completing this task—he’s an outsider.\nThe Light Noble Health Club only came to his attention because this abstract system notified him of its existence through the task.\nLin Li told Yangliang that his information source was a friend, but he knew very well he just made it up. Without any leads, where would he go to find the other three chicken farms in Xiling Town?\nPerhaps when passing by a chicken farm again, the system would notify him in a similar way?\nHe’s only got a month, Lin Li looked towards the finally unlocked marketplace, and then he saw lock after lock.\n[Marketplace has been unlocked.]\n[Unlocking will refresh item slot 1, requires a cumulative total of 600 system currency. (300/600)]\n[Unlocking will refresh item slot 2, requires a cumulative total of 1000 system currency. (300/1000)]\n[After unlocking the previous refreshable item slot, you can view the requirements to unlock refreshable item slot 3.]\nHaha.\nLin Li laughed, genuinely amused by his anger—this backwards system.\nDid I unlock the marketplace? More like a tease.\nUnlocked the right to enter the market, but have not unlocked any products.\nSomeone please tell Lin Li, what’s the point of browsing an empty supermarket, is it to exercise?\nCrap.\nMy marketplace is still virtual; even strolling is not an option.\nIf the system had a physical form, Lin Li would probably lift it high above his head, and then pathetically hug it back, muttering—a choice between being frustrated and being angry in frustration.\nDid you update so early in the morning just to add this?\nHonestly though, seeing this backward maneuver in his system, after a brief angry laugh, Lin Li calmly accepted it.\nThinking deeply about it is terrifying, the system isn’t possibly trying to gaslight me, is it?\nThe only good news is that unlocking doesn’t consume system currency. I’m still at 300, and slot unlock requirements are cumulative gains, not what you currently hold, so saving up will eventually pay off.\nOriginally hoping for a chicken farm detector, Lin Li completely gave up this idea, knowing the system is unreliable; he can only rely on himself.\nBut if you’re unreliable again next time, I really, really will get mad.\n\"Alright, our task here is pretty much complete. Thanks again, Lin Tongxue, for your help in this case. We won’t disturb you any longer. See you next time during the campus safety knowledge campaign.\" Sun Ying said to the group.\n\"Sure, sure, thank you for coming. I’ll see you out.\" The principal naturally was very cordial.\n\"No need, no need...\"\n\"It’s alright, it’s alright...\"\nThe adults started their back-and-forth politeness again. The adult world is truly troublesome.\n\"Xiaolin, why do you seem not particularly happy?\" Yangliang asked Lin Li warmly at this moment.\nLin Li was stunned.\nBrother Yang, isn’t your target that colleague of yours? Why aren’t you helping her out, instead of staring at me?\nAnd it’s like you’re just making conversation for the sake of it.\nWarming me for a whole day doesn’t beat warming her for a whole day.\n\"No, I’m really happy.\" Lin Li looked back at the red envelope and supply card in his hands, and his smile became instantly genuine.\n\"What do you plan to do with the money?\" Yangliang asked again.\nSpend on games, snacks, buy a Spring Breeze Elf (with the face model), go for a massage again (couldn’t forget last time’s experience), save some for system-enabled task expenses...\nThat’s what I think, but I can’t say that, Xue Jian is still here: \"I’ll supplement household expenses.\"\n\"Good kid, good kid.\" Yangliang nodded with satisfaction, took a deep breath as if making an important decision, then looked over to Xue Jian standing aside: \"Teacher Xue, can I speak with Lin Li alone?\"\n\"Ah? Of course, go ahead.\" Xue Jian had no objection and went to exchange courtesies with the principal.\n\"Uncle Yang, is there something you want to say?\" Lin Li really was puzzled now, feeling he couldn’t quite understand Yangliang’s intentions.\nWith words seemingly difficult to utter, Yangliang’s lips moved several times without saying anything. Finally, after resolving himself once more, he exhaled, looked earnestly into Lin Li’s eyes, then spoke:\n\"Lin Li, can I be your dad?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThis past weekend was really uneasy for Yangliang, after checking the information, discovering all Lin Li said was true, he dreamed constantly of Lin Li’s atypical expression and response upon being asked that question by him.\nHurting a kid like him is truly an unforgivable sin.\nYangliang naturally wanted to compensate this brave-facade wearing teenager.\nTo get a bonus of three thousand three hundred, Yangliang’s efforts played a particularly important role, and the accompanying supply card was something given out usually as gifts for special occasions among Demon Suppression Envoys, sourced from Yangliang’s share which he forcefully passed to Lin Li.\nEven so, Yangliang felt it was insufficient.\nThinking of using it to augment household expenses, truly a thoroughly good child.\nSo, Yangliang decided —\nTo the boy I wronged, let it be I who compensates for the fatherly love you missed!\nLin Li, be my son!\nThe white-bearded Yangliang looked at Lin Li expectantly, waiting for his response.\nLin Li looked at Yangliang, his pupils shaking.\nYour mom.\nSo all this time the target was not Sun Ying, but me!\nYangliang couldn’t possibly be one of those priests who likes boys, right?\nJesus come save me!\nOh, wait, Jesus couldn’t protect a boy even if he covered his behind, there’s a hole in his hand, no wonder the priests were unruly back in the Middle Ages.\nWorshipping the west is indeed dangerous.\nApologies, got distracted.\nTathagata come save me!\nTathagata’s hand could suppress Sun Wukong, surely able to protect me, covering me completely.\nUnless he suppressed me, but left my backside exposed.\nHowever, facing Yangliang’s gentle gaze, Lin Li quickly calmed down.\nNo, Yangliang isn’t that sort of person.\nThough the time spent with him wasn’t much, it’s still possible to tell if someone’s bad, and Yangliang is a true Demon Suppression Envoy, honorable and righteous, not having such filthy thoughts.\nThen what’s meant by these words? Why suddenly want to be my father?\nHold on.\nLin Li’s face turned completely serious, he looked at Yangliang, and said, word for word:\n\"Uncle Yang, when did you start with my mom?\"\nYangliang: \"?\"",

What he wanted was to be his father, which means he had set his sights on his mother, and now he wanted to probe his thoughts!\nLin Li felt a warmth in his cheeks.\nIt’s not that he couldn’t accept his mother dating again. Frankly speaking, he didn’t particularly care about it, although he probably wouldn’t accept calling the new guy ’dad,’ he could manage not to resist.\nBut not being kept in the dark from start to finish, without any consultation, only to be told when things are nearly settled, and still by the guy telling him! This is disrespectful to him!\n\"I won’t agree with what’s between you two!\"\nLin Li only regretted not having money.\nIf he had, he’d slap a five hundred thousand card down on Xiang Yangliang’s face and sneer: \"Half a million, stay away from my mom.\"\nOne realizes money’s importance when the need arises.\n\"No no no no no—\" Xiang Yangliang was stunned for a moment, then broke into a sweat.\n\"Xiaolin, you’ve misunderstood, I don’t even know your mother yet!\"\nLin Li’s expression eased a little, calming down.\nThinking back, indeed, nothing unusual happened during his call with his mom on Friday. If there was something between them, when he was caught up in an anti-prostitution raid on Friday, it should have been more dramatic.\nSo, while checking my identity information, he must have seen my mother’s photo and developed feelings for her.\nThis is something he could accept.\n\"So, you’re planning to pursue my mom? Not bad, that’s ambitious,\" Lin Li looked at Xiang Yangliang with a scrutinizing gaze and asked: \"But it’s not going to be easy getting past me! What’s your job? Do you have a car and house? Do you love your dad or your mom? Do you prefer salty or sweet tofu pudding?\"\nXiang Yangliang glanced down, he was still in uniform. Even if not, didn’t Lin Li know what he did?\nLin Li seemed to be performing classic abstract skills, but Xiang Yangliang knew too well, he felt that no one understood Lin Li better than him.\nLin Li at this moment, was merely covering up his inner turmoil with such abstract behavior.\nTaking a deep breath, he continued: \"No, Xiaolin, I already have a family and can’t possibly pursue your mom.\nI’m simply hoping to adopt you as my child, like an adopted son, as we seem to get along really well.\nI’ve talked with my wife, and she has no objections, as this can also make up for your lack of fatherly love.\"\nXiang Yangliang’s wife indeed had no objections, after hearing of his deeds early Saturday morning, she even sympathetically suggested that jumping might hit someone, and recommended poison instead — you truly deserve it.\nShe too found Lin Li to be a pitiful yet endearing child.\nUpon hearing this, Lin Li was stunned, then his expression turned hesitant and cautious.\nSeeing this, Xiang Yangliang’s expression softened further, realizing Lin Li’s protective shell was breaking, and he had peeled away to his softest heart.\nXiang Yangliang should be thankful for not having mind-reading abilities, or he would have heard this thought:\n\"Uncle Yang can’t or is he infertile?\"\nAnyway, there was no way to have descendants.\nSo here was this outstanding new-era youth, seeing talent and being fond of it, wanting him to inherit his legacy.\nThat was Lin Li’s judgment.\nYet, as those words would indeed be somewhat offensive to a grown man, Lin Li was hesitant and cautious, ultimately choosing not to voice them.\nRegarding making up for his father’s absence, Lin Li didn’t acknowledge it at all.\nThere was no reason, right? They’ve only intersected for one night, and he hasn’t even met his would-be mother yet. If Xiang Yangliang’s family bestows such charity, they might as well adopt all the single-parent families in Xiling Town.\nNeither emotionally nor rationally could Lin Li accept it.\n\"Thank you, Uncle Yang, I appreciate your kindness, but it’s unnecessary, sorry.\" Lin Li bent slightly, \"thanked\" and spoke, using this gesture to express his sincerity.\n\"Xiaolin, Uncle is sincere.\"\n\"Uncle, it’s really unnecessary.\"\nUncle Yang, once I succeed in cultivation, I’ll use my immortal techniques to cure your ailment, bringing you back to new vitality, seventy times a night.\nNo wonder he led the anti-prostitution operation, maybe there was a tinge of envy and jealousy involved here.\nWhen he thought of this, he looked at Xiang Yangliang with some sympathy.\nXiang Yangliang felt the special emotion in Lin Li’s eyes, it was probably gratitude, but he also felt his resolve.\nHe had somewhat anticipated rejection because a child like Lin Li, who could build a strong protective shell for themselves, must have a strong sense of pride.\nSaying more might backfire.\nSo Xiang Yangliang nodded: \"Names aren’t important, Xiaolin, if you face any trouble or difficulty in the future, you can always talk to me, I’ll try to help you, why not come over to my house on weekends, eating takeout often is unhealthy.\"\nNo father in name, but a father in reality.\nXiang Yangliang had decided to treat Lin Li better in the future.\n\"Okay, sounds good.\"\nXiang Yangliang knew Lin Li was being perfunctory, but he believed one day he would truly have Lin Li drop all his pretenses in front of him.\n\"Alright, I have nothing else, you should go to class.\" Actually, Sun Ying not far away had already finished her pulling and was waiting for him, so he said.\nThe road to protect this child is long, but he has plenty of time.\n\"Okay, goodbye Uncle Yang.\"\nNow it’s time for class, but that’s not a problem, it’s just the unacknowledged English lesson anyway.\n...\nAt the office entrance, the five separated, Lin Li followed Xue Jian back to the classroom.\n\"Lin Li, what on earth were you... what are you doing?\" Xue Jian finally couldn’t hold back his middle-aged serious old man’s curiosity, wanting to ask Lin Li the details, only to see him stuffing a banner into his pants.\nAs expected of the talent who managed to infiltrate the massage parlor, his demeanor had a distinct flair.\nHowever, thinking about the anti-prostitution pioneer on the banner, Xue Jian suddenly understood Lin Li’s actions.\nBut if the banner were discovered, it wouldn’t be easy to explain.\nAnd Lin Li, wearing short sleeves and summer pants, certainly had a hard time hiding it.\n\"Give me the banner.\" Xue Jian said.\n\"Sure, teacher, there aren’t any names on it anyway, if you like it, you can have it! I noticed you don’t have any banners in your office, it could add some variety.\" Lin Li happily handed this hot potato to Xue Jian.\n\"I meant for you to take it away when you go home at night!\" Xue Jian immediately emphasized.\nThis thing, he wouldn’t even accept it if gifted to him.\nHanging an anti-prostitution pioneer in the office, the parents would think the class he led was some kind of obscene den if they saw it.\nAs for a heroic youth, are there youths like himself?\n\"Oh oh.\" Lin Li nodded.\nThey continued walking.\nXue Jian suddenly reacted: \"You said I don’t have any banners?!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"That’s not true, you heard wrong.\" Lin Li quickly explained, noticing Xue Jian’s expression seemed off with a sidelong glance.\n\"I see.\"\n\"Mm.\"\nThey continued walking.\nTen seconds passed.\n\"The teacher does have banners! Just not hanging in the office! It could easily lead other parents to give them too, and that wouldn’t be good.\" Xue Jian emphasized once more.\nLin Li chuckled along, trying to gloss it over.\nThe more someone emphasizes something, the less they have it.\n\"This matter is over, no need to think more on it. Go back and study well, your initial ranking wasn’t bad upon entering, but it has dropped quite significantly, Lin Li.\" They had arrived at the floor where class four and the office were located, Xue Jian told Lin Li.\nThe five had agreed not to publicize the matter within the school, a simple commendation letter without details was posted on the bulletin board as a wrap-up.\nHearing this, the familiar and fear-inducing pressure of the middle-aged Old Deng surged forth.\n\"Okay, teacher.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"I really do have banners...\"\nLin Li had already turned around, walking back to class, his pace even quickening a bit.\nBai Bufan and a few other classmates were standing in the corridor with English books in hand.\nProbably dragged out for some impromptu recitation.\nThe group had noticed Lin Li too, their faces full of curiosity, wanting to know what he’d been up to.\n\"I’m back!\" Lin Li spread his arms out, feeling like a returning Jordan ready to make waves.\nBai Bufan: \"Hello Back, my name is Bufan, nice to meet you!\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThe atmosphere dissipated instantly, where did this English humor come from.\nAt this moment, the English teacher happened to walk to the door, her mouth twitching slightly at the dialogue.\n\"Classmate Back, stay as well, recite yesterday’s passage.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nIt was clearly Bai Bufan speaking English nonsense, why was he the one to suffer.",

      "content": "Chapter 29: Chapter 29: This Is So Authentic!\nLin Li returned to his seat with a frown.\nAs mentioned before, Lin Li’s English grades are average, and his spoken English is a mess. He can spell many words, but reading them aloud is a no-go.\nI just scored a big fat zero on my recitation test. Why don’t you give it a try?\nAnyway, he still has to recite something next class.\nActually, Bai Bufan’s recitation is also dog poo, but he managed to fumble through it. All he needs to do is recite it to the group leader after class.\nThat’s no big deal; the group leader’s basically a buddy, turning a blind eye most of the time.\nNow Bai Bufan is more curious about something else and while facing the English textbook, his eyes have already been glancing at Lin Li:\n\"Lin Li, what’s up? What did the principal want with you?\"\n\"Confession.\" Lin Li answered gloomily.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"I told him student-teacher relationships are not appropriate, and I’d consider it after graduation.\" Lin Li said with an air of seriousness.\nBai Bufan recalled the principal’s image in his mind and felt a wave of admiration, cupping his hands as he said: \"You must really be desperate.\"\nThen Bai Bufan, with quick reflexes, intercepted two envelopes Lin Li was about to put in his drawer. Seeing they weren’t sealed, he invaded Lin Li’s privacy on the spot by opening them, and then his eyes widened.\nThinking quickly, Bai Bufan looked sympathetically at Lin Li: \"Did the principal strong-arm you? Is this hush money? Lin Li, buy some good preventive medicine, don’t get sick.\"\nLin Li couldn’t be bothered to respond.\n\"Wait, will your farts be soundless from now on?\" Bai Bufan found another blind spot.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nAfter swearing at Bai Bufan’s ancestors a bit, Lin Li took back the envelopes. The one containing money was casually thrown into the drawer.\nIn school, it’s perfectly safe to keep money in drawers or even on desks. Most students wouldn’t covet such things, and besides, there are large surveillance cameras above the front door keeping an eye on everyone.\nHowever, if it’s tissues or snacks, don’t even think about leaving them on your desk. They’re a highly risky proposition, even in drawers.\nEspecially tissues, after gym class, coming back late is a disaster; they’re like eggs by the roadside in India, all you find is their hollow, empty shell after being fried by many.\nLin Li started to tally up the supermarket card’s value.\n\"Why is there a supermarket card, and it’s only for these things? Lin Li, I remember you don’t really cook, do you? Do you even know how to use it?\" Bai Bufan asked after seeing the envelope’s contents.\n\"Who said I don’t cook? I know many recipes. Let me put it this way, I have a homemade little dish~\" Lin Li replied in a perfect Beijing accent.\nBai Bufan reacted quickly: \"No soy sauce allowed.\"\n\"...Then there’s nothing left.\"\nYu Qian’s recipes have three characteristics with one core. The characteristics are simple, cheap, and hard to eat, with soy sauce being the core.\nBetter go and learn some recipes from Huang Lei, his seem awesome, with virtually no negative reviews on any shows.\nWhoever says the recipe is bad, I say it’s fantastic.\nHaving finished counting, the value of the supply card is nearly eight hundred. Even cashing it out should guarantee at least seven hundred, a handy hidden reserve for emergencies.\nBai Bufan could no longer hold back his curiosity and asked: \"Bro, what’s the deal? I’m begging you bro, tell me, I feel ants crawling all over me, driving me crazy.\"\n\"It’s nothing, just that I helped the local police station solve a case over the weekend. They came today to deliver a commendation letter alongside this prize money and gifts.\" Lin Li explained.\nSince the commendation letter is to be posted up, absolutely keeping it a secret wouldn’t be feasible, and continual questioning would be a hassle. Better to say roughly what happened.\n\"Really? That’s pretty awesome.\" Bai Bufan widened his eyes. This sounded a bit more believable than the principal confessing, \"What kind of case? Must be a big prize like several thousand, right? What did you do to get so much?\"\n\"I discovered and reached the crime scene, confirmed the criminal act, and immediately called the police. Then I personally tangled with one of the suspects to buy time.\nMy body endured her numerous rubs and presses, and though I couldn’t help letting out a few noises, relying on my unwavering resolve, I held on until the police arrived, finally unraveling the entire case and restoring peace to Xiling Town.\"\nLin Li smiled slightly, calmly recounting his glorious exploits.\n\"Bro, stop exaggerating, just tell me the truth, did you find a wallet full of a billion cash?\" This description was too far-fetched; Bai Bufan didn’t buy it at all.\n\"If even a single word just said is false, may I become impotent.\" Lin Li sneered, staring coldly at Bai Bufan.\nThis time, Bai Bufan had to believe it. He knew Lin Li would never joke about his authentic Old Xiling Chicken Rolls.\nMoreover, Lin Li actually hadn’t uttered any lies just now.\nHe only regretted not having another twenty minutes of battle with Xiaojing.\nStunned, Bai Bufan covered his mouth, then looked Lin Li over as if searching for leftover bruises but found none.\n\"The pain is in my heart, not my body. In this incident, the greatest torture I suffered was mental.\" Lin Li stated calmly.\nThat statement was true too, grieving that unexperienced twenty minutes.\nBai Bufan was genuinely impressed: \"You really are something. But given your weak constitution, how did the criminal not beat you? It’s a bit ridiculous?\"\n\"Even the weakest person, if they use a slide tackle, even a tiger has no choice but to accept its fate of being gutted by a toenail, let alone an unguarded person. Besides, I’m not the same weakling I used to be.\nBafan, abstain from lust, you wouldn’t understand if you haven’t truly abstained, abstinence works like this.\"\n\"Who hasn’t truly abstained? What’s hard about abstaining? I do it every day.\" Bai Bufan flushed red, indignantly defending his honor, \"But you still haven’t said, what kind of case was it? Was there a robbery or a theft?\"\nThe question is well asked; next time, don’t ask.\nBut Lin Li was well prepared.\n\"This was discussed with the school and police station, and it needs to be kept confidential, so I’m sorry, I can’t tell you.\" Lin Li said with the air of a sage.\n\"But you know, I can keep secrets really well, I even swear on my chicken rolls, please tell me, I promise I won’t spill it.\" Bai Bufan was itching to know, feeling itches all over his body.\n\"As Buddha said: ’Not to be said.’\" Lin Li shook his head with a smile, \"Bufan, just pay attention in class.\"\nLin Li adjusted his position, preparing to fall asleep, he hadn’t forgotten his original intention.\nBai Bufan was so annoyed he ground his teeth.\nSoon after.\nBai Bufan suddenly turned his head again.\nXiling Town isn’t a big place.\nThe news flow should be pretty fast here, but this week, he hasn’t heard of any major incidents happening.\nAdditionally, helping with a case, what’s there that can’t be said, it’s so commendable, such an achievement, yet you can’t even tell your close buddy.\nThe bond between himself and Lin Li, to describe it simply, if both were watching TV on the couch and one couldn’t find the remote, they’d never accuse the other of sitting on it.\nWhat could possibly be unspeakable?\n—— Unless it’s the anti-vice case that Zhou Baowei mentioned.\n\"Lin Li, did you assist in uncovering Bao Wei’s anti-vice raid?\" Bai Bufan inquired.\nLin Li closed his eyes.\n\"I know you’re not asleep.\"\nLin Li opened his eyes and immediately rolled them in exasperation: \"How is that possible? Don’t bother me, I’m going to sleep now.\"\n\"Oh.\" Bai Bufan nodded, seems like he overthought it.\nA minute later.\nBai Bufan turned his head again.\nHe recalled Lin Li’s reaction when he heard Zhou Baowei mentioned this before.\nSomething felt off.\nSo, he whispered:\n\"Lin Li, why don’t you swear on your chicken rolls again?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 30: Chapter 30: From then on, Lin Li and Bai Bufan lived happily together.\n\"You don’t trust your buddy?\" Lin Li looked genuinely disappointed, staring speechlessly at Bai Bufan. \"What’s there to lie about to you?\"\n\"Uh-huh, then swear an oath.\" Bai Bufan nodded perfunctorily.\n\"The feeling of not being trusted really makes one sick.\" Lin Li was getting a bit angry.\n\"Uh-huh, then swear an oath.\"\n\"You know what kind of person I am. Normally I can joke around with you and be very easygoing. But if you touch my reverse scale, I’ll let you know what true darkness is. I am the kind of person who looks innocent and naive on the surface but is actually cunning and worldly wise.\nI never lack for thunderous methods nor a Bodhisattva’s heart. I have both Buddha and demon in my heart, but I’ve sealed the demon deep away, leaving only the Buddha. I originally intended to face everyone with a Bodhisattva’s heart, but you insist on me lifting the seal on the demon in my heart. So I ask you, Bai Bufan, would you still be able to handle it when facing a real demon in this world?\"\nLin Li was genuinely, genuinely angry.\n\"Uh-huh, I’m actually a braised chicken, Lord Baby-face Wolf, swear an oath.\" Bai Bufan was impenetrable.\n\"I can swear this oath, but from now on, we’ll be bitter enemies.\" Lin Li said coldly.\n\"Uh-huh, then swear an oath.\"\nLin Li took a deep breath.\nNiu Niu, I’m sorry! I can’t give up my reputation for not giving up on you.\n\"This is your choice, Bai Bufan, you will regret it!\" Lin Li was genuinely, genuinely, genuinely angry.\n\"I swear—\" Lin Li sneered, staring straight at Bai Bufan, \"If I was involved in some massage parlor case over the weekend, my—\"\nSeeing Bai Bufan’s expectant eyes, Lin Li’s lips twitched, and then he silently lowered his raised finger.\nDamn it, damn it, still couldn’t do anything distinctive!\nThat beast Bai Bufan, chooses to betray me to find the truth, but if I also betray my chicken wrap for the so-called reputation, what’s the difference between me and Bai Bufan, both just beasts!\nLin Li was from the Animal Protection Association, Bai Bufan could hurt him, but he couldn’t hurt the cute Moo Moo.\nSo Lin Li and Bai Bufan stared at each other, stared, and stared.\nSometimes silence is also a response.\nWhen Lin Li noticed that Bai Bufan’s mouth was about to twitch, he couldn’t hold it in any longer either.\nGeneral Yu possessed him directly, Lin Li pointed a finger at Bai Bufan and forcibly said with seriousness: \"Don’t say a thing!\"\nBut these words acted like a fuse, igniting Bai Bufan, who started shaking all over while lying on the table.\nIt’s said some people really died from laughing; Lin Li looked worriedly at this scene, praying for his good brother in his heart.\nIs there a risk of dying?\nHope the person is alright.\nBest to rest in peace, no good death is deserved.\nDamn it, hurry up and die!\nFailures always run throughout life; this is life—Bai Bufan, unfortunately, survived.\nAfter laughing for a while, before the English teacher lost his temper, he barely sat up straight.\nHe looked at Lin Li: \"I wondered why on the weekend I didn’t pit you, and when you did a \"Aruba\" to me just now, you were more spirited than them, so it was you I was cursing all along.\"\n\"Damn it, matched up, it all matched up, I said, why did you run out right when night study ended last week, was it because of this too?\"\n\"More or less, went to gather intelligence.\" Lin Li didn’t feel ashamed, being discovered was being discovered. Honestly, Lin Li didn’t mind his few buddies knowing about this as long as strangers didn’t know.\nMoreover, with Lin Li’s mindset, even if the whole world knew, he at most would have a headache for a while and wouldn’t care.\n\"Wait, so swearing just now about grappling with the suspect was actually... you! So you secretly went to enjoy yourself!\" Bai Bufan’s eyes widened in hindsight, questioning Lin Li.\n\"I didn’t keep it from you, I went alone, plus you don’t have legs, why would I carry you? Just walk by yourself.\" Lin Li resumed his composure and sneered.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"I was right, scolding you this morning was way too mild, how could you sneak off, you’re not a human; your old Xiling chicken wrap is tainted—\" Bai Bufan grieved deeply.\n\"Don’t wrongfully accuse someone out of thin air, think about it with your brains. If I did go that far, would I still get this money and prizes?\" That’s the only thing Lin Li needed to clear up.\n\"So purely green?\"\nLin Li showed a meaningful smile.\n\"You jerk!\"\nBai Bufan couldn’t hold it anymore.\nBut it wasn’t just Bai Bufan who couldn’t hold it in:\n\"Bai Bufan! Lin Li! Go stand at the back of the class! Stand separately! You haven’t paid attention for even a minute since class started!\"\n...\nThe familiar few guys in the class knew about this after the English class ended.\nAs for how they found out, it wasn’t because Bai Bufan spread the word like a megaphone; Lin Li was confident that as long as he asked, Bai Bufan would never intentionally reveal it.\nThe two were truly friends.\nBut when they came to ask themselves as a group, Lin Li thought that since Bai Bufan already knew, hiding it further would be overly clownish, so he just said it.\nBut he did tell them not to let others know.\n——Not all the guys in the class had a good relationship with Lin Li; some classmates were just classmates, although there was no enmity, they couldn’t be counted as friends.\nAfter all, not everyone could adapt to Lin Li’s personality, and Lin Li also found them uninteresting.\nFun is the true meaning of life.\nAnd as a result of telling them, Lin Li not only didn’t face any ridicule or mockery, but rather after the shock, a bunch of people with reverence, envy, and endless desire for exploration watched him pitifully.\nThis was their deeply craved new knowledge.\nIn order to get Lin Li to share this content with them, everyone teamed up, and the morning Zhou Baowei who unknowingly scolded Lin Li, ended up having a relationship with the Door Beam—Bai Bufan, the victim not long ago, became the most enthusiastic perpetrator.\nWhen will the cycle of revenge end?\n\"Mr. Lin, your great revenge has been avenged! Please impart more knowledge upon us!\" A few people sincerely asked at the stairwell corner.\nClutching his crotch and unable to walk straight, Zhou Baowei also didn’t have any complaints, and he was in the line, looking at Lin Li.\nThere was no selfish desire in his eyes, only the thirst for knowledge and exploration that countless teachers hope to see in their students.\nPure.\nRounding up, could be said to be a naïve heart.\nAlthough he didn’t like the Door Beam, if falling in love with it could exchange for himself and his brothers to hear stories, he was willing.\nSacrifice the small self, achieve the greater self.\nLin Li wasn’t stingy either, he shared as much of the part he could tell as possible.\nThen he saw in his brothers’ eyes the genuine reverence and yearning.\n[The tales of slaying demons have reached the ears of fellow disciples at the Nansang Sect.\nYour junior disciples are filled with pride at your deeds and look forward to one day slaying demons alongside you.\nThe prosperity of the sect lies in the responsibility of its disciples; cultivating talent for the sect is a responsibility you cannot shirk.\nTeaching a man to fish is better than giving a man a fish, but the teaching of fishing cannot just rely on empty theory; practice is required to know oneself.\nThe task of slaying demons still lies ahead, so why not take fellow disciples with you and craft a grand plan to slay demons together?]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Four: Take at least one fellow disciple and cooperate deeply with the Demon Suppression Bureau to clear a Hehuan Demon base.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Image charisma increases by 10%; Random Pill *1; System Currency *50.]\nAs Lin Li was narrating \"Lin Li’s Magical Adventure,\" he was stunned by the pop-up message.\nDamn you.\nThis can trigger a task too.\nBringing people to visit prostitutes, will there be retribution for that?\nThis so-called supreme system is just using me to boost the massage parlor’s performance!\nHowever, this could be completed while completing task two, and class was about to start with the bell ringing, so a few of them agreed to continue discussing the matter later.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan returned to their seats.\n\"Bufan, say, if, if I were to go raid brothels again, would you be willing to come with me?\" Lin Li smirked.\nBai Bufan stared straight at Lin Li. He almost instantly replied:\n\"Bai Bufan isn’t a nice name, from now on, just call me Lin Bufan. No child should have a name separate from their dad’s, right, Dad?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHe gave a thumbs up.\nA great man can flex and extend.",

I keep asking for things from you without ever thanking you~~ When I want to take care of you, you might not wait, I need to show filial piety early, time, please slow down, don’t let you get older~~\" Bai Bufan began extolling fatherly love.\n\"Alright.\" Lin Li didn’t hold back at all, then suddenly reacted: \"Wait a minute, when you want to take care of someone but they don’t wait, are you saying I’m gonna die?\"\nNot caring if holding the hand of his desk mate while talking was gay or not, Bai Bufan excitedly continued: \"Whether you die or not is not important now, what’s important is when we’re going on our adventure. I can’t wait for others to taste my signature dish, and also present Master Xi’s surprise to them!\nI’m done with the days at the temple.\"\nThe signature dishes naturally being chicken rolls and bean juice, truly authentic, truly authentic, truly truly authentic~~\nLin Li shook off Bai Bufan’s hand, waved: \"I just said, it’s only possible. I’m also not sure which places Xiling still uses for raising chickens, I just have to find out, so we’ll act only when I find them.\"\n\"But Bufan, I need to clarify something; I’m sort of an informant now, and finding these places is one of the tasks they’ve given me.\"\nLin Li first legitimized his actions.\n\"When I take you there, the ultimate thing we’ll do is to report them.\nSo bringing you along is only for you to experience the fun of getting caught, which seriously can be fun; as for the real taboos you seek...\nIf you aren’t afraid of your family knowing, at your age, with my and their connections, just a reprimand and education instead of detention, it shouldn’t be a problem.\"\nLin Li earnestly analyzed.\n\"Haha, father, no, no, no, no—your thinking is still a bit narrow,\" Bai Bufan waved his index finger profoundly, \"You just told the kid, your boss said as long as it’s urgent, even if last time Xiaojing’s mom disarmed you, they’d consider letting you off the hook, right?\nSo whether it’s urgent or not is up to us father and son, isn’t it?\nYour last regret; this time, let me as son help you make up for it!\nEven if the cops come, I will block them at your doorstep; if they want to pass, they have to step over my corpse!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou could even bring up Xiaojing’s mom nonsense.\nYour son is quite clever, just not putting the cleverness into the right things.\nIt might just be possible.\nBut he then seriously shook his head: \"Bufan, to be serious, if you really plan on doing this, then I’m not taking you.\"\nFun is fun, chaos is chaos; Lin Li wouldn’t deliberately lead a brother astray for a task.\nThis isn’t taking a brother to an internet cafe or helping a brother in a fight, it’s a bit more serious.\nIf Bai Bufan got sick or addicted, Lin Li couldn’t shirk responsibility.\nBesides, if the sect junior being taken gets consumed by Hehuan Demon, will the low-grade system consider the task complete?\n—Let’s emphasize, this reason is the least important.\n\"Relax, I was joking, I’m also afraid of getting sick, and I don’t want to lose my first time in such an environment.\" Bai Bufan laughed.\n\"Bai Bufan, how about swearing on your chicken roll?\" Lin Li is one who learns well.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"You don’t trust bros?\" Bai Bufan got mad.\n\"Yep yep, swear on it.\"\n\"You know what kind of person I am, normally I can do this or that? Forgot the front, forgot the middle, forgot the end, anyway I’m also a wolf with a childlike face.\"\n\"Yep yep, swear on it.\"\n\"Okay fine, I really swear, I, Bai Bufan...\" Bai Bufan did not hold back like Lin Li did but finished the oath.\nThough an oath is made to be broken, Luo River still jokes because of Sima but that doesn’t happen between Bai Bufan and Lin Li.\nActually, no need to swear, Bai Bufan had only been joking up till now.\nDon’t even mention fifteen-year-old Bai Bufan, actually, most people in this world are curious about this thing, but even if they know the way, those with strict upbringing or those well-behaved dare to try alone, are very few.\nPeople really need companions.\nOne of the biggest sources of courage is from friends.\nJust like at the start of school, when the teacher asks those who didn’t do homework to stand up, if it’s just you standing alone—Gordon comes to mind, you’re done.\nBut if it’s a group standing—haha.\nUltimately it’s a violation, if Lin Li dares to go to the last step, Bai Bufan might struggle and hesitate before tagging along, but if he’s alone, forget it, better not.\nThinking about facing an accident alone, Bai Bufan gets scared.\n\"Consider it as a free foot massage for me.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\n\"That’ll do, then wait for my notice. If I find clues quickly, we can go adventure this weekend.\" After saying that, Lin Li also nodded, then stood up, only one minute left before formal class started:\n\"Since it’s settled, I have to head to the office now.\"\n\"Father, are you going to register me on the white list in advance, making sure they really won’t arrest me later? That’s some influence.\" Bai Bufan said with some admiration.\nTo become an informant for the police, he still is quite awesome indeed.\nTruly impressive.\n\"The office I meant is the restroom.\" Almost out of time, Lin Li didn’t look back.\n\"D—\" Bai Bufan hesitated a second then cursed, but then stopped abruptly.\nNo right, Lin Li is his father now.\n\"You’re despicable.\"\n...\n\"Before you confirm the day to take me on an adventure, I’ll revert to Bai Bufan, you dog bastard.\" Bai Bufan said expressionlessly.\nThe father-son bond between the two, after Lin Li reenacted his last feat of ordering five meat dishes without rice at lunch, disappeared into smoke.\nLin Li gave a contemptuous smile.\nThe two parted ways at the bottom of the teaching building, like strangers.\n—Bai Bufan went back to the dorm, while Lin Li, being a day student, naturally returned to the classroom.\nIf it’s near the final exams, students staying in the classroom for self-study during lunch could be quite many, but today when Lin Li returned to the classroom there were barely any, only two, a boy and a girl, sitting towards the front, both unfamiliar.\n\"Memory seems to have really improved.\" Lin Li looked again at the English segment the teacher wanted him to memorize next class, tried it out, then was pleasantly surprised.\nAt this moment, Lin Li’s memory had already improved by 100%.\nDuring the fourth period of the morning, Lin Li saw the message notification: [Task three completed]\n[You received rewards: Physical Improvement: Memory Boost 100%; System Currency*50.]\nHowever, following that, like the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, came a prolonging task.\n[If you want constant effort to penetrate stone, accumulation is indispensable, cultivation is endless, after stepping out, one can glimpse the precious experience of predecessors.\nSix hours blink in an instant, why not persist again seeking the path?]\n[Task three: During lectures and teachings from sect elders, managers, guardians, etc., listen attentively, thoroughly study for a total of twenty-four hours.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Comprehension Boost 10%; Memory Boost 100%; Random Cultivation Technique*1.]\nThe task requirements quadrupled, but the reward was quite generous, though comprehension boost is only 10%, Lin Li understood this as directly making himself 10% smarter, the effect should be very strong.\nAnd studying is studying, if Lin Li doesn’t do it normally in school, there’s nothing else to do.\nAs long as he maintains the current efficiency for a few days, this task can be completed within two weeks.\nThis system encourages both diligent study and chicken farm exploration.\nIt’s truly versatile in supporting both mind and body activities.",

      "content": "Chapter 32: Chapter 32: System, You’re Too Baby\nActually, Lin Li really wanted to check what the Spirit Stone looks like right now. The anti-pornography mission was completed, and the Spirit Stone is already in his [warehouse], ready to be taken out at any time.\nBut because he’s worried about causing a disturbance by taking it out in the classroom, to ensure safety, Lin Li plans to check it out after returning home.\nSafety first.\nFor now, let’s just focus on finishing the homework as soon as possible. This way, there will be time in the evening to preview the content for the upcoming courses.\nThough the efforts outside of class time don’t count towards the mission’s planning.\nStill, whether it’s completing homework or previewing, both help deepen the understanding of the coursework. The level of torment when seriously listening to a class that’s completely incomprehensible compared to when you can understand it is entirely different.\nThis is also the first barrier for a suddenly reformed poor student who starts listening to lectures—if you can’t understand it, you can’t seriously engage even if you want to.\nListening to lectures seriously has now become a long-term task and isn’t something that can be finished in just two or three days. Lin Li is doing this with his future in mind, hoping to make things easier for himself later.\n\"Persuasive homework, I’m going to write you to death! Want to see daddy’s morning glory?\"\n\"I’m going to stuff the idea of disassembly right into your little deconstruction text!\"\n\"Am I better, or is Bai Bufan better? Is my writing better, or is his writing better? Do I spend a long time writing you? Are my words big? Is it longer than his, is it bigger than his? Hmm? Speak up!\"\nLin Li sipped on his tropical flavored iced red tea while chanting this offbeat homework Bible, fully engaged in the battle with his homework.\n\"Lin Li? Are you reciting something?\" A female voice suddenly sounded next to him.\n\"Daddy wrote you—Chen Yu Ying?\" Immersed in his own world, Lin Li looked up and was startled to see Chen Yu Ying standing in the aisle beside Bai Bufan’s desk.\nHe quickly shut his mouth.\nStudying failed me; he hadn’t even noticed when Chen Yu Ying came to the classroom or when she got to his side.\nOh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.\nPlease, don’t hear what I just said.\nLin Li prayed in his heart.\nFortunately, Chen Yu Ying didn’t show any unusual expression, so she probably didn’t hear.\n\"Sorry, did I scare you?\" She heard Lin Li’s voice raised a bit, and instinctively raised her hands and stepped back half a step.\n\"No, no, no, no—\" Lin Li shook his head, then asked, \"What’s up? Do you have a package to pick up? If it’s not urgent, I can bring it for you tomorrow. If it’s urgent, I can go out during dinner to get it.\"\nUncertain if it’s because he’s seen Xiaojing before, Lin Li used to be a bit nervous and restrained when facing Chen Yu Ying, the prettiest girl in the class, but now that feeling is gone.\nOh no, Xiaojing won’t become my white moonlight, will she? Such a thing is bad.\nNo, given Xiaojing’s occupation, she can’t be considered white moonlight. She’s more of a pitch-black seafood-flavored stinky moonlight.\n\"Oh, it’s nothing like that. I was just curious about why you were called to the principal’s office this morning.\" Chen Yu Ying pressed her palms on Bai Bufan’s desk, her body slightly leaning toward Lin Li, her long hair floating up, smelling quite nice.\nLin Li blinked.\nThis is a no-go.\nJust as he was preparing to bluff with the reason he had previously prepared, the system suddenly popped up a message.\n[You have been in this world for half a day now. In this all-female world, someone has finally noticed your existence and is curious about you, wanting to know more information about you.]\n[Since this is the case, then prove your identity, tell her, you are a completely different male from her, a male who can that that with her!]\n[Mission Triggered!]\n[Mission Five: Tell Chen Yu Ying you are a different male from her, and inform her of the physiological differences between males and females.]\n[Mission Reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha Synchronization Index +10; Random Talent *1; System Currency *50]\n\"...\"\n\"Ah?\"\nNo way, extremely and even 350234 points of no way.\nBush Gomen.\nWhat the heck is this mission? Why did the system’s style suddenly change? Aren’t I ’in’ the Cultivation Realm? What is this all-female world? Didn’t the previous descriptions sound so literary, and why are they now in colloquialism?\nWhat does ’a male who can that that’ mean? Which that is it? Can you be more specific?\nLin Li’s brain at this moment is like the upper half of Xiaojing: a blank.\nThe view finally focused on the first half of the sentence at the start of the mission [You have been in this world for half a day now].\nHalf a day ago, which is 12 hours earlier, he should have been asleep.\nWait a minute, Lin Li remembered seeing [System Update] when he woke up this morning... damn, could this abstract system update this morning be the cause?\nHave I been ’crossed over’ again?\nBut seriously, I’m really intrigued by this world!\nFailing to go to the Cultivation Realm, Lin Li brushed it off, but how could this world not allow him to venture there? System bro, I have hardly ever asked anyone for anything in my life, but I beg you, take me there now.\nWhere’s the dump truck? Where’s the dump truck, hurry and save me!\nI need a stroke of luck urgently right now.\nBut wait, with the updated system, today’s Cultivation Realm tasks are still being released normally, missions two and four are still urging him to vanquish demons and eliminate demons, and this mission serial number is duly five.\nDarn it.\nWhat on earth is this?\n\"...\"\nLin Li eventually realized one thing, trying to rationalize the system’s actions is inherently irrational.\nThe system going crazy isn’t just a one-day occurrence; understanding it simply isn’t realistic.\nWhy has the style of the mission rewards changed too? What in the world is this Mecha Synchronization Index?\nSounds really cool, could this mean he can pilot a Gundam—assuming the system actually provides him with a Gundam.\n\"Lin Li? Lin Li? What’s going on?\" Chen Yu Ying, waiting for an answer, saw Lin Li suddenly zoning out, and a bit confused, waved her hand in front of him.\n\"Ah, nothing, class president, I’m just thinking about how to tell you.\" Lin Li snapped back to reality and spoke.\nTheoretically speaking, a task is here; it’s meant to be completed. Although the Mecha Synchronization Index is something completely unknown in terms of meaning, stepping back, system currency... heck, even not knowing if it’s useful, stepping back again, random talent must be useful.\nHowever, isn’t this mission content a bit too defiant?\nWhy does he have to enlighten Chen Yu Ying on physiological knowledge?\nMoreover, Chen Yu Ying surely knows these things, right? She doesn’t actually live in an all-female world.\nWhat she’s curious about now isn’t his gender at all!\nThe system’s thought process is purely the building between Building A and Building C.\nBut this isn’t a timed mission; would it just hang in the taskbar if uncompleted?\nThe taskbar interface looks 2*3 in format, two rows and three columns, currently holding five tasks.\nLin Li doesn’t know if more space will appear after filling up six.\nEven if there’s no upper limit, having something incomplete just feels uncomfortable to look at.\nDense mind! Hurry and brainstorm a solution!\nSuddenly there’s light in Lin Li’s eyes.\nHe’s really a genius.\nIf Lin Li were Pleasant Goat, a 240W giant light bulb would appear above his head now.\n\"Alright, class president, next, I’ll tell you why the principal called me this morning!\" With the demeanor of a storyteller, Lin Li picked up a pen and heavily slapped the desk, very imposing.\n\"Mm-hmm!\" With a curious face, Chen Yu Ying looked at Lin Li with some anticipation.\nLin Li took a deep inhale, then stood up, moving slightly away from Chen Yu Ying.\n\"First,\" facing Chen Yu Ying’s expectant yet puzzled gaze at his actions, Lin Li pointed to himself, then to her:\n—\"I’m male, you’re female.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 33: Chapter 33: First, Second, From Then On, Finally, I’m Not a Pervert\n\"I’m a guy, you’re a girl, do you get that?\"\nChen Yu Ying heard this opening line and experienced a brief moment of brain freeze.\n\"Huh? Uh.\" She voiced her confusion, then absentmindedly nodded: \"Yeah! Uh-huh, I get it. Huh? Wait, what else could it be?\"\nSo many interjections displayed the girl’s mind full of question marks at that moment.\nShe was indeed waiting for something big, but not this kind of big.\nLin Li sighed; the mission hadn’t been completed yet. As expected, he still had to do the most beastly thing of explaining this himself.\nHe took a deep breath, and then exhaled.\nThough millions stand in my way, onward I shall go!\nA true man stands among heaven and earth, how could he remain low for too long? Birth to humble beginnings isn’t shameful, being adaptable makes a man a true man. I’m not afraid of the system’s little trap for me, the biological education task won’t be the death of me ah ah ah ah!\nBut before going on, Lin Li still had to say a word, \"System, I curse you!\"\n\"No, you still don’t get it,\" Lin Li shook his head. \"First of all, I’m not a pervert, and second, remember my first point—I’m really not a pervert.\"\nLin Li continued to back away, increasing the distance between them while layering armor on himself.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Now, let me explain the differences between men and women!\nMen, although they have no advantages, do have one long asset! And women, on the other hand, not only lack length but also have one shortcoming. But men and women are actually fair, as women have not one, but two advantages!\nNow, let’s analyze why the combination of men and women is most fitting by nature? The answer: men like to grasp the two advantages of women, using their own asset to compensate for women’s shortcoming!\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"???\"\nChen Yu Ying was stunned, staring blankly at Lin Li, while Lin Li also looked at her—or actually, at the imaginary system interface between them, silently praying.\nA few seconds later, the system popped up a message prompt: [Mission Five Completed.]\nHooray!\nI’m a genius!\nThe great victory of a young genius!\nIt turned out, because Chen Yu Ying already understood this knowledge, he only needed to guide her to think in this direction, scientific popularization was successful even without carefully describing the organs like a junior high science textbook.\nHowever, before Lin Li could start celebrating, he covered his ears first.\n\"Ah!!! Pervert!!\" Nearly simultaneous with the system message, was Chen Yu Ying’s blushing face and scream.\nAfter all, mission completion meant Chen Yu Ying completely understood Lin Li’s meaning.\nSigh, even though he had just layered armor, she still called him that.\nWhy did I keep backing away, creating distance? It was to give her a bit more sense of security.\nThe remaining boy and girl in the classroom instantly turned their attention this way, looking towards the corner where the two were.\nThe boy even immediately stood up, seemingly wanting to play hero, opening with, \"Class monitor, what happened? Did Lin Li do something to you, need to call the teacher?\"\nSee?\nThis is why Lin Li and people like him can’t hang out together.\nThey call the teacher at the drop of a hat. Lin Li hates two kinds of people the most — those who tattletale and those who prevent him from tattletale.\nLin Li ignored this classmate named Wang Yuezhi, instead explaining to Chen Yu Ying:\n\"Class monitor, calm down, calm down, there is a reason why I said what I did just now. Don’t rush, I will explain it to you, and you will understand.\" From a distance, Lin Li extended his hands in front of him, trying to soothe her.\nSeemingly realizing she had shouted too loud, Chen Yu Ying quickly covered her mouth, her face blushing.\nShe turned to look at Wang Yuezhi, waved her hand: \"It’s nothing.\"\nWang Yuezhi reluctantly nodded and sat back down, but Lin Li could notice that his gaze was still sneaking glances his way.\nHeh, unrequited love, but lickspittle gets no good end.\nAt this moment, Chen Yu Ying returned her gaze to Lin Li, still indignant, with hands at her hips, demanding: \"Give me an explanation.\"\n\"The tape is in Bai Bufan’s lower drawer, there!\" Lin Li, quicker with his mouth than his mind, blurted out the lousy joke, noticing how Chen Yu Ying’s recently calmed face flushed again.\nThe color changes were quite sensitive, felt like it could be hung on the road as red and white lights, heh, kind of fun.\nDarn it, now wasn’t the time for this.\n\"Not that tape!\"\n\"Ahem, it’s like this, class monitor, what I said before was a necessary lead-in for the upcoming explanation, to emphasize one last time, I’m really not a pervert,\" said Lin Li.\nYet the skepticism in Chen Yu Ying’s gaze did not fade.\nNormal people wouldn’t repeatedly stress they’re not a pervert.\n\"The following content needs to be said quietly, I’m afraid of eavesdropping, would you like to sit down?\" Lin Li, now at the back near the storage cabinet, found it tiring to talk and manage the volume from there.\nThus, he walked back to his spot, pointing to Bai Bufan’s chair and spoke.\nPerhaps it was curiosity surpassing the fear of perverts, Chen Yu Ying still sat down, hearing that a lady only sits halfway on a chair, but she sat on the half far from Lin Li, didn’t seem very ladylike.\nWang Yuezhi’s gaze grew more intense from nearby.\nWhispering with your goddess, kill you with jealousy, just this NTR feeling, so satisfying.\nHowever, the pressing task was to salvage his reputation.\n\"Class monitor, you surely understand the meaning of what I said earlier, and that behavior, more precisely that desire, often leads to certain crimes,\" Lin Li said seriously and earnestly, \"And what I assisted the police in cracking down, was a case about this aspect.\"\n\"The incident was like this, not long ago I found those small deliberately scattered cards on the ground, you might have seen them too, I was very interested in them—wait! Don’t call me a pervert again, I’ll emphasize one more time, I’m really not a pervert.\nWhat I’m interested in is not the kind of sensual X appeal you think.\"\nPre-emptively judged, Chen Yu Ying pursed her lips, skeptically indicating Lin Li to continue.\n\"At that time, my thought was to bring those responsible for these cards to justice! So I started investigating and collecting information, eventually finding a shop corresponding to one of the cards, then I used my after school time and weekends to stake out, take photos, gather information, and even interview customers.\nEventually, through my efforts, I finally gathered enough decisive evidence, rushed to the police station to report. With the information I provided, they easily dismantled the operation behind these cards! Because of this, they came to the school today to find me through the principal, to commend my deeds.\"\n\"Really?\" Though Lin Li concocted this story, the fresh and astonishing news still stunned Chen Yu Ying, who asked in surprise.\n\"Of course it’s true. I suppose the commendation letter is already posted on the bulletin board downstairs, class monitor, you can check it yourself. But it doesn’t mention those case specifics, it only says I helped the police, because this stuff isn’t appropriate to say outright.\"\nChen Yu Ying nodded in amazement, thinking that since the bulletin board was mentioned, it must be true.\nGreat, she believed it, Lin Li was quite pleased.\nThere was no way he could tell Chen Yu Ying the real version.\nBai Bufan might not care, but he did.\n\"But I have one more question,\" Chen Yu Ying asked.\n\"What?\"\n\"Then why did you have to say those creepy comments about male and female assets before this case?\" Chen Yu Ying asked, confused.\n\"Firstly, I’m not a pervert, then the reason I already said, it’s to let you better understand the cause of this case, it’s a necessary preamble, class monitor, it’s with the best of intentions, lastly, I’m really not a pervert,\" Lin Li said with heartfelt sincerity.\nChen Yu Ying wanted to nod, but something still seemed off.\nNo, that’s not right.\nLin Li could have simply stated the case details; she would have understood.\nThe talk of differences between genders seemed completely unnecessary prologue!\nSeemed like a pervert trying to rationalize their perverse behavior.\nChen Yu Ying paused, looking at Lin Li with a dissatisfied tone, feeling not getting the truth, \"You like backstories so much, why didn’t you start from when Nuwa created humans?\"\nLin Li paused, then nodded:\n\"It is said that Nuwa used mud to mold humans after her own form, creating and structuring human society...\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"You really started saying it!\"",

(Looking for Monthly Votes at the Beginning of the Month)\n\"Class rep, if you don’t like the traditional version, I can also be westernized, like Adam is the human created by Yahweh God...\" Lin Li changed his words again.\n\"That’s not what I meant!\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit annoyed but didn’t know how to express her true thoughts. Finally, she sulkily said, \"I still think you’re like a pervert.\"\nLin Li now wanted to refute Wang Yongbin, who said that a gentleman judges by actions, not intentions. Lin Li now felt quite the opposite.\nJust because you’ve said perverted things and done perverted things, does it mean you’re really perverted inside and must be labeled as a pervert?\n...What else could it be?\nInside, Lin Li was interrogating his conscience, questioning and answering himself very quickly, when he suddenly froze.\nHuh?\nAfter a moment, he smiled in relief, nodded to Chen Yu Ying, and said with no desires, \"Class rep, you’ve convinced me, I am a pervert.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"I didn’t mean... well, I kind of did, but it’s not that serious, you’re a good kind of pervert.\" Chen Yu Ying felt like she had hurt someone and stammered as she spoke.\nClass rep, you’re really good at comforting people; next time, maybe don’t comfort me.\n\"You’re a good person, Lin Li!\" Seemingly realizing she said something wrong, Chen Yu Ying added.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nNew achievement unlocked: received a \"good person card\" without even confessing.\nMight as well say I’m a good pervert, thanks.\n\"It’s okay, never mind.\" Lin Li waved his hand, then instructed, \"But class rep, could you do me a favor and not tell anyone about this? You’re willing to ask, so I’m willing to tell you, but for others, I’m not necessarily willing to say, as even though it’s a good deed, it could lead to gossip.\"\nActually, if it weren’t for this incident, Lin Li wouldn’t have planned to tell Chen Yu Ying the truth; he intended to brush it off with a random good deed like finding a lost wallet.\n\"Yes, yes! I know, I definitely won’t tell anyone!\" Upon hearing this, Chen Yu Ying nodded vigorously.\n\"Anything else you’re curious about? If not, I’ll keep doing my homework.\" Lin Li said.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t reply and was a bit embarrassed in Bai Bufan’s seat.\nIf she told Bai Bufan what happened at noon this afternoon, Bai Bufan would definitely start licking the chair like crazy, wishing to eat it – pure Lin Li’s subjective slander, purely malicious.\n\"Anything else?\" Lin Li actively asked.\n\"Lin Li, what key evidence did you find?\" Chen Yu Ying spoke up.\n\"Those things are even more perverted, I’d better not say.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nHe couldn’t discuss what’s non-existent.\n\"It’s okay, tell me, I want to hear.\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice was as soft as a mosquito.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li suddenly felt a bit wronged for being labeled a pervert for so long; why should perverts make it hard for perverts?\nClass rep, I didn’t expect you to be this kind of class rep!\nBut Chen Yu Ying was probably just purely curious. After all, girls are far less pure than boys think; the way girls act around boys is like the way boys act around girls, they’re all pretenders.\nIf you check the chats between girls and their best friends, it would be like the history of a boy’s browser, unspeakable.\nHow can you say something that doesn’t exist?\nMake it up!\nIs it hard to make up some stories based on what you see, hear, and experience?\nOf course, Lin Li didn’t need to do this.\nBut! Lin Li felt it would be exciting to talk about such things in front of a pretty girl...\nSo, Lin Li, who originally planned to end the conversation, cleared his throat: \"Since you sincerely asked, I’ll kindly tell you.\"\n\"Okay, okay.\"\n\"First, I haven’t experienced it myself, but according to the clues I’ve gathered, there are indeed very rich services provided in chicken farms, such as...\" Lin Li bent down, covered his mouth, and began whispering.\nMeanwhile, Chen Yu Ying also bent slightly, leaning towards Lin Li, perking up her ears to listen to a whole new perspective of the world.\nBoth were very satisfied, sensing this would be a pleasant conversation.\nHowever, a third party was not satisfied.\nWang Yuezhi, who originally planned to study hard at noon, had been holding his pen for a long time but hadn’t written a word.\nHe was eavesdropping with no heart for the homework in front of him.\nNo matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t hear what those two were saying in the back row.\nOccasionally, he could catch a faint exclamation from Chen Yu Ying, barely distinguishable as \"Really?\" or \"Oh my god.\"\nOr the laughter of that damn Lin Li.\nOther than that, only indistinguishable rustling sounds could be heard.\nCan you speak properly? Didn’t you eat; why are you whispering?\nIf you can’t talk, just shut up!\nHe really wanted to stand up and warn them, after all, even though you could stay in the classroom during lunch break, the school had rules; after 12:40, whether in the dorm or classroom, you couldn’t wander around freely – and certainly couldn’t engage in hushed conversations.\nIf it was Lin Li and Bai Bufan here, he would have stood up long ago.\nBut the problem now was that the chatting duo was Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying, he couldn’t bring himself to stand up.\nThe more Wang Yuezhi thought about it, the angrier he got, sneaking a glance back.\nDamn!\nTheir heads were almost touching, Chen Yu Ying had a beautiful, moving, likable blush on her face, while Lin Li had a hideous, sleazy, disgusting grin.\n—Purely subjective, purely malicious.\nClass rep, why are you blushing, you should be hitting him hard!\n\"Stay away from him, it’s dangerous!\" Wang Yuezhi’s voice squeezed out between his teeth.\nCould they be dating?\nThinking back to how Chen Yu Ying had loudly called him a pervert just now, yet now the two were so close, Wang Yuezhi had already imagined the plot of the story, and it had some odd attributes.\nWang Yuezhi Jaeger: That kind of thing doesn’t need medicine! Class rep finding another guy or something!\n\"Damn damn damn damn!\" Wang Yuezhi finally picked up his pen, only to scribble meaningless circles on his homework, simultaneously cursing Lin Li.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, can you be quiet? It’s very noisy.\"\nAt this moment, the fourth student in the classroom, also sitting in the front row, said impatiently to him.\nLin Li’s voice floated over from the back: \"Exactly, how can one person be so noisy? The two of us are so quiet, tsk tsk.\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"...\"\nThe last two straws that broke the camel’s back came quietly.\nWang Yuezhi left the classroom.\nWang Yuezhi.exe encountered an error.\n...\nThe bell for the afternoon class’s preparation ten minutes early rang.\nThe students from the dorms were all gradually returning to the classroom.\nLin Li stretched lazily.\nDamn, I originally wanted to study well, but ended up wasting the whole noon making up stories in front of Chen Yu Ying.\nPlans were all disrupted.\nBeauty seduces me, from today onwards, I’m quitting drinking!\nNo regrets.\nI live for myself, not for the system.\nThe heavens and earth are vast, I’m the biggest.\nBai Bufan yawned as he entered through the back door, seemingly having not slept enough at noon.\nHe plopped down in his seat, then suddenly jumped up: \"Why isn’t it cold! Lin Li, who violated my chair!\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying sat on it all noon.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nBefore questioning Lin Li, he quickly squatted down, chin parallel to the seat surface, took out two pens pretending to be knife and fork, licked his lips: \"Then I won’t be polite, time to start eating!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSo it turns out my malicious speculation wasn’t slander.\nKnowing heaven is easy, reversing destiny is hard.\nAs expected of you, Bai Bufan.\n--\nAsking for a monthly ticket at the beginning of the month~~",

      "content": "Chapter 35: Chapter 35 This Must Be Instinct at Work\nFortunately, Bai Bufan didn’t really feast at the end; otherwise, with Lin Li’s noble character, he would definitely not associate with such people.\n... More rigorously, probably not.\n\"Why aren’t you eating?\" Lin Li asked with a smile.\n\"I just sat on it, it’s already contaminated.\"\n\"You’re defying the heavens.\"\nBai Bufan got up again and went straight to Lin Li’s back, applying a chokehold on the spot, then leaned in gossipily on Lin Li’s shoulder: \"Quickly tell me, what happened at noon, how did Chen Yu Ying manage to sit with you for an entire afternoon? Did you secretly make a move on her without telling the guys?\nIt’s weird; Chen Yu Ying is quite pretty, her personality and academics are good too, it doesn’t make sense for her to be blind.\"\n\"Heh,\" Lin Li sneered, pretending to be profound before speaking truthfully: \"She came to ask me what the principal wanted me to do in the morning.\"\n\"...\"\nStunned for a moment, Bai Bufan released his chokehold, his expression like a laughing strongman holding back: \"What did you say?\"\n\"I made up a more pleasant explanation.\" Lin Li repeated the exclusive explanation he gave to Chen Yu Ying.\nThis makes it easier to align stories, even if there’s a very slim chance in the future that Chen Yu Ying and Bai Bufan talk about this matter, it won’t unravel.\n\"Lin Li, you wouldn’t want your Chen Yu Ying to know the truth either, would you?\"\n\"Quit your flavor, you Japanese person.\"\n\"I’ll forgive you guys for invading my chair, and even welcome you to come again next time.\"\n\"Green hat fetish? Bai Bufan, truly worthy of being Japanese; I must be lifelong good brothers with you!\" Lin Li looked expectantly at Bai Bufan.\n\"?\"\n\"Damn it, I haven’t even started dating yet, and you’re already eyeing my girlfriend? I take back my forgiveness, go to hell.\"\nLin Li chuckled and then looked at the system.\nHe spent all noon creating a story for Chen Yu Ying, and hasn’t checked the reward for task five he earned from her yet.\n[You have received the following rewards: Mecha Synchronization Index +10; Random Talent *1; System Currency *50.]\nSacrifice Bai Bufan’s ten years of lifespan, give me a top-tier talent! Talent, activate!\n[You have received a talent: Ballet (Ordinary).]\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nSuddenly, some dance techniques popped into his head.\nBut.\nDefying the heavens with talent.\nLin Li wasn’t asking for practical skills like Tongbei Fist or Tai Chi Palm; he could accept talents like piano or violin that allow him to show off, but what’s the meaning of giving ballet?\nDamn, does this mean playing the little swan in Swan Lake? No, this is just an ordinary-level talent, and the little swan is a highly challenging role in ballet, which Lin Li might not even be able to perform.\nIn the Cultivation Realm, with enemies looming, Lin Li utters \"hold on a moment,\" then spins, leaps, and closes his eyes.\nThis scene Lin Li dares say he couldn’t even imagine.\nAnd the thing that amuses Lin Li most is that this ability isn’t even listed on the panel; the system doesn’t care for this ability either.\nGeez, why did my sacrifice fail? In the past when sacrificing Bai Bufan’s lifespan, it was pretty effective.\nWait! It’s due to insufficient balance!\n\"Bufan, you won’t even live ten more years!\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nAfter some horsing around, Lin Li brought up the panel again, which now looked like this.\n[Name: Lin Li (Blood Crow Assassin)]\n[Age: 17]\n[Constitution: Spiritual Qi absorption rate increased by 200%; Charm Resistance increased by 100%; Yang Qi concentration increased by 50%; Memory improved by 100%; Mecha Synchronization Index 10]\n[Passive Ability: Barehanded Blade Catch]\n[Active Ability: None]\n[System Currency: 400]\nLooking at his panel, Lin Li couldn’t help but fall into thought.\nHe feels he’s been quite busy since activating the system, but in terms of results, he’s still unsure about what exactly he’s been busy with.\nBusy, being busy is good.\n...\nThe bell for the end of night study rings.\n\"Keep up the effort; I’m counting on you!\" Bai Bufan no longer held back Lin Li but watched Lin Li leave with great expectations.\nGo on, find the big brother at the chicken farm.\nToday, Lin Li rarely goes home with his backpack during school days, mainly because it’s loaded with valuables over four thousand in cash and card supplies.\nHe heads to the office, ready to pick up his pennant from his homeroom teacher, even though he feels giving it away is fine too.\nPoor Teacher Xue without a pennant, although he himself wouldn’t admit it.\nLin Li arrives at the office door.\nAlmost all subject teachers are here.\nBoarding schools naturally provide staff accommodation, according to Bai Bufan, they occasionally encountered Xue Jian checking dorms at eleven.\nHowever, as most teachers are middle-aged, those who aren’t homeroom teachers mostly live in their own homes outside and drive to work.\nTonight, the reason the teachers gather is due to a weekly Monday night teacher meeting.\nYet his target, Xue Jian, isn’t here.\nLin Li knocked on the door upon entering and inquired with the nearby Li Binbin: \"Teacher Li, is Teacher Xue not here?\"\n\"Probably went to the restroom, should be back soon; if you’re looking for him, wait here for a moment,\" said Li Binbin.\n\"Okay.\"\nLin Li stands beside Xue Jian’s spot, observing around.\nFinally, he locks eyes on the English teacher’s legs.\nBased on Lin Li’s school experience, if the English teacher is female and young, she tends to be the best looking and most fashionable among teachers; Lin Li’s English teacher Coco fits this niche, though he often calls her Koukou, in her twenties, although rumored to be married.\nNansang’s school rules prohibit teachers from wearing heavy makeup or attire like short skirts during classes, not that any teachers actually do.\nDressing up is usually for oneself, not for grooming to please unruly kids.\nHowever, Koukou returned today from outside specifically for the meeting, wearing a completely different outfit than in the morning, with well-done makeup and seemingly styled hair, paired with a carefully selected dress, looking quite nice.\nThe love for beauty is universal.\nNice legs.\nGlancing once, it’s instinct, nothing more to say.\nLooking persistently, is a continuous instinct, also nothing more to say.\nInstinct is truly difficult to resist.\n\"Lin Li, remember to review the text diligently at home; I’ll call on you tomorrow.\" Koukou noticed Lin Li and spoke.\nSpoke too soon.\nInstinct is actually quite easy to resist.\nLin Li immediately lost interest in looking.\n\"Got it, teacher.\" Lin Li nodded.\nKoukou contemplated briefly, deciding to reprimand Lin Li; lately his behavior had been exceedingly out of line.\nIn English class, he’d either be zoning out or asleep, totally unrelated to course content.\nKoukou didn’t want Lin Li to continue this way.\nShe was just about to speak—\n\"Your class performance has been good lately, showing great seriousness, Lin Li, remember to maintain that, your grades will improve steadily.\" Li Binbin, readying to head home, suddenly recalled and praised.\n\"That’s indeed true; Lin Li is exceptionally focused in class lately,\" the biology teacher chimed in upon hearing.\n\"True, assignments are completed well too, keep it up, Lin Li,\" the geography teacher also nodded.\n\"Indeed...\"\n\"...\"\nLi Binbin’s comments resonated with all teachers present, and they generously flattered Lin Li.\nLeaving Koukou with: \"?\"\nHer mouth hung open, suddenly stiff, words unsaid.\nWhat’s going on?\nHasn’t Lin Li been increasingly neglecting academics lately?\nWhy is every teacher except her praising Lin Li?\nEven with encouragement-based education, this praise feels over the top.\nUnless...\nKoukou’s gaze shifted to Lin Li, slightly embarrassed, scratching his head with a smile.\nAt this moment on Lin Li’s side.\nTeachers’ attitudes toward students generally boil down to strictness through deep care.\nThough different levels of distributive care exist for distinct students:\nLow achievers: Strict care,\nAverage achievers:\nHigh achievers: Deep love.\nHigh and low achievers’ end-of-term comments vary greatly, with targeted praise or encouragement, while average achievers typically hear, \"You are a quiet student...\"\nDue to being mischievous, Lin Li falls under the ’strict care’ category; this shift to ’deep love’ feels quite unfamiliar.\nSuddenly, Lin Li felt a chill, as if someone was watching him, sending shivers across his body.\nUpon Lin Li’s glance.\n\"Why... why... I’m not satisfied... why...\"\nHoly.\nI haven’t seen her for a minute, how did my beautiful, stylish Teacher Koukou turn into a resentful spirit?",

      "content": "Chapter 36: Chapter 36: Oh no, it’s the Dominating Demon Miss Shakima!\nThis resentful gaze made Lin Li feel completely uncomfortable, as if trapped in an iron maiden.\nKoukou Teacher, please have some self-respect, looking at me with such eyes, if your husband saw this, he’d kill me!\nBeing beaten to death like this would be really unjust.\n\"Teacher, is something wrong?\" Worried that he’d wake up in the middle of the night to find Koukou Teacher standing by the bed looking at him like this, Lin Li cautiously asked.\n\"Lin Li, do you have any opinions about the teacher?\" Koukou asked seriously.\nThe younger the teacher, the more they care about the students’ attitudes.\nThose veteran teachers, who are not homeroom teachers, would just laugh about such situations and let it go.\nNo, they probably don’t even remember who Lin Li is.\n\"Opinions?\" Lin Li thought for a moment, then seriously said, \"Teacher, I think you suit curly ends very well. Your hair today must have been curled with an iron, right? It looks great. I think you could handle even curlier hair, so why not just go to the salon and get it done once and for all?\"\n\"Really? I also think today’s hairstyle is nice,\" Koukou’s eyes lit up, nodding heavily, twirling her hair with her finger, \"What do you think about curling it to this extent?\"\n\"Very good, it definitely looks better than the usual straight hair,\" Lin Li agreed.\n\"Your taste is just as good as the teacher’s. The teacher will listen to you and try it tomorrow...\" Koukou suddenly shut her mouth and silently lowered her head.\nWhat the hell am I doing!\nI came to question Lin Li about his opinion of me, so how did we end up talking about hair!\n\"What the teacher wants to hear isn’t this kind of opinion...\" Koukou spoke again.\n\"But when it comes to clothes, my sense of style is terrible, I have no opinions to offer,\" Lin Li shook his head, bravely admitting his shortcomings.\n\"It’s not about clothes either!\" Koukou raised her voice, \"The teacher wants to ask why, despite everyone saying you’ve been studying diligently, I can’t feel it in my English class!\"\nThe loudness startled Lin Li, making him jerk back and inhale sharply.\nAfter he understood, he blinked.\nOh no, it’s not about having less but about fairness, Koukou was originally upset about inequality here.\nAfter careful consideration, Lin Li softly explained, \"Koukou Teacher, is it possible they were actually being sarcastic, and I haven’t been paying attention at all?\"\nKoukou: \"?\"\n\"That’s right! That’s it! Rest assured, Koukou Teacher, I haven’t been listening in any of my other classes either!\" Lin Li felt more confident as he thought about it.\nI’m truly a genius.\n\"You admit you’ve completely ignored English class?\" Judging by Koukou’s increasingly resentful gaze, she didn’t believe his words and seemed to catch on to the important part.\nLin Li was stunned: \"?\"\nOh no! She’s a bad woman! Are you Miss Kayako the Demon of Control or something?\nKoukou is digging a pit for me!\nDammit, is this the insidiousness of an adult woman? Truly hard to guard against.\n\"Sometimes I listen too... ha, ha, ha...\"\nLin Li chuckled awkwardly.\nOh dear, the resentment attribute is still increasing.\nEven if Kayako came, she’d probably have to be a servant.\nIt’s already reached the level of a ghost in red clothes.\nScratching his head and thinking quickly, Lin Li finally lowered his head and honestly apologized, \"I’m sorry teacher, I’ll listen more carefully in the future. I truly have no complaints about you, who would have complaints about the best-looking teacher, gomen nasai, I’m so so so sorry.\"\nThe one with complaints isn’t me, it’s my abstract system!\nFrom now on, I definitely won’t slack off so blatantly! Koukou Teacher!\nAt least I’ll cover it up a bit from now on!\nLin Li silently added in his heart.\n\"Sigh, the teacher remembers your words and hopes you can do it. The teacher also has to go home now, bye-bye,\" Koukou shook her head somewhat helplessly before finally getting up to leave.\n\"Goodbye, teacher.\"\nAfter Koukou left, the previously busy office was suddenly left with only Lin Li.\nJust as Lin Li began to wonder if Xue Jian was suffering from constipation, he finally returned.\nSeeing Lin Li, he nodded: \"Here to pick up the banner?\"\n\"Yes, teacher.\"\n\"Good.\" Xue Jian nodded, went to his place, and began fiddling with his phone.\nWhile Lin Li was puzzled, Xue Jian showed the phone screen to Lin Li.\nCurious, Lin Li looked.\n[To Teacher Xue of Nansang Middle School in Xiling County: Teaching sincerely, mentorship yields students everywhere. Student XXX respectfully presents...]\nAn image of a banner.\nAt first, Lin Li didn’t understand why Xue Jian showed this to him. Once he realized, he felt inexplicable.\n\"...\"\nElder Xue surprisingly cares about face.\nThe offhand remark I made this morning, he remembered so clearly.\nBut he knew what he should say at this moment.\n\"Wow, is this the banner that parents previously gave to the teacher? It’s so well-made!\"\nApparently, Lin Li’s words made Xue Jian very happy. After a few exchanges of modest compliments, Xue Jian finally bent down to open the drawer, beginning to look for Lin Li’s banner.\nHis phone was left on the desk, and perhaps because he accidentally touched the screen when putting it down, the full-screen image shrank back.\nThe phone displayed WeChat, as the picture came from a chat.\nLin Li instinctively looked over.\nThe contact was \"Wife.\"\n「Xue Jian: Is it not done yet?」\n「Wife: Almost done, nearly finished.」\n「Wife: You’re really something, Xue Jian, everything about you is fine except for caring about face. Making a banner for yourself, it’s embarrassing for me.」\n「Xue Jian: Don’t worry about it, it’s because you didn’t take care of it earlier.」\n「Wife: Alright.」\n「Wife:「Picture」」\nThe content of that picture was self-evident.\nLin Li blinked, as if he had seen something incredible.\n\"Hey, Lin Li, your—\" And at this moment, Xue Jian just happened to stand up with Lin Li’s banner, speech halted.\nLin Li’s gaze was still fixed on the screen.\nIt seemed too late to turn away now.\nWith his peripheral vision, he already sensed a faint murderous aura.\n\"...\"\n\"Gulp.\"\nLin Li gulped loudly.\nHe watched the screen, Xue Jian watched him, until the screen automatically turned off, leaving Lin Li nothing to look at.\nLin Li raised his head and, at that moment, the two locked eyes, but they tacitly said nothing.\nThey stared at each other, feeling nothing but disappointment.\nAm I having a hallucination? Why do I see a red danger symbol above my head?\nWhat’s with the flashbacks; I don’t want to start reminiscing about my life! Stop the scene now! Medicine! Ah!\nSomebody save me! Miracle Worker, come on, help out!\nDamn, looks like I have to save myself.\nLin Li suddenly covered his eyes fiercely, wailing:\n\"Ah ah ah ah ah Erkang, I can’t see! Why can’t I suddenly see anymore!\nAh ah ah ah ah The red light on left turns is the hardest to wait at!\nAh ah ah ah ah I suddenly remembered, I actually have periodic blindness, occasionally becoming blind, but why did it suddenly act up now...\"\nXue Jian: \"...\"",

It was better to run away now.\nHe was very close to the door, the dawn of victory was just in sight. Come on, keep going!\n\"Stop.\"\nAs Lin Li reached the door, he heard the low whisper of death behind him and, in a daze, saw the Ox Head and Horse Face smiling warmly at him.\nI’m doomed.\nBad news, he’d never see Xiaojing again. Good news, he could visit Lao Da now.\n\"Hey, the illness is over! I’m better now!\" Lin Li ended his performance, mechanically and slowly turned around, obediently and honestly stood where he was, and looked at Xue Jian: \"Teacher, I was really blind just now, believe me, I never lie.\"\nLin Li didn’t see Xue Jian’s gaze.\nBecause Xue Jian was already sitting in his seat, pressing his forehead with his fingers, covering his eyes with his palm, and did not respond to Lin Li’s words.\n\"Come here.\" A few seconds later, Xue Jian suddenly said.\nHow to write an obituary?\nCan someone watch a thirty-second ad to revive me?\nMoshi moshi, waiting online, very, very urgent.\nFortunately, all his browsers were in incognito mode... Wait, no! He hadn’t deleted the forbidden comics yet, his favorite manga would be shown! 363848, go ahead, my inheritance is all here.\nWith a resolute determination to face death, Lin Li walked towards Xue Jian with a drooping face.\nHowever, Xue Jian still did not look up, as if he didn’t dare to face Lin Li’s eyes either.\nHe extended his trembling hand, unlocked his phone with a fingerprint again, then said in a shaky voice, \"Take the phone, scroll through it, read some chat history.\"\nHe paused and added with a tremor, \"I beg you.\"\nThis was the first time Lin Li saw Xue Jian show such a ’fragile’ side, like an old man in his twilight years. Who could refuse such a request at this time?\nLin Li could.\n——But actually, Lin Li was just a bit scared, not daring to pick up the phone.\nAt this moment, he was like a bomb disposal expert, maintaining distance, and started swiping the screen with his finger from afar.\n\"...\"\n\"Xue Jian: Where are all my banners? Can’t find any of them?\"\n\"Wife: Haven’t seen them, probably didn’t bring them last time we moved because they were hidden in those boxes or something, why are you looking for them?\"\n\"Xue Jian: It’s about my dignity, look again, look again.\"\n\"Wife: Really can’t find them.\"\n\"Xue Jian: Do you have photos of them? I changed my phone, previous photos weren’t transferred over.\"\n\"Wife: Why would I keep pictures of your banners? Do I look sick to you?\"\n\"Xue Jian: ...Then can you help me make one, quick, I still remember the contents of one banner...\"\n\"...\"\nOkay, Lin Li had already understood what Xue Jian wanted to express to him.\nEven though assignments not brought were regarded as uncompleted, Xue Jian had truly done them.\nIt’s just that the assignments were lost, having no choice but to copy them anew, and all he saw was the scene of him copying the assignments, indeed a misunderstanding.\nXue Jian was a good student.\nHe truly was, Lin Li was moved to tears.\nCome to think of it, being a homeroom teacher in a key high school, his age and experience were there, so banners were achievable.\n\"Teacher, I finished reading, I understand, you truly have them.\" Lin Li cautiously said, fearing a loud voice would trigger Xue Jian.\n\"Thank you,\" it was rare to hear such words from Xue Jian’s mouth, he again extended his trembling hand, handed Lin Li his banner, \"Take it home, be safe on the road.\"\nThroughout, Xue Jian did not look up to Lin Li, but Lin Li didn’t feel disrespected at all.\n\"Thank you, teacher.\" He carefully took it and expressed thanks.\n\"Get going now.\" Xue Jian waved his hand.\nLin Li turned and left immediately, without a moment’s pause because he suspected that Xue Jian was now suppressing his second personality, or the beast sleeping within him. If he didn’t leave soon, there would be no more chances.\n...\nGot on the bicycle.\nLin Li did not immediately ride in the direction of his home, first went to the ATM to deposit most of the money into his bank card, and then started seemingly aimless wandering around Xiling Town.\nA dead rat, come on, show yourself.\nHowever, even after biking for half an hour, the system Lin Li was expecting gave no response.\nThere was no notification about any nearby chicken farms.\nCould it be that his luck was too bad, never could locate where the chicken farms were hidden?\nSince it was only half an hour, and was actually making rounds, Lin Li was essentially wandering around the Xiling Center area.\nMight these places be too urbanized, the fundamental reason for not being triggered?\nIt was already too late today, too much time had been wasted in the office. Tomorrow evening, he would ride to farther and more remote places. If this method still didn’t trigger in a week’s time, Lin Li could basically conclude that the system wouldn’t notify proactively, and finding a chicken farm would rely on finding a new way himself.\nLin Li biked back home.\nWithout hesitation, he manifested the spirit stone.\nThe spirit stone was not as big as he imagined. Actually, the size of one was even a bit smaller than an egg, five of them could be barely held in one hand, but very light, their total weight was less than an egg.\nLin Li initially thought they would be very large, where one hand could only hold one, and heavy, turns out he overthought it.\nAnd it didn’t trigger any celestial phenomena.\nWith a crystal-like luster, seemingly with an internal crystalline flow, shape between regular and irregular.\nLin Li leaned in and smelled, slightly fragrant, quite appetizing.\nThis time it was really something good, even if sold, collectors would definitely be interested.\nBut Lin Li couldn’t possibly do that.\n\"Wow, totally worth dying for!\" Lin Li showed an excited smile, could finally see what this spiritual qi was about!\nBut Lin Li soon encountered another problem.\nThis spirit stone was a product without identity, without a production or expiration date is one thing, they also didn’t provide a user manual.\nIt was basic knowledge in the Cultivation Realm.\nBut it was not for him.\nHow to extract this spiritual qi?\nAs the saying goes, a housewife cannot cook a meal without rice.\nThe Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique indeed wrote on how to use spirit qi absorbed into the body, but didn’t mention handling a spirit stone.\nLin Li tried biting it, very hard, his teeth hurt.\n\"This thing can’t possibly be like the Golden Cores in novels, that can be swallowed and refined in the stomach, right?\"\nLin Li looked at its size, indeed swallowable, he held it but hesitated to swallow.\nForget it, Lin Li spat it out again.\nThis thing indeed smelled appetizing, but swallowing it might truly open up appetite in a physical sense.\nIf eaten and unable to digest, certainly couldn’t pass it, he hadn’t made it to be one of the must-eats in Chengdu.\n\"One cannot hold it in to death!\"\nLin Li gritted his teeth and decided to treat a dead horse as if it were alive. He manifested the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, opened the second Chapter, held the spirit stone, and started cultivating.\nAs his movements posed, the cultivation technique began actively guiding the body.\n\"Oh~~~~\"\nLin Li couldn’t help but utter a soft moan.\nIt worked!",

      "content": "Chapter 38: Chapter 38: Three-Headed Golden Crow · Lin Li\nThe recent comfort made Lin Li unforgettable, and his longing for Xiaojing faded away.\nXiaojing’s massage technique was just so-so.\n\"Indeed, people won’t be strangled by their own urine, and there’s always a way out when the car comes to the mountain!\"\nLin Li happily took the Spirit Stone out of his mouth and wiped it clean with a tissue.\nThen he held it in his hand and resumed practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique with the Spiritual Qi Chapter.\nThe pleasant sensation flooded back into his body, the Spirit Stone in his hand glowed softly, and the crystalline interior circulated rapidly. Since no one was home, he couldn’t help but exclaim in joy.\nHe switched hands and tested again.\nAfter a while.\nIt turned out that having it in his mouth wasn’t a necessary condition. It seemed that as long as there was skin contact, it could absorb Spiritual Qi.\nThe color wasn’t different from the start, but if Lin Li used his big eyes carefully to observe, he’d find that the interior was no longer absolutely clear. Between the crystalline structure was a small bubble—actually, calling it a bubble wasn’t right, it was like two incompatible gases.\nIt could be predicted that this bubble was the consumed Spiritual Qi. When the interior crystal fully turned into pure white ’air,’ this Spirit Stone would be completely consumed.\nAlthough small, Lin Li couldn’t help but frown.\nSuch a tiny bit wasn’t adorable at all.\nHe had just accumulated enough to enjoy a few seconds of pleasure, and now there was a bubble? This wasn’t good news, as it meant the Spiritual Qi inside might be depleted within minutes.\nBut then Lin Li thought for a bit and was relieved.\nThe stuff he had was just a Spirit Stone, and a rather low-grade one at that, the most basic item in the Cultivation Realm, often used as currency.\nIn novels he used to read, characters in the Cultivation Realm talk about thousands or tens of thousands of Spirit Stones; his five pieces indeed seemed shabby.\nYet for Lin Li, it was a milestone.\nHe had finally reached the level of real cultivation! It was the most tangible and profound reward he’d received so far.\nLin Li didn’t plan to continue practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique; serious practice for an hour a day was enough. Inefficient practice would lead to inefficient absorption of Spiritual Qi, which was counterproductive.\nAnd it was already late, he’d continue tomorrow.\n...\nThe next morning, close to five o’clock.\n\"Damn it, people really will be strangled by their own urine.\"\nLin Li retracted his statement from last night.\nFurthermore, he announced that the most tangible and profound reward wasn’t actually these five Spirit Stones!\nForget about the Spirit Stones for now.\nIt was the increased 50% concentration of Yang energy in his body!\nGranted, when Lin Li completed the task, his body felt the same as always, but this time, his judgment was drastically wrong.\nIt’s not that there’s no retribution, just that the time has not yet come.\nWhen Lin Li got up in the morning, retribution came.\nAt that moment, Lin Li stood in the bathroom, bending over in a hurry.\nIs there any shooting game player out there? Online, urgent.\nDamn it.\n\"Who the hell let you feedback Yang energy into my body like this? Couldn’t it be masculine energy, turning me into Mr. Macho?\" Lin Li was somewhat exasperated; he really needed to use the bathroom.\nLooking at the Mr. Macho behind the toilet, Lin Li was even more irritated.\nAt seventeen, he was at the age to wrestle with metal, yet now he was slightly better.\nUsually, after a wash-up, everything would return to normal, but today, even after freshening up, Lin Li was still brimming with excess Yang energy, head held high, refusing to submit.\nLin Li thought, if his thirty-seven-year-old self received such an enhancement, he would probably be delighted, reborn, but right now... Brother, I have too much Yang energy; I really don’t need it now!\nCould you give it to me later? Or have a demoness absorb it for me?\nXiaojing! Sorry!\nHe shouldn’t have joked about her last night.\nOh, maybe standing on my head could solve this problem?\n...\nHandstands couldn’t solve the problem, at least not now, and of course, Lin Li wasn’t about to try it, knowing full well his physical strength couldn’t support it.\nIf the aim was off, that would be it.\nAfter these days of morning exercise, even without Spiritual Qi, Lin Li felt a noticeable improvement in his physical condition, at least no longer a muddled corpse.\nHe’d try again when he became strong in the future.\nAs for how Lin Li finally solved the problem...\nThanks to ZZ’s correctness.\nWho said black wasn’t good? Black is fantastic, better than yellow or white.\nIf Lin Li hadn’t forced himself to stare into the eyes of the live-action ’The Little Mermaid’ main character for ten seconds—or rather, the ’Black Anthropomorphic Catfish’ heroine—with that ten-bucks-right-eye-and-left-eye stare, the steel would’ve been refined, and he immediately felt relieved.\nIf it were a normal leading lady, such a stare would probably have the opposite effect.\nThanks again to ZZ’s correctness, for leaving so much crap in this world that can be eaten at will.\nAs Lin Li stepped into the hallway, he was suddenly troubled.\nHow could he practice with the Spirit Stone?\nThe Spirit Stone wasn’t as big as an egg, but it wasn’t small either. Holding it in his mouth would be conspicuous, not to mention uncomfortable. If he held it in his hand, his fingers could lose their flexibility, making some exercises impossible, and it would look too obvious.\nAs for practicing at home, Lin Li thought about it and decided against it.\nHe had always practiced in the community park, and Lin Li worried that if he moved home, the system might not recognize him. After all, the task description had mentioned ’the rising sun,’ even if it wasn’t required for the task, Lin Li didn’t want to risk it.\nHe had to know that the current task required a consecutive week, and any interruption would waste the previous days.\nShould he continue practicing the first Chapter? But Lin Li couldn’t forget the happiness of last night, and with real cultivation on the horizon, who could resist?\nSo Lin Li began to think of solutions.\nAs everyone knows, Lin Li is a genius.\nThen Lin Li’s old face lightly blushed with rare shyness.\nBelieve it or not, there’s actually a spot perfect for placing the Spirit Stone. Not only does it avoid the need for adhesive assistance, but the position also comes with snug clothing, and honestly, nobody can tell from two to three.\njust do it!\nLin Li put on a pair of loose basketball shorts.\nHe looked down, nodded in satisfaction.\nPlan’s working.\nJust like no one knows if there are beasts hidden beneath the calm sea, no one will know that this potentially egg-laying beast might have a third child brewing inside.\nThe basketball shorts were loose, but Lin Li changed into a brand-new pair of underwear.\nAfter all, underwear tends to become loose after seven or eight wears because of Lin Li’s side-sleeping posture, with one leg habitually stretched straight and the other bent—a wide range of motion.\nWore it another seven or eight times and it would be indescribable again. If left suspended, it would cause great discomfort—especially when around others where adjustments are not feasible.\nSo it was specially changed, because if that happened, the Spirit Stone would fall out.\nLin Li absolutely couldn’t allow that to happen.\nThe image is too beautiful to imagine, and he truly feared misunderstanding.\nIf someone nearby happened to have a remote control, Lin Li’s originally bright life would be ruined.",

      "content": "Chapter 39: Chapter 39 This is Called a Friendship Beyond Age\n\"Good morning, Grandpa Zhou.\" Going down and arriving at the park, Lin Li naturally greeted his exercise buddy, who was practically a fixed NPC.\nAs usual, he received a cold shoulder, with Zhou Youwei merely nodding at Lin Li, but Lin Li didn’t mind.\nOnce a grandson, always a grandson—he’s an old child but doesn’t know any better, why bother fussing?\nMy uncle spoils his dad.\nHowever, today Zhou Youwei seemed a bit different from usual. He should have already been watching Lin Li, scheming about how to secretly learn his techniques, but today he looked gloomy, his mind seemed elsewhere.\nWould a sixty-something still recall their bright moonlight on NetEase Cloud deep into midnight?\nAlthough curious, Lin Li wasn’t idle enough to ask what happened. That would be finding trouble for nothing, so instead, he earnestly began practicing his exercises.\n\"Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!\" But before he could formally start, Zhou Youwei’s voice interrupted him.\nLin Li looked over to see Zhou Youwei pushing his hands towards a stray dog seven or eight meters away, trying to scare it away.\nIn Lin Li’s neighborhood, the annual property fee is only 200 yuan, and although Xiling Town isn’t a big place, the price is considered excessively low.\nIt shows you get what you pay for—the quality of the property management can be gauged from the security guard at the gate, who in Lin Li’s neighborhood, is a rather classic sixty- or seventy-something with sparse white hair, wears glasses, enjoys drinking tea, reading newspapers, and listening to the radio, and is slightly hard of hearing.\nIf you ask him if he knows Ma Dongmei, he’d genuinely reply, \"Who’s Dongmei?\"\nIf Lin Li asked him to open the gate barrier, he’d say, \"Thank you, young man, but Grandpa can’t eat fried chicken.\"\nLin Li pointed to the jujube tree in the neighborhood, saying he wanted to climb up to pick dates, and the guard replied he was thinking about a lady from Shandong, suggesting Lin Li take care.\nEvery time Lin Li came back, he could hear dialect opera from the security booth, or sometimes there was simply no one there.\nIf you asked respectful resident Lin Li what the security booth was actually for, he could only scratch his head for a while and then reply it was for setting up the transition, introducing the next topic, expressing the author’s homesickness.\n—Useless.\nSuch property management naturally wouldn’t care about stray cats and dogs. The daily maintenance of the neighborhood park mostly relied on enthusiastic and idle elderly folks, who seemed to have an unofficial committee, though Lin Li wasn’t sure about the specifics.\nHe wasn’t old enough to join.\nHe’d need to undergo at least forty-three years of tests of the organization.\nNo, since the retirement age is 65, make that forty-eight years.\nLin Li looked at Xiaozhou.\nIt was strange, Xiaozhou usually wasn’t so hostile toward stray dogs, why was he acting differently today?\nWas he annoyed by the stray dog, or was he in a bad mood and taking it out on the dog?\nGood thing it was a stray dog he was driving away; if it had been a stray cat and someone filmed it to post online, they’d experience what it’s like to face the world’s malice. After all, on Douyin, cats are top-level protected animals.\nCats and dogs are quite cute. Lin Li liked them too, but in his heart, no matter how cute they were, they were still categorized as animals like Bai Bufan. They could be favored over other animals because of liking, but they should never be placed above ordinary, normal people.\nRecollecting his thoughts, taking a deep breath, Lin Li officially began his exercises.\nWow, it feels great.\nLin Li, who usually spent every morning in agony, smiled genuinely for the first time today.\nIt felt like being surrounded by multiple Xiaojings—supporting him.\nForgot that his Yang energy concentration was 50% higher than before, making his body more sensitive.\nHe shouldn’t imagine such stimulating images.\nIt didn’t hinder the practice but could be easily noticed by others.\nThat could lead to a horrible misunderstanding.\nTherefore, when Zhou Youwei finished chasing away the dog and turned to see Lin Li suddenly stop his movements and sit on a stone bench pondering, he was puzzled.\nWhat’s this kid doing?\nPlaying statue here in the morning?\nIf he got a bit closer, he would hear Lin Li muttering:\n\"Black anthropomorphic catfish I love you, Black anthropomorphic catfish I love you...\"\n...\nHalf an hour passed. For the first time, serious practice didn’t make him tired. On the contrary, Lin Li felt energetic, took a deep breath, and showed a satisfied smile.\nThe reason for stopping now was that the Spirit Stone was out of Spiritual Qi.\nAs expected, practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique—Spiritual Qi Chapter, consumed about two low-grade Spirit Stones per hour.\nGreat, that means he only had medicine for two and a half days in his hands.\nTo be exact, he could only enjoy two more hours.\nLin Li sighed deeply, then stood up and left—\nLin Li headed for the toilet.\nIt seemed there were footsteps behind him. Turning around, Lin Li saw Zhou Youwei, who no longer looked gloomy and was excitedly holding a phone. As he followed Lin Li, they made eye contact, and he suddenly turned to seriously admire the trees nearby, saying, \"This tree surely is one big tree.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li walked for another ten seconds and heard footsteps, turning back again.\n\"This flower is really a flower.\"\nLin Li walked for another minute and turned back again. This time he heard no exclamations, yet he spoke somewhat helplessly, \"Grandpa Zhou, I see you, stop squatting.\"\n\"This dog poop is really dog... Oh, why is there always damn dog poop! One day, I’ll drive all the stray dogs out of this neighborhood!\" Zhou Youwei stood up with a burst, grumbling.\nPlaying games, watching anime, this fashionable old man wasn’t having an easy time in his later years either.\n\"Stray dogs leaving waste all around is indeed annoying,\" Lin Li first agreed and then curiously asked, \"Grandpa Zhou, why are you following me?\"\n\"Who’s following you, I’m just going to the toilet,\" Zhou Youwei widened his eyes, retorting.\n\"Then why aren’t you walking faster?\" Lin Li nodded, not doubting him, since they were indeed heading to the public toilet, he just asked again.\n\"Isn’t it normal for older people to walk slower?\"\nZhou Youwei wasn’t good at lying.\nSomething was off.\nLin Li squinted his eyes.\nGeniuses can always quickly dig into the truth.\n—A grown-up but afraid to go alone to the public toilet in the small forest?\nYet this assumption was too outrageous. The neighborhood’s public toilet was indeed a bit remote and the environment slightly poor, but it was broad daylight; even ghosts would be off work by then.\n\"Grandpa, are you afraid of ghosts?\" Therefore, Lin Li still asked once.\n\"Afraid of ghosts? I fear the ghost, but the ghost hasn’t harmed me! I’m not afraid of people, but people have hurt me all over!\" Zhou Youwei waved his sleeve, sarcastically mocking Lin Li.\nOK.\nEars automatically filtered, Lin Li only heard \"I’m afraid of ghosts.\"\nAs expected of a genius, I guessed correctly again.\nJust timid.\nIf he’s afraid, he’s afraid, why say so much, why are Xiaozhou and Old Jian both so stubborn.\nPerhaps people get more superstitious as they age.\nFollowing the principle of respecting the elderly and caring for the young, Lin Li chose not to expose him and headed to the toilet, entered a cubicle, opened the capsule, and swiftly swapped out an egg.\nThe Spirit Stone without Spiritual Qi became extremely light and couldn’t be stored back in the [warehouse]. It looked like a plastic shell, but for safety’s sake, Lin Li decided to take it home.\nWhen exiting the toilet entrance, because he lagged behind significantly, Zhou Youwei had just entered.\nBut seeing Lin Li was about to leave, Zhou Youwei suddenly changed direction.\nLin Li chuckled lightly and sighed, without waiting for him to say anything, gently saying, \"Grandpa Zhou, go use the restroom, I’ll wait here, won’t move, and I’ll definitely be here when you come out.\"\nHe could understand Grandpa Zhou’s actions because if Lin Li left, Grandpa Zhou would undoubtedly lose courage again.\nUpon hearing this, Zhou Youwei gritted his teeth. He, too, understood Lin Li’s actions.\nIf he couldn’t see it now, he’d be a fool: Lin Li clearly already knew he was being followed but intentionally confirmed it, showing he didn’t plan on doing anything bad and was also mocking him.\nHe shouldn’t have been so reckless to follow him.\nNo, now that he thought about it, being able to easily find out today, perhaps this cunning kid already knew about his presence yesterday, merely pretending not to know, and just now mentioning stray dogs might have been an implication of this, too?\nWhat a devious plan.\nZhou Youwei went into the toilet, bowing his head somewhat unwillingly.\nThis round of battle, he lost, lost thoroughly.\nObserving this, Lin Li smiled gently, believing Grandpa Zhou realized his good intention, thus entered the restroom feeling a bit shy.\nAnother day of doing a good deed.\nSoon after, Zhou Youwei emerged from the toilet with his head held high again.\nHe suddenly realized something: he hadn’t lost.\nHis aim was to protect the rest of the community from Lin Li’s harm, and had he not achieved that? Lin Li could do nothing!\nThus, he smiled proudly at Lin Li.\nLin Li returned a bright smile.\nThis was the Grandpa he was familiar with.\nThe joy of having solved a pee-related problem, Lin Li totally understood, bathed in that happiness for a whole minute this morning, a shared feeling!",

(4/7)]\nFeeling refreshed, Lin Li stretched lazily, and for the first time felt this spirited at this hour.\nMoreover, the practice was going faster than expected. Five spirit stones might just support him through the second Chapter, allowing his body to better adapt to Spiritual Qi.\nSpeaking of the changes brought by Spiritual Qi after entering his body, Lin Li felt as if all his organs were becoming healthier.\nHis mild rhinitis, which used to have a bit of a stuffy feeling, was now completely clear.\nSpiritual Qi was truly miraculous, easily achieving what physical training could not.\nHe was even more excited about the future.\n\"Grandpa Zhou, I’m off.\" Lin Li waved goodbye as usual.\n\"Hmph!\"\nWatching Lin Li leave, although he could comfort himself with the reason that he was protecting others in the community, Zhou Youwei still felt a bit upset.\nEspecially since Lin Li didn’t hide his smugness and deliberately showed off in front of him.\nAs for how Zhou Youwei could tell, it was quite simple, because Lin Li hadn’t really trained today.\nWho smiles while training and practicing martial arts, and doesn’t even break a sweat after over an hour?\nThe cultivation techniques Lin Li had been practicing, Zhou Youwei might not know what they were, but he could understand and feel that those actions were meaningful.\nSometimes after Lin Li left, Zhou Youwei would curiously mimic a few moves himself and could feel that these moves had a martial arts foundation, appearing quite advanced with a unique logic.\nIf not for the irreconcilable enmity between them, already making them enemies, Zhou Youwei might have been curious enough to ask what on earth those martial arts were.\nAnd today?\nLin Li was there as if he were doing a ballroom dance or wiggling his hips, with a bizarre smile and expression on his face.\nIf Lin Li hadn’t been so infuriating, claiming he had just absorbed something in the morning, Zhou Youwei might have believed it.\nThe most humiliating part was when Lin Li occasionally turned his body to face Zhou Youwei with his rear, doing it so deliberately that if it wasn’t mockery, Zhou Youwei would eat yesterday’s dog poop!\n\"Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west, don’t bully an old poor man! The shame of today, I will surely repay!\" Zhou Youwei growled at the departing Lin Li.\nAfter a while, he chuckled, \"Shouting like that really is satisfying. No wonder my good grandson always loves shouting those lines. I’ll sneak into his room later to read one of his novels.\"\n\"Ouch~~\"\nHearing the sound, Zhou Youwei swiftly turned his head.\nThen he saw Zhang Fang crouching in the bushes, exactly where he had been yesterday, and was momentarily stunned before mechanically asking, \"Old Zhang, why are you crouching here?\"\nAre you also here to, um, relieve yourself?\nNo, why did I use ’also’?\nZhang Fang lifted the shovel and black bag in his hand, \"To avoid the same misunderstanding from last time. Since the property management won’t handle it, I thought I’d take care of the cat and dog poop, I’m free anyway.\"\nHe then rubbed his own back, \"Still, I have to admit I’m getting old. Squatting like this and my back’s already aching. Old Zhou, you’re impressive, so spry at your age.\"\n\"Since when were you here?\" Zhou Youwei asked seriously.\n\"About thirty years ago, I guess.\"\nZhou Youwei: \"...\"\n\"But seriously, Old Zhou, thirty years is a bit much. Us old folks are truly a bit poor. Even if you’re spry, it wouldn’t look good if you died, right? How ’bout we say three years?\" Zhang Fang continued, curious, \"By the way, whose shame are you going to repay? Lost a game of cards last night?\"\n\"No, no, I’ll head back now.\" Zhou Youwei got up, today wasn’t the best day for exercising.\n\"Going to read your good grandson’s novel, Old Zhou?\" Zhang Fang asked with more curiosity.\nZhou Youwei’s pace quickened.\nToday he didn’t pull a muscle, but why did it feel worse than previous days?\n...\nWhen Lin Li arrived at the classroom, Bai Bufan was again immersed in classic storytelling from unofficial history:\n\"According to unofficial history, back then, when Liu Xuande entrusted Zhuge Kongming with his son at Baidi City, he had three hundred ax-wielding guards lying in ambush. Liu Xuande had plans in mind. If Zhuge Kongming ever had the slightest thought of breaking away and founding his own domain, he’d immediately raise the cup as a signal! The three hundred guards would storm in wildly waving their axes until Liu Chan was chopped into a meat paste!\"\n\"This unofficial history is... wait, is it Liu Chan being chopped? Well, that doesn’t sound too offbeat after all!\"\n\"Isn’t wild enough? Alright, let’s go wilder. Do you know why Cao Mengde kept his humble history of boiling wine for Liu Xuande?\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"According to unofficial history, when Liu Xuande picked up his chopsticks, he casually touched Cao Mengde’s jade-like feet. Mengde let out an ’eek!’ sound and went all soft, next...\"\n\"What hogwash are you spouting! Goddamn it, eek-eek literature!\"\n\"Ding! I just heard ’shade’, were you talking about dead water? Is dead water shady?\"\nBai Bufan really loved the Three Kingdoms.\nBut his affection is a bit skewed.\nLin Li liked it too, out of the four classic novels, his favorite was the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. He read the 120-Chapter version several times as a kid, it’s truly captivating.\nShu Han has the romance of Shu Han, Wei has the ethos of Wei, and Jiangdong has the rogues of Jiangdong.\n—though geographically, Lin Li counts as a descendant of the rogues.\nBecause he loves the Three Kingdoms, and loves everything about it, Lin Li also gave good ratings to the game Three Kingdoms Kill.\n\"Kids, come get your food.\"\nLin Li started hanging his backpack on the chair back, then turned to look at the writing on the blackboard, preparing for the homework to collect later.\n\"Why is there another one here, did someone not take theirs or is it yours?\" Bai Bufan was eating soupy dish with a bun, and asked out of curiosity while glancing at the breakfast on Lin Li’s desk.\n\"Oh, that’s for Chen Yu Ying, you can give it to her for me.\" Lin Li glanced at it and said, it was mentioned by Chen Yu Ying yesterday at noon.\n\"Why should I deliver it? Are you using me as your Viagra, adding excitement? Am I part of your play? I’m not going; you deliver it yourself.\" Bai Bufan rolled his eyes.\n\"They say rough words but come with logic, but yours are too rough indeed. I’m actually using you as a cover though.\" Lin Li laughed as he continued placing his notebooks on the desk one by one.\n\"Of all people, you have no right to say my words are rough!\"\nLin Li picked up the breakfast and went to the third row, near the entrance, where Chen Yu Ying sat, and placed it on her desk: \"Hey, here’s your breakfast.\"\nThe gazes around naturally focused on Lin Li.\nNot because everyone liked Chen Yu Ying, but merely out of habit when there’s some noise, they look.\nHalf of them immediately shifted their gazes away, uninterested.\nThe other half, realizing it was Chen Yu Ying and Lin Li—who usually didn’t appear in the front rows—continued watching, hoping for some juicy drama to spice up their dull high school life.\nLin Li used to feel awkward under such gazes, but perhaps thanks to the system, he now felt indifferent, even appearing natural.\nIt can’t be just because his skin got thicker.\n\"Alright, thanks, here’s your money.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded and took a ten-yuan note from her drawer.\n\"Okay, I’ll give you five in change...\"\n[In this completely unfamiliar world, Chen Yu Ying, the first person you’ve interacted with, finally couldn’t resist and made a monetary transaction with you, feeling very satisfied with your service, bringing your relationship a step further.\nTo establish yourself in this unknown and perilous world, you need to know more. Why not start with the one person here you know best—her.]\n[Mission Triggered!]\n[Mission Five: Have more interactions with Chen Yu Ying, try to learn more about this world from her, and gain a basic understanding of this world.]\n[Rewards: Physical Improvement: Mecha Synchronization Index +10; Random Limbs, Organs Enhancement Opportunity *1; System Currency *50.]\n[Random Limbs, Organs Enhancement Opportunity: Upon use, a random limb or organ in your body will gain a certain ability boost, with a high probability of acquiring additional mutation capabilities.

      "content": "Chapter 41: Chapter 41 Feiyangyang, you’re so annoying!\nNo, dude.\nWhat do you mean by a monetary transaction, and what do you mean by being satisfied with my services? Don’t say things that are hard to understand.\nWait a minute.\nDon’t let your mind wander anymore. It’s more important to focus on serious matters, like someone who’s equivalent to 1.5 men.\nLin Li focused on the reward, naturally ignoring the two useless parts, and instead looked at the [Random Limb, Organ Enhancement Opportunity].\nSeeing the words in parentheses, Lin Li didn’t know whether to be happy or not.\nTo be honest, his first reaction to seeing this reward was to worry that this abstract system, claiming to be random, might end up giving him that location.\nTurns out the system preemptively judged his judgment.\nYou can remove it from the prize pool.\nBut.\nOn the other hand.\nLin Li felt a bit embarrassed—he thought for a moment and didn’t really want to take it out of the random pool. How about just keeping it?\nHehe.\nHowever, it’s still too early to consider the rewards, as the completion of this task doesn’t have specific criteria, and the system has given him a progress bar similar to an accumulating time task, currently at zero.\n\"Lin Li, money? Why are you zoning out again!\" Seeing Lin Li’s vacant gaze, Chen Yu Ying stood up and waved a note in front of him.\nLin Li snapped back to reality, quietly pressing the bill back into his pocket with his right hand, shaking his head: \"Class President, I don’t have any change.\"\nChen Yu Ying’s deskmate, Ding Sihan, blinked. Being closer to Lin Li than Chen Yu Ying, she asked, \"What was that five yuan note you just pulled out from your pocket?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou sharp-eyed devil.\nLin Li cursed Ding Sihan twice in his mind, calling her a puppy.\n\"It’s counterfeit money.\" Fortunately, he’s already thick-skinned, so Lin Li remained expressionless.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Is it that sniper god Jia Bi from Marley?\" Wang Ze, who was eating the breakfast Lin Li brought, turned back and chimed in.\nIn general, the front rows are filled with obedient or honest, or simply short students. Wang Ze isn’t short, so he shouldn’t be in this area.\nBut two positions are exceptions, right beside the lecture desk on both sides, known as the Guardians’ seats in the class. Wang Ze is the Right Guardian.\nLin Li ignored him and continued looking at Chen Yu Ying. He actually wanted to find an excuse to bring breakfast again tomorrow. After all, that’s the most frequent interaction between the two.\nHowever, after thinking for a while and now being exposed, Lin Li thought he had a better idea for completing the task.\nSo Lin Li pushed Chen Yu Ying’s money back and naturally said, \"Class President, I’ll be honest, my real intention is not to take your money. I’ve been trying to study seriously recently, but there are still many things I only have a half-understanding of, especially in geography, so I need some tutoring.\nThe Class President is quite versatile, so I wanted to ask if you could tutor me. The breakfast money is my tutoring fee!\"\nLin Li’s recent seriousness is something the whole class is aware of. Many of the boys in the back have tried exorcism rituals on Lin Li, but they have all failed. The students in the front can perceive it from Lin Li’s responses in class and the occasional praise from the teacher.\nExcept for English class.\nIt’s become a tradition for Koukou to call on Lin Li every time.\nTo get more information about this world from Chen Yu Ying.\nGeography is supposed to be his best subject.\nLin Li also wanted to mention history, but asking others to tutor him in history seemed a bit far-fetched.\nThe current curriculum only requires rote memorization.\nIf the geography system doesn’t respond, he can adjust based on this feedback.\nIn any case, getting her over here first is the most appropriate step.\nChen Yu Ying blinked upon hearing this, her hand holding the money lowering a few centimeters as she gently said, \"I can tutor you; just ask if you have any questions, but how can I accept money for this? It’s okay, keep the money.\"\n\"Describing it as a tutoring fee was inappropriate; it should be a token of appreciation for your help, so I’ll treat you to breakfast.\nClass President, I have many questions, and some of them might even seem ridiculous to someone as good as you, and it will take up a lot of your time, so treating you to breakfast is quite normal. Is that alright now?\"\n\"Alright then.\" Chen Yu Ying smiled, nodded, and then suggested, \"Anyway, Lin Li, you can only stay in the classroom at noon. I usually come to the classroom at noon too, so if there’s anything you don’t understand, you can ask me at noon today?\"\n\"That’s exactly what I wanted to say.\" Lin Li nodded heavily.\n\"Lin Li, let me tutor you. My grades are about the same as Chen Yu Ying’s, and I’m in the classroom every day at noon.\" A zealous classmate, Wang Yuezhi, stood up with a biting smile, extending a helping hand to Lin Li.\nHow could Wang Yuezhi tolerate such a thing happening!\nBy getting involved, not only could he thwart Lin Li’s disgusting plan, but also enhance his image as a helpful person. Why not?\nFaced with Wang Yuezhi’s kind smile, Lin Li responded with an equally kind smile:\n\"Who the hell are you?\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\nThe surrounding area burst into quiet laughter, except for Wang Ze.\nBecause he was laughing extremely loudly.\n\"Hahahahaha, this is too much, hahahahaha!\"\nThe corridors could probably hear him. Lin Li suspected he even spat out his breakfast, lucky there was no one sitting in front of him.\nThe joys and sorrows of people do not connect.\nAs the person involved, Wang Yuezhi’s face turned into an \"uzi\" in three seconds.\n\"You’re swearing, you have no manners!\" He shouted in anger, pointing at Lin Li.\n\"I can’t help it, all my manners were eaten by Wang Ze.\" Bai Bufan, sitting at a distance, had to take the blame meant for a dog, which now had to be shouldered by Wang Ze.\nLaughing hard, Wang Ze took a moment to flash the middle finger.\nSwearing in front of girls generally lowers likability, but first, Lin Li wasn’t addressing Chen Yu Ying, and second, he wasn’t pursuing romance with her; as long as she didn’t change her decision to tutor him, that’s enough.\nOf course, not being disliked would be even better, and furthermore, after talking yesterday at noon, Lin Li believed Chen Yu Ying isn’t the type to be offended by these kinds of things.\nLastly, Lin Li indeed lacked manners, Wang Yuezhi was spot on.\nLin Li tilted his head slightly and saw Chen Yu Ying struggling to hold back laughter, feeling slightly relieved.\n\"Men and women shouldn’t be so close, you might make the Class President uncomfortable. I’m a boy, wouldn’t tutoring from me be better?\" Wang Yuezhi loudly protested.\n\"Are you stuck in the past? In this day and age, spending time together doesn’t ruin reputations. Seriously, dude, I’m asking the Class President for study help, not trying to date her! A boy-girl team makes the work less tiring!\" Lin Li rolled his eyes and said.\n\"You have ulterior motives for the Class President!\" Wang Yuezhi continued to argue nonsensically.\n\"Since it’s come to this, I won’t hide it from everyone; I’m actually GAY. Everyone who knows me in the class already knows this. Wang Ze, back me up!\" Lin Li smiled, looking at Wang Ze.\n\"That’s right, Lin Li is really GAY.\" Wang Ze nodded emphatically.\n\"Absolutely true! He really is! I went to his house last week to hang out, suddenly lost consciousness, and when I woke up, Lin Li was super happy while my butt hurt till today.\" Bai Bufan’s head peeked sneakily from the front door, giving a thumbs-up in agreement.\n—He had been munching on snacks at the door ever since Wang Ze started laughing earlier; now that his good buddy needed backup, when else if not now to make an entrance!\n\"Did you hear that, Wang Yuezhi? If you tutor me, that’s when I’d start having thoughts, all about you. Wang Yuezhi, you wouldn’t want a backside like Bai Bufan’s, right?\" Lin Li said with a cheerful smile.\nLin Li’s voice was quite loud, and almost everyone in the class was laughing.\nWhy say almost?\nBecause Wang Yuezhi wasn’t laughing.\nSo out of sync.",

Now you can rest assured that I have no covetous intentions towards you. In fact, if you don’t mind, I could be your best girlfriend, replacing Ding Sihan.\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nDing Sihan stood up, pointing to her seat and said, \"You can have my seat right now.\"\n\"Huh? Thanks! My seat is at the last row by the window. Let’s start moving now. Bai Bufan, get over here and help your new desk mate!\" Lin Li was overjoyed at this stroke of good luck.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"No, are you really sitting there? I’ve changed my mind!\" Ding Sihan’s eyes widened as she saw Lin Li really planning to sit down, and she plopped back down into her chair, holding onto her desk tightly.\n\"Ahem ahem!\" Bai Bufan, who had just retracted his head that had been listening in, stuck it out again, \"Lin Li, even though you’re my bro, if you become such a scumbag as a male bestie, you deserve to die, y’know.\"\nAs for the part with Ding Sihan, Bai Bufan outright ignored it. Alone in front of girls, he turns into a social phobia type.\nIf he had to bring breakfast, he’d probably stutter just to say \"thank you.\"\nAs for why the person delivering breakfast says thank you instead of \"you’re welcome,\" that’s something Bai Bufan might do when he’s nervous.\nAnd as for Lin Li’s conversation partner, Chen Yu Ying, she was now a bit embarrassed, her head lowered, her face possibly a bit red, not saying a word.\nActually, there’s no need to speak; anyone could see Lin Li was joking.\nAs to whether people might think Lin Li actually likes Chen Yu Ying, well, that’s a different story.\nChen Yu Ying herself might even think in that direction.\n\"Do you have anything to say? Now we can all relax.\" Lin Li turned to Wang Yuezhi again, but before he could answer, Lin Li had a sudden realization and said to himself, \"Wait, why would I put you at ease? I’m asking the class president for help, and it’s enough if she agrees.\nStill, for you, I’m willing to start from today without cursing.\"\nThen he turned his head away, ignoring him.\nWang Yuezhi’s face turned red, it would have been better if Lin Li cursed him instead: \"I’ll tell the teacher!\"\nLin Li didn’t pay him any mind and confirmed with Chen Yu Ying, \"Class President, shall we say that’s settled?\"\nFine, tell the teacher then. In the teachers’ eyes, I’m a return-to-the-fold prodigal, plus I just spent a crazy night with Xue Jian.\nChen Yu Ying nodded.\nSo Lin Li walked to his seat at the back row, while Wang Yuezhi, full of unwillingness and anger, also sat back in his seat, grabbing his hair and gritting his teeth.\nHis seatmate quickly straightened his expression to comfort Wang Yuezhi, preparing to curse Lin Li together.\n\"Yuezhi, you...\" The seatmate suddenly stopped talking and glanced at the aisle next to Wang Yuezhi.\n\"What’s up?\" Wang Yuezhi turned his head as well.\n\"Hehe, are you mad~~\" But before he could, Wang Yuezhi heard someone say these words close to his ear, quite smugly.\nWho else but Lin Li.\nWhen Wang Yuezhi turned to curse him, he only saw Lin Li’s departing figure.\nMake people nauseous and then run away.\nWang Yuezhi turned red once more.\n\"You—\"\nWas about to curse but realized cursing would just come back to bite him, so he forced it down.\n\"—You’re so annoying!\"\nSuch minor force, like a coquettish spat between lovers, Lin Li was utterly pleased, even turning around and making a flamboyant gesture.\nHis life’s motto was quite simple.\nIf someone doesn’t mess with me, I—I might unintentionally mess with them occasionally; but if someone does mess with me, I must return the favor.\nMessing with someone and then running, oh the joy!\nThis time, it was obvious Wang Yuezhi was the one deliberately targeting him, he was the one who started it.\nBack at his seat, Bai Bufan and the others immediately crowded around to ask what had just happened.\nSo Lin Li recounted the parts they missed.\nSince they had already performed several exorcism missions on Lin Li, they didn’t doubt his intent was purely academic, but Bai Bufan frowned and asked, \"Is your ulterior motive really about studying?\"\n\"I’m decent at geography too, if you’d like me to tutor you?\" Even good students play around, and some of the best players Lin Li knew were good at studying.\n\"Getting tutored by guys makes me cough.\" Of course, Lin Li declined.\n\"You scoundrel.\" Everyone chuckled and left, breakfast not even finished.\nZhou Baowei, however, didn’t leave.\n\"What’s up?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"I just dropped off my breakfast to find you, turns out you were up front flirting.\" Zhou Baowei said.\n\"What’s the matter?\"\n\"The organization has tasked you with retrieving a batch of goods, a very important batch.\" Zhou Baowei lowered his voice conspiratorially, like a clandestine meeting.\n\"What’s the code?\" Lin Li knowingly lowered his voice to ask.\n\"Here it is,\" Zhou Baowei handed Lin Li a piece of paper, \"Read and destroy afterwards.\"\n[Nansang Star Stationery Store Newbie Collection Point 8-4-2663]\n\"Got it, mission accepted, I’ll get it to you by noon.\" Lin Li nodded, stuffing the note into his pocket.\n\"Remember to keep it confidential, make sure the packaging is not damaged, dinner’s on me.\" Zhou Baowei cautiously advised.\nLin Li narrowed his eyes, giving Zhou Baowei a meaningful look.\nZhou Baowei returned the look in kind.\nThey connected telepathically.\nLin Li suddenly began to sing:\n\"If my brother guides once, I’ll guide twice!\"\n\"If my brother guides twice, I’ll guide four times!\" Zhou Baowei followed with the lyrics immediately, adjusting his non-existent glasses like Sakamoto, and pointed at Lin Li.\nThe lyrics may be bizarre, but this song does exist, and it’s called \"Spring Breeze Elf.\"\n\"If my brother guides four times, I’ll guide eight times!\" Bai Bufan chimed in with a line.\n\"If my brother guides eight times, I’ll guide sixteen times!\" Zhou Baowei sang again, then pointed both hands towards Lin Li, passing the climax of the song to him.\nBut Lin Li hesitated to take over, and even Bai Bufan didn’t sing.\nLooks like they wanted to leave the biggest stage for him.\nGood brothers.\nWhen it comes to singing, he really had some talent.\nNo other choice, Zhou Baowei cleared his throat and passionately sang: \"Me and my brother share one shell of Northern Clam~~ My brother’s sweat drips on my back~~\"\n\"Me and my...\"\n\"Baowei, could you step aside, you’re blocking the class president.\" Lin Li said, holding back a smile.\n\"Yes, Baowei.\" Bai Bufan laughed out loud again, nodding in agreement.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nHe mechanically turned his head, and Chen Yu Ying was standing there, a bit lost.\n\"Lin Li, you seem to have forgotten to get me chopsticks, do you have any...\" she asked weakly.\n\"Oh, right, here they are, class president, for you, sorry about that.\" Lin Li realized, handing the disposable chopsticks to Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Okay, thanks.\"\nA pale-faced Zhou Baowei stood by, mumbling something inaudibly, seemingly praying.\n\"What do I do, save me! What do I do, save me!\"—that’s the message in his look towards Lin Li.\n\"I’ll save you.\"—that’s Lin Li’s return look.\n\"Please!\"—Zhou Baowei was so grateful he almost cried.\n\"Class President!\"\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"You didn’t hear Zhou Baowei’s Northern Clam song just now, did you?\" Lin Li asked loudly.\nStunned for a moment, Chen Yu Ying shook her head like a rattle, then quickly walked away.\n\"Now you can relax, the class president said she didn’t hear it.\" Lin Li smiled and assured Zhou Baowei.\n\"...\"\nRelax? Yeah, he’s not just relaxed; he’s dead.\n\"You two planned this, didn’t you? Lin Li, I’m gonna kill you! Bai Bufan, don’t stop me!\" Zhou Baowei’s face contorted.\nBai Bufan nodded, indicating Zhou Baowei should just go for it, just do it.\n\"Then no one’s getting your package.\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"I just remembered I’ve got something to do at noon, so I shouldn’t leave school.\"\n\"Oh man, you’re right, I won’t kill you.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 43: Chapter 43: Good, Very Spirited\n\"A person experiences three deaths in their lifetime. I’ve skipped biological death and fast-forwarded to sociological death. Lin Li, if I jump right now and you see my eyes wide open, not closed, what would you think?\"\nZhou Baowei leaned against the window, gazing outside at the ground, which increasingly resembled a cozy bed that he wished he could lie on immediately.\n\"I’d think about whether I should watch the latest movie ’Bureau 947’ this afternoon.\"\n\"Aren’t we having class this afternoon?\" Zhou Baowei was puzzled.\n\"If you jump, there’s no class for you,\" Bai Bufan chimed in, questioning in a tone that suggested Zhou had asked a stupid question, and then looked at Lin Li, \"Let’s go to the cinema then. But I want to watch ’Undersea Fortress’.\"\n\"Is it really set underwater? If it is, I have to watch it too.\"\n\"You guys, you guys...\" Zhou Baowei was so moved by his friends that he was speechless.\nThey were indeed good friends. He hadn’t even jumped yet, and they were already planning his last rites—if those rites were for him, Zhou would be even more touched.\nZhou Baowei returned to his seat, listless and a bit desperate.\nThinking about his completely tarnished image in the class monitor’s eyes, which might spread to every girl’s ears in the class through late-night dorm chats, left Zhou Baowei utterly hopeless.\nHe hoped that the girls’ dorm chats would, like the boys’, eventually drift toward world affairs and national worries, instead of fixating on him.\n\"My reputation is ruined.\"\n\"Relax, maybe the class monitor didn’t even remember a minor character like you. To her, it was just a joke that went in one ear and out the other,\" Bai Bufan consoled.\n\"...\"\nThat seemed even worse than having his reputation ruined.\n\"I’m done with being abstract; no one gets my humor, but some really think I’m a fool who cries ’boohoo’...\" Zhou Baowei decisively resolved.\n\"What about Genshin?\" Hearing this, Lin Li reclined, looking over Bai Bufan with concern.\n\"ACTIVATE!!!!\" Zhou Baowei reflexively sat up, using all his strength to draw out the words.\nLin Li sighed in relief.\nThank goodness, he almost got this kid onto the right track in life. After all, people who don’t indulge in the abstract have figured it out for life; it seems Zhou Baowei was just talking.\nThe abstract isn’t easy to quit; addicts long for another hit every moment.\nLin Li glanced at the progress bar of task five; it was still moving since he did talk to the class monitor a bit, though minimally, it was negligible.\n\"Lin Li, how’s it going?\" Bai Bufan asked when there were only the two of them left.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"The plan to sabotage the Gentle Harbor of Single Men in Xiling Town.\"\n\"Oh, that. It’s at zero progress.\"\n\"How can you be so useless? I thought you had connections. I’ve got some leads on my side,\" Bai Bufan said disdainfully.\n\"You? If you have connections, I’ll write my name backwards from today,\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"Can you write it backwards?\"\n\"No, what’s right is right,\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"I really do. Last night, I tried scrolling through short videos in the local section, and I messaged those whose stylistic accounts looked off. Many replied. Could they be our targets?\" Bai Bufan spoke while sipping soup.\nLin Li raised his eyebrows; he hadn’t thought of Bai Bufan’s approach.\nBut he soon thought of the issue.\nThe task described required dismantling the Hehuan Demon’s stronghold.\nEven if these influencers are in that business, perhaps they’re freelancers? Loose cultivators who haven’t joined a sect but stole the Hehuan Technique?\nThis might not complete the task.\nBut maybe there’s a madam among them.\nHe could trace it back to their stronghold?\nWith that in mind, Lin Li nodded, \"Maybe, but I need to see the specifics.\"\n\"All right, but I didn’t bring my phone. Can you come to our dorm at noon to check? I can’t wait to fish for law enforcement,\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nHaving had the potential of a fishing enthusiast since childhood, this life was set; if it succeeds, Lin Li would gift him a pair of Air Force 1s, well, the Putian version.\n\"Okay.\" Lin Li nodded. Although he had tutoring with Chen Yu Ying at noon, it was actually during the official lunch break, and he didn’t have a spot in the dorm, so as soon as the lunch break bell rang, he could return to the classroom and find the class monitor.\n...\nThe bell for the end of the fifth class rang.\nPeople flitted outside the window, running fast as if they’d miss a meal if they were late.\n—Indeed.\nThough they wouldn’t miss a meal, waiting in line might take more than ten minutes.\nPrompted by someone to share twenty minutes of his college stories, the English teacher had many class topics yet to cover during this session.\nYet, facing the eager looks out the window and their implied prompting when looking back at him, the young and soft-hearted Koukou reluctantly put down the textbook and waved his hand, \"Class dismissed.\"\nIt was like a scene of monkeys scattering when the tree fell.\n\"Goodbye, Mr. Koukou.\" Being a distinguished off-campus student today, Lin Li naturally didn’t need to rush like others and leisurely headed towards the main entrance, greeting Koukou as he left.\n\"Lin Li, I’m glad you absorbed the teacher’s words. Very diligent today,\" Koukou said upon seeing Lin Li.\nLin Li finally seemed spirited today.\n\"Teacher, it’s what I should do.\"\nDue to today’s repaired Spiritual Qi Chapter, Lin Li was in high spirits and not at all drowsy.\nToo bad he could only keep this up for another two days, or rather one, as he’d only have one spirit stone left the day after tomorrow, and could only practice the normal Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique for half an hour thereafter.\n\"I wasn’t done speaking.\" Koukou laughed.\n\"Please continue praising.\" Seeing Koukou smile, Lin Li also smiled, as comfortable as a spring breeze.\n\"But can you apply this diligence to the English course instead of just the teacher’s stories?\" Koukou’s smile was of exasperation.\nThis darn kid.\nWas he attentive when she was teaching course content?\nYes.\nBut.\nPreviously, he sat lethargically with Bai Bufan during class, sniggering.\nToday, he was engaged and sniggering with Bai Bufan during class.\n—So he he’d laughed even louder.\nSo there was that, at least after she scolded him, he genuinely paid attention.\nBut he was somewhat distracted.\nYet whenever she began discussing things outside the textbook, her experiences or stories, he immediately became the perfect comedic partner, never letting her words falter, fully valuing her emotional guidance, with eyes that sparkled.\nAnd every time her story neared its end, this kid would astutely ask a question, often one she also wanted to share with others, extending the extracurricular segment.\nBefuddling her into talking much longer.\nHalf a lesson, a whole half a lesson.\nUsually, she’d only indulge in five minutes of personal anecdotes!\nIf only this kid could use these conversational skills during her normal teaching, how fulfilling a lesson it would be!\nHearing this, Lin Li blinked in honest surprise.\n\"Are you this attentive in other classes too? Don’t they say you accurately answer teaching questions?\" Koukou couldn’t help but ask.\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"I’ll ask other teachers once I’m back in the office.\"\n\"In that case, no.\"\nKoukou: \"...\"\nTurns out what she longed for was the daily affair of other teachers.\n\"Why... why... why...\"\nYour friend \"Koukou (Resigned Spirit Exclusive)\" has come online again.",

      "content": "Chapter 44: Chapter 44: Bai Bufan, Poet of the Wanquan Division\nEmbracing the Japanese spirit of \"bow sauce\" and making grand promises like a mature man, Lin Li awkwardly ran out of the haunted classroom of Grade 10, Class 4.\nThis noon, he planned to eat Lanzhou beef ramen.\nAs soon as he walked in, it was indeed the same familiar setup.\nKids doing homework, a man rolling dough with the traditional hat, a woman with a headscarf moonlighting as a waitress, speaking an incomprehensible dialect, the store filled with the aroma of beef and mutton.\nHaving been to countless Lanzhou beef noodle shops in this life, it’s understandable to have similar decor, but why is the staff lineup the same? Is this a mandatory requirement for franchises?\nHowever, when the noodles were served, this shop was not quite authentic, the meat was not transparent.\nAfter eating, Lin Li went to the stationery store to pick up Zhou Baowei’s package.\nJudging from the package size, it wasn’t the Spring Breeze Elf at all.\nThinking about it, although people talk about it, it’s understandable for college, but how many in high school actually do this in the dorm? Everyone’s time in the dorm is mostly the same; are they really studying finance in there?\n——In finance, there’s a term called hedging.\nIf you’re really starting a ranking match, it’s more fitting to buy the NetEase version of Spring Breeze Elf for online matches.\nNot everyone brings a phone like Bai Bufan, you can’t rely on imagination, charging forward blindly will just harm yourself.\nBut now Lin Li found this morning’s Bao Wei’s despair even funnier, he was just bluffing, but Chen Yu Ying must have taken it seriously—didn’t he just put a poop bucket on his own head?\nWith the package, Lin Li went to the dormitory of Grade 10, Class 4, recalled and found Zhou Baowei and Bai Bufan’s dorm.\n\"Knock knock knock.\" Lin Li knocked on the door.\n\"Who is it?\" Bai Bufan, who ate pretty quickly today, was already back, his voice came from inside.\n\"The host, writer, folk singer, bartender, oil painter, cobbler, silversmith, hand drum artist, old backpacker, investment advisor, French knight, abstract genius Lin Li.\" Lin Li replied.\n\"We can’t accommodate so many people in our dorm, can you switch to another one, please?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"Good boy?\"\n\"Pat pat head.\"\nThe secret signal matched, and the dormitory door was immediately opened.\nClassic configuration, six-person dorm, three bunk beds, two rows of long desks and chairs, but the environment was decent, unlike some trash schools with a decor style only suitable for being located in the ruins of Damascus’ ’Rose’—just like in Syria.\nIn the dorm, there were only three people, the other three hadn’t returned yet or were visiting other dorms.\n\"Bao Wei, your computer parts.\" Lin Li tossed the package to Zhou Baowei, who was sitting on a chair, and then lay on his bed without any hesitation, occupying it like a cuckoo, rubbing against the quilt.\nHaving long accepted his lower bunk as a public area, Zhou Baowei just sighed helplessly after catching the package.\n\"Lin Li, be careful.\" Bai Bufan stretched his hand to Lin Li’s upper bunk, searching for his phone beneath the quilt, while reminding, \"There are precious artifacts on Bao Wei’s bed, they’re ancestral, if you damage them, you probably can’t afford to pay.\"\n\"Really?\" Lin Li sat up upon hearing this.\nZhou Baowei also turned around—how come I didn’t know myself.\n\"Yes, there are papers from the Lu Kingdom on Bao Wei’s bed, with Jin characters on them, witnessing the cultural exchange between ancient countries. Have you watched ’National Treasure’? Remember those fingerprints from over two thousand years ago? I think this artifact of Bao Wei’s is also quite romantic, wonder if there’s a chance to get on that show.\" Bai Bufan spoke eloquently.\nLin Li glanced at the pillow side, indeed there were tissues: \"...\"\nThere’s no need to ask why it’s ancestral; such things are easy to infer—the DNA is ancestral.\nIt’s just this romantic notion that Lin Li disagrees with.\nBut he had to admit, if it could make it on the show, the program effect should be substantial.\n\"That’s for my nose blowing, stop spreading rumors!\" Zhou Baowei was briefly enraged.\nAfter locating his phone, Bai Bufan sat on Zhou Baowei’s bed.\nLin Li directly snatched the phone and opened his short video platform.\nFirst, check the content.\nLin Li opened the browser first.\n\"You’re really a dog! But at least I came prepared.\" Bai Bufan sneered.\nDamn, it’s in incognito mode.\nBut Lin Li always had other means, he opened the browser’s bookmarks to see what Bai Bufan had saved.\n\"Alright, that’s enough, it’s impolite to keep looking.\" Bai Bufan grabbed Lin Li’s hand, speaking seriously.\nLin Li laughed heartily, then prepared to return to the main screen.\n\"?\"\n\"Why is your phone’s home button a screenshot, Bai Bufan?\" Lin Li was puzzled after taking a screenshot, then pressed volume up and power to finally return to the main screen.\n\"Because I flashed the phone; I don’t want my phone to be easily used if I sacrifice on the battlefield and the enemy picks it up!\" Bai Bufan proudly puffed his chest.\n\"Bai Chen Guang, have you considered if your teammate picks up your phone on the battlefield, what then?\" Lin Li asked earnestly.\nBai Bufan was stumped, after a long thought, he nodded heavily, \"That’s his bad luck.\"\nLin Li gave a thumbs up.\nOpening Douyin, Lin Li watched five videos.\nThree goddess-type videos, one gaming video, one needing heroes to appear in the comments section comic introduction video.\n\"You’re screwed for life.\" Lin Li expressed his approval again.\n\"I don’t usually watch these.\" Bai Bufan said sincerely, \"Also, when talking to me, could you look at me instead of the goddesses? It’s a bit rude, if you really like, I can send you their Douyin IDs later.\"\n\"I scoff at that notion, but do send them to me, I need to collect evidence with a critical eye, once the evidence is collected, it’ll be the fall of the goddess statues.\" Lin Li shook his head, though his head shook, his eyes didn’t.\nEven more stable than an owl’s head.\n\"I’ll forward them to you later, take your time watching, let’s focus on the task first, we don’t have much time.\" Bai Bufan said.\nLin Li opened the messages.\n\"Bufan, I have a question for you.\"\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"Why is there a user here called ’Good Grandson’, whose avatar is the same as mine, and when I clicked in, I found his Douyin ID also seemed to be the same as mine.\" Lin Li asked with a smile.\n\"This proves you have good taste, picking an avatar recognized by the masses! It can’t possibly be my remark for you, just kidding.\" Bai Bufan smiled, then changed to a frightened laugh.\nA while later.\nLin Li was seated atop Bai Bufan’s \"corpse\", opening one chat log after another.\n...\n「Bai Bufan: Meet up?」\n「Love Green Grape: Add WeChat 300.」\n「Bai Bufan: Add and we can meet up?」\n「Love Green Grape: Add WeChat first, then we’ll talk.」\n「Bai Bufan: The stock market is bad recently, I’m a student, can you give a discount? How about three yuan?」\n「Love Green Grape: LOL, why don’t you say you’re a newborn? Can’t I give you WeChat for free?」\n「Bai Bufan: Thanks, sister, for understanding. I am a newborn.」\n「Bai Bufan: Didn’t you get it? I’m a newborn, hellohello, I’m a newborn.」\n「Bai Bufan: Are you there? Why no reply after reading? Give me WeChat?」\n「Due to the privacy settings of the other party, TA cannot receive your messages.」\n...\n「Bai Bufan: How much per session.」\n「Xiling angel: We’re green outdoor playmates, 12 hours 3k, all expenses during the period are covered by you, boss.」\n「Bai Bufan: Green? Why is green so expensive?」\n「Xiling angel: Of course it’s green, if you only want 6 hours of day play, the price is only 800.」\n「Bai Bufan: There’s nowhere to play at night, only games, this costs 2200? Who orders such playmates, I’d rather have an online sweet girl accompany me for tens of yuan per hour.」\n「Xiling angel: Can’t understand human words, idiot.」\n「Bai Bufan:?」\n「Due to the privacy settings of the other party, TA cannot receive your messages.」\n「Bai Bufan: Why blacklisted? Your pricing is indeed unreasonable!」\n「Due to the privacy settings of the other party, TA cannot receive your messages.」",

No matter the amount, I’m not interested. I post these things just to share out of interest, because I don’t have a boyfriend right now, so they’re only put on Douyin. I have no plans nor the intention to make money with my body. I can’t accept such things.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Huh? Sis, are you a real-life goddess?!\"\n\"Waiting for My Pure Love: Haha, sort of, but once I have a boyfriend, I definitely won’t share anymore. In reality, I’m a very conservative and traditional person. I’ll probably only be a goddess for him.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Sis, you’re so nice. I really envy your future boyfriend.\"\n\"Waiting for My Pure Love: Sigh, it’s been really boring lately. I’ve encountered some difficulties in real life and have no one to talk to. It’s nice chatting with you. It’s kind of a hassle to chat here. Want to add me on WeChat?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: No, sis.

I’m the Marshal of the Heavenly Horses, I’ll feed your horses to grass!\"\n\"Bai Bufan retracted a message.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: @’Post’, sis or bro, can you push the original blogger to me? I genuinely like it; I beg you.\"\n\"Longing: Douyin account 6BK...\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Thanks, you’re unexpectedly nice, but fair is fair. I still have to keep calling you out.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Image-stealing dog! I’ll feed your horses to grass!\"\n\"Due to the other party’s privacy settings, they cannot receive your message.\"\n...\n\"Bai Bufan: Hello, blogger. I have a good brother named Lin Li. He’s terminally ill now, the doctor has issued a critical condition notice. He can’t even type with his hands anymore, but he has a last wish, to see the blogger’s legs. So I have to rudely disturb you, hoping you can fulfill my brother’s last wish.\"\n\"Bo Bo Xiaobo: Hahahahaha.\"\n\"Bo Bo Xiaobo: Since you’ve typed so much, I’ll satisfy you this once.\"\n\"Bo Bo Xiaobo: (Picture)\"\n\"Bai Bufan: It’s not for me, it’s my brother Lin Li, but thanks, sis, now he can rest in peace.\"\n\"Bo Bo Xiaobo: Alright, alright, then tell me, what’s your brother’s serious illness?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Terminal hemorrhoid cancer, the hemorrhoids have spread throughout the body, want to see a picture?\"\n\"Bo Bo Xiaobo: ...no thanks.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Sis, he’s looked at the legs, he entrusted me to ask if there are any more?\"\n\"Due to the other party’s privacy settings, they cannot receive your message.\"\n...\nLin Li sat on Bai Bufan’s body, already laughing so hard he might pass out.\nHalfway through the laughter, out of sheer curiosity about what was so funny, Zhou Baowei and another roommate present, Chen Tianming, also came up to Lin Li’s side, sitting on the remaining empty space of Bai Bufan’s body, and looked at the chat log.\nThe result was laughter going from one person to three.\nBai Bufan, in front of guys and girls, was truly two extremes. See, this is the consequence of playing abstract, turning into pure brain damage, a lesson to bear in mind.\nAlmost all private chat results, without exception, ended in being deleted and blocked, isn’t this a talent too?\nNo wonder Bai Bufan said he made progress, but only a little, this morning.\nNow it seems, that little was an overstatement.\nUsually, Bai Bufan can mouth off wildly in front of guys, but in situations like this, his IQ and EQ were zero.\nLin Li even wanted to open Bai Bufan’s head to see what kind of structure could produce these messages.\n\"Simple people easily get fished, but idiots don’t count as simple, because idiots don’t even know someone threw a hook in front of them.\" Chen Tianming shook his head and sighed, \"Bufan is truly a divine person, Pure Love Sis: Want to add WeChat to enter my fishpond and prepare to explode Gold Coins?\nBut our Brother Bufan is like: Sis, good luck~ I won’t add! Hahahahaha——\nBufan, from now on, we’ll each call each other our own, you continue to call me dad, and I’ll call you bro!\"\nThe sorrow and joy of humans do not interconnect, Bai Bufan didn’t know what was funny now, he only felt the unbearable weight of life: \"You three... can you get off me for now...\"\nNo need to mind, no one cared.\n\"Hahahahaha——\"\n\"?\"\nBut after seeing himself inexplicably diagnosed with hemorrhoid cancer, with hemorrhoids already spread throughout the body, Lin Li wasn’t giggling anymore.\nSuch a vile and disgusting disease, no wonder the other side blocked you out of disgust.\nWhat made Lin Li angriest was that Bai Bufan, that dog, used his name to scam leg photos, and after getting them, didn’t even share with him. What kind of selfish person is this?\nIf he shared, maybe Lin Li could even forgive him.\nZhou Baowei and Chen Tianming were giggling more instead.\nChen Tianming even laughed till tears came out, so he wiped his tears with the tissues on the bed.\nWhy are these tissues all clumped up?\nWait a minute.\nRealizing afterward, Chen Tianming stopped giggling and went to wash his face in the bathroom.\nLin Li discovered a law in all this.\n——The Snootiness Conservation Law, snootiness doesn’t disappear, it only transfers from one person’s face to another’s.\nSnooty snoot.\nAnd with Chen Tianming gone, Bai Bufan finally able to breathe, face twisted: \"Damn, I’m a bit alive again, but come on guys, did you really treat me as a cushion! Get up!\"\n...\nThe chat logs that were left had mostly been viewed, there were also some that simply didn’t get responses, so Zhou Baowei left to continue examining his package deliveries, while Bai Bufan gazed hopefully at Lin Li:\n\"So, how was it, after reading these, were they of any help to you? Can we follow the thread, quickly take action?\"\n\"Helpful, you made me feel better, so my work efficiency should improve from here on.\" Lin Li nodded seriously.\n\"?\"\nIs this considered help?\nBai Bufan felt very hurt.\nLast night he kept getting blocked until one o’clock but this is the laughter he gets in return.\nTrue feelings can’t exchange for true feelings.\n\"I added a few WeChats, they aren’t the tea sellers, maybe you want to check them out?\" Bai Bufan said sadly.\n\"Send them all to me, these bloggers, and the WeChats you added, send them all, but not the tea sellers. Later I’ll use my account to ask around, see if I can still gather some intel.\" Lin Li nodded.",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Chapter 46: Terrifying upon closer reflection, Lin Li has never appeared alongside aliens\nAfter Bai Bufan stayed in the dormitory to send useful information to him, Lin Li immediately went to the classroom.\nAs soon as the lunchtime bell officially rings, if I’m still walking between the dormitory building and the teaching building, my name will appear twice on the announcement board.\nClass 4, Grade 1.\nThe resentful spirit Koukou is gone, but there are noticeably more people staying in the classroom to study this noon than yesterday.\n\"Wang Ze, can you tell me why you’re here at this time?\" Lin Li scratched his chin, inspecting the Right Guardian Wang Ze who could be seen before even entering the door:\n\"Do you get it? Just as I pushed this door open, I was prepared to see a Luminous Pearl, but instead, it felt like a pile of shit showed up first.\"\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nThe attack is strong, and the insult is severe.\n\"Can’t I want to study? You can set fire as an official, but I can’t light a lamp as a commoner?\" Wang Ze said with wide eyes.\n\"Let me see what you’re studying? Mo Ye is now Chu Mu’s only soul pet... Oh, you’re studying Pet Charm.\"\n\"Hehe, it’s nice, I love reading it.\" Wang Ze scratched his head and laughed, \"Bufan recommended it to me, said this book is really great.\"\nLin Li nodded, looking at Wang Ze’s smiling face, he smiled too.\nGo on and laugh slowly.\nWhen you see Mo Ye reincarnating countless times just to hear Chu Mu say to him once more, ’Just call you Mo Ye’, hope you can still laugh.\n\"Alright, go see your Luminous Pearl. Bro, I sacrificed my nap time today actually for you. I was worried Wang Yuezhi would stop you from having a happy noon, so I came specially to guard you!\" Wang Ze tucked away the novel and winked at Lin Li.\nGot it now, it seems the extra people in the classroom today might be here for me.\nHope for civilized monkey watching.\nOnly those who frequently watch monkeys know how deep the intricacies are.\nChen Yu Ying’s eyes turned towards Lin Li as soon as he came in. Lin Li naturally walked over to her and asked, \"Monitor, same as yesterday, you sit in Bai Bufan’s seat? I ask you questions here, I’m afraid of disturbing others.\"\n\"Sure.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"What’s the same as yesterday? What did I miss?\" Ding Sihan, who is usually absent, was also in her seat today, and exclaimed in surprise, looking eagerly at Chen Yu Ying.\nAt this moment, Ding Sihan is like a melon-eating marmot.\nQuite adorable, poking her with a fork would definitely be fun—a thought from Lin Li’s mind.\n\"Yesterday, I was chatting with Lin Li...\" Chen Yu Ying paused, unable to say what happened yesterday, so she looked at Lin Li and tentatively asked, \"What did we talk about?\"\nLin Li, Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nAren’t you the one involved? Why are you asking someone else what was talked about? Weird, there’s something fishy, this melon seems all the sweeter!\n\"What did we talk about yesterday, let me think too.\" Lin Li, amused, scratched his chin and decided to be perfunctory:\n\"Talked about breakfast outside the school, I gave a Lin Qi Mi three-star rating. Monitor, let’s go, once the bell officially rings, it’ll be inappropriate for us to move around.\"\n\"Okay.\" Chen Yu Ying simply tidied up the homework she was going to do at noon and got up from her seat.\n\"Can I join your study session?\" Ding Sihan asked sincerely.\n\"Hold on a second.\"\nLin Li started patting his pockets, searching everywhere.\n\"Lin Li, are you looking for something?\" Ding Sihan asked in confusion, looking at the floor to help: \"Did you lose something?\"\n\"The excuse to reject you suddenly disappeared, help me find it.\" Lin Li nodded, saying with a serious tone.\nDing Sihan’s actions froze.\nShould Lin Li be described as tactful or straightforward?\nFor straightforwardness, he at least gave a pre-spell cast delay, for tactfulness, this pre-cast seemed unrecognizable as a pre-cast.\nA combination of overlong pre-cast and zero-frame start-up.\n\"I can’t find this.\" Ding Sihan shook her head expressionlessly, hands on her hips.\n\"Then I’ll keep looking myself.\"\nChen Yu Ying first chuckled softly, then said to Ding Sihan: \"Sihan, what are you saying, if you have any questions, just ask me as usual?\"\n\"Exactly, Ding Sihan, I only have this bit of noontime, and you want to intrude too. I’m severely suspicious you’re targeting me, and I’ve decided, in the future, at my wedding, you’ll share a table with Wang Yuezhi.\nOh, Yuezhi happens to want to teach, and you want to learn, the two of you can form another study group, wouldn’t that be perfect?\" Lin Li clapped his hands, conveniently offering a perfect suggestion.\n\"I don’t want to!\" Ding Sihan vigorously shook her head.\nNearby, Wang Yuezhi, who seemed to be doing homework, paused, and the lead of his mechanical pencil broke mid-click, flying into the air.\nHe really did mention this to Xue Jian.\nBut just as Lin Li expected, Xue Jian had no intention of stopping it and only felt Lin Li was getting more sensible.\n—If Lin Li could inexplicably break his brain, lose a day’s memory, he’d like him even more.\n\"I will always keep an eye on you, Lin Li, you can never replace my best friend position...\" Ding Sihan also turned into a resentful spirit.\nBut unlike Koukou’s red-clad level, Ding Sihan’s spiritual rank calms down with just a peach wood sword from Lin Li.\n...\nLin Li and Chen Yu Ying returned to their seats.\n\"Lin Li, if there’s anything you don’t understand, feel free to ask now.\" Chen Yu Ying said.\n\"Alright, let’s start with geography homework.\" Lin Li took out yesterday’s geography homework, most of which was already done.\nThey began a normal study tutorial.\nLin Li furrowed his brows slightly, not very satisfied.\nThe progress bar was moving, faster than just chatting, but overall, it was still quite limited, and the speed of increase was still rather slow; accumulated progress might not even reach one percent by now.\nAt this rate, how long would it take to complete?\nAnd judging from the task’s reward, it didn’t seem like a task requiring a large amount of time to complete.\nThe recent geography content is climate, theoretically learning about this should count as understanding this ’world’.\nLin Li looked at the task panel again.\nPreliminary understanding, could the emphasis be on the general framework of this world, rather than the ’details’?\nOr perhaps it requires using Chen Yu Ying to unwittingly reveal that this world isn’t the current one, but rather info on the so-called all-female world?\nSpeculation is useless, it needs testing.\n\"Monitor, the way you’re explaining right now, it’s actually a bit hard for me to understand, can we start from basic places?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Sure, if there’s anything you don’t understand, just say it.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, simply took out Lin Li’s geography textbook and opened it.\nGoodness, the front part looks brand new, while the recent courses have quite a few notes.\nWhy are the figures in the pictures all drawn with beards and the eyes shaded black, barely recognizable.\n\"The knowledge in the textbook might be too complicated; what I want to ask might need to be a bit more fundamental.\" Lin Li slowly said, setting up the groundwork.\n\"Huh? Is it complex here too?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Then, then ask first, although outside the book, you say fundamental, I’m not very sure.\" Chen Yu Ying’s gaze now seemed clear yet confused.\nThe girl always ranking stably at the top of her grade was starting to feel unsure about her knowledge reservoir.\nBecause explaining something simple doesn’t always mean it’s easier; the 1+1 in Goldbach’s conjecture still baffles mathematicians today.\nThe main thing is, the person in front of me is Lin Li, and Chen Yu Ying always feels something might go wrong.\n\"Firstly, I’m not sick.\"\nUpon hearing this opening line, Chen Yu Ying’s heart skipped a beat.\nGreat! Just as expected, Lin Li took a deep breath:\n\"The planet we’re living on, what’s it called?\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nYou’re not saying it’s such basic geography?",

Whatever the atmosphere was, it vanished after that long sentence was spoken.\nLin Li chuckled, put his hands together seriously, and said:\n\"Class president, first of all, I’m really not sick, secondly, I’m really not sick, lastly, I’m really not sick; I genuinely want to ask you this question. What exactly is the name of the planet we’re on?\"\nChen Yu Ying thought for a moment and shook her head, \"Yesterday you also insisted at first that you’re not a pervert, but you ended up admitting it, so this time I think you still have something wrong.\"\nIt’s logical and convincing.\nSystem, see what you’ve done.\nA shy, timid, socially anxious person who wouldn’t dare pinch a stranger’s butt because of you ended up with this sort of image in other people’s eyes.\nWhat happened to my brightness and grandeur?\n\"Either you’re intentionally messing with me, which would make me a little angry,\" Chen Yu Ying paused, then added, looking at Lin Li seriously.\nLin Li raised his evaluation of Chen Yu Ying—girls who express their anger are truly great!\nThose girls who get mad but don’t say anything and even worse, those who go home and make their boyfriends guess why they’re angry because of others, are truly horrible.\nFrom now on, he would absolutely not charge the class president a single cent for breakfast.\nHowever, Lin Li’s ability to come up with temporary excuses has always been good, so he promptly said seriously:\n\"Class president, I’m not messing with you; I’m seriously asking you this question.\nI do know the answer to this question, but I still have a reason to ask it this way.\nClass president, do you remember yesterday when I was going to tell you about the case I helped solve, I opened with something that’s highly relevant yet irrelevant about gender differences?\nThis has to do with the memory techniques I’ve been practicing recently, class president; have you ever seen a Hong Kong drama from over ten years ago called ’The Mind Reader,’ where one of the cases involves a memory palace murderer, and what I’ve been practicing recently is similar.\"\n\"Are you also practicing murder?\" Chen Yu Ying asked dumbfoundedly.\n\"...?\"\n\"Class president, what kind of image do I have in your mind?\"\n\"I’m practicing a memory palace!\"\nLin Li blinked, beginning to suspect there might be some inflation in the class president’s high grades.\nBinbin, take a look at the comprehension skills of the students you’re teaching.\n\"Oh, oh, go ahead,\" Chen Yu Ying said, a bit embarrassed, realizing that sometimes her brain really doesn’t catch up when dealing with Lin Li.\nIf Lin Li admitted he was practicing murder... Chen Yu Ying would consider it seriously.\n\"I need to engrave those basic pieces of knowledge into the palace first, then on this foundation, start to extend and build my memory palace, accumulating difficulty bit by bit, and forming a progressive thread, like adding bookmarks to memory.\nAnd now, in the subject of geography, I suspect I’ve memorized the wrong knowledge, so I’m formatting this part of the palace and need to refill it...\"\nLin Li spoke at length.\nOf course, it was all nonsense.\nBut it worked; by continually referencing \"insights\" and some high-level terms he either heard somewhere or made up, he managed to fool Chen Yu Ying.\nLin Li now seemed like an all-knowing internet expert; when you listen to him talk about things you’re unfamiliar with, it seems like he has extensive knowledge, but once he touches on a subject you know well, you’d realize he’s a complete idiot.\n\"So please, class president, just pretend I’m a traveler from another world, knowing nothing and trying to learn about this world, okay?\" Lin Li, in a sense, laid it all out directly.\n\"As long as the class president can tell me, I’ll do anything, I’ll agree to anything,\" Lin Li transformed into a submissive character, practically sticking his tongue out and rolling his eyes.\nA strange request indeed, Chen Yu Ying scratched her head, but facing Lin Li’s hopeful gaze, it didn’t seem like he was messing with her, so she eventually nodded, \"...okay.\"\n\"Thank you, class president; right now I really want to pretend to be excited and deliberately grab your hand and rub it hundreds of times to show my gratitude.\" Lin Li breathed a sigh of relief.\nKnowing it was a joke and having confirmed Lin Li is indeed a pervert, Chen Yu Ying didn’t feel embarrassed; she thought for a moment and said:\n\"Although I’m still somewhat skeptical, I can accompany you through role-playing to help build this palace, but later on, I have a few questions that you need to answer for me, okay?\"\n\"Class president, you want to ask me questions?\" Lin Li blinked.\nThe class president is an all-around person, while he is more of an anti-all-around person.\nProbably the only subject where he might stand a chance, without gender considerations, would be P.E.—but not guaranteed a win.\nWait a minute.\n\"Class president, you’re not going to ask me something perverted, are you?\" Lin Li asked tentatively.\nThe one area where Chen Yu Ying might be curious and he might be able to provide guidance.\nSure enough, Chen Yu Ying nodded slightly, \"Some questions I’m indeed quite curious about.\"\nNo problem.\nAfter yesterday’s conversation, Chen Yu Ying didn’t find Lin Li’s perverted actions odd, and Lin Li didn’t find Chen Yu Ying’s curiosity about perverted things odd.\nThe odd couple was growing.\n\"No problem, but class president, please don’t ask anything too perverted; I might not be able to answer those either.\" Lin Li responded carelessly.\n\"You’re being modest,\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nSystem, give me back my good reputation.\n\"Shall we start building my palace first?\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Let’s begin then, class president. The planet I’ve arrived on now...\"\nHaving agreed, Chen Yu Ying took on a serious face and began, \"Let me think about Geography 101, otherworld traveler Lin Li, the planet we’re on is called Earth; about 29% of its surface is land and 71% is water...\"\nGenius!\nWatching as the progress bar starts to shoot up, Lin Li reaffirmed that he was indeed an undeniable genius.",

So this planet is called Earth! This knowledge is so important to me! Teacher Chen, please continue, I’m listening carefully.\" Lin Li slapped his thigh and looked expectantly at Chen Yu Ying, \"Next, can you tell us the names and numbers of the seven continents and four oceans?\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nIt’s hard to empathize with someone who says things like ’how many are the seven continents and four oceans’.\nBut with Lin Li, it’s somehow normal.\nChen Yu Ying was puzzled about how she hadn’t noticed these traits of Lin Li in the last semester.\nWith a laugh, she sighed and continued playing the role, responding to Lin Li’s ’queries’: \"Earth has a total of seven continents and four oceans, namely Asia...\"\n...\n[Task Five Completed.]\nUpon seeing this message, Lin Li let out a long sigh of relief.\nIt only took a dozen minutes.\n\"Class president, that’s enough.\" Lin Li reached out to pause Chen Yu Ying’s narrative and then complimented, \"Class president, if you become a kindergarten teacher, you’ll definitely have students all around the world.\"\nChen Yu Ying blinked, feeling the phrase ’students all around the world’ seemed both fitting and not quite right for a kindergarten teacher.\n\"Really no need to continue?\" Chen Yu Ying had actually gotten into the groove.\nRole-playing felt awkward, but Chen Yu Ying realized as long as she reminded herself she was entertaining a fool, everything became amusing.\nEspecially when the fool gave positive feedback, it was even more fun.\nChen Yu Ying was already enjoying herself.\nIt’s known fooling fools would weigh heavy on one’s conscience.\nBut fooling Lin Li wouldn’t.\nAnd the other party would even thank her.\n\"No need, it’s enough. These knowledge points are solid enough as a foundation for my memory palace, I can build the rest on my own.\" Lin Li nodded, continuing his nonsense.\n\"Alright...\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, a bit reluctantly, then inspected Lin Li suspiciously: \"Lin Li, you’re not tricking me, right? Are you really using this so-called magical memory palace technique? Can it really improve your memory?\"\n\"Class president, how could I trick you; I could swear. My memory has already doubled compared to before.\" Lin Li, whose physique had been improved by the system, spoke with confidence.\n\"Really?\" Chen Yu Ying still wasn’t convinced. She had heard of many peculiar and effective memory techniques globally, but they weren’t widely spread due to being either high-bar or difficult to master, lacking universal appeal.\nTheoretically, a memory palace requires very high spatial imagination ability.\nIs Lin Li really capable?\n\"Really, class president, if you don’t believe it, test the knowledge you just taught me to see if I remembered it,\" Lin Li confidently patted his chest.\n\"Alright, what is the name of the planet we live on?\"\n\"Earth.\"\n\"What species are we?\"\n\"Humans, broadly, mammals.\"\n\"What do we inhale and exhale?\"\n\"Oxygen, carbon dioxide.\"\n...\nAll questions posed by Chen Yu Ying were instantly answered correctly by Lin Li.\n\"You really remembered everything.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"See.\" Lin Li was somewhat proud.\n\"This memory technique is quite impress—no wait!\" Just as she was about to continue nodding, Chen Yu Ying paused, suddenly realizing.\n\"What’s wrong? My answers are all correct.\" Lin Li was a bit confused.\n\"You already knew these basic facts! You’re not really dumb... or a real traveler from another realm!\" Chen Yu Ying, having been too deep into role-play, had really taken Lin Li for a fool, now finally came to senses.\nLin Li surely isn’t a fool... shouldn’t be.\nThe ’knowledge’ I just taught, even a random wild Bai Bufan on the street could answer.\nIf Lin Li couldn’t answer these questions, that would be crazy; this can’t prove any memory improvement!\nAlmost got caught in the loop.\n\"What you said makes sense.\" Lin Li realized, thinking and then pointing to the geography textbook, he said, \"But my memory really improved, why don’t we memorize a completely unfamiliar Chapter together, let’s see who memorizes more in one minute?\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Class president, taste the feeling of failure!\" Lin Li was very confident.\nEven when considering nothing as everything.\n...\nFailed.\nCouldn’t memorize more than Chen Yu Ying.\nLin Li belatedly realized, scoring 100% and doubling still couldn’t exceed 300%, one Lin Li Tyson punch could kill only, two Lin Lis max two punches.\nIt takes Vice Generals to rival Zhuge Liang—not just three stinky cobblers.\nSome games you cheat to no avail against an expert.\nNo wonder the class president has such a freakish memory at a young age, ranking high academically; the freakishness isn’t just brains, but brains—the latter refers to the entity itself.\n\"Class president, you’re making me a bit embarrassed...\" Lin Li flopped onto the desk, eyes unfocused.\n\"I believe now, I believe, this memory technique of yours must be pretty impressive.\" Lin Li’s demeanor drew laughter from Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Class president, if you want to praise yourself, you can say it directly, no need to compliment me to indirectly praise yourself.\" Lin Li’s gaze refocused on Chen Yu Ying, looking rather resentful, then he smiled as well.\nTheir mutual laughter caught others’ eyes.\nWang Yuezhi’s teeth were grinding fiercely, Ding Sihan shared a tantalyzing aunt-like smile from the sidelines, Wang Ze... Wang Ze kept his gaze fixed on Wang Yuezhi.\nIf this doesn’t count as love, what does?\n\"Since your palace is ready, shall we return to the textbook and solve those questions all over again?\" Chen Yu Ying inquired.\n\"Okay.\" Lin Li nodded, preparing to open the book but then remembered: \"Class president, don’t you have tricky questions wanting to ask me? Why don’t you ask them first?\"\n\"Sure.\" Ultimately, Chen Yu Ying could never speak as brazenly about perversion as Lin Li did, her volume lowered, but then she asked:\n\"Lin Li, what does ’light hum’ mean when you guys say it?\nI’ve noticed you’ve been using this word frequently lately, but when I ask people around me, none of them know its meaning.\"\nLin Li blinked.\nPrepared by the perverted baseline set, Lin Li wasn’t embarrassed or speechless by this question.\nEven thought it quite reasonable for the class president to ask.\nBut how to elegantly describe this when Anti-bar’s Four Silver Demons coined the term?\nLin Li always has ways.\nHe’s a genius.\n\"Class president, do you know what jade ant, heavenly blessing, jade liquid, poetic bait, yellow mash mean?\"\n\"Alcohol?\"\n\"Exactly, all these are elegant references, just like how white jade platter, Heng’e, laurel tree are elegant references for the moon, ’light hum’ is an elegant reference too.\"\n\"So an elegant reference for what?\" Chen Yu Ying was more curious.\n\"For us boys, it’s Tao Zhe’s elegant reference.\" Lin Li answered.\n\"Tao Zhe? Ah? Isn’t Tao Zhe a singer? Is ’light hum’ a fan nickname? And why is it gender divided?\" Chen Yu Ying was even more perplexed, completely failing to understand.\n\"No, I mean the literal split meaning of Tao Zhe.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nChen Yu Ying watched Lin Li, hoping he would further explain.\n\"Class president, split ’Zhe’ and read Tao Zhe’s name literally, and you’ll get it.\" Lin Li gently explained.\nTao Gee...\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"",

She hesitated to speak, then stopped, eventually only saying:\n\"I think you should apologize to Tao Zhe.\"\n\"Tao Zhe said he has no objection.\" Lin Li shrugged.\nThen, under Chen Yu Ying’s gaze, he gave in, raised both hands and smoothly declared an apology:\n\"Alright, sorry Mr. Tao Zhe, I really do like your R&B, especially that song ’Small Town Big Love’. \"\n\"That’s a song by Wang Leihong, and it’s ’Big City, Small Love’. Now you have to apologize to both of them!\" Chen Yu Ying lightly pressed her forehead with her hand, realizing that Lin Li probably did it on purpose, with a hint of laughter in her voice.\n\"So now you understand what ’light humming’ means, right? You can’t use Tao Zhe to describe a girl. If I had to describe it, I might...\"\n\"No, no, no, thank you, I understand now, no need to describe further.\" Chen Yu Ying quickly interrupted Lin Li’s spiel, finding herself unable to match Lin Li’s eloquent yet crafty manner.\nHaving almost performed another \"Er Kang I Can’t See It\" act, Lin Li regretfully stopped.\nHe then introduced the origin of ’light humming’ to Chen Yu Ying, but seriously advised her against using Reddit, as it would only lead to unhappiness—unless she planned to open an internet cafe on a low budget.\n\"Any other perverted questions you want to consult me on?\" Lin Li felt his own question sounded weird after he said it.\nHe felt like he was becoming Chen Yu Ying’s ’perversion mentor’, which Lin Li found a bit unjustified.\n\"Yes, do you guys really buy those... cups and use them in the dorm?\" Chen Yu Ying was quite curious about what she overheard that morning.\n\"Pure banter. By the way, class rep, please clear my buddy’s name; Bao Wei didn’t buy what you think he did. We were just joking around, who would use such things in the dorm?\" Lin Li shrugged.\n\"I checked at noon, it was Ma Ying Long that he bought, and when I asked, it turned out Bai Bufan has hemorrhoids.\"\nBai Bufan, is it true you like to claim hemorrhoid cancer to pretty girls, huh?\nRetribution comes sooner than three days for Lin Li.\n\"So when you go home every day, did you buy anything?\" Unfortunately, Chen Yu Ying wasn’t interested in Bai Bufan, but her level of insight into blind spots was quite good.\n\"Didn’t buy.\" Lin Li shook his head, \"I would only buy it when I have my own place in the future. Class rep, haven’t you considered how awkward it would be if your family discovered it?\"\n\"True.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, her expression showing a hint of regret for not delving deeper into the information, but she didn’t press further, shaking her head: \"I have no other questions, thanks for your answers.\"\n\"It was nothing. In the future, you teach me to study, and I’ll teach you ’perversion’, and we all have a bright future.\" Lin Li humbly waved his hand.\n\"So, shall we continue with the problems you don’t understand? The ones in the textbook, not the basic ones.\" Chen Yu Ying didn’t want to acknowledge how ’bright’ it was, deciding to steer the conversation back to business.\n\"Okay.\"\n...\nThe time left, as no new tasks were triggered, Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying continued their normal study Q&A.\nLin Li was quite serious, as being unserious at that time would be disrespectful, and it indeed helped him with his grades too.\nSeeing them getting back on track with their studies, Wang Yuezhi let out a long sigh of relief like a character in an erotic manga, tears still streaming, while Ding Sihan regretfully didn’t get to see more novel scenarios, and Wang Ze focused faithfully and solely on Wang Yuezhi.\nNoticing his gaze, he gave a thumbs-up—I’ve got your back.\nLunchtime ended, with ten minutes left to remind class, the prep bell rang in the dormitory simultaneously.\n\"Darn, that saying is true—desperate people can do anything, except math problems.\" Lin Li exclaimed painfully, running his hands through his hair after calculating each room could house the square root of three over two people.\nWhy on earth can’t people take square roots?\nNext to him, with no questions left from Lin Li, Chen Yu Ying stretched, her modified uniform fitted more closely than a regular one, a graceful curve extending.\n\"Actually, it’s the same as the problem I taught you earlier, just with a slight variation. Try it on your own; I won’t go through it again now.\" Seeing Lin Li in distress, Chen Yu Ying laughed.\nThe joy those good at math feel watching those who aren’t struggle with it is beyond imagination for others.\n\"I’ll give it another shot during night study.\"\n\"Sure, if you have any questions, come ask me again tomorrow at noon. I’m in the classroom most noontimes anyway.\" Chen Yu Ying was already packing up to return to her seat.\nAlthough today’s reason for doing so was mostly due to the system, considering the possibility of triggering some bizarre task later, Lin Li did not refuse and nodded.\nHaving a quiet, pretty, pleasant-voiced, and smart female deskmate, that kind of joy is unimaginable to others.\nWanted to change deskmates.\nAs for Bai Bufan, Lin Li wished him all the best.\nHonestly, Lin Li suddenly realized he wasn’t that familiar with him, after all.\nIn the brotherhood, one may metaphorically spear a bro for aiding a woman, but who wouldn’t sympathize with disabled persons yet scorn unclothed individuals as perverts, right?\nThe importance of each is apparent.\n\"Alright, I’ll still bring you breakfast tomorrow, based on today’s?\" Lin Li reciprocated, since he did waste nearly half of Chen Yu Ying’s noon time, and would continue to need her help.\nChen Yu Ying wanted to refuse, but Lin Li was adamant, pulling her along, and under Lin Li’s ’threat’ not to buy more, she reluctantly accepted.\nMoney was certainly out of the question.\nWith the rewards given by the anti-obscenity campaigner, short-term she certainly wouldn’t lack a little money.\nLin Li stood up and headed to the restroom.\nTime for the harvest.\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha Synchronization Index +10; Random Limb/Organ Boost Opportunity*1; System Currency*50.]\n[Would you like to include the Protruding Organ in the \"Random Limb/Organ Boost Opportunity\" pool?]\nLin Li’s face showed a sly smile.\nHow could it possibly be included in the random pool, what’s the point of enhancing that, this is clearly the system’s twisted humor.\nOops! I am such a careless person, accidentally clicked \"Yes\"!\nOh no, oh no, messed up now, unlucky, can’t the system give me a chance to redo!\n[Please confirm this choice: Include.]\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSeriously, bro, you’re really giving me the chance?\nIsn’t this supposed to be final and unchangeable?\nThen what was my so-called ’dilemma’, this makes me awkward, Lin Li began to suspect the system might actually be intelligent, but was pretending otherwise.\nWhat should I choose now?\nLin Li awkwardly turned his head, whistling.\nHe couldn’t help but laugh out loud; who am I fooling, time to stop pretending, cards on the table!\n[You have confirmed once more.]\n[The Protruding Organ has been added to the \"Random Limb/Organ Boost Opportunity\" pool.]",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Chapter 50 This Green Turf Has Never Lacked Genius\nBrave cow-cow, not afraid of difficulties, come on, system.\n[You have used the \"Random Limb, Organ Augmentation Opportunity.\"]\n[The strength of your right hand has increased to 200% of its current power, and you have acquired the ability \"Charge Up.\"]\n[Charge Up: Completely paralyze your right hand for one hour to accumulate a usage opportunity. Within an hour of using it, the power, abilities, and skills of your right hand will double. Paralysis and skill use cannot be interrupted, and the charging ability has a storage limit of 3.]\nLin Li: \"...\"\nLin Li looked at his right hand, which was as slim as the rest of his body. At this moment, there were no visible changes, but it did seem stronger? Seems like it.\nIs this a Kirin arm? Can I use it to play Terracotta Warriors and get double the joy?\nNo, this isn’t really about brute force.\nIf only I’d had this ability before high school, I could’ve chosen shot put for the physical education exam. By charging up, I could’ve used power equivalent to four times what I have now, scoring a perfect ten on the event, no problem.\n\"Kirin arm is good, and awakening this surely-acquired ability is really! good! yes!\" Lin Li gritted his teeth and sighed.\nThere’s no cow-cow in the prize pool to power up, fine, Lin Li accepted it; but now there’s a cow-cow in the pool, and still no power-up, isn’t this pool added for nothing?\nSystem, you say it’s random and it’s really random? Can’t you learn from Tencent? I allow you to be unreliable at times like these.\nThe dream of the Great Horned Cow is shattered, but it’s still better than ballet. At least this ability appears in the ability area of my system panel.\n[Name: Lin Li (Blood Crow Assassin)]\n[Age: 17]\n[Physique: Spiritual Qi absorption rate increased by 200%; charm resistance increased by 100%; yang energy concentration in body increased by 50%; memory increased by 100%; mecha synchronization index +20]\n[Passive Ability: Catch White Blade with Bare Hands]\n[Active Ability: Charge Up]\n[System Currency: 450]\nNo more blank entries, finally.\nThe right-hand strength boost does not appear in the [Physique] section. Lin Li’s understanding is that the items in the [Physique] section are permanent buffs and are additive rather than multiplicative, whereas this right-hand strength increase is a one-time base boost.\nThere are both good and bad sides.\nIf my right-hand strength was originally 1, regardless of whether it’s a buff or base, a 100% increase would bring it to 2. However, if I gain another 100% strength increase buff, the former would be 300% of 1, which is 3, while the latter would be 200% of 2, becoming 4.\nBut if I physically enhance my strength by 0.1 through the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, the buff will double it to 0.2, but the base will not get an additional boost.\nBut Lin Li didn’t care much whether it was base or buff; he was satisfied with the benefits from completing a simple task.\nLin Li was like an old-fashioned kettle, optimistic enough to keep whistling even if his bottom was on fire. In the desert, he’d find a pessimistic person to take their half-cup of water.\nWhen he returned to the classroom, Bai Bufan was already sitting at his desk.\n\"Did you spend a rosy noon? Sigh, I got blocked by several bloggers again at noon, why though.\" Bai Bufan sighed deeply.\n\"Because you’re kind.\"\n\"Bufan, can I punch you once?\" Lin Li asked directly afterward.\nGotta test it somehow.\n\"I don’t know why, but no, you can’t.\" Bai Bufan shook his head.\n\"Thank you, double negatives confirm a positive.\" Lin Li smiled contentedly and proceeded to punch Bai Bufan with his right hand.\n\"If I said yes, would you say, ’thanks for agreeing, now here’s another punch’?\"\n\"You guessed it right, bonus punch for you.\" It’s indeed difficult to fool someone on the same wavelength. Fortunately, Lin Li always had a reason to throw a punch.\n\"Your mom!\"\nBai Bufan shook his slightly aching hand and asked in astonishment, \"Lin Li, how did you get so strong? You ate super spinach behind my back?\"\nBai Bufan originally had more strength than Lin Li, but just now, when he caught Lin Li’s punch with his palm, it hurt like hell, and he couldn’t push back with force.\nAs for why Lin Li inexplicably punched him, that was unimportant, not worth asking. This kind of thing is pretty normal among guys.\n—In the last row during the break, when doing homework at your desk, it’s very possible a brother might land a Tathagata’s Palm on your back.\n\"Giving up lust is like this; you wouldn’t understand if you’ve never given up.\" Lin Li was quite pleased looking at his right hand, feeling a noticeable difference when exerting force.\nIt was comforting.\n\"You look more like you’ve been building up strength from not giving up lust.\" Bai Bufan flipped him the middle finger.\n\"Not important, from now on I’m a strong person, and all rebellious subjects must die.\" Lin Li patted his chest with his hand, \"Heh heh, Bai Bufan, from now on, you must be my dog, or get greeted with fists.\"\n\"A true strong person would never bully the weak, Lin Li, I, Bai Bufan, will never acknowledge you!\" Bai Bufan indignantly said.\n\"Who says I don’t, even though I have the power, I still follow principles, not hitting kids and women.\" Lin Li shook his head but quickly added before Bai Bufan could stress that he’s only fifteen:\n\"Unfortunately, your wife isn’t a kid, and your son isn’t a woman, so I aim my fist at them, I assume you’d understand.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"What if I have a daughter?\" Bai Bufan thought for a moment and asked.\n\"Sorry, sorry, I suddenly remembered I don’t hit elderly either, but your daughter isn’t elderly.\" Lin Li sincerely apologized for his lack of precision.\nAlmost didn’t annihilate a whole family.\n\"You’re quite polite; I acknowledge your strong heart, but I must sentence you to death now, in parentheses, repeatedly executed.\" Bai Bufan gave a thumbs-up.\n...\nNight soon arrived.\nAs soon as he left the school gate, Lin Li took out his phone.\nDuring the afternoon meal outside of school, Lin Li used his account to send private messages to the bloggers he found for Bai Bufan, engaging in a round of chats.\nBut the results were unsatisfactory.\nIt was evident that they were in the business and also offered takeout services.\nHowever, they also seemed very aware that the internet is much more ’dangerous’ than reality since everything leaves a trace, so they were quite cautious.\nAny slightly professional ’gaming companion’ shop strongly declares from start to finish that they only offer green services, adamantly refusing to change their tune.\nThe prices at night were suggestive, and the tone was full of implications.\nBut honestly, for such shops, Lin Li instinctively considered one thing — do they deliberately mark vegetarian dishes with meat prices?\nWhen the foolish customer eagerly awaits a special service at night, only to want a leg touch and get slapped by the companion saying sir, respect yourself.\nWhen the customer realizes it and wants to cause trouble with the shop, the main store then says we clearly priced and stated the service content, what do you mean, customer?\nThe customer surely can’t call the police file saying the chicken he found changed its tune saying it wasn’t chicken, right?\nAt most, he could complain to the Consumer Association about unreasonable pricing.\nSuch incidents have precedents.\nLuo Jincheng, a ruthless guy selling 160 pounds of drugs in a month domestically, a contemporary drug lord, was eventually only sentenced to ten months after being caught.\nAs for why this crime, theoretically deserving of ridicule a hundred and six times at Tokyo University — losing his head ten times, was finally sentenced to ten months, it wasn’t because he had great influence or connections.\nBecause this guy sold 160 pounds of rock candy.\nHe hidden in drug addicts group, telling everyone he had a lot of ’rock candy’ for sale, group members responded saying I understand, I understand, you’re selling rock candy, even praising Luo Jincheng’s caution, they wanted rock candy.\nThe deal conducted with both parties satisfied.\nCustomers tasted the sweetness, all with good reviews, asking about Luo Jincheng’s family’s health, even tried to get his address to meet in person to give gifts.\nBut none dared to call the police.\nLuo Jincheng’s best move was that he’d include Rock Candy’s assay results in the delivery, adding a pack of cheap tea, the former to prove he was indeed selling rock candy, no deception, the latter to provide a reason for his high price.\n—After all, the market price of tea is quite non-transparent; as long as Luo Jincheng says he considers it good tea, selling a pack of rock candy for a thousand is reasonable.\nIt took time to clarify the case, and before the formal verdict, he was detained for ten months, if declared not guilty, these ten months required considerable compensation.\nThus the Demon Suppression Bureau forcibly gathered seven customers who bought rock candy, accumulating the amount to 7000 to file a case, sentencing to ten months.\nThis drug lord was indeed a genius.\nAfter seeing the operation of this brother, Lin Li suspected these gaming shops were playing the same game.\nIsn’t it just another form of a new type of Immortal fraud?\nAnd the price of gaming companionship has no reference point, making it difficult to accuse of fraud.\nWhen Lin Li asked if they had a physical store, saying he could go over to buy and enjoy the service, they without hesitation stated no and refused, only accepting dispatches.\nOne of them even directly blocked him:\n[\"Due to the other party’s privacy settings, TA can’t receive your message.\"]\nThe other party actually sensed he was fishing so keenly.\nLin Li looked at the exclamation point on the screen with unspeakable emotions.\nCrap, I’ve become Bai Bufan.",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Chapter 51: Away from Home, Relying on Brothers\nThis method can only catch loose cultivators, and the efficiency is rather low.\nTrying to trace the leads to clear out the stronghold becomes exponentially difficult; once a gecko loses its tail, the investigation might take several months—after all, the priority for such cases isn’t particularly high.\nAnd it’s unclear whether the system acknowledges this method.\nLin Li thought about it and decided to put it aside for now, following the original plan to bike to a relatively remote area of Xiling Town to see if the system could give him any notifications.\nOpening the Wicked Map, he picked a direction that seemed remote in Xiling from his memory and biked there.\nSometimes Lin Li really feels like the system is like a frigid lady; he’s already up and pedaling, yet it gives him no response, not even a peep.\nLin Li was getting exhausted from pedaling.\nLin Li recalled a saying, success comes from hard work afterward.\nSo true.\nSo maybe tomorrow and today, let’s just rest and talk about it the day after tomorrow.\nWith this thought, Lin Li biked past an intersection. When his brain finally reacted to what his peripheral vision caught, he suddenly pressed the brake, leaving a faint black mark on the cement ground with the bicycle wheel.\nJust now... did I see an... old friend?!\nLin Li quickly turned around, returned to the intersection, and changed direction. Once he found that back figure, he accelerated immediately, going around a drainage ditch and stopping his bike right in front of the person.\nSeeing that somewhat familiar face, if it weren’t for the inappropriate setting, Lin Li would’ve shouted excitedly.\nMenma, I finally found you!\nHowever, unlike Lin Li’s emotions, the other person was startled by the sudden appearance of a bicycle blocking the way, taking two steps back and cursing: \"What the—how do you ride a bike like that! Your dad’s back home planting loquat trees, go check on him!\"\nLin Li raised an eyebrow.\nThis guy’s swearing skills are something; he’s both a warrior and a scholar. I should note down that last sentence to use on Bai Bufan later.\nForget it, use it on Wang Yuezhi instead; Bai Bufan might not understand it with his literary skills.\n\"Bro, it’s me!\" Lin Li called out sincerely.\nThe other person was momentarily stunned upon hearing this, pausing his insults and scrutinizing Lin Li, who was wearing a school uniform and riding a bicycle, his expression gradually relaxing: \"Oh—~~\"\nLin Li also smiled, making things easier.\n\"—Who the hell are you?\" The person’s tone suddenly changed, turning hostile on the spot.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDidn’t recognize me, are you some kind of a dam or something?\n\"You’re still a high school student, right? I don’t know many people your age. Stop trying to form ties with me. If you know me, what’s my name then?\" The other’s attitude wasn’t particularly friendly.\n\"I actually don’t know your name.\" Lin Li admitted.\n\"Luckily I’ve been vaccinated against rabies, otherwise I’d have to run. Move out of the way.\" Saying so, the other person started to walk to the side, seemingly intending to bypass Lin Li.\nLin Li remained calm, believing that their bond would tighten once the other recognized him, so he turned to the man preparing to pass by him, trembling and tearfully said:\n\"The Light Noble Toilet by Daming Lake, the bottle of miracle oil you didn’t finish, the salute the police couldn’t stop, our past memories, have you forgotten them all——\"\nThe man’s footsteps suddenly stopped.\nIn a few seconds of silence and quietness, the man slowly turned his head mechanically and incredulously, looking at Lin Li with surprise.\nLin Li responded with the same surprised look.\nHe reached out his trembling finger: \"Is it... you?\"\n\"It’s me!\" Lin Li nodded heavily.\nThe man before him was the one he encountered in the toilet last Friday, narrowly escaping being caught!\n\"It really is you! You are...\" The man said excitedly, intending to call Lin Li by name, but then remembered he never knew it, quickly correcting himself: \"·Bro·!\"\n\"It’s me, I’m bro, and you are my... ·bro· too!\"\nLv Xiucai once said, names are just a code. One bro for a lifetime. Lv Ziqiao also said, just call someone not known \"producer\". Therefore, Lin Li nodded heavily, joy overflowing.\nAt this time, both of them became known as bro.\n\"Bro!\"\n\"Bro!\"\nThe two fools in the eyes of passersby began calling each other bro like this.\n\"Sorry, bro, it’s not that I don’t consider you a bro; it’s just when you suddenly put on clothes, I really didn’t recognize you.\" After calling each other bro seven or eight times, the man apologized to Lin Li.\n\"...\"\nLin Li stepped back half a step: \"Bro, I don’t think we’ve ever been frank, I’ve always had my clothes on.\"\nCould it be that he mistook me for another bro, if this guy plays both sides, Lin Li needs to start planning a retreat strategy now.\nThe butt is more important.\n\"Oh, sorry, sort of what I meant. I generally don’t remember men’s faces; you changed clothes, couldn’t recognize you, that’s it.\" The man explained, patting Lin Li on the shoulder.\nNow that could be understood.\nThen the man asked curiously: \"Little bro, how come you’re already out? There’s still quite a while before fifteen days, right?\"\nLin Li shook his school uniform: \"Big bro, I’m only seventeen, plus I’ve some connections inside, so I wasn’t detained even for a day, just got released.\"\nSomeone in the Demon Suppression Bureau wants to be my dad, if that isn’t connections, what is?\n\"Oh, that makes sense. No wonder you were the one wearing a mask that day; I was wondering if you were some key figure.\" The man suddenly realized.\nLin Li was speechless.\nI actually am a key figure since without me, this entire capture operation wouldn’t have existed.\n\"That’s great, seventeen, really nice, being inside is boring; if you can avoid it, better not go through that. Seeing you’re okay, I’m genuinely happy for you, bro!\" The man patted Lin Li’s shoulder again, this time more sincerely.\nThis emotion wasn’t faked.\nThe friendship between men sometimes occurs very strangely.\nTwo complete strangers can even bond over a few mutual headlights flashes on the highway, running a hundred kilometers together in companionship, understanding the pursuit, and lamenting parting with horn honks as one exits the highway.\nEspecially with this little bro in front of him?\nTo think, they two might have shared the same path, and this isn’t something mere bros can describe; they’re akin to brother-in-laws.\nAs for what path they’re on, characterized by blending in, it’s nothing grand.\n\"Pleased to see you, but I have business to attend, let’s part ways for now?\" The guy said.\n\"Fate brought us together, bro, shall we get a midnight snack?\" Lin Li immediately suggested.\n\"Better not, really got something to do, but we’ll meet again by the rivers and lakes, let’s chat next time.\" He waved his hand, politely declining and kept walking.\nThe things he still wanted to know, how could he let him leave like this?\n\"Bro, it’s my treat!\" Lin Li shouted loudly.\nTime = Distance÷Speed.\nThen reversing time = Speed÷Distance!\nRight now the formula unfolds, time rewinds!\nThe man reversed his path, coming back into gaze with Lin Li:\n\"Now that you mention it, you’re right, meeting indeed holds fate.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 52: Chapter 52: Facing Danger with a Smile\nLin Li: \"...\"\nAlright, alright, I’ve got a better understanding of my new buddy’s quirks now.\nI really do have a knack for reading people.\nOf course, Lin Li wouldn’t let it show on his face, so he said, \"You’re absolutely right, bro. So, where are we going for some late-night snacks?\"\n\"You asked the right person. I know a nearby place that has great food! Follow me!\" The man thumped his chest.\n\"Then let’s go!\"\nThey hadn’t walked far before the other guy led him to a BBQ restaurant.\nFor some reason, even though there were seats inside, people still preferred sitting outside at the BBQ place during summer, eating meat and drinking beer with their shirts off.\nIf this were a big city instead of a small town like Xiling, these folks would definitely end up on Xiaohongshu.\nNaturally, Lin Li didn’t sit outside, because their conversation content would probably not be suitable for kids, and it wouldn’t be good if others overheard. So they picked a relatively secluded spot inside the restaurant.\n\"Want some Maotai?\" The man asked Lin Li while ticking items off the menu with a pen.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou darn old bug, I’d rather drink your brain juice right now.\nEven though I’m paying, isn’t ordering Maotai going a bit overboard?\nThis guy, you probably can’t find any info on him on Baidu, but just switch browsers to Sogou, and boom, there he is.\n\"Bro, I’m a student, not a beast. Be easy on me when you’re ordering, don’t go overboard, alright?\" Lin Li looked at the other guy with an indescribable expression.\nI can’t just spend my bonus like this.\n\"Oh, oh, sorry, my bad. When you mentioned you had connections at the firm, I thought you were some rich kid.\" Upon hearing this, the other guy sincerely apologized and promptly crossed out some of the expensive items he had just marked.\n\"Alright then, now take a look. I’ve ordered enough for two people. You probably don’t need the kidneys, so I just got one serving. It’s around sixty bucks. See if you can handle it or if you want to add anything.\"\nLin Li breathed a sigh of relief; this was still somewhat reasonable.\nThough he seemed pretty unscrupulous, he was actually quite decent.\nThe price Lin Li could still accept. After taking a quick look and adding a few skewers he wanted, he handed it over to the server.\n\"Here, have a cigarette.\" Knowing that Lin Li \"smokes\" from last time, the man didn’t ask and just placed a cigarette in front of Lin Li before lighting his own.\nThis guy is quite something; his lighter is hanging on his keychain.\nHis friends must have a hard time since they can’t even swipe his lighter.\n\"Hey, why aren’t you smoking?\" he asked when he noticed Lin Li hadn’t picked up the offered lighter.\nLin Li easily found an excuse as he pointed to his school uniform: \"I have to wear this uniform to school tomorrow, and if the teacher smells it, it wouldn’t be good. I’ll pass, you go ahead.\"\n\"My bad, my bad.\"\nHearing this explanation, the man first took a deep breath, then aimed his mouth at the cigarette and inhaled like a whale, the wind sweeping by rapidly shortening it until it burned out completely.\nAfter exhaling a thick cloud of smoke behind himself with satisfaction, he tossed the butt into the ashtray.\nWhat a speedy smoker, I bet smoking a cigarette gives you ten Gold Coins. At this rate, a pack a day wouldn’t be enough.\n\"Is that Nansang Middle School’s uniform? It was dark outside so I didn’t recognize it. A top school, impressive, kid. I thought you were from some community college. Didn’t expect students from a top school to go to such places.\" After his satisfying smoke, he examined Lin Li’s uniform and remarked in surprise.\n\"Haha, that’s how our school is.\" Lin Li gave a dry laugh.\nApologizing internally already.\nSorry, Principal Wang. Sorry, Teacher Xue Jian. Sorry to all students of Nansang Middle School past, present, and future.\n\"Jeez—I’d better advise my nephew to choose another school. He’s in third grade and about to take Nansang’s early entry exams.\" The man shook his head slightly.\n\"It’s not really about the school; it’s about the people.\" Lin Li, not wanting to dream tonight about the principal standing over his bed measuring his neck circumference, felt compelled to defend Nansang.\n\"True.\"\n\"Here’s the beer you ordered.\" The server came by, and a chilled beer arrived before the BBQ.\n\"Do you drink?\"\n\"I gotta drive later, so I won’t.\" The man turned to look at the bicycle at the entrance, nodded in agreement. A bicycle counts as a vehicle too.\nHe then said, \"I’ll just drink from the bottle, then?\"\n\"Sure.\"\nThe man chugged down a third of the beer in one go, letting out a loud burp.\nHe was the type to turn red quickly, and with his slightly flushed face, he asked Lin Li, \"Call me Brother Ping, kid. And how should I call you?\"\n\"Brother Ping, my name’s Bai Bufan, just call me Xiaobai.\" Lin Li introduced himself.\n\"When you’re out, don’t give your real info so easily. Especially folks like us. Never tell your full name. Even calling yourself Xiaohai would be fine, but Xiaobai and Xiaohai sound like dog names, so I’ll call you Xiaofan instead.\"\nBrother Ping advised Lin Li, whom he saw as overly naive, with a frown.\nLin Li blinked; his demeanor was surprisingly decent.\n\"Lesson learned, bro.\" In future, his alias would be Zhou Baowei, real name Bai Bufan—double safety.\n\"But we’re brothers on the same road, so there’s no need to be overly cautious. You’ve bared your soul to me; it’d be pointless for me to be secretive. My name’s Song Luping, just call me Brother Ping.\"\nBro, is it possible you’re even more naive than I am?\n\"Xiaofan, let me tell you, last Friday was definitely strange.\" Song Luping lowered his voice slightly, speaking seriously:\n\"Lately, Xiling hasn’t initiated any crackdown campaigns, plus Qingjue should have their own sources, more informed than even I am. Last Friday when the cops came, it’s clear it wasn’t a situation they’d pre-rehearsed.\"\nAs expected of the old bug, he saw through the whole thing immediately.\n\"Makes sense.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Damn, I’d bet my life—someone tipped them off that day. It’s that bastard’s fault the cops showed up. Damn scumbag, harming others without benefitting oneself.\"\nThe scumbag himself pressed his left hand against his lips, slightly embarrassed.\nEncore.\nGetting cursed at to the face again.\nDamn, I need to find a way to aruba Song Luping too, give him the same treatment as Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei.\nThe still-venomously-cursing Song Luping, noticing Lin Li’s silence, asked puzzled:\n\"Xiaofan, curse with me! Damn, you need to know it’s because of that bastard you got caught! Come, curse him with me fiercely! Believe me, the more we curse, that prick will get his just desserts! Justice prevails!\"\nIf I believed that, I’d be even less inclined to curse.\nBut at the moment, Song Luping was looking at him expectantly, and not cursing didn’t seem like an option.\nSorry, me.\n\"Brother Ping, you’re absolutely right, curse him! How could I not? I’m furious! That snitching pile of crap!\" Lin Li indignantly exclaimed!\n\"Must be some fatherless bastard!\"\n\"I bet he doesn’t even see his mom more than a few times a year!\"\n\"Even if he has family, he’s living like an orphan!\"\n\"Curse him—have his yang energy drop by 50%!\"\n\"Every morning he wakes up, he can barely stay hard for a moment before going soft again!\"\nLin Li cursed viciously.",

      "content": "Chapter 53: Chapter 53 Perhaps He Really Can Become the King of This Path\nLin Li was really cursing.\nEvery word came from the heart.\nAnyway, even if the curses came true, two of the things would be good outcomes.\nJust treat Song Luping as a wishing well turtle.\n\"Good, well said!\" Song Luping gave an approving thumbs-up, but then shook his head, \"Xiaofan, you’re still holding back a bit. Why are you good students so meticulous? Just go all out!\"\n\"That’s right, doing it halfway is pointless.\"\nWell, no, you have to keep it separate.\nIt might not be useful now, but you can’t do without it.\n\"No, Brother Ping, you might not understand but I think being stuck halfway is the most unbearable, neither here nor there, that’s the most vicious curse,\" Lin Li explained.\nSong Luping thought deeply and then his face darkened. He sighed, \"You’re actually right. You’re ruthless. Not completely dead, but beyond saving, it surely is painful, sigh~\"\nLin Li lowered his head to control his laughter.\nOuch, collateral damage.\n\"Make him suffer! Don’t let me find out who reported it. If he dares appear in front of me, I’ll pick up a knife and turn him into a human swine, pour chili water and essential balm below him! Then sprinkle itching powder on his back!\" Song Luping adjusted his mood and said fiercely.\nHiss—\nAs the person involved, Lin Li felt his phantom limb starting to ache, and now he was even more certain that his decision to hide his identity information was correct.\n\"Brother, are you serious?\" Lin Li asked weakly.\n\"I often kill people, you think?\" Song Luping sneered.\nLin Li scrutinized the other’s mental state, feeling like he was one of those who indulge excessively and would be flipped by ants if they go out, farting and jetting forward a thousand meters by reaction force.\nSeriously doubting whether his non-enhanced right hand could even give him a match.\nSo Lin Li’s gaze became hard to evaluate.\n\"You don’t believe?\" Song Luping seemed to have interpreted Lin Li’s gaze and was a bit anxious.\n\"Uh, I believe.\" Lin Li decided to comfort him; maybe he kills with skill.\n\"I know you still don’t believe me, I’ll prove it to you.\" Song Luping sighed and said.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nHow does one prove that, by randomly picking a lucky audience at the barbecue shop to kill?\nBrother, I’ll leave first, don’t get blood on me.\nSong Luping took a deep breath, picked up chopsticks as a weapon, cleared his throat under Lin Li’s vigilant gaze, \"Chili pepper fried meat mixed noodles!\"\nLin Li was stunned for a moment, then quickly gave a thumbs-up, \"Brother, now I believe you’re from Changsha!\"\n\"You believe it now, right?\" Song Luping nodded with some smugness, but then said sullenly, \"How could I really have the guts to kill, even if that beast really stood in front of me, I also have to weigh the situation, see what’s going on with the other side.\nIf they look strong, I’ll act like nothing happened, if they look weak, I’ll intimidate fiercely, Xiaofan, you haven’t entered society yet, remember this tactic of mine, a real man should be able to endure humiliation for the greater goal.\"\nThe worst slander against men being \"real men,\" Lin Li silently complained in his heart.\nAt this point, the barbecue started to arrive one after another, and the two began to eat for a bit.\n\"Brother Ping, I have something I want to ask you, I don’t know if you can help me.\" After eating a skewer of mutton that had a slightly gamey taste, Lin Li decided to steer the conversation to the main topic.\n\"What’s the matter, tell me.\" Song Luping was not surprised at Lin Li suddenly saying this.\nOn the contrary, if Lin Li simply invited him for a meal, he would be suspicious and unsure of Lin Li’s intentions. Now if he had a request, Song Luping would feel more at ease.\nOf course, the socially astute Song Luping would never rashly make any promises before hearing what Lin Li had to say.\n\"Brother, now that Qing Jue has been closed, if I still want to eat chicken in Xiling Town, where should I go? Do you have any recommendations?\" Lin Li lowered his voice once again and inquired.\nHe couldn’t find these places himself because he was an outsider, but Song Luping seemed different, he looked like an experienced player who could help Lin Li out.\nThe system unwillingly keeps it a secret from him, but he can.\nOtherwise, why would Lin Li seem so eager when he saw him?\nSong Luping was taken aback by this, losing his grip on the chopsticks, the meat fell onto the table.\nIt seemed like several seconds passed before he reacted to what he had heard, astonished, \"Xiaofan, you just got caught, and now you’re planning to go exploring again?\"\n\"No choice, at this age, the addiction is a bit strong, and it ended too soon last time, making it even more uncomfortable, I don’t want it myself,\" Lin Li said with a somewhat embarrassed expression, scratching his head.\n\"Aren’t you afraid of getting caught again?\"\n\"Oh, I’m at this age now, right? I have a buff on me with a protection mechanism, even if I’m caught, I’ll just get a lecture and then released. If I don’t use it now, in a few months when I become an adult, it’ll be too late for regrets.\" Lin Li reasoned logically, making a convincing case.\n\"That’s right... No!\nWhat about your family? They must already be so embarrassed by now, they must have scolded you harshly, right? If they find out you’ve been caught again, even if they beat you, outsiders would probably understand them, or even praise them for it. Aren’t you afraid of being beaten to death?\"\nSong Luping asked sincerely. When he was caught as an adult, his family found out, it was a bleak scene, let alone being underage.\n\"My mom is working outside, it’s just my dad at home, he understands me well, tells me to do as I please, if anything happens, he’ll handle it.\" Due to the previous targeted cursing, Lin Li casually fabricated details about his family.\nCan’t tell the truth anyway.\n\"Wow, your dad is beyond awesome.\" Song Luping was slightly surprised and gave a thumbs-up.\nHuh?\nLin Li frowned, this sounded strange, as if he had become part of a hell joke.\n\"Oh well, anyway, that’s the situation, I’m pretty much worry-free.\nBut Brother Ping, I’m not really familiar with the chicken farming industry here in Xiling, I only knew about Qing Jue, which was told by an outsider. Now that Qing Jue is gone, I’m at a loss of where to go.\nBut I just can’t suppress my inner desires and needs, I desperately want to...\nI think Brother Ping, you should be more experienced in this area than I am, so brother, can you tell me about some other chicken farms in Xiling?\"\nLin Li crossed his hands on the table, leaned forward slightly, and looked at Song Luping sincerely, expressing his wish.\n\"Really planning to go? Not joking?\" Song Luping fell silent, then spoke up after a moment.\n\"Really planning to go, not joking.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"You really like being a player?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"You’re really passionate about this industry? Even if it means risking getting caught again?\"\n\"...Yeah.\"\nThe two began an empty question and answer session.\nLin Li naturally followed the logic of being hormonally driven, but some of Song Luping’s questions actually made it hard to hold back.\nCouldn’t you just give me a few addresses, brother?\nAre you evaluating my qualifications now?\nAfter asking, Song Luping fell silent.\nHe thinks he’s deeply in love with the industry, priding himself as a celestial constellations player, but at this moment, he feels like his position will soon be replaced.\nThe waves of the Yangtze River highlight the new waves pushing the old waves to the shore.\nHe’s already old.\nLooking at it now, Bai Bufan’s excitement for this industry doesn’t seem to be any less than his own before, if it were him... maybe he could really do it!\nSong Luping remained silent, Lin Li didn’t rush, silently waiting.\nFinally, Song Luping spoke, and under Lin Li’s expectant gaze, he sighed:\n\"Maybe you could really become the King of Patrons.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nIs this what I wanted to hear?",

      "content": "Chapter 54: Chapter 54: Abstract heroes in this world are as numerous as fish crossing the river\nThis thing... there’s even a king?\nDamn, could there be some kind of underground competition?\nMan, this is just too much.\n\"Addiction is big, sigh, I understand, back in the day, when I was your age, I had the spirit of ’a fine sword comes from the sharpening, the fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the bitter cold,’ overcoming gods if they block my path, overcoming Buddhas if they block my path. Back then, the sisters in Xiling would go weak at the knees when they saw me...\"\nSong Luping’s thoughts seemed to skip quickly; he began reminiscing wistfully about the glorious days of the past.\nLin Li blinked his eyes; this guy looks like he’s only in his twenties, and he’s already reminiscing? His time seems to have been too fleeting.\nWell, I guess it makes sense, after all, he’s already using magic oil now.\nBut under the current circumstances, Lin Li felt embarrassed to interrupt, so he could only listen to him reminisce and even had to play along:\n\"What do you mean? Then what happened? Right! Hey! Look at you...\"\nLin Li’s words of encouragement indeed flattered Song Luping—Koukou felt the same way during class today.\nFinally, after finishing his story, Song Luping popped a piece of flower cabbage into his mouth and voluntarily returned the conversation to the direction Lin Li hoped for:\n\"As for the other Xiling chicken farms you’re looking for, you’re asking the right person.\"\n\"Although, like the friend who told you about Light Noble, I’m technically an outsider, but I definitely know this place better than most locals.\nThe Xiling Chicken Farm, in particular, I’m practically an encyclopedia. I spend 90% of my salary on this every month,\" Song Luping said proudly.\nThere’s nothing to be proud of for something like that, right?\nBut Song Luping indeed lived up to Lin Li’s expectations, and upon hearing this, Lin Li clenched his fist under the table and gave a little pump.\nHe finally saw the light of completing the mission.\n\"What do you need from the chicken farm? Just say it, as long as Xiling has what you’re looking for, I can tell you. Honestly, Light Noble isn’t considered particularly good in Xiling; it’s average quality with a high price tag. It’s just that there’s a chicken there with high emotional intelligence that gives me something I can’t get elsewhere, so I occasionally go there.\"\nSong Luping waved his hand and spoke with the manner of a guru.\n\"Thank you, Brother Ping, my requirements might be a bit picky, so bear with me.\nI don’t accept takeaways; after all, you understand, I definitely can’t bring someone home, that would be too much, and I don’t really want to open a hotel. Besides the extra one or two hundred expenses for a hotel, mainly I feel the identity verification part would be problematic...\nMy personal preference is more for on-site service places like Light Noble; I want to spend all my money on the essential parts, even if it means paying a bit of a premium. Additionally, in case of mismatches, I can immediately complain and exchange with the madam...\"\nLin Li’s reasoning was sound, crafted to paint a certain picture that his ultimate goal was to locate the Hehuan Demon’s lair that the Demon Suppression Bureau could collectively raid.\nLin Li carefully stated his conditions as long as Song Luping didn’t seem upset or troubled.\nHowever, Lin Li found it somewhat strange that even after expressing all his conditions, Song Luping’s face not only didn’t show difficulty but also seemed to have a hint of satisfaction?\nWhat are you so happy about?\nThat left Lin Li a bit confused, feeling slightly uneasy.\n\"You’re quite ambitious,\" Song Luping slowly started speaking after Lin Li finished, \"You have a lot of conditions, and your unique choices...\"\n\"Brother Ping, do I have too many conditions? I can lower them...\" Lin Li quickly changed his approach upon hearing his words.\n\"No no no no—\" Song Luping quickly waved his hand when he heard that, deeply moved with emotion. \"Successors, successors indeed! Bai Bufan, do you think there are many conditions? No, there are too few!\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Initially, I thought you were just a youngster getting carried away, but now it seems you’re an ambitious, high-level bug.\nBufan, do you know how long I’ve been searching for my kind in this world? So long that I had given up, but now, I’ve finally found you,\" Song Luping said, quite touched.\nLin Li: \"??\"\n\"I know, even without me, you would become the true king of Xiling Pimping in the future, but now, I will lend you a hand on this path, helping you reach that height more quickly! Don’t worry, I seek nothing in return, just that our souls resonate, and it happens that my body isn’t what it used to be; many people’s businesses I can no longer attend to, but you can.\"\nLin Li: \"???\"\nLin Li looked at Song Luping’s ramblings with a face full of confusion.\n[The world is complex, with opportunities and crises coexisting. On the quest to find the Hehuan Demon, you unexpectedly encountered a reclusive expert, who alas had been devoured and beguiled by the Hehuan Demon, fully falling into an evil path.\nThe expert is pleased by your talent, intending to impart his lifelong knowledge to you.\nUse the power of filth to eliminate demons, though his heart remains upright; falling into an evil path doesn’t mean there’s no turning back.\nWill you eliminate the demon or advise him to return to the righteous path?]\n[Mission Triggered!]\n[Mission 5: Bring Song Luping back to the righteous path or send him to the Demon Suppression Bureau.]\n[Reward: Random Ability*1; System Currency*50]\nWhat’s with the system again sticking its hand in here?\nAfter a quick glace at the mission description, Lin Li blinked his eyes.\nThe question is whether it’s easier to persuade an old bug to abstain and become a monk, or to send him in easier?\nLin Li already had an answer in his heart.\nThis system is really twisted, teaching me to backstab, betray my teacher, and disgrace my ancestors.\nYou’re really putting me in a difficult spot.\nDeep down, Lin Li was firmly against doing such things, but the system’s coercion left him with no other option.\nHowever, before betraying his teacher, he thought it best to first learn all his skills from him, so he temporarily put this mission aside and instantly asked Song Luping:\n\"Brother Ping, I didn’t quite understand what you meant by that.\"\n\"Though you have many requests, there are definitely places in Xiling Town that can meet your demands. In my impression, there should be three or four,\" Song Luping said.\nLin Li raised an eyebrow; the number was sufficient.\n\"Brother, can you tell me?\" Lin Li listened attentively, preparing to hear. If not for the fact it might seem too obvious, he would’ve opened his phone to record right away.\n\"Even if I told you now, I could only give you an overview. The specific addresses, contact information, and passwords—I can’t remember them all by heart. They’re all written in a notebook or saved on my phone.\nWhen I return home, I’ll organize all the chicken farm information I possess, including those that don’t meet your criteria, display their pros and cons, and compile a table to send you. Then you’ll be able to make your selections based on your situation.\nAfter all, spoken words have a margin of error, and it’s better for you to do the filtering yourself for a better experience.\"\nLin Li widened his eyes, sensing that the direction of the situation had taken a tiny unexpected turn.\nCompiling a table? Is this guy at work until he’s gone mad? Doing spreadsheets after work?\n\"...Why?\" There’s no such thing as a free lunch, Lin Li couldn’t help but ask.\nAnd true to form, the twist quickly came out of Song Luping’s mouth:\n\"Listen to me, Bufan, I need you to agree to a few requests,\" Song Luping gestured and then said.\nLin Li clutched his phone, uncertain if he had enough balance.\nSeemingly understanding Lin Li’s intention, Song Luping waved his hand: \"As I said, I seek nothing in return. I’m not asking for money; do I seem like someone who cares about money?\"\nLin Li glanced at the barbecue on the table and then at the bottles of Moutai on the wall behind him.\nHe nodded, emphatically.\nSong Luping: \"...\"\n\"Ahem, business is business. For this matter, I truly don’t want your money; today is just because payday is in a few days, and I’m short on cash.\"\n\"Xiaofan, I only need you to promise me to follow a few simple principles in the future.\"\n\"Brother Ping, please go ahead,\" Lin Li asked cautiously.\n\"Alright, Bai Bufan, listen carefully to what I am about to say!\"\n\"First, when eating chicken, you must wear a baby burp bag, pay attention to your own safety and health.\"\n\"Second, do not enter red lights forcibly; don’t go through the back door.\"\n\"Third, don’t fight battles you can’t win, don’t overspend, don’t procrastinate on debt! Transactions should only be conducted with hard-to-trace coins!\"\n\"Fourth, absolutely no girls under eighteen, that’s a strict rule!\"\n\"Fifth, you must have showered within two days and washed your hair within three days before going.\"\n\"Sixth...\"\nSong Luping earnestly detailed each rule to Lin Li.\nAnd Lin Li at this moment—\n\"?\"\nWhat on earth are you babbling about?\nThe world it seems, has abstract heroes abundant as river crucian carps.\nI am still too weak, lacking power.",

Requirements for a model ladybug selection?\n\"Sixty-seventh, afterward, if the lady hasn’t left immediately, gently praise her.\"\n\"Seventy-fourth, during the spending, do not engage in any recording or other trace-leaving actions.\"\n\"Eighty-seventh...\"\nSong Luping was still earnestly delivering.\nHow come there are more... Master, stop reciting, I’m getting dizzy from all these, what were the dozens of rules before?\nEven though my memory has improved by 100%, it’s not to the point where I can remember everything just by hearing it once.\nThe \"Nansang Student Rulebook\" is not this complicated.\nLin Li felt a headache coming on.\n\"There are about a mere hundred and three rules. If I’ve missed something and think of others later, I’ll add them. Xiaofan, have you remembered them all?\"\nSong Luping finally stopped, took a drink from a bottle on the table due to his dry throat, and then asked.\nLin Li wanted to nod but feared Song Luping would really test him, so he honestly shook his head: \"Sorry, Brother, it’s too long; I didn’t remember everything.\"\n\"That’s normal; no one can remember it all at once. I’ll organize these rules and send them to you later.\nFor now, the purpose of telling you is just to ask if there’s anything in them that you find completely unacceptable. This is very important.\" Song Luping didn’t mind and waved his hand; then he seriously looked at Lin Li.\n\"No.\" After all, I’m not actually looking for the Hehuan Demon; these rules have nothing to do with me, so why wouldn’t I agree?\nEven if Song Luping said to spend money without touching to do charity, Lin Li would agree.\n\"Good! Very good! I knew I wasn’t wrong about you!\" Song Luping seemed a bit excited but quickly calmed down, nodding in approval:\n\"Xiaofan, remember, engaging in this is an art, and it has its principles. If we’re going to do it, we must do it as the noblest ladybugs! Never sink to the level of those foul, decaying uncles like Huang Mao.\nThey only consider themselves and never think about the future and development of this industry.\nOnly through sustainable depletion can we have a reason for existence and earn respect, do you understand?\"\n\"Completely understand!\" Lin Li, as if seeing a beautiful scene, had eyes full of hope.\n——Completely do not understand.\nEven if I used my small head to think, I couldn’t reach a consensus with Song Luping.\nThis guy was really muddled by frequenting prostitutes.\nHowever, Lin Li could see that Song Luping considered him a kindred spirit, which made him so excited. All this art and king of procuring was probably his own imagination.\nJust cooperate a little, anyway, my own goal can be achieved.\n\"I knew you’d agree. Since you have, then I will share everything I have with you for free as promised.\nAfter going back tonight, I’ll start compiling the documents and information, but this will take some time.\nBecause I haven’t frequented some shops for a long time, I don’t even know if they’re still open. If I provide you with false information, it would be irresponsible to you, and I can’t allow myself to do that.\nSo, I might be a bit busy these days, working overtime to inspect them. Anyway, you still need to study, so you shouldn’t be in a rush for a few days, right? By the weekend, I’ll first send you the initial version of Xiling’s map for eating chicken, and as I make updates later, I’ll send you the final version.\nAt that time, the sky’s the limit for you!\nSong Luping spoke with sincerity, reached out, rubbed his waist and passionately declared:\n\"Old chap, let’s fight for a few more days! Pave the way for newcomers!\"\n\"Of course, no problem,\" Lin Li felt somewhat touched, tears welled up in his eyes: \"But, Brother, you’re already so exhausted, and you say you need to work overtime and visit places these days? What about your health, and aren’t you without a salary...\"\nBeing so weak already, if next time we meet, and you’re left with just five pounds along with the box, how am I going to complete the task?\nDoes returning from the Bridge of Helplessness mean turning back?\nOr send the ashes to the Demon Suppression Bureau to complete the task?\nIf it doesn’t, Master, please wait until the day your disciple betrays you before you pass away.\n\"First, this isn’t exhaustion; I just put on a Western decadent makeup look, personal preference.\" suddenly emphasized the excited Song Luping seriously and firmly.\nMen’s pride in this area is surprisingly strong.\nLin Li smiled, sure, if you say so.\nHe nodded, and then Song Luping proudly added:\n\"Secondly, regarding money, indeed the money for meals is gone, but there’s still money for foot baths, rest assured.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nInverted consumption view.\nThe 90% gold content is still increasing, apparently prioritizing looking for the Hehuan Demon over eating.\nFinding Song Luping was indeed the right choice; he wasn’t wrong. No one in Xiling Town could match him in this field.\n\"Lastly, even if we go ten thousand steps back, getting hurt a little for you is worth it.\nThe new medicine I bought has arrived, and with it, I can burn my last potential, and I’m sure I can support you to become the king of Xiling’s ladies.\nAt that time, witnessing all this would make me happy to retire, gratefully passing the crown onto your head.\nI believe that day won’t be long.\nBufan, do you know that in most chicken farms in Xiling Town, if you mention my name, you can get a five percent discount?\"\nLin Li was only pretending to be shocked before; now he was genuinely shocked.\nHow old of a customer must you be to get such treatment? Suddenly Lin Li felt that it was entirely normal for Song Luping to be in this state at his age.\nHowever, Song Luping wasn’t boasting; he earnestly looked at Lin Li: \"But I hope one day Xiling will echo with a legend that belongs solely to you, surpassing the master!\nAt that time, when village women disdain my weakness, and I shout your name, they will be shocked and exclaim loudly—Oh, so it was Mr. Bai Bufan’s introduction, then we have a ten percent discount!\nThe world will eventually know, without you, Bai Bufan, the paths of the profession would be shrouded in darkness!\"\nSong Luping, like a kindly elder, had eyes full of hope as he looked at Lin Li.\nAt this moment, the phrase ’hoping the student excels in the profession’ was brought to life.\nLin Li gritted his teeth, nodded emotionally, and squeezed his thigh hard, reminding himself not to lose composure.\nKeep a straight face, don’t laugh, quickly think of the saddest thing recently!\nUsing the name Bai Bufan in his decision-making was indeed the right choice.\nThe image of his haircut last month flashed in his mind— great, didn’t want to laugh anymore, he was saved.\nNot only did he not want to laugh anymore, but a trace of sadness filled Lin Li’s eyes, allowing him to more cooperatively respond emotionally to Song Luping: \"Brother Ping, I will make every effort to reach this point, hold on.\"\nAnd having found a kindred spirit in Lin Li, Song Luping was beyond words with joy and excitement to receive such a response.\nBefore, when he talked about these concepts and points of view with his ladybug pals, they called him a gigantic fool, but Bai Bufan was different, he recognized him! He’s one of his kind!\nTo die for one’s confidant.\nAnd Song Luping was willing to sacrifice for his confidant.\nThe path to the throne is always filled with thorns.\nHe had wanted to ascend it himself, but alas, he gloomily realized he didn’t have the ability.\nNow Bai Bufan has come.\nSo, he’s willing to pave the way for the other, to cut through the thorns!\nI, Song Luping, will be the man behind the future Ladybug King! Supporting him silently all the way!\nThis is... the legacy!",

Although it has a Moments feature, it has no personal information, so Song Luping wouldn’t suspect he’s not Bai Bufan.\n\"[Def.] requests to add you as a friend.\"\nWhoa, it’s a single-character ID with a black and white anime male avatar. Could it be that Brother Ping is also an online God?\n\"Uh... Bufan, is this ’Tutor Randomly Checks My Thesis and Gets Shocked’ you?\" Song Luping frowned, sensing something was amiss.\n\"Yes, Brother Ping, that’s me.\" Lin Li was using his secondary account to adopt such a nickname.\nSong Luping looked at the smitten Patrick Star profile picture and twitched his mouth slightly.\nDid he really find someone suitable to inherit his mantle?\nSuddenly, Song Luping felt less confident.\n...\nAfter they added each other, they continued eating barbecue and chatting, pouring out their hearts, though half-true and half-false.\n——Everything Lin Li said was fake, while everything Song Luping said was true.\nNot sure if Song Luping is a lightweight, Lin Li always feels like they’ve only drunk one bottle, yet the other party was already getting tipsy, pulling him and saying a lot of things he would only say at a table with kids.\nThings like his first love, his first time, etc., etc.\nToday’s boxers are red—Song Luping even told Lin Li that.\nThe other party was so sincere, and thinking about the contents he shared, none of which were true, Lin Li felt a bit guilty.\nLin Li originally planned to reciprocate.\nSong Luping gave him a map, he would give him something in return.\nIt was reasonable.\nBut now, that thought had slightly changed.\nMaybe he could try hard to guide him back to the right path? Make it a Happy Ending?\nThey just ordered seventy yuan worth of food, and before realizing it, they finished eating quickly.\nThere was no further intention to order more, and Lin Li called the server to settle the bill.\n\"Bufan, how can I let you treat? I was just kidding. As the elder brother, I’ll pay for it!\" The slightly tipsy Song Luping squinted and said loudly.\nLin Li smiled while showing his QR code to let the shop scan it.\nDamn you.\nIf you wanted to pay, you should’ve gotten up.\nYou’re sitting at the farthest spot and only said it after I took out my phone, and you had no intention to stop me at all. Isn’t that a bit too much?\nNot even willing to argue about it with me?\nMaybe Song Luping was afraid that Lin Li didn’t know social etiquette and would really make him pay.\nDamn adults.\nLin Li retracted his earlier thoughts, he should still ’send’ Song Luping in.\nOnce a prankster, always a prankster; turning over a new leaf is impossible!\n\"Brother Ping, so that’s it, I’m heading back?\" As the two walked shoulder to shoulder out of the barbecue shop, Lin Li, unlocking his bike, said to Song Luping.\n\"Alright, Bufan, be careful on your way back, I’ll start organizing things when I get back.\" Song Luping nodded.\n\"Brother, you should be the one being careful.\" Watching the slightly swaying Song Luping, Lin Li said weakly.\nBefore you send me the Xiling Town chicken farm map, you have to stay alive.\nIf you’re going to die, at least do it afterward.\n\"No worries, my home is not far, right over there.\" Song Luping waved his hand and pointed in a direction.\nLin Li looked at the direction Song Luping pointed—at the barbecue shop—and fell silent.\nIs it your home, really?\nSighing, Lin Li ultimately half accompanied, escorting Song Luping to the building of his residence before biking back home.\nGot an address, now the reference materials for sending him to the Demon Suppression Bureau are even richer.\n...\nAt home.\nLin Li was in a good mood.\nThe most troublesome problem was finally resolved.\nNow he just had to wait for Song Luping to send him the chicken farm’s Book of Life and Death, so he could randomly select a lucky one to raid.\nThis weekend should be the time to act—even if Song Luping doesn’t send the document before that.\nBecause in the subsequent conversations, Song Luping mentioned that Lin Li remembered a chicken farm that met his requirements, although the location was remote and not the best option.\nBut there was a target, and if Song Luping didn’t send the document, he’d just investigate and raid it.\nYangliang would be so happy, as he would bring them more achievements.\nXiling Town’s Yellow Heaven would be eradicated by his hands.\n\"Buzz—buzz—\"\nJust as he sat on the sofa enjoying thoughts of the future, Lin Li noticed his phone on the coffee table starting to vibrate continuously.\n\"Did you organize so quickly?\" With this thought, Lin Li unlocked his phone.\nMessage after message popped up crazily on the lock screen, and he barely saw one before the next one crowded it out.\nWas he being bombarded with texts?\nLin Li unlocked his phone and clicked on one message:\n\"Wang Yuezhi engages in solicitation and doesn’t pay! Wang Yuezhi engages in solicitation and doesn’t pay! Wang Yuezhi engages in solicitation and doesn’t pay!\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nIs this for real? So there’s an expert around me. Wow, Wang Yuezhi, with your prominent appearance, I really couldn’t tell, huh? If you said earlier, I’d have become your buddy right away! I was already bored with Bai Bufan’s group!\nNext message.\n\"Last night, Wang Yuezhi checked into a hotel behind his wife’s back! Such wild play! Click the link to watch the video!\"\nLin Li: \"??\"\nHuh?\n\"Wang Yuezhi posing as a loli luring Hawking to Loli Island...\"\n\"Wang Yuezhi tricking students with an absentee list as an attendance list...\"\n\"Wang Yuezhi giving the Japanese a nuclear bomb, claiming it’s a hand warmer...\"\nLin Li checked these messages and realized they were all attacking Wang Yuezhi. He deduced they were probably not true, just deliberate slandering.\n\"It’s quite rhyming.\"\nBut what happened? Why are these messages sent to his phone? And the sending numbers are different; it’s not the same number continuously sending them.\nWeChat messages popped up, but it wasn’t from Song Luping.\n\"Bai Bufan: Did something happen?\"\nGreat, no need to deduce, the culprit returns to the crime scene, the mastermind was found.\n\"Lin Li: ’Screenshot’.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Hahaha.\"\n\"Lin Li: Was it you? What’s going on?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: No, I was still looking for our target tonight, but then ran into a sister who wanted to have a nude chat with me.\"\n\"Lin Li: Go on.\"\nLin Li waited for Bai Bufan to continue explaining.\nBai Bufan shouldn’t be foolish enough to believe in such things, and the fact that the messages targeted Wang Yuezhi already explained a lot.\n\"Bai Bufan: There’ve been so many anti-fraud campaigns; hearing isn’t as good as experiencing. So I decided to test it out.\nSo I became Wang Yuezhi. The sister asked about my preferences and likes, saying she liked mine too, claiming we were a match made in heaven, and started inviting me for a nude chat.\nI had my philosophical mask ready, but she insisted we do it on the software she sent over.\nI suspected a virus, so I used a virtual machine to download it.\nTurns out the software wasn’t really a virus, but once launched, requested an update, which turned out to be asking for information access permission to fetch phone information.\nAccording to my predictions, I just made up a phone contact list on the virtual machine, with only your information being real.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Then we started the video chat. Lin Li, you wouldn’t believe it; whether it was AI or a prerecorded video, it looked pretty real.\nSeeing me wearing a mask, she initially tried convincing me gently, but when I refused to reveal my face no matter what, she suddenly turned sour and started arguing. We ended up with six of us hurling insults at her, and even made her cry.\"\nLin Li blinked.\nDamn.\n\"Bai Bufan: She just messaged us asking for 600 yuan, what a clown.\"\n\"Lin Li: The most humane thing you did in all this was not using my name.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: We’re bros at heart.\"\n\"Lin Li: I feel kinda guilty now. If I knew earlier, I wouldn’t have teamed up with Chen Yu Ying during lunch.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: \"Voice Message\" 60s·\"",

      "content": "Chapter 57: Thoughts on Launch\nGet to the point.\nIt’s finally going on sale, folks. It’s time for you to support me.\nIt will be available at midnight on the 13th, with a base update of ten thousand words. There might be a few minutes delay, but it’s really good, so make sure to subscribe!\n--\nRambling.\nI have a lot of feelings. I’m really happy that everyone likes this abstract novel, which I absolutely didn’t expect.\nYou’ve done well.\nIt’s not in vain that I wake up at four every morning, hiding under the covers, wiping away tears while memorizing ideas.\nIn reality, I’m a very shy, introverted, socially anxious little boy. I really envy those who are naturally gifted in abstraction, and even with effort, I’m still far behind them.\nI’ll just have to keep trying harder.\nBack to talking about this book.\nYou can all see that it’s an abstract daily life novel, now and in the future.\nCombat power is not the core of this book, abstraction is.\nTo put it bluntly, now that Lin Li has combat power, who is he going to deal with? My ability to write about showing off and face-slapping, well, my previous failed book already showed me the answer, even roadside writer Bai Bufan does it better than me.\nBut since I’ve received these rewards, there must be useful, substantial feedback. That’s why this book is published as a light novel, not a city novel.\nHowever, even back then, it was mainly about abstract fun, and the foundational rewards early on destined Lin Li to be extraordinary at that time.\nBut that’s still a long way off. At least in the early and even mid stages, it will be at the current pace.\nBefore then, let Lin Li happily go about his unique life in the ordinary urban setting, talking about love, making money, sweeping away vice, enjoying an extraordinary life.\nOf course, choosing a daily narrative has its consequences. Daily life novels are the easiest to foster a book, and I rarely cut off Chapters. Additionally, reading too much abstraction in a short time can wear you out, so it’s suitable for a burst of fun, then a break, and then another burst of fun, with debuff stacks maxed out.\nThat’s why there are many, many readers choosing to give this book positive reviews (I’m a little fairy boy, bad reviews get deleted, so you only see good reviews) and then fostering the book. The book’s subscription-to-follow ratio is quite remarkable.\nAuthors thought I had ten or twenty thousand followers, but in reality, it’s in the low thousands. This ratio is quite remarkable after starting at the anti-theft point.\nBook nurturing is quite fatal for new books at the starting point. Fortunately, my base is large enough, so I still have thousands of readers following the updates, helping me get the basic recommended reads. Sincerely thank all the readers who have been following the updates, Arigato Pleasant Goat san, when I push you forward in the future, I’ll do my best!\nAfter it goes on sale, it’d be great if you can still follow the updates. For readers nurturing the book, consider turning on auto-subscription. If not, make sure to buy it once in a short time. Once again, Arigato.\nThe positive feedback from data can stimulate the author and create a positive cycle.\nOn the first day of sales, according to tradition, ten thousand a day.\nBut afterward, I can’t manage eight thousand or ten thousand every day. I hope everyone understands, abstract writing often relies on inspiration. Forcing it won’t be fun or abstract, just getting more off-track and shortening my lifespan.\nThe writing speed of this novel has set my slowest writing record, often staring blankly at the computer, wondering how to make it interesting next.\nHere’s a joke: I promised to update 6 to 8 thousand a day, what I meant was 6 characters to 8 thousand characters. If I take a day off, isn’t \"mmm...dah\" seven characters, so how’s that breaching a contract?\nSeriously, updates will definitely be more than upon release, aiming for a stable 5 to 6 thousand, with occasional explosive updates!\n—— I should add, dear readers, try to comment in the main text, as you can see, I’m quite diligent about reading comments. Nonsense, how can one person’s abstraction compare to everyone’s? I’ve already copied so much from the comment section into the novel.\nAnd I’ll copy more in the future.\nAlthough zombies aren’t interested in your brains, I’m interested!\nHow can abstract novels be written without crowdfunding?\nTo add another note, if you don’t understand any jokes, just ask. There’s always a helpful reader willing to explain.\nI’m not going to do any sentimental or self-pitying sellout speeches. In short, dear readers, just subscribe, vote monthly tickets, and comment more!\nNext is the thank you and book promotion section. The following authors greatly helped me with their Chapter promotions. Although I’ve already done a sellout speech, let’s thank them again.\n\"Fairy Tail: I Don’t Want To Be The President\"\nWant to eat popsicles, the towering tree in the light novel world, currently the number one in Fairy Tail at the starting point. According to rumors, every light novel writer must pay homage to popsicles and offer 50% of the manuscript fee, otherwise they’ll be blacklisted in the light novel world.\n\"Just About to Take the College Entrance Exam, The Divorce Comeback System Arrived\"\nJuly Fengyang, habitually called Lao You. According to rumors, Tianxian and Lao You formed a dazzling duo in the abstract world. I’m quite dazzling, and he’s also stellar.\n\"Crossing Together: Me and Countless Mes\"\n\"Ninja School Teacher, I Become Stronger By Teaching\"\nRice and Orange, the top dogs in the Naruto world, also formed a dazzling duo. Rice is stellar, Orange is also stellar.\n\"I Can Summon Absurd Partners\"\nDazzling! Dazzling! Dazzling is here! Too dazzling! No need for further words! Great!\nOkay, no more boasting. After the absurd free trial period, interested readers should subscribe. Recommended viewing order: normally see the modified Fight Break then skip to the end of the Fight Break sub-story midway if it seems boring, then find Ten Cool and Piggy Hero in the remaining sub-stories. The other four or five sub-stories are purely up to personal interest, not written very well.\n\"Demonic Master\"\nHere’s another recommendation for an old friend’s new book, Brother Mo Wei. Although it’s a seedling, it’s quite dazzling. The portal and introduction are on the author’s note.\nAbove!\nPlease subscribe tomorrow!\nGoing to write now.\n——Sellout antenna on the verge of failing.\n(Drawing a Spring Breeze Elf in the comments (Antenna mold), though not much, it’s not real either.)",

Though everyone is swearing at virtual mothers online, there’s no need to get close just to get scolded.\nSixty seconds is the limit for WeChat, not Bufan Bai’s limit.\nProbably not just his voice alone; clicking it open would be a thrilling ensemble from their dorm room.\n「Bufan Bai: The dawn’s first light, the evening’s emerald glow; the rosy mist seen at twilight, like dusk on a hilltop.」\nBufan Bai suddenly decided to write a poem for himself, expressing his longing for home through descriptions of natural scenery.\nLin Li ignored.\n「Bufan Bai: I’ve had enough of your baseless accusations, we’re done, I’m teaming up with Bao Wei to bully you!\nListen up, this weekend we’re throwing a super cool party, all the school’s notable figures will be there, but guess who won’t get invited? ’American Baseball Shirt Dance Emoji’」\n「Lin Li: No problem bro, just so you guys can party, I’m going on an anti-harassment mission this weekend.」\n「Bufan Bai:?」\n「Bufan Bai: Bro, have you already found your target?」\n「Lin Li: I don’t understand what you’re saying.」\n「Bufan Bai: Hey, good bro, isn’t this a flood hitting the Dragon King’s Temple? Guess what, I suddenly remembered, though I don’t have hemorrhoids, I can learn, I love hemorrhoids!」\n「Lin Li: Aren’t you going to keep teaming up with Bao Wei to bully me?」\n「Bufan Bai: Bro, I’m just joking, my playing with Bao Wei is purely false, playing with you is the real fun. If you say the word, I’ll add mustard to his hemorrhoid cream and mix mint oil in his eye drops without hesitation.」\n「Lin Li: To be arrogant first and humble later, amusing upon reflection.」\n「Bufan Bai: Laughing! Actually laughing! Young master, you haven’t laughed in ten years. Now, being able to make you laugh, even if I die, it’s worth it.」\n「Lin Li: Alright, let’s talk more at school, and stop gathering data from other apps; don’t accidentally trap yourself. It’s getting late, let’s sleep.」\nTook a detour and had a midnight snack, now it’s almost twelve, and he hasn’t even showered.\n「Bufan Bai: Okay, sleep well.」\n「Lin Li: Press 3 for goodnight, press 2 to revive Lao Da, press 1 to send pudding.」\n「Bufan Bai: 1111 Are you really going to send it, bro?」\n「Lin Li: +3」\n「Bufan Bai: +3」\nThe chat ends here, a yawn followed. Although the body wasn’t tired today, using the brain seriously is exhausting, and ever since activating the system, Lin Li’s sleep quality has been surprisingly good.\n...\nGood sleep quality doesn’t mean easily getting up early.\nIf it weren’t for the fact that this September’s weather is still hot as summer, Lin Li’s plan to get up early would be even harder—after all, in winter, the bed is undoubtedly the place where most lingering spirits are born.\nRubbed his tired eyelids, Lin Li opened the curtain; unfortunately, the morning light at this moment wasn’t warm, his own body still cold.\nLooking at the sky, there are many clouds today, but they are bright, not dark; Lin Li checked the weather forecast, and there’s no mention of rain.\nBut as everyone knows, weather is as changeable as a woman, and forecasts as unreliable as men; better take an umbrella just in case, if there’s no rain, it can be left in the classroom as backup.\nLooking at these clouds, Lin Li’s sleepy eyes suddenly turned determined. He wiped nonexistent tears: \"Lao Da, with all your efforts, what right do I have to complain?\"\nThese clouds in Lin Li’s eyes are not just clouds; they are clearly the cotton planted by God at four in the morning, just like Kobe.\nSee that cloud, looks like a watermelon.\nSee that cloud, looks like fried chicken.\nSee those contrails left by planes, isn’t that God’s whip?\nLao Da planted so much in less than an hour; as a successor of the Mamba spirit, how dare he be weak!\n...\n[Get up strictly before 5:00 AM every day for a week, diligently practice Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, accumulate at least half an hour before 7:00 AM. (5/7)]\nOnly two days left to complete this task.\nToday is still a very easy day.\n\"Odd Chapters are physical exercise, even Chapters are magical; truly, Master Mage is the right path.\" Lin Li stretched lazily, feeling emotional.\nAlthough there are no concrete stats, Lin Li can feel he’s become healthier in just these two days.\nFor instance, his left eye which had a bit of pseudomyopia hasn’t shown any blurry vision in these two days.\nSpiritual Qi is indeed good stuff, and this is just the effect after two days, an extraordinary must-have; too bad there’s only one Spirit Stone left now.\nWhy isn’t there any in modern times?\nLet’s work hard on the anti-harassment mission, after eliminating three Hehuan Demon’s strongholds, get five more, and enjoy a leisurely day.\n\"See you, Grandpa Zhou.\" He greeted the usual NPC Xiaozhou who was always secretly watching him.\nProbably hasn’t been successful in stealing techniques these past two days, as he looks more and more frustrated.\n...\nIn the classroom.\n\"According to unofficial history, Zhuge Liang’s empty city strategy was to cut Sima Yi’s losing streak.\" Bufan Bai is still keenly discussing Three Kingdoms.",

Now they’re two yuan each. You bought two, and I paid an extra yuan. But since we’re brothers, quibbling over a couple of yuan seems unnecessary, so for now, let’s just say you owe me ten yuan.\"\nBai Bufan frowned and scratched his head, realizing things weren’t that simple. Something felt off.\n\"I’m out of money, not paying.\"\n\"No money? I’ll cover the bun inflation costs. Give me your phone.\" Lin Li smiled as he laid out breakfast on the table, making it easier for others to take their shares, and said concurrently.\n\"Where did this two hundred thousand come from?\" Bai Bufan cooperated quickly.\n\"There’s no two hundred thousand, just a thousand. It’s from your Huabei loan.\"\n\"Wait, if it’s Huabei, my limit is exactly two thousand!\"\n\"That extra thousand is my service fee.\"\n\"You definitely know how to be a middleman.\" Bai Bufan shot a middle finger and took a vicious bite of a mushroom bun, \"Inflation is really fast, even in a small place. Prices are catching up to the big cities.\"\n\"Of course inflation is fast.\" Lin Li nodded in agreement, \"Do you know Mbappe? Search for ’French supercar’ and you get him instead of cars. He earns tens of millions of euros a year. Over a hundred years ago, he wouldn’t have been worth more than a few dozen bucks; prorated, that’s a few dollars a year. The inflation rate is frightening.\"\n\"I disagree at this point. Over a hundred years ago, entering a game often included a hundred draws for free. Who knows, you might draw something valuable and make a comeback.\" Bai Bufan shook his head.\n\"You’ve got a point.\" Lin Li pinched his chin, contemplated for a moment, and then nodded.\nA wise person admits the inadequacy of their own thinking—there’s always something to learn from others, and in this regard, Lin Li realized he needed to learn more from Bai Bufan.\n\"Lin Li, which one is mine?\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice came from behind at that moment.\n\"Monitor? I was just about to bring it to you, and here you are. Look, this one’s yours.\" Lin Li turned around, saw Chen Yu Ying, and after a slight surprise, handed her her portion of the breakfast.\nNo triggered task, huh? Was it because monetary transactions might be a trigger, and he accidentally canceled it, so now it won’t trigger? Lin Li was pondering over these thoughts when Chen Yu Ying, who had taken her breakfast, didn’t leave. From her school uniform pocket, she took out a handful of assorted candies and placed them on his table:\n\"Since you won’t take my money, accept these candies. You mentioned that your recent studies have left you lacking sugar, and I like candies too. I’ve stored plenty in the dorm, so I can share a lot with you.\"\nLin Li blinked, cautiously asking, \"Monitor, what if I’m now willing to take your money?\"\nHe had indeed vowed not to take a single penny from the class monitor, but now he planned to collect five or even ten yuan.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Just kidding, just kidding. Thanks for the candies, monitor. I’ll help myself without hesitation.\" Lin Li laughed and waved his hand, putting the candies into his drawer.\nForget it, there’s no need. Monetary transactions as a prerequisite is just his speculation, not a decisive condition.\nEven though after his suggestion, Chen Yu Ying would probably continue giving him money without minding, doing so would make Lin Li feel more deceitful than Bai Bufan.\nEven if he intended to probe that condition, even if it turned out to be a necessary condition, he would choose another way in the future.\n\"Okay, if you find some candies taste good or bad, just let me know, I can adjust.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, then slightly turned, \"I’ll head back first. Let’s talk at noon?\"\n\"Sure, talk at noon.\"\nChen Yu Ying left and returned to her seat.\nMeanwhile, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei, who were acting silent and mindful of their breathing as if they were dead, suddenly came to life, and immediately fixed their gaze on Lin Li.\nBai Bufan cleared his throat, showing off a poised hand posture, and began mimicking dramatically, \"Which candy is good~~ or bad~~ you can tell me~~ I’ll adjust it~~\"\nZhou Baowei followed suit, \"I’ll head back first~~ talk at noon~~\"\nThe essence of humanity is being a repeater; the essence of personified creatures is being sarcastic repeaters.\nThe Lin Li without the system before was a bit shy, but now Lin Li, facing the two’s teasing gazes, could remain calm and even had time to return a middle finger.\nUpon discovering the thief, Lin Li immediately slapped away Bai Bufan’s hand reaching for his drawer.\n\"Not sharing even with brothers, huh? The class monitor meant she’d bring you candies every day. You don’t have to hoard them like treasures and not let me touch, right? I’ll just have one piece!\" Bai Bufan protested indignantly.\nFaced with Bai Bufan’s resentful gaze, Lin Li shook his head and said earnestly and truthfully, \"It’s not that I won’t give you, but dogs really can’t have chocolate. Here, be good, have this fruit candy, you can eat this.\"\nLin Li placed a fruit-flavored hard candy in Bai Bufan’s palm, smiling purely.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nHe stared at the fruit candy in his hand, dazed for a moment. A fierce mental battle ensued, profanities brewing for a long time, finally suppressing bluntly to say, \"Thanks, damn it, thank you.\"\n\"You’re welcome.\"\n\"Crap.\"\nAfter squeezing out that word, Bai Bufan turned back to munch on his mushroom bun.\nA wise person recognizes their inadequacy when it comes to annoying others—there’s always something to learn from others, and in this regard, Bai Bufan realized he had to learn more from Lin Li.",

I’m clearly so handsome.\"\nZhou Baowei let out a deep sigh, his tone full of exasperation.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan both looked at Zhou Baowei.\nSome things are just unbearable.\n\"Should I go first or do you want to?\" Bai Bufan asked without turning around.\n\"You go ahead.\" Lin Li responded, as the expert should always be the last to show.\n\"Okay, Bao Wei, you said the class monitor is blind, I agree, but honestly who gave you the courage to say ’why doesn’t she like you’?\nThere’s no mirror in the dorm but we have urine, you look like a QR code, people wouldn’t know what you are without scanning; how can you confidently claim to be handsome?\"\nBai Bufan nodded to Lin Li, signaling that it was his turn to speak.\nLin Li kept it simple, looking at Zhou Baowei and succinctly said, \"The doctor took forever to draw your blood, only to find it was lard.\"\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan immediately regretted, slapping his thigh.\nNo doubt, in this round of humiliating Zhou Baowei, he had lost.\n\"Lin Li, tell me, if I had said ’Bao Wei, when you’re with the crew inside the ring, do you try to steal feed from other brothers?’, wouldn’t that be more aggressive?\" he turned, humbly asking for advice.\n\"Not bad, that’s better than the QR code one.\" Lin Li thought for a moment and nodded.\n\"What if I tweak it a bit more...\"\nWatching the two seriously analyzing how to insult him in the most aggressive manner possible, Zhou Baowei remained silent.\nTheir words were really hurtful.\nHe was about to explode.\nSo I ask you, I ask you.\nActually, Zhou Baowei wasn’t even that fat, he could even be considered sturdy, his BMI was just slightly beyond the normal range, but unfortunately, his poor choice of friends meant his relationships with Lin Li and Bai Bufan magnified his flaws infinitely, leaving him doomed for life.\n\"Hey, hey, guys, can I interrupt?\" Zhou Baowei raised his hand to stop these two beasts from continuing their research, then seriously suggested, \"I think sometimes between brothers, encouragement might be appropriate, after all, I’m quite self-conscious, so I suggest you praise me more.\"\nFacing Zhou Baowei’s earnest look, Lin Li laughed:\n\"Bao Wei, if you want praise, wear a wig, put on lipstick, and post on Little Red Book, you’ll immediately have girly compliments.\nWow girl, you’ve got a great base, don’t listen to others, where are you fat? You’re the perfect slight plump, just dress up a bit and you’ll be stunning.\"\nBai Bufan laughed too:\n\"Bao Wei, Lin Li and I are from Tieba, you should understand, seeing someone like you, all we say is ’what a genuine fat pig.’\nLittle Red Book used to be a platform with barely any male users a few years ago, so under those photos Lin Li found pretty, the comments were often quite vile, sometimes more malicious than those from lustful guys.\nRemember one of the Tieba commandments:\nWhen an ugly pig evaluates another ugly pig, it will spare no praise because it knows that no matter how much it praises, it’s still a pig, and praising it is indirectly self-praising.\nWhen an ugly pig evaluates a beautiful pig, it will focus on the beautiful pig’s shortcomings, while secretly setting the beautiful pig as a goal, hoping to one day become it.\nBut when a pig evaluates a peacock, it knows it doesn’t belong to the same species as the peacock and will never become the peacock, thus it will become aggressive, hysterical, and constantly hope for the peacock’s downfall.\nAt this moment.\nOld buddies from Tieba Lin Li and Bai Bufan looked sincerely.\nZhou Baowei felt beyond hopeless.\n\"I’m outraged, I’m angry, I’m going to cosplay an 180cm sunny day doll in front of your doors.\"\nBai Bufan: \"You’re not 180cm, you’re not even taller than me.\"\nZhou Baowei paused, then roared in protest: \"Damn!!! On the height issue, you two are even more beastly, I’m not dealing with you anymore!\"\nAnd why Zhou Baowei would be so insulted.\nBeing in the back row, the heights among these buddies were naturally not short.\nBai Bufan was already 181cm at 15, but he always claimed to be just 178cm to outsiders. Lin Li once asked him why, and he said it was to make those who say they’re 180cm feel awkward.\nTo hear this reason made Lin Li marvel.\nGenius.\nFrom then on, Lin Li, who believes in lifelong learning, being 186cm, always claimed to be just 183cm.",

Was what he was about to do inappropriate?\nSo he turned to Lin Li, took a deep breath, and asked:\n\"Lin Li, if I sneak a piece of Bao Wei’s omelet now, do you think I’ll get caught?\"\n\"Probably not, but can’t you finish the food in your bowl first before eyeing what’s in the pan?\" Lin Li gave a steady analysis, \"Also, be careful in case Bao Wei is baiting us and is secretly lurking at the door, wiggling his butt and spying on us.\"\n\"True, never mind, I’ll let him off today.\" Bai Bufan nodded, finishing off the buns in a few bites, sipping through a straw from his soy milk. Excitedly, he asked, \"Lin Li, about last night, what’s the deal?\"\n\"I’ll buy you a pudding at lunch.\"\n\"Who asked about pudding—you’re really getting me one? Thanks, bro!\nAhem, but let’s talk about lunchtime stuff at lunchtime.\" Bai Bufan grinned slyly, then eagerly returned to the topic: \"Stop keeping me in suspense, you know what I want to ask. What’s the deal with having a target for the weekend?\"\n\"I ran into a buddy last night...\"\nLin Li recounted last night’s events to Bai Bufan in relative detail.\n\"So if that guy really sends me the map of Xiling Chicken Farm, we’ll have more options, and we can consider it carefully then. If he doesn’t send it, it doesn’t matter, I’ll go tonight to check out Tianhong Chicken Farm, as he mentioned.\"\n\"Going tonight? I have a feeling I’ll be sick tonight, the kind the medical office can’t cure. Wait for my sick leave note!\" Bai Bufan suddenly stood up.\nIt’s decided, toothache it is.\n\"See, you’re in a rush again. My store scouting mission tonight is just to check the surroundings outside; the real entry and consumption would wait until the weekend, what’s the hurry?\" Lin Li explained.\n\"Oh, right.\" Bai Bufan relaxed a bit and then had a moment to marvel: \"There really are professions for everything, with experts in every field.\nI never imagined there could exist a genius like Song Luping in this world, and you’re so connected with him.\nHe’s right, Lin Li, maybe you really are fated to be the protagonist, destined to become a king. The only issue is that you won’t become the king he expects—a king of indulgence—but, instead, you’ll become quite the opposite, the ’Yellow Sweep King.’\nDamn, a dark lord grooming a saint of justice, a navy admiral’s grandson wanting to become a pirate king! I can’t wait for the day he discovers your true identity, Lin Li. Make it into a novel; I’d surely follow it and praise you as the author!\"\n\"Indeed, this is my destiny.\" This was exactly him, as Lin Li had already immersed himself in the identity of the righteous saint.\n\"The skies of Xiling will change because of you; I see the future, a vast expanse of clarity. But is this a blessing, or a curse?\" Bai Bufan looked up deeply towards the sky outside the window, only to break character a second later: \"Hey, Lin Li, look over there, Lao Da is working hard today, planting so much cotton!\"\nIt seems Bai Bufan and I think alike; Lin Li felt gratified about this.\nNo longer role-playing, Bai Bufan said to Lin Li with interest: \"I really want to meet this Song Luping, this guy must be a top talent; chatting with him must be quite interesting.\"\nLin Li blinked, suddenly remembering something he forgot to mention to Bai Bufan.\n\"Oh, right, Bufan, I forgot to tell you, you actually know Song Luping.\" So he spoke gently.\n\"Huh? I’ve met him? Let me think... No, I don’t remember having any relatives with the last name Song,\" Bai Bufan furrowed his brow slightly, delving into his memories, and eventually shook his head.\nThe adults he knew were few, none fitting the description.\nSo he changed his question: \"Lin Li, or have you already introduced my buddy to this buddy of yours?\"\n\"Neither, it’s just that I used your name when in front of him.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\" Bai Bufan nodded, \"So you used my—?\"\n\"?\"\n\"¿\"\n\"Name?!\" He jerked his head, glaring intensely at Lin Li.\nLin Li nodded slightly, responding: \"Yes, exactly, so strictly speaking, he doesn’t know me; he only knows you, Bufan. He’s your buddy, not familiar with me.\"\nSo Song Luping knows Bai Bufan, but if you ask him who Lin Li is, how could he answer?\nBai Bufan’s gaze gradually darkened.\nWhile Lin Li remained calm, he didn’t forget to remind: \"If you really want to meet Song Luping and even become friends with him, I can introduce you.\nAs long as you present an excellent beetle image, he’ll see you as a confidant immediately.\nBut, Bufan, you have to remember, when you meet him, don’t say you’re Bai Bufan because Bai Bufan is already me.\"\n\"·Heh·heh, ·Lin·Li, you are the guy I’m going to eat.\" Bai Bufan gritted his teeth, forcing a smile.\n\"In the world we roam, when we’re out and about, who uses their real identity?\" Lin Li looked unconcerned, waving his hand nonchalantly, even somewhat proud.\n\"Is that your damn excuse for using my identity?! I roam the world too, what identity do I use?\"\n\"Bao Wei’s.\"\n\"Oh, that works too.\"\n\"No wonder last night you felt a slight hint of guilt when I didn’t use your name during the nude chat; turns out it was about this matter.\" Bai Bufan’s eyes showed a trace of grievance, but his expression soon relaxed considerably, \"Great, now I can finally hold my head up in front of the class leader.",

Still, Bai Bufan found Chen Yu Ying’s misunderstanding of having hemorrhoids more socially fatal. Thinking about it, he felt he’d benefited.\nWhen Lin Li understood Bai Bufan’s thoughts, he felt a bit embarrassed, patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder, and scratched his head:\n\"Bufan, you’ve misunderstood.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Whether spreading rumors with the class monitor or getting acquainted with Song Luping, Bai Bufan is the protagonist of both incidents, and they’re both true.\nI just worried that if I told you both last night, you wouldn’t be able to sleep, and I don’t want to see you with dark circles. It’d hurt my heart.\"\nLin Li gave a simple and pure smile, clean as Rick Gen V, making one’s lungs itch.\n\"?\"\nBai Bufan looked at this caring smile and indeed felt his lungs itch with anger.\n\"A blush on a young face beats all sweet talk, truly.\"\nLin Li, seeing the flushed face of the young one, deeply felt the charm of this saying.\nThe blushing young man turned even redder upon hearing: \"Sweet talk? My face is filled with curse words! Lin Li! You poet of the Wanquan Division!\"\n\"Bufan, don’t rush; there is some good news. Yesterday when I spread rumors with the class monitor, she had no reaction. She might not have remembered it at all. Should I help you to probe if she cares about this?\" Lin Li felt he was a bit out of line and thus comforted and reassured him attentively.\nBai Bufan recalled how Lin Li helped Zhou Baowei confirm situations; was that probing intelligence? That was clearly helping the class monitor strengthen her memory!\nEspecially now, Lin Li’s smile seemed eerie.\nBai Bufan became more determined about what would happen if he agreed, and his head shook like a rattle drum: \"Bro, no need, it’s fine as it is. If need be, I’ll just clench my butt in front of the class monitor and tighten my pelvic floor.\"\nSeeing the sensible kid, Lin Li felt quite gratified: \"Bufan, whoever might be lucky enough to be your dad someday, will be enjoying life.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Wait, why are you standing up?\" Bai Bufan inquired, seeing Lin Li suddenly stand up.\n\"You mentioned pelvic floor exercises, and I haven’t done them today, so might as well do a set now to avoid actual hemorrhoids,\" Lin Li answered.\nPelvic exercises can be done sitting, lying, or standing, but sitting is awkward in the classroom, so it’s better to stand.\nMakes sense.\nSo Bai Bufan also stood up.\nWhen Zhou Baowei returned and asked what they were doing, he didn’t sit down either.\nThus, if any student from the front row turned around, they would find the group in the back row all standing in their spots, tense-faced, exerting themselves.\nThis is the allure of the words ’pelvic floor exercise.’\nWhen seeing or hearing this phrase, it’s a marvel if someone doesn’t join in.\n...\nTime had reached evening, and the night classes were nearing completion when Xue Jian walked into the classroom.\nThe originally slightly restless sounds immediately quieted down.\nHaving cleaned his desk thoroughly, Lin Li silently picked up his textbook again under Xue Jian’s gaze.\nEveryone was ready to start.\n\"Night class is about to end, let me tell you something,\" Xue Jian sat on the podium desk, making everyone focus on him.\n\"The first monthly exam of this semester had its schedule discussed by the school, moving from the originally planned Friday and Saturday to a week before National Day, with dates pending. Then classes initially scheduled on Friday and Saturday fall during the autumn break.\"\nThe classroom, which had been quiet for less than half a minute, immediately became noisy again.\nOriginally, the autumn break was designed decades ago for students to go home to harvest wheat, but over time, this break has vanished from most places in the country, except for the province where Xiling is, maintaining this fine tradition.\nQuite enjoyable.\nEspecially when discovering other provinces don’t have it, it feels even better.\nDuring elementary and middle school, it was fixed for three days, though schools usually use this break for autumn trips or sports events.\nIn high school, the break becomes more flexible and varied by region.\nNansang Middle School’s area mandates two no-class days, so Grade 10 gets two days; Grade 11 students voluntarily stay one day to study while Grade 12 students voluntarily stay two days to study.\nIt shows that as the grade increases, people actively become more studious.\nThis is because Nansang is a public school, unlike some private schools famous for high enrollment rates that simply disregard this holiday.\nAs for why the monthly exam had to be scheduled for the Saturday next week, it’s not about intentionally using the weekend but because the following Tuesday is Mid-Autumn. Therefore, Saturday is meant to hold Monday’s classes, so using it for exams is normal.\nWhich is how the autumn break that usually connects with National Day now aligns with Mid-Autumn.\n\"Don’t celebrate too soon; during the autumn break, the school plans to organize an autumn trip, so I’m telling you this for discussing where to go tonight. Suggestions and opinions can be told to the class monitor, who will then relay them to me.\nThe longest duration would be leaving Thursday night and returning Saturday night, the shortest is a full Friday.\nBut, let me say in advance, for ease of management and safety, a class can only go to a place if more than one class chooses it.\nSo even if our class arrives at a commonly accepted decision, if no other classes want to join, it can’t be realized.\nTherefore, the process is for everyone to discuss our class’s preferred destination by Friday after school, which I will report, and over the weekend the school will deliberate and let you vote for the result, finally choosing one of the highest-voted projects among all classes...\"\nHaving had similar experiences in the past at middle and elementary schools, nobody complained about the autumn trip taking the autumn break.\nStill better than using normal weekends for autumn travel.\nIf it was for a sports event, not only would the autumn break be used up, but Sunday might also need half a day for the ceremony. Given the heat, waiting for cooler weather before National Day is impossible.\nThe crowd started discussing.\nLin Li didn’t care much about where to go for autumn travel; he was focused on what he had to do later.\n\"Lin Li.\" Bai Bufan, deep in thought, suddenly called Lin Li’s name.\n\"Speak,\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan.\nAs the saying goes, whenever Bufan thinks, God laughs.\nLin Li dared to assert he wouldn’t hear anything normal from Bai Bufan’s mischievous mouth.\n\"Spring outing is elegantly called Green Trip, so wouldn’t autumn outing elegantly be called a Sweep? So does the past week, this week, and next week count as an autumn trip?\"\n——\"Damn, you’re the Autumn Travel King!\"\n\"You say it like that... I really am.\" Lin Li nodded, acknowledging the notion behind the words.\n\"That’s great.\"\n\"Everyone! Lin Li just said he’s the Autumn Travel King; his experience in autumn travels is quite extensive. I suggest everyone follow his opinion!\" Bai Bufan stood up and shouted loudly.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThis voice dominated the crowd, causing everyone, including Xue Jian, to look at Lin Li instinctively.\nAfter the shock wore off, Lin Li smiled.\nDamn you.\nBai Bufan.\nYou kid revenge like yourself, three days is too late.",

How about you organize this event?\" Xue Jian asked.\n\"Teacher, that’s not true, Bai Bufan was just talking nonsense.\" Lin Li quickly denied.\nUnless there’s some task to activate, Lin Li wouldn’t have time to deal with these trivial matters.\n\"I swear, Lin Li just said he’s the Autumn Travel King!\" Bai Bufan supported again.\nFists clenched.\n\"I was just joking, teacher.\" Lin Li said with a flattering smile.\nKnowing that Lin Li and Bai Bufan and their group are rather cheeky, and since it indeed seemed like Bai Bufan’s prank, Xue Jian just nodded and didn’t make things difficult for Lin Li.\nIt was already close to the end of class, and the bell for the end of evening study session rang right then. Xue Jian had only come to talk about this matter and told everyone to go back and rest early, then got up and left directly.\nBai Bufan was the first to want to go back and rest, he was in a hurry.\nBut someone didn’t want him to go back.\nSo Bai Bufan turned around and saw Lin Li smiling.\n\"Autumn Travel King, is there something you need?\"\n\"I’m not the Autumn Travel King, I’m the King of Games, and now it’s my turn. I decide to summon my fist in attack position.\" The Autumn Travel King maintained a smile without warmth.\n\"King of Games, I know I was wrong!\"\n\"You don’t know you were wrong, you know you’re about to die.\"\nLin Li smiled with squinting eyes, and Bufan looked pitiful.\n...\nCalling it a ’yellow sweep’ as an autumn outing’s nickname is not quite appropriate, but the other way around, calling an autumn outing a ’yellow sweep’ nickname is more than fitting. It’s really not appropriate to keep mentioning ’yellow sweep’ in school every day.\n\"From now on, our operation codename is Autumn Outing.\" Lin Li said.\n\"I think you’re right.\" Bai Bufan, whose cheek was forcibly pressed on the table, nodded in agreement.\nJust now the two of them had a fierce conflict.\nBai Bufan used his chest to hit Lin Li’s fist hard, then used his butt to press Lin Li’s shoe tip hard, and now was expressing the joy of victory in battle by kissing the table with his cheek.\nSummary: What a thorough beating it was.\nLin Li released the right hand that was pinning Bai Bufan down, and Bai Bufan immediately sprang up from his seat, lively once again.\n\"Where’s Bao Wei, that bastard didn’t respond when I called for help, and now he’s nowhere to be seen.\" Bai Bufan looked around and, finding that there were hardly any people left in the classroom, complained.\nAs for why there are still people in the classroom 7 or 8 minutes after evening study ended, there are always people who will study for another 10 or 20 minutes after it ends, even up to when the dormitory building is about to be closed.\nNansang Middle School was at least a well-known local school.\nOf course, besides diligent students, there were also couples waiting for others to leave so they could leave together or sneakily.\n\"Bao Wei? He left early, even told me to make sure you had something to do, that way he could just throw his clothes on the top bunk. He’ll be very disappointed when he sees you’ve come back.\" Lin Li pushed his chair into place and responded.\n\"That’s something he would say,\" Bai Bufan nodded, moving his hands and frowning: \"Lin Li, have you been secretly working out behind my back? How come you’re so strong?\"\nBai Bufan really didn’t understand. Even though they were just playing, Bai Bufan realized he genuinely couldn’t break free from Lin Li’s hold.\nHe used to think he was stronger than Lin Li, after all.\n\"You haven’t practiced restraint, this is the result of restraint.\" Lin Li sneered.\nIn fact, he had been storing power just now.\nBy letting his hand go numb for an hour before bed last night, it bought him one use.\nAs a result, his right hand’s strength was four times what it used to be; although he still couldn’t beat Tyson, dealing with Bai Bufan was a piece of cake.\nAs the first person Lin Li used his cultivation moves against, Bai Bufan had it coming.\nBai Bufan instinctively wanted to argue, but he swallowed his words.\nThe difference between the Lin Li now and Lin Li a week ago was bigger than the difference between Lin Li a week ago and a dog.\nNot only is he working hard in his studies, but his body is also getting stronger. Could it be that restraint...is real?\nIs there really such a miraculous thing in the world?\nIs lust such an inconvenient thing?\n\"I’ll pay attention to self-restraint when I go back tonight!\" Bai Bufan said earnestly, \"Lin Li, I’m going to start seriously practicing restraint too!\"\n\"Haha.\"\n\"I’m serious! Seriously this time!\"\n\"If you stick to it for more than a week, I’ll treat you to breakfast.\" Lin Li sneered coldly.\n\"Wasn’t asked... huh? Wait! Why do I have to treat you?\" Bai Bufan almost fell for it.\n\"I’m off, need to scout the place quickly, see you tomorrow.\" Lin Li didn’t respond, after checking that he had his car and house keys, he waved and walked towards the door.\nTomorrow morning’s practice can only be comfortable for half an hour, the need for early sleep was back, so he had to hurry.\n\"Okay, bro, take care~\" Bai Bufan showed a smiling face immediately, then quickly packed up his things and got ready to head back to the dormitory.\nThe guy in love was already casting a sorrowful look at him.\nNot getting in the way of their kissing, retreat!\n...\nOutside Tianhong Foot Therapy and Spa.\nThe shop was still open.\nLin Li again displayed a traditional skill, pretending to talk on the phone while secretly observing.\nHonestly, there was only limited information accessible from outside, and what’s more, the shop had some twists; he couldn’t even see the register from what he could see through the door.\nThe information he got was even less than from Light Grace.\nLin Li had to change tactics, heading down the road where the shop was located, pretending to be passing by.\nGetting closer gave him a much better view, but the problem was he couldn’t stand at the door indefinitely.\n\"...Annoying?\"\n\"...Annoying?\"\nWho’s that, keep asking if people are annoying, Lin Li turned his head with the phone.\nHey? Song Luping?\nWas he calling my name?\nSong Luping finally got close enough, carefully examining Lin Li’s face, finally settling on the school uniform: \"You’re Bai Bufan, right?\"\nBrother, we just met yesterday, almost became brothers, I am standing right before you, and you don’t recognize me?\nLin Li now completely believed that Song Luping only recognizes guys by their clothes.\n\"It’s me, Brother Ping, what are you doing here?\" Lin Li asked.\nSong Luping didn’t answer, just kept straightening up.\nUnderstood.\nSeeing this action with Song Luping’s face looking even paler than yesterday, what else could it be?\nHelping himself perfect Xiling Chicken Farm map, he really did, Lin Li cried his heart out.\n\"Bro, are you done?\" Lin Li inquired.\n\"Yeah, just came out planning to have a smoke, your school uniform stands out pretty well, so I came to check if it’s you.\" Song Luping nodded, then asked, \"Bufan, what brought you here today?\"\nLin Li thought for a while, then considering Song Luping’s personality, decided to go for a half-true half-false explanation: \"Yesterday after you mentioned this place, eating chicken is an art, knowing oneself and the enemy, only then can you achieve victory in every battle.\nConsidering that I might come here as a customer in the future, with the mindset of seeing is believing, I came outside to inspect.\nTrying to assess this shop’s quality from the client base and occasionally resting employees...\nAnd I was already thinking about, in case of being caught, what escape routes would be the best...\"\nMaking up stories, fooling around, Lin Li’s ability in this regard needed no doubt, speaking so logically.\nJust going with Song Luping’s thinking was necessary.\nSong Luping’s face had turned serious, like a teacher listening to a student’s academic report, hands behind his back, nodding from time to time.\nAfter Lin Li finally finished, he nodded in satisfaction: \"Very good, you indeed have talent in this area.\"\n\"To have this level of deductive thinking at your age, is truly outstanding among people.\"\n\"Indeed, reading thousands of pieces is not as good as exploring thousands of shops; appreciating is a very subjective matter, what I like, you may not like. Your initiative to gather information for research, truly makes me pleased.\"\nLin Li apologized silently to idioms and sayings on behalf of Song Luping.\n\"However!\" Song Luping’s face turned even more serious, \"Bufan, you made a fatal error!\"",

Others can forget, but you shouldn’t make such a low-level mistake: it’s a critical moment just after Light Noble Health Club has fully collapsed!\"\n\"Just now, after finishing my session, during some casual chat with the ladies, they told me they suspect an undercover directive has been issued, the kind where it’s advised not to publicize or attack secretly.\nXiling Town is about to enter a dark era of a Great Qing purge, and everyone at Xiling Chicken Farm is on edge, constantly worried about impending doom.\nAt this time, they are extremely sensitive to any external movements.\nYet you choose to go undercover at this moment; if they notice, they won’t see you as a potential new client with growth potential.\nInstead, they’ll rather be safe than sorry, and will prioritize assuming that you, this unfamiliar face, are an informant for the cops—a bait for fishing enforcement!\nHow long have you been stationed here? For all we know, you might already be under surveillance.\nIf they identify you, you’ll immediately be added to the black service list.\nIf you think you’re only being blacklisted by Tianhong, you’re gravely mistaken.\nNews is shared among many chicken farms, which means Tianhong will spread your information to all farms they’re connected with. In time, the information will circulate more and more, until you’re completely isolated!\nBai Bufan, loudly tell me are you an informant for the cops? Are you the bait!!\"\nSong Luping held Lin Li’s shoulders, shaking them back and forth, his words unconsciously grew intense.\nLucky that there are hardly any pedestrians around at this moment.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nFaced with this question, how could he possibly respond?\n...Brother, I am, I truly am.\nIf it weren’t clear that Song Luping isn’t normal, Lin Li might even suspect he knows his true identity and is deliberately mocking him.\nLuckily it’s Song Luping.\n\"I, Bai Bufan, am not!\" Lin Li could only tighten his expression and respond loudly.\n\"That’s right! Of course, you’re not! For people like us with ambition and goals, being mistaken for an informant and put on a blacklist is the greatest humiliation!\nSo, Bufan, do you realize the severity of your mistake now: risking yourself during dangerous times indeed proves your courage and passion for the industry, I support you.\nBut acting during such times means you must exercise caution—endlessly. Think thrice before taking action. One false move and it’s all over.\"\n\"I understand, it indeed shows I haven’t thought deeply enough. I’m sorry Brother Ming, for letting down your expectations and guidance.\" Lin Li had to admit he didn’t consider these aspects.\n\"It’s not entirely your fault, it’s an error commonly made by newcomers, and it can foster growth instead.\" Song Luping shook his head.\n\"Even if you’ve not been discovered, your efforts are in vain; it’s the special period right now, and for safety, Tianhong are not accepting new customers, only well-known old clients are served.\"\nSong Luping spoke with a hint of pride in his tone.\nLin Li suddenly looked up, how could this be?\n\"Brother Ping, do you mean during this windy period, I’m completely out of luck with this shop?\" Lin Li asked softly.\nIf this is the case, he’ll need to change venues; can’t all shops be this cautious?\nIf this lasts beyond a month, his task would exceed the time limit.\n\"Fate is such a marvelous thing. Your previous outcome may indeed have been predestined, but now—you’ve met me, Xiaofan.\nThis destined conclusion has long been rewritten! You’re out of luck with this store? Remember, I am here, with me here.\"\nSong Luping gently shook his head, then directly turned and walked towards the shop’s main door.\nThe glowing orange neon lights shone on Song Luping’s body, casting a half-lit sun-like glow, revealing a divine greatness. He waved his hand, his voice gentle yet resolute:\n\"God said, let there be light, and there was light in the world; I say, you have fate, Tianhong and you, thus have fate.\"\nThough his words were slow and calm, it made Song Luping’s figure suddenly seem more towering to Lin Li.\nMoved to tears.\nSo inspiring, thank you, mentor!\nNo one can say Brother Ping is not normal; he is the most reliable!\n\"Bufan, stop being dazed, come on.\"\n\"Coming, Brother Ping!\" Lin Li immediately followed him.\n...\n\"Welcome back—oh, Brother Song, forgot something?\" The front desk naturally recognized Song Luping who had just finished his session and returned, so he greeted him with a smile.\n\"No, Xiaowen, let me introduce a guest, Bufan, come over.\"\nAlthough Lin Li was taller than Song Luping, Song Luping still wrapped his arm around Lin Li’s shoulder, positioning him beside himself.\n\"Is this your child? Truly gifted.\" The front desk immediately complimented.\n\"Cough cough cough—\"\nLin Li and Song Luping both choked on their saliva at the same time.\nTheir eyes met, one saying \"Could this be my son\", the other \"Could this be my dad?\"\n\"Xiaowen, do I really look that old to you? How old do you actually think I am?\" Song Luping protested indignantly.\nThe receptionist referred to as Xiaowen thought for a moment, hesitated a bit, and then decided to speak the truth: \"Brother Song, we’re familiar with each other, so I won’t bother with the flattery we usually give guests to comfort them.\nHonestly, although I can’t tell how long you’ve lived, I can tell you won’t live much longer.\"\nSong Luping: \"?\"\nLin Li immediately made a mental note, impressed by the receptionist’s sharpness.\nBesides, what she said was pretty accurate.\n\"Brother Song, maybe you should take a break. We’re really afraid you’ll suddenly pass away in our shop one day, and taking so much medicine isn’t good for your health.\"\nXiaowen’s aggression was really strong, but perhaps she genuinely cared for Song Luping.\nConsidering that Song Luping was an aspiring and ambitious ’beetle’, who put himself in the lady’s shoes during the consumption process and respected every chicken, Lin Li could understand why Xiaowen could have such a ’seemingly harsh but genuinely caring’ attitude towards him.\nHonest advice is hard to take, but perhaps, this is also a form of true emotion and bond.\nSong Luping’s face turned red: \"Xiaowen, how can you make up such things! I actually didn’t take any medicine!\"\nXiaowen took out half a pack of pills from the drawer and whispered, \"Brother Song, Sister Wu just brought them over, you left them here after your massage. I thought you came back just to get this.\"\nSildenafil Citrate Tablets (Super Super Super Enhanced Version).\nLin Li turned his head to hold back his laughter.\nSong Luping frantically patted his pockets, and then his face turned alternating shades of pale and flush.\nDamn, he really forgot to take them.\nNo wonder Xiaowen wasn’t surprised at all to see him come back after leaving, it was because of this.\nYou can’t really abandon money for dignity, each pill is tens of yuan, and the remaining half pack is worth several hundred.\nSong Luping quickly reached out to put the pills back in his pocket, then immediately pushed Lin Li in front of him, dryly laughing: \"Haha, Xiaowen, these things aren’t important, almost led you off topic. Now back to the main point.\nXiaowen, this is my newly recognized younger brother. Haven’t you not been accepting new customers lately?\nBut he wants to spend here, with my recommendation, it should be fine, right?\"\nOnly now did Xiaowen genuinely observe Lin Li. Although earlier discussions with Song Luping were of a special nature, nothing was explicitly mentioned, so normal customers wouldn’t care. But now Song Luping seemed to want to directly speak openly.\n\"Brother Song’s introduction, of course, there’s no problem.\" This kind of super VIP premium old customer introducing a client on-site couldn’t possibly be an issue, so Xiaowen didn’t hesitate for long before giving an answer.\nHearing this, Song Luping winked at Lin Li.\nThe meaning was obvious—see, this is the charismatic appeal of me, the current Xiling Pimp King.\nThe future is yours, but for now, it’s still mine!\nLin Li cooperatively showed an admiring look.\nSeeing Song Luping turn his head and laugh foolishly, Lin Li also laughed.\nTricking a fool can be quite fun.\nIn the mirror embedded in the hall, Lin Li’s peripheral vision caught his current smile.\nHey—looks kind of familiar?\nWhy does it feel like he had seen this expression on Chen Yu Ying before?\nHmm?\n\"It’s really giving me this face, Xiaowen, rest assured, although I haven’t known Bufan for long, this kid is absolutely trustworthy.\" Lin Li’s look and expression made Song Luping quite pleased, and he wholeheartedly praised Lin Li to Xiaowen:\n\"Don’t be deceived by his young age, now he’s still quite impressive.\nI saw him getting arrested with my own eyes, and you know what, the officer who arrested him had a particularly bad attitude towards him, almost pushing him into the car. I even saw him lift his leg as if wanting to kick Bufan but held back in the end.\"\nLin Li blinked; what Song Luping said was true. At that time, Uncle Yang’s face was filled with frustration.\n\"I almost couldn’t bear to watch. Tsk tsk, this kid, and the cops are like fire and water—definitely someone we can trust. It’s absolutely impossible for him to have issues, if he does, I’ll never be able to get it up again in this life, even with medicine!\" Song Luping laughed.\n\"...\"\nLin Li’s expression remained unchanged.\nSpeaking of which.\nIf it really doesn’t work, does that mean Song Luping will completely give up on these urges and that counts as mending his ways?\n—Not even possible to think wickedly anymore.\nHope the vow comes true.\n\"Bro, thank you for your trust in me. Rest assured, the outcome of trusting me will never change, from the past to now, from now to the future, always unchanged! I also swear, if I change, even taking medicine won’t work!\"\nLin Li sincerely looked at Song Luping, declaring aloud.\nUpon hearing this, Song Luping gazed at Lin Li in a daze.\nAlthough the vows sounded the same, the subjects were completely different. He himself had issues with impotence and hesitation, while Lin Li was a young man full of vigor—the weight of the punishment can’t be compared!\nAs a result, his eyes grew moist.\nThis, is absolute trust!\nThis, is the bond of kindred spirits!",

      "content": "Chapter 65: Chapter 61: Fortune relies on misfortune, huh, where’s my misfortune?\n\"If this doesn’t count as love, what should I be sad about~~\"\nXiaowen watched this scene and clicked the mouse a few times, causing such music to flow out.\n\"...\"\nDon’t mess around with the BGM, sister.\n\"No need for this, Bufan, take back your pledge. I’m already very moved by your sincere intentions, and even if one day you truly let me down, I will absolutely not blame you.\" The twenty-something Song Luping, yet his face carried the kindness of someone in their sixties.\nThanks for understanding, brother. Keep in mind, when the truth comes out later, you’re absolutely not allowed to scold me.\nLin Li ’shyly’ smiled a bit.\n\"Although our ages aren’t suitable for father-and-son roles, perhaps one day we could become sworn brothers, and from then on I can genuinely call you my younger brother.\nThat way, like Liu Bei, I can proudly announce to all the chicken farms in Xiling — my second brother is invincible!\nI remember historical records saying that Sun Shangxiang was willing to marry Liu Bei because she often heard him say that, but in the end, she found out she was deceived and was very angry, so she never gave Liu Bei any offspring.\nXiaofan, do you think if I say this, someone might rush into my arms too?\"\nSong Luping has already entered his fantasy world.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nBai Bufan really should swear brotherhood with Song Luping; they’re both scholars of unofficial history.\n\"Alright, you brothers should stop being sentimental at the door. This... Brother Xiaofan, right? Are you going up now? I’ll call someone to show you the way. Brother Song, you’d better hurry back; we’ll take good care of your little brother.\nYou should hurry back and make tea with goji berries, polygonatum, cistanche, epimedium, dodder seeds in your thermos... You shouldn’t come back for a while.\"\nAlthough Xiaowen is certainly older than Lin Li, in this kind of occasion, she wouldn’t normally call a customer ’brother’, so she said.\nLin Li clicked his tongue; just hearing the names of these medicinal herbs made his nosebleed almost gush forth.\n\"He’s not here to spend today; he’s just here to check things out.\" Before Lin Li could speak, Song Luping directly helped him explain.\n\"Yes, that’s it, Sister Xiaowen. Plus, I need to save up some money; the earliest I might come is this weekend,\" Lin Li echoed.\nThe sooner he completed the task of helping Bai Bufan sweep the place, the sooner he could obtain the elixir.\nMaybe after just one mouthful, he’d ascend directly to the heavens.\n\"Oh, so that’s how it is. Alright, alright, no problem at all. You just need to come when you can, even if I’m not on duty that day, just say Brother Ping introduced you, and mention that you’ve already met Xiaowen, then there should be no problem.\nEven if there are issues, they’ll ask me, and I’ll resolve them for you.\" Xiaowen nodded and continued smiling:\n\"As for money? Hasn’t Brother Song told you? Our main selling point is affordable quality, you shouldn’t need to save for too long.\"\n\"I actually didn’t have time to mention it. But Xiaowen, do give Brother Song a bit more face this time; in the future, offer Xiaofan a discount exceeding boundary conditions, eight percent discount, rest assured, I’ve taught him, he understands, he’ll only pay in cash.\" Song Luping reminded Xiaowen.\n\"Usually, Brother Song, the guests you introduce get a ninety-five percent discount, considering your good relationship with Xiaofan, ninety percent is no problem, but for an eighty percent discount, I’ll need to discuss with the boss and the sisters, I’ll try my best.\" Xiaowen gestured OK but didn’t fully commit.\nSong Luping indeed did not deceive; he really has such a significant influence in the Chicken Raising World.\n\"A ninety percent discount doesn’t sound good; later, people will say my face carries just a ninety percent level of value, at least there should be an eighty-nine percent discount right?\" Song Luping negotiated.\n\"Alright, alright.\" Xiaowen nodded, scanning to ensure no regular customers were around before turning to Lin Li: \"Since I’m idle anyway, let me first introduce the pricing of the store to you, so you won’t bring too much or too little money when you come later.\nThe price is roughly like this...\"\nReally, you truly shouldn’t say, the consumption level of this shop is much lower than that of Leight Jazz, not only are the corresponding service prices only half that of Leight Jazz, but the extra charges for additional services are exceedingly low.\n\"It’s indeed not expensive...\" Lin Li lamented.\nWhat a pity.\n\"Of course. Tianhong focuses on quick turnover with small profits; everything we do is labor-intensive work. Life is tough; we’re just trying to earn some hard money.\" Xiaowen felt a bit prideful after hearing the lament.\n\"Xiaofan, the previous location you visited at Leight Jazz in Xiling Center, the rent difference compared to here is significant. Plus, they want to create a high-end atmosphere; this price is purely inflated by various factors, except for the considerate but regrettably already entered Sweet, not a single one is worth it.\nI’ve always believed in a saying since childhood; disaster lurks beneath fortune, fortune lies hidden in disaster. A fortune teller said when I was young that my life would be a balance of fortunes and misfortunes, neither too good nor too bad.\nIt applies to you too.\nAlthough Xiaofan, you got caught at Leight Jazz, hidden within this misfortune was the luck of getting to know me; you could say you’ve profited, saved six or seven years of wandering in Xiling, didn’t waste foolish money, nor wasted time.\"\nSong Luping analyzed the reasons to Lin Li, while sighing.\nSuddenly, Song Luping furrowed his brow.\nHe realized a problem: \"Strange, I narrowly escaped death at Leight Jazz before, which certainly counts as absolute good fortune, right? Yet afterward, nothing else happened worthy of remark, besides meeting you.\nBut this matter is absolutely good fortune for me, hey, where’s my misfortune?\"\n\"Do you feel something’s off, could it be that I’m about to meet someone significant?\"\nSong Luping was plunged into worry.\n\"Hello, the significant one is right here.\"\nLin Li blinked, suddenly feeling a bit curious about meeting this fortune-teller—it seemed quite accurate.\nLin Li actually believed in metaphysics, but only halfway.\nLeft eye twitching means fortune, right eye twitching means superstition—Lin Li only believed in the part that was good for him.\nBut this fortune-teller seemed suspiciously accurate.\nMaybe they’re actually a powerful cultivator in the real world, able to roam between shattered worlds.\n\"Brother Ping, there’s no need to worry, it’s just superstition. You think it’s accurate, that’s just like horoscopes, with their descriptions—they’re so broad even a dog would agree with a few points. It’s all psychological, a result of your own imagination.\"\nHoroscope Predictor: \"Your sign will die if you don’t breathe this month.\" Horoscope Enthusiast: \"Wow, that’s so accurate, they’re describing me!\"\n\"I don’t think you’ll encounter anything troublesome again.\" The greatest trouble himself began to console Song Luping, as he couldn’t let the other party suspect him.\n\"Yeah, maybe my life started to turn around when I met you, Xiaofan. After all, before meeting you, I had already given up the idea of finding a soulmate in this world. Yes! This way of understanding makes everything clear. I really need to thank you, Xiaofan.\"\nSong Luping was obviously an optimistic person who knew how to comfort himself, having found a reason he could accept.\n\"Oh, right, I almost forgot to mention, Sister Xiaowen, there’s a good chance I’ll bring a classmate over this weekend, is that okay?\nWill he be excluded since he’s a stranger? He won’t ask for discounts, he’ll pay full price, and I can teach him to abide by Brother Ping’s ladybug rules.\" Lin Li spoke up.\nWouldn’t want Bai Bufan to be stopped at the door.\nAlthough Lin Li thought that scene would be quite amusing, he’d love to see Bai Bufan’s exasperated face.\n\"Are you familiar with this classmate?\" Song Luping asked on Xiaowen’s behalf.\n\"Very familiar, we’re super buddies, Brother Ping. He’s just like us, holding great respect for Chicken Raising World, but he’s a bit less brave than I am—he doesn’t dare try it alone.\" Lin Li nodded, \"It’s a shame he’s a boarding student, or I’d call him over to meet you now.\"\n\"He’s like you too?\" Song Luping was shocked.\nNo wonder Xiling Town’s top school! It’s filled with talents!\nWho knew such a small school not only housed a sleeping dragon but also hid a phoenix chick!\n\"When you get the chance, introduce him to Brother Song.\"\nThere may have been some doubts before, but now, Song Luping was certain that Bai Bufan was his lucky star!\nScrew that saying about fortune and misfortune, from now on, he’ll have nothing but good luck!\n\"Sure, Brother, I bet once he knows, he’ll be happier than you. The two of you will definitely have a lot to talk about.\" Lin Li nodded, speaking sincerely.\n\"That’s no problem at all! As long as you’re familiar with him, my brother’s brother is my brother too, how could there be no discount, don’t worry about these little expenses for me!\" Song Luping said generously.\n\"...Brother Song, that’s our money.\" Xiaowen raised her hand to point out.\n\"Ahem, not important, what kind of relationship do we have here, no need to be so specific.\"\nXiaowen rolled her eyes helplessly but didn’t argue further, nodding towards Lin Li:\n\"Brother Xiaofan, you’re basically one of us now. As long as you personally bring your friend over, and not him coming alone, it’ll be no problem at all to host you both.\"\n\"That’s great, I’m already looking forward to a surely pleasant weekend.\" Lin Li showed an ’excited’ smile, \"I hope nothing unexpected happens again, last time almost gave me a trauma.\"\n\"Last time you were really unlucky, but no worries, Tianhong is an old brand with a legacy, there won’t be any more unexpected incidents, guaranteed!\" Song Luping pounded his chest with conviction.\n\"Hiss—\" His spirit barely lasted a second before Song Luping began to massage his chest, wincing.\nTo hurt himself like this, rounding it up, is also a kind of talent.\n\"I borrow Brother Ping’s good omen, so—\"\nThe evening concluded perfectly, surpassing the task by several times, and Lin Li was satisfied, ready to bid farewell.\n\"Yes, Brother Xiaofan, don’t worry, we’re on high alert now.\nDuring the busiest weekends, we’ll keep an eye on any suspicious individuals, ensuring you and your friend have a safe and happy weekend!\" She even gave Lin Li a wink after speaking.\nLin Li, who was already prepared to turn and leave, stopped in his tracks, the polite farewell words stuck in his throat.\nLin Li turned around, showing genuine curiosity:\n\"Oh—?\"\n\"Is there such a thing?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 66: Chapter 62: A Traitor Emerges in the Demon Suppression Bureau\n\"That’s certainly true, there are so many advantages here that I forgot to praise it.\" Song Luping nodded upon hearing this, looking at Lin Li, \"Bufan, in this store you don’t have to worry about escape routes, with them here, nothing unexpected.\"\nGiven his current status, it’s completely normal to be curious about these things, so Lin Li straightforwardly asked:\n\"Brother Ping, Sister Xiaowen, may I ask out of curiosity? How do we ensure safety in this regard? Is there a secret passage in the shop, and if someone comes to investigate, we just use the passage and leave unnoticed?\"\nLin Li really didn’t expect to encounter such a ’surprise’.\nFortunately, Xiaowen took the initiative to bring it up.\nIf he later informed the Demon Suppression Bureau and failed to capture them, letting everyone escape or cover up the Hehuan truth, all his hard work would be for nothing.\nFurthermore, if it doesn’t work this time, Lin Li wouldn’t willingly come to this shop a second time—being ambushed at the same shop twice when he comes here would be too conspicuous and suspicious.\nThe Demon Suppression Bureau itself employs people to go undercover at Hehuan points to gather evidence, so the Hehuan Demon folks will naturally consider this possibility and suspect others routinely.\nAs a cautious person, Lin Li doesn’t wish to take such risks before completing the task.\nLin Li is someone who dislikes risk very much; the only things that make him ignore risks are web pages and software.\nFaced with web pages and software, Lin Li rapidly transforms into a radical, risk? If there are no risky web pages and software, I’m not interested at all! Ignoring risks, I continue installing and browsing!!\n\"Brother Xiaofan, you think we have Northern Myanmar chicken farms here, with basements and secret passages, how impossible is that! This is commercial land here, to change the basic structure of a building for major renovations, you’d have to report to the district management office, we don’t have that capability.\"\nXiaowen said with some amusement.\n\"But it’s...\"\nXiaowen smiled mysteriously, \"We have informants placed.\"\n\"We have people inside the bureau, who report to us and keep an eye on their every move.\"\nLin Li’s pupils shook.\nBu Hao! A traitor has emerged among us! Even more than one!\nThe Demon Suppression Bureau has been infiltrated!\nHowever, Lin Li wasn’t particularly worried about his identity being revealed.\nThe last operation was actually reported by him; not many people truly know the complete details, and considering the safety of the informant, the Demon Suppression Bureau customarily doesn’t publicize it even internally.\nEven the flag Lin Li received didn’t have his name on it.\nTherefore, not many people actually know it was him who reported it last time; Lin Li estimates the number is still a single-digit figure.\nMoreover, if they already knew his identity, neither Song Luping nor Xiaowen would treat him with the current attitude.\nThus, after initial shock and brief panic, Lin Li was replaced by uncontrollable excitement.\nThis will be quite an achievement.\nHe’s about to clean up the corrupt elements within the Demon Suppression Bureau and bring the evil hand sheltering Xiling Town to justice, truly restoring its clear skies!\nSeventeen-year-olds are indeed the most daring and adventurous at this age, it’s thrilling just to think about it.\nIf the last reward was three thousand three, this time if successful, they must give more, right? If they do, Lin Li surely would reward himself with a Spring Breeze Elf (Sha Wujing model).\nFour thousand four? Five thousand five?\nHaha, if I could seize the assets of the moles and wipe out their families, wouldn’t it be great if I got all the confiscated possessions—the thought passed innocently through Lin Li’s mind.\nNo ill intentions, just hoping for collateral damage across ten families.\n\"Brother Song, Sister Xiaowen, are you saying there are people on our side among the cops? This time, will they give us advance notice?\" Lin Li asked excitedly, pretending to have calmed.\n\"More or less.\" Xiaowen smiled enigmatically.\n\"What position is it? Grassroots? A messenger? How can they cooperate with us?\" Lin Li quickly asked, then immediately tapped his head, raising his hands slightly in front of him, looking and sounding apologetic: \"Sorry, I shouldn’t be asking about this, just got a bit too excited.\"\nSeventeen years old has become Lin Li’s most suitable camouflage, being excited and wanting to know the inside scoop in such a situation is perfectly reasonable.\nAnd naturally, Lin Li wouldn’t try to explicitly ask who the informant really is, trying to narrow it down is enough, the rest is an internal issue of the Demon Suppression Bureau.\nIndeed, neither Xiaowen nor Song Luping were surprised by Lin Li’s excitement; Xiaowen laughed, \"No worries, we’re all on the same side, but Xiaofan, your guesses are wrong, not grassroots, not messengers.\"\n\"...High level?\" Lin Li’s eyes widened.\nDid I just skip the flies and go straight to the tigers?\nOh no, I might have to be more careful then.\nI’m not Wu Song, facing tigers, I’m at most minced meat, at best minced meat that can slide tackle.\n\"Haha, we don’t have that capability, Xiaofan you misunderstood; we haven’t even managed to bribe any cops successfully, there are tons of rules like rotational shifts now, with tight management, and the anti-vice group is keeping things confidential, not as easy to bribe as before.\"\nFaced with Lin Li’s shocked yet admiring face, Xiaowen felt a bit embarrassed, waving her hand as she spoke.\n\"Huh? Then our informant is...\" Lin Li was confused.\nWho else besides the Demon Suppression Envoy can go undercover in the Demon Suppression Bureau?\n\"We have a former supervisor, currently on probation and participating in community correction. His correction location on weekends is at Sanqiao Police Station, so we have entrusted him with keeping an eye on the personnel flow inside. As soon as he notices a large or gradual departure of cops, regardless of whether they’re in plain clothes, he will immediately alert us.\nAdditionally, on weekends, we will hire some people to keep an eye on the necessary routes leading to us and several nearby colleagues. Once our former supervisor messages us, we’ll have them reconfirm if the cops are actually coming our way.\nWhen all parties confirm that the clues indicate a prostitution raid targeting us, we will immediately notify our guests and staff to pause special services and begin orderly adjustments to appear as legitimate operations.\nTime is definitely sufficient. By the time the cops arrive, they’ll only see our completely legal appearance. Even if they check the surveillance, they won’t find anything suspicious.\nXiaowen truly didn’t see herself as an outsider, and proudly revealed the truth to Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHis feelings at this moment were indescribable.\nYou know what, just don’t talk.\nHis scope of thinking was indeed too narrow.\nAside from those responsible for suppression in the Demon Suppression Bureau, naturally, there are also demons responsible for being suppressed.\nBad news: There’s an insider in the Demon Suppression Bureau.\nGood news: The insider has not only been caught, but also sentenced.\nHow frustrating, getting all excited for nothing, didn’t catch any tigers or flies, just swatted a mosquito that had already been hit.\nInforming Yangliang of this, he might commend him with a ’well done,’ but as for any rewards, don’t even think about it.\nSha Wujing, I’m sorry, it’s my incompetence, my lack of ability, can’t bring you home.\nLin Li sighed deeply in his heart.\nNonetheless, it’s a useful piece of information.\nOrdinary people really wouldn’t consider this angle, which could easily be detected by these chicken farms.\nWhen it’s time to act, be sure to notify Uncle Yang and the others in advance so that they can prepare.\nOnce aware, precaution becomes simple; sending people from other branches, directly replacing the community service jobs of probation offenders so they see nothing, pretending to go home after work then going undercover, and so on.\nBut preparation must not be overly deliberate, nor should they confront and question the insider directly. Otherwise, it’s blatantly telling the chicken farms there’s a mole in your ranks, and through simple deduction, the whistleblower is essentially exposed.\nSigh.\nThis undercover role is really exhausting.\nBy then, Uncle Yang and the others should also get the hint.\n\"I see, now I feel more at ease. If only I had known about your Tianhong earlier, compared to you, Qingjue is truly disappointing.\" Lin Li clutches his chest, his voice sincere.\nDefaming while praising is disgusting, unless you’re the one being praised, plus the defaming party is already gone. Xiaowen was now smiling quite happily.\n\"This is something we should be doing for the safety of ourselves and our customers. Honestly, hiring people for surveillance outside is quite costly. If it weren’t for several places sharing the expenses, this would be a losing proposition.\nLow margin, high volume isn’t just empty talk, we really are making some hard-earned money.\nBut to ensure you’re having fun, and assured while doing so, what does sacrificing a little mean?\"\n\"Absolutely,\" Song Luping nodded passionately, \"In my heart, Tianhong is truly deserving, a place with ambition and aspirations, how wonderful would it be if everyone could be happy!?\"\nTears welled up.\nThe chicken farms in Xiling are all so exemplary, Qingjue competes in infrastructure, Tianhong competes in service.\nLin Li gave a thumbs up.\nThrow them in to re-educate a bit further.\nXiaowen graciously accepted, chuckled, and said, \"So, Xiaofan, feel free to enjoy yourself this weekend. Our preparations are flawless. It’s all our people here, same goes within the bureau; everywhere is filled with our own people, how could we lose?\nIf we get caught like this, I, Xiaowen, will never work in this line again in my life, hehe.\"\nHehe.\nKarma +1.\nInternally, Lin Li was already giggling, but outwardly he appeared very approving, nodding firmly:\n\"That’s right, perfect, flawless.\"\nWith dragon riding your face, you truly can’t lose.",

      "content": "Chapter 67: Chapter 63: Child, This is Very Funny (Requesting Monthly Tickets)\nWithout any other doubts to discuss, and with Xiaowen not actively having any ’records’ to explain, Lin Li bid farewell to the two, as Song Luping was already planning to leave, so the two of them walked out together.\nWalking to Lin Li’s bicycle, Song Luping said, \"The document is actually already halfway edited. Tomorrow or the day after, I’ll go to Shuinan Bridge to help you check out the store. After it’s perfected, I’ll give you the first draft as soon as possible, oh—\"\n\"What’s the matter, bro?\"\nLin Li heard the exclamation and looked up at Song Luping.\n\"It’s nothing, I just seemed to be stripped bare by an ant.\" Song Luping waved his hand dismissively.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nIt was clear that, despite his tough words, Song Luping was aware of his own frailty.\n\"Bro... why don’t you listen to Xiaowen? Stop while you still can. If you keep taking the medicine, your health will collapse.\" Lin Li was genuinely afraid that Song Luping would vanish in an instant.\n\"I can’t go back now, and I have to take the medicine, Bufan, you need to understand, the thing girls hate the most is being caught off guard, I don’t want to see their disappointed faces.\" Song Luping said in a low voice.\nApologize to this phrase, being caught off guard has been dragged the worst this time.\nBesides, will chickens really be disappointed, shouldn’t they be able to leave work early?\nShouldn’t it be spoken with a smile about how easy it is to earn money, six hundred in three seconds?\n\"You can still adjust, Brother Ping, you’re still young, what will you do in the future like this, you’re not even married with kids yet.\" Lin Li sincerely persuaded, seeking a sliver of possibility for redemption.\nSong Luping treats himself really well, but he must betray him, blaming the entire system.\n\"Now I’m a DINK advocate; my yearning for love ended when my first love ended, and everything followed suit.\" Song Luping’s face was a mask of nostalgia, even without drinking today, he seemed more mournful than the night he had supper:\n\"In that first love year, I caught a cicada and thought I had caught summer; I messed up her face and thought I was destined to be with her forever. But in the end, I suddenly realized that everything was just a fantasy; both she and I were merely transient guests in each other’s lives.\nSummer doesn’t stay, and she chose to leave.\nThere will be more people grabbing that cicada in the future, and more people messing up her face; no one is special, so why trap oneself in the past, why linger for someone again?\"\nThis overly literary yet vulgar whisper left Lin Li stunned.\n\"I like and have become completely accustomed to my current life. Rather, you, Bufan, maybe I am your future; this is something that once tasted is hard to let go. If you’re fearful, there is still a chance to turn back; if you don’t want to inherit my legacy, I won’t blame you.\" Song Luping softly murmured.\n\"I will not retrace anyone’s old path, nor will I become anyone’s shadow. I, Bai Bufan, will certainly pave a grand avenue in the world of love!\"\nLin Li flipped himself onto the ’horse,’ and responded with a frequency matching Song Luping’s.\nSong Luping said no more, watching Lin Li leave with complex eyes, and after a long while, when there were no silhouettes on the road, he turned around and gazed up at the moon, his eyes filled with bewilderment.\nSong Luping walked forward.\n\"Oh.\"\nGot tossed over by an ant.\n...\nReturning home, it was already late at night.\nLin Li took out his phone, with the breathing light flashing green, indicating there was a message.\nAs for the vibration, it was already gone.\nBack in the store, it was buzzing all the time, Xiaowen even asked if I had brought tools to play, and reminded me that it wasn’t proper to do so, hoping I wouldn’t do that over the weekend.\nLin Li could only chuckle and take out his phone, turning off the vibration.\nIt wasn’t a text message, that stopped last night, the other party’s bombardment wasn’t those costless verification code bombs, but real edited content sent as text messages, each costing at least several cents.\nPerhaps at this moment, a woman in a remote dark room in Northern Myanmar might be screaming.\nThe reason for the vibration was Bai Bufan.\nClicked open WeChat, it was all messages inquiring about my situation.\nBai Bufan really exemplified what it means to change his expressions.\nStarting with a respectful attitude, then later suspecting I was enjoying myself ahead of him, starting to angrily slander and insult me, and now, after suffering cold violence, exhibited powerlessness and frailty, even entering a crazed state:\n\"You there?\"\n\"Why aren’t you replying? Lin Li, you’ve successfully piqued my interest, I need your cold response to balance my enthusiasm.\"\n\"Sorry, what I said earlier was crossing the line, I think in truth our relationship hasn’t progressed to where you’d reply to me, my problem.\"\n...\n\"Alive?\"\n\"Lin Li, I’m your dad! How many years do you get there for not replying to messages?\"\n\"Wang Changling’s mom! Did you die? No signal at your grave?\"\n\"Lin Li, are you purposely not replying, adjusting your phone to vibrate and secretly enjoying it?\"\n...\n\"You damn!\"\n\"I’m begging you, bro, reply to my message, if I catch a cold tomorrow, it’ll definitely be because of your cold violence.\"\n\"Not replying, huh \"sweat bean\", fine, alright actually I didn’t really want you to reply \"sweat bean\", actually, I have many people replying to me, I don’t particularly fancy chatting with you \"crying with laughter\", you’re really quite average \"rolling eyes\", really amusing and pompous \"rolling eyes\" \"crying with laughter\".\"\n...\n\"Image\"\nA super high-quality alluring picture, but Bai Bufan censored all the key parts heavily, behaving beastly.\n\"Didn’t see the messages? Can’t lure you out even with this?\"\n...\nLin Li viewed it with absolutely no sense of guilt.\nBai Bufan is still sending messages right now.\n\"Lin Li quoted ’Message’: Send me the infantry map.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Bro, you finally came back to life, I’ve been watching ads forever waiting for this!\"\n\"Lin Li: Just got home, the situation wasn’t suitable for checking messages earlier...\"\nLin Li briefly explained the situation, leaving the details for tomorrow.\n\"Bai Bufan: Living on campus is really a pain for me, I need to find a chance to ask my family again if they can drive me back and forth for an hour and a half every day, twice a day, so I can be a day student.\"\n\"Lin Li: Did you laugh when you typed that?\"\nBai Bufan is not a local of Xiling, but from the neighboring town, which is a bit farther away.\n\"Bai Bufan: Didn’t laugh, buddy, it’s not funny, pay attention to the wording, I said ’again’, I’ve already brought it up with my family once.\"\n\"Lin Li: So, what happened?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: My dad laughed and said, ’Bufan, I’ve met your grandpa, but you haven’t met mine yet, isn’t that unfair?’\"\n\"Bai Bufan: At that time I was puzzled, I thought my great-grandfather’s generation had mostly passed, but before I could voice my doubt, my dad said his transportation was his belt.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Damn, that day I didn’t meet my great-grandfather, but I did meet Lao Da.\"\n\"Lin Li: Buddy, that’s not funny.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: If you didn’t laugh when you typed that, I’ll eat dirt here and now.\"\nLin Li indeed was laughing.\n\"Bai Bufan: Additionally, I specifically asked Lao Da, and Lao Da really said he didn’t mind, buddy, that’s funny, I can only say Lao Da’s heart is as broad as Lao An’s.\"\n\"Lin Li: Your imagination is as vast as Lao Ken’s.\"\n\"Lin Li: Alright, just got home, going to shower now, send over the infantry map and source, it’s urgent.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Galio used his ultimate to defeat 385 citizens in a city named SONE.\"\n\"Lin Li: 1\"\n...\nLin Li nodded in satisfaction, he approved of Bai Bufan’s perspective; usually lying in bed as if ’wooden’, at this moment he was like ’too.’\nLin Li wouldn’t make the foolish mistake Bai Bufan once did.\nHe downloaded it first before watching.\n...\nThe next day.\nIt’s easy to go from frugal to extravagant, but hard to go from extravagant to frugal.\nWhen the last egg was taken from Lin Li’s egg box, Lin Li could only practice the odds Chapters of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique diligently once more.\nSweaty pain filled his body again, and maybe because he hadn’t practiced this way for several days, today felt especially exhausting.\nLin Li wasn’t giggling, but Xiaozhou’s complexion looked much better, clearly the giggling had transferred somewhere else.\nZhou Youwei was genuinely happy.\nAfter all, as a human, it’s hard to constantly face an enemy shaking their annoying butt with a good expression.\n[Get up seriously before 5:00 AM for a week and practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique diligently, at least half an hour before 7:00 AM. (6/7)]\nSeeing the notification, Lin Li propped his hands on his thighs, breathing and resting.\n\"Goodbye, Grandpa Zhou.\"\n\"Hmm, goodbye.\" Today he could be a Korean-style grandpa again, indeed responding, with a slight smile on the corner of his mouth.\nThoughts written all over the face, interacting with such elderly is indeed entertaining.\nLin Li nodded again, dragged his tired body forward, the long-lost dead dog posture.\nThough he’s only practiced for a week, at least it’s a cultivation technique that doesn’t exist in reality; the effects are undeniable, Lin Li’s physical condition has improved.\nA week ago, without resting, Lin Li could rely on stamina in the front, then on body and willpower, practicing for a dozen minutes with standard moves; when the moves twisted so much that they affected the cultivation practice, he could only rest a few minutes before continuing.\nBut now, Lin Li could probably maintain the standard moves continuously for nearly twenty minutes.\nBut this can’t change the ending of being exhausted like a dog.\nAfter all, the system’s demand for diligence grows with Lin Li’s growth.\nHaving leftover strength unused is considered not serious.\nThe petty-minded system is like this.\nUnless Lin Li can effortlessly handle the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, perfectly meeting the cultivation requirements with leftover strength, or practice for five minutes, rest two hours, until then, the result of serious practice is all about being dog-tired.\nThe only consolation might be that before, he was a very weak dog, now Lin Li is just a generally weak dog!\nAnd tomorrow! His Qi Blood will change!\nThe future is promising! He might become a strong dog tomorrow!\nEh? Wait.\nHe is human.\nRedo, stronger human!\n\"I am human! I am human!\" With this thought, Lin Li raised his left hand, chanting the slogan ’I am human’, and joyfully jogged home.\nEarly-rising elderly along the way: \"?\"\nWhose kid is being silly?",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Chapter 64: It’s Still Simpler to Like Boys\nClassroom.\nIt’s quite rare, Bai Bufan surprisingly didn’t tell any historical anecdotes today.\n\"The names of Liu Bei’s descendants, Liu Feng and Liu Chan, combined mean ’Feng Chan,’ an expectation of imperial greatness. The names of Sun Jian’s descendants, Sun Quan and Sun Ce, together mean ’Quan Ce,’ a blessing for capability.\nAlright, next, let’s look at the old Cao family.\nWhat are their names? Cao Cao, Cao Pi, Cao Zhen, Cao Shuang.\nNot talking about Sima, only discussing Shu, Wei, and Wu, yet the Cao family was the ultimate winner, so can you see it? What emperor’s ambition, what strategic capabilities, all useless! Tell me loudly! What truly is the ladder to victory!\"\n\"To win, you only need to do three things! Emperor Wen of Wei! Cao Ziheng! Cao Pi!\"\nThe history is correct; the interpretation is wild.\nAfter distributing breakfast to everyone, Lin Li gave Bai Bufan a belated thank you:\n\"Bufan, that movie yesterday was really good.\"\n\"Bai’s Strict Selection, what did you think? If it’s not good stuff, it wouldn’t stay on my phone, my memory is precious strategic material.\nI still have a lot of good stuff stored, have you watched all of Sister Feng’s things? Although they’re a bit old, classics never go out of style, and the quality after restoration exceeds even new films.\"\nBai Bufan was unfazed by such praise and replied calmly.\n\"Send them all to me, please, it’s really important to me.\" Lin Li said earnestly.\n\"I’ll send you my cloud account password later; sharing is troublesome, and links can easily become invalid.\nFortunately, my account still has membership, and I’ve already organized and reviewed the files; they’re not a mess.\nHowever, to avoid the files being harmonized, most of them are compressed archives; the extraction passwords differ based on the source, usually noted in the folder, you’ll have to check them yourself.\"\nIn the early days when one cloud storage dominated, a single line could break your defenses:\n—! You’re too late, the shared file has been canceled.\nEvery time you found a link only to discover it was from years ago, it was a nerve-wracking gamble.\n\"You’re my true brother, alright, since you don’t normally use these resources in the dorm, why not leave them with me, someone who needs them more? Just let me know when you need them on the weekend,\" Lin Li nodded, very appreciative of Bai Bufan’s understanding.\n\"No need, no need to return them to me even on the weekend, I don’t need these things anymore. Starting today, I’m officially beginning to quit lusting! I’ve decided to bring my genius to the NoFap community.\" Bai Bufan declared resolutely, \"I’ve already uninstalled forbidden comics and Pica from my phone! With my firm resolve, I don’t even know how to lose!\"\n\"Hmm,\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hey, the reaction is too dull! Lin Li, I feel like you don’t respect me! Why do you only respond with a ’hmm’ to such an important decision!\" After a brief silence, Bai Bufan snapped a bit.\n\"Wow, Bufan Bufan, you’re really great, Bufan Bufan, you’re the best,\" Lin Li praised upon hearing, but with a monotone voice.\nLin Li had heard this line too many times.\nBai Bufan’s famous saying is that he abstains from lust for 23 hours a day. Assuming he lives to the average lifespan of 75, he has a full 72 years abstaining.\nThis stat sheet only suggests that if Bai Bufan takes his talent to the NoFap community, he truly is a secondary GOAT there.\n\"You will regret today’s words and actions,\" Bai Bufan looked coldly at his deskmate, who looked down on him.\n\"Haha.\"\nA few minutes later.\n\"Lin Li.\"\nAfter finishing breakfast, Chen Yu Ying came over, throwing her trash in the hallway bin, and called Lin Li’s name.\nIn fact, the classroom’s trash can was originally in the back row, but after last semester, it was moved to the hallway by Xue Jian as it was deteriorating into a basketball hoop for Lin Li and others.\n—At least this way, during class, they won’t see these little brats using tissues or other things as basketballs.\n\"What’s up, class president?\"\n\"I wanted to talk to you about the autumn outing. Zhuo Yongfei and I discussed it and decided to have discussions based on dormitories first, and the dorm leaders will tell me or him, so we can gather a few large options, and in the class meeting, we’ll choose the one the class can best accept.\nAnd because you’re the only day student in the class, without a dorm, I needed to tell you separately.\"\nZhuo Yongfei is the vice class president of class one, grade 10, a male student.\n\"Oh, I see. I’m very laid-back about it, anything goes,\" Lin Li nodded upon hearing this, then looked at Bai Bufan, \"Bufan, did your dorm discuss last night? You can count my vote with your dorm, too. There are five in the Big Four, three in the Big Three of mystery novels are four, so it’s normal for a six-person dorm to have seven votes.\"\n\"That works, but Bai Bufan, I’m curious, did you guys come to a conclusion?\" Chen Yu Ying nodded and asked Bai Bufan.\nWith his head down, tightly staring at the unopened textbook on his desk, Bai Bufan, upon hearing his name, became even more stiff.\nHe mechanically turned around, facing Chen Yu Ying, but without looking at her, stammering, \"We, uh, haven’t discussed it well yet, maybe tomorrow night it will be decided.\"\nLin Li was momentarily stunned, then understood, Bai Bufan was an extreme in front of males and females, especially in front of the class’s fashion queen, Chen Yu Ying.\nIt really shouldn’t be like this.\nMainly because he once spread a rumor about Bai Bufan having hemorrhoids in front of the class president, which dealt another heavy blow to his already fragile spirit; Lin Li noticed Bai Bufan’s hands were tightly pressed against his thighs, without any extra movement.\nLin Li stood up because when your mind thinks of hemorrhoids, it’s time to clench.\nNot only did he stand up.\nWhen Lin Li and Chen Tianming, who was also standing in the back row near the door, exchanged glances, everything was unspoken, and they both laughed.\nSo you also play the original—no, do you also clench?\nUnbeknownst to him, Bai Bufan had become the ’clenching assistant’ of class one, grade 10; seeing him reminded you to clench.\nAt this moment, Bai Bufan’s mind seemed to have stopped, stumbling over his words very awkwardly.\nThis left Chen Yu Ying a bit at a loss temporarily.\nMaster Lin couldn’t stand seeing his good friend suffer such earthly hardships.\nSo Lin Li closed his eyes.\n\"Hahaha—cough cough.\" Lin Li opened his eyes because he accidentally laughed out loud.\nBecause he suddenly stood there laughing, Chen Yu Ying and Bai Bufan both looked over.\nChen Yu Ying was puzzled, while Bai Bufan was filled with resentment and a plea for help—whoever you are, quickly get her away!\n\"Class president, Bufan has a bit of social anxiety around girls, especially pretty ones. Let him report to Yongfei later.\" Lin Li decided to lend a hand.\n\"Oh oh, sorry.\" Upon hearing this, Chen Yu Ying immediately stepped back, making Bai Bufan feel more at ease, and then she was a bit surprised: \"But it’s hard to imagine Bai Tongxue being like this.\"\nAfter all, Bai Bufan was rather loud, and his gossip could be heard by the entire class. In the eyes of those unfamiliar with him, he shouldn’t have any connection with social anxiety, and seemed more like a social intimidator, being the cause of others’ social anxiety.\n\"The key is still good-looking.\" Lin Li raised an eyebrow.\nAt this age, girls find it hard to be poised in the face of compliments, and with such straightforward praise, Chen Yu Ying was a bit shy and did not respond.\nBai Bufan looked at Lin Li even more resentfully.\nAre you seriously using me as a buffer between you and the class president?\nAm I becoming Luffy?\n—According to rumors, when Kaido and Big Mom didn’t want children, they used Luffy as an excuse.\n\"Actually, there’s another reason, class president. Last time when I said Bufan had hemorrhoids, it was fake. I was joking.\" Lin Li added.\nThis time, Bai Bufan finally gave a grateful look—Lin Li had neither a strange tone nor did he wink. This was a genuine clarification, bringing him to the verge of tears.\nChen Yu Ying was stunned upon hearing this, first looking at Bai Bufan and then at Lin Li: \"Did you... tell me about this?\"\nThe still grateful Bai Bufan suddenly became stiff again.\nHuh?\nBai Bufan looked at Lin Li, bewildered.\nLin Li innocently spread his hands, tilted his head, shrugged his shoulders, and said directly: \"I told you the class president wouldn’t remember this. Look how nervous you are.\"\nBut now she remembers.\nRealizing this, Bai Bufan found himself in the same situation as Zhou Baowei.\nAnd it’s all because of his own actions!\n\"Class president, I mentioned it briefly the day before yesterday at noon. It’s better you didn’t remember. There’s no need to now, because it was my rumor, and it’s false.\" Lin Li repeated.\nBai Bufan once again gave a grateful look.\n\"Oh, alright...\" Chen Yu Ying weakly nodded, but her gaze was a bit odd.\nShe was about to leave but suddenly noticed something strange, so she somewhat confusedly asked Lin Li, \"I wanted to ask earlier, why did you all suddenly stand up to do horse stance?\"\n\"To clench the butt.\" Lin Li honestly answered.\n\"What subject’s outline?\"\n\"Uh, if you ask, it’s the ’clench the butt’ subject.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nRealizing what was happening, Chen Yu Ying slapped her forehead and quickly left.\nBut Lin Li noticed she didn’t sit down immediately at her spot.\nThe trend of clenching the butt finally reached the front row.\nBut Lin Li felt a little sad.\nEven pretty girls have to clench their butts too.\n\"I really have to thank you this time, Lin Li. When you’re not being unreliable, you’re actually pretty dependable.\" Bai Bufan was genuinely moved this time.\n\"You’re thanking me too early.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"I’ve lied to the class president too many times these days. I emphasize something isn’t true, and she probably believes it even more, so theoretically, now she’s not just remembered it, but is even more convinced. Did you see the look in her eyes back then? That’s probably why.\" Lin Li explained with a smile.\nHe said he wasn’t a pervert, and claimed he wasn’t sick; Lin Li felt Chen Yu Ying didn’t believe him at all, so this is a reasonable deduction.\n\"Haha, you said that to scare me, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Lin Li, quickly nod and say yes! Damn! Nod!\" After great joy came great sorrow. Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li smiling and became desolate again.\n\"I want to change deskmates...\" he said weakly in despair.\n\"I think Ding Sihan would be a great choice for your new deskmate, Bufan. Why not consider it?\" Lin Li steadily suggested.\n\"Are you seriously taking my considerations into account!\" Bai Bufan said through gritted teeth, \"If I could beat you now, you’d be on your knees apologizing to me, Lin Li. Just wait, when I successfully suppress my desires and transcend, new grudges and old grievances—I’ll settle them with you!\"\n\"Bufan, being like this isn’t good for you either. How will you date in the future? If you don’t overcome your awkwardness and unease in front of girls, what, are you planning to find a man to spend your life with?\" Lin Li advised.\n\"It seems that changing sexual orientation might be simpler than overcoming the fear of girls.\" Bai Bufan thought for a while and then replied, giving Lin Li a smile: \"Lin Li, good luck with clenching. I’m looking forward to your future.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHe silently pushed his chair as close to the wall as possible, trying to stay away from Bai Bufan.\nDamn, I’m scared now.",

      "content": "Chapter 69: Chapter 65: There Is Love in Math Problems (Requesting Monthly Tickets)\nNoon.\nLin Li limped back to the classroom, feeling the sadness of his poor luck.\nOften walking by the river, how can one’s shoes not get wet?\nBai Bufan told me at noon that there was something good in their dorm, but when I went over, I ended up having a \"relationship\" with the Door Beam in front of everyone.\nIn broad daylight, under the clear sky, there is no justice.\nThis was a malicious trap orchestrated by Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei.\nThis group of rats in the gutter who can’t stand others doing well said I’ve been too arrogant lately and needed to be taken down a peg.\nDid I not recently set them up, spread rumors about them, and beat them?\nSo what?\nWhy not think about your own problems? As someone being bullied, is there no fault?\nRage, shaking, cold.\nLin Li’s physical fitness has improved quite a bit, but two fists cannot beat four hands, especially since they also called in the class’s Right Guardian, Wang Ze.\nWang Ze is a legend, once bending a steel bar HRB400 with his bare hands in a fit of rage, and as a child, he fell from the 18th floor without any protection and was unharmed.\nLin Li firmly believes all this, after all, Wang Ze is an athlete, and when he settles, he has invincible frames, these are basic operations.\nJust like how the 180cm Zhou Baowei naturally resents the self-proclaimed 178cm Bai Bufan, the 185cm athlete Wang Ze also naturally resents me, who claims to be 183cm.\nSo when Wang Ze joined the fray, Lin Li’s defeat was already set in stone.\nBut athletes aren’t invincible either. Afterwards, Lin Li used breakfast as a threat, forcing everyone to turn their target on Wang Ze, ambushing him before he could settle down, and thus the Door Beam soon welcomed a second guest.\nNow he should be in the dorm avenging me against those gutter rats.\nThis is called driving a tiger to swallow a wolf!\nHehe, although Lin Li is not a petty person, once I succeed in cultivation, every one of these people will be sent flying to find the rainbow sea!\nReturning to the classroom.\nThere were quite a few people in the classroom yesterday, but after Xue Jian announced the monthly exam delay last night, there were very few people here today. They probably went back to rest and take a nap, and I only saw Chen Yu Ying and Wang Yuezhi.\nChen Yu Ying had naturally taken Bai Bufan’s seat.\nSigh, if only Wang Yuezhi would go back to the dorm too.\nHehe.\nI bet Wang Yuezhi thinks the same.\n\"Class President.\"\nHappily greeting, Lin Li sat in his seat.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Class President, what are you writing?\" Lin Li curiously tilted his head to look, and it didn’t seem like Chen Yu Ying was doing any assignments.\n\"I’m still working on the autumn trip stuff. I’m the dorm leader of our room, and my roommates have entrusted everything to me, so I’m designing our plan.\" Chen Yu Ying didn’t mind Lin Li’s prying, she even slightly turned her body to let Lin Li see more clearly what she was writing.\nLin Li glanced over.\nThe class president’s autumn trip plan seemed quite long, not just a same-day trip, but overnight as well.\nLooking at the location, it seemed to be in the city of Pingjiang, which is reasonable.\nIf taking a coach, it would take several hours.\nIf coming and going on the same day, the time would all be spent on commuting, and there wouldn’t be any time to really enjoy it.\nAs Lin Li looked over, Chen Yu Ying thought for a moment and said, \"By the way, Lin Li, didn’t Bai Bufan call you the Autumn Travel King? Can you help me take a look at this plan?\"\n\"It’s just that dog being cheeky. Autumn Travel King means Yellow Sweep King; I haven’t organized an autumn outing...\" Since the class president knew the inside story, Lin Li briefly explained the reason. \"So class president, I can’t give you any advice.\"\n\"Hehe~\" Chen Yu Ying giggled, \"So that’s the Autumn Travel King.\"\n...\nWang Yuezhi worked on problems.\nHe knew that Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying were sitting together behind him.\nBut so what? He just needed to study hard and closely follow the class president’s footsteps.\nLin Li and the class president would never be from the same world. They excelled in different subjects, their classes would be divided differently starting from sophomore year, so let him enjoy this last semester.\nIn the more distant future, in university, they would be even further apart.\nNothing to worry about.\nComforting himself with this, Wang Yuezhi felt a lot better.\nHe looked at the math problem in front of him and started solving it.\n\"Solution.\"\nIn high school, writing \"solution\" no longer earns points, but not writing it would deduct one point.\n\"Draw auxiliary lines as shown in the figure, and label the intersection points y, w, z, and y’.\"\nNormal people, when labeling vertices or intersections, tend to follow the alphabet. For example, if there are already ABC in the figure, they start from D. With ABCD, they start from E, and they definitely wouldn’t set Y’ at the beginning like that.\nBut Wang Yuezhi, being from Class 4, was not ordinary. His favorite letters to set were WYZ and Y’.\nBecause after setting them like this.\nYou see, in this problem, △wyz and △cyy’ are forever connected.\nBecause these two triangles share the vertex y, they look like wyz and cyy’ facing each other, cuddling.\nWang Yuezhi continued writing: \"△wyz≌△cyy’\"\nThese two triangles, under his setup, are congruent, fitting perfectly, a natural couple.\nWang Yuezhi’s face broke into an auntie-like smile, feeling that pink bubbles were enveloping him.\nSo happy, so sweet.\nHehe.\nThis is a beautiful future.\nAfter admiring his masterpiece with satisfaction, he formally began to contemplate the problem-solving method.\nThen.\n\"So that’s the Autumn Travel King~~\"\nSince there were only three people in the classroom, and it was not yet the actual nap time, Chen Yu Ying’s laughter was almost unrestrained, and Wang Yuezhi heard it clearly.\nWang Yuezhi told himself not to look back at a time like this, but his body subconsciously twisted.\nAlthough he had seen such a scene before, it once again stimulated him—Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying facing each other, cuddling.\nThe scene in his mind came true, but unfortunately, the main character was not himself.\nNo hehe.\nTurning back with an expressionless face, Wang Yuezhi looked at the math homework in front of him.\nTheir classes wouldn’t be together, universities wouldn’t be together, future is promising, future is promising...\nJust as Wang Yuezhi was hypnotizing, comforting, and numbing himself, he noticed something.\nBu Hao.\nWang Yuezhi felt like he had seen Earth’s dimensional reduction, fearfully trembling his hand, looked at the line he just wrote on the homework:\n\"△wyz≌△cyy’\"\nThis...\n△wyz and △cyy’... They’re not actually together, there’s a congruence symbol between them.\nTurn the = sign vertically, isn’t it ll?

      "content": "Chapter 70: Chapter 66: It Turns Out I Already Hold a Special Place in the Class Leader’s Heart\n\"Do you think Wang Yuezhi performs poorly like you in exams? The math we’re learning now feels pretty easy, it shouldn’t be that bad, right?\"\nChen Yu Ying was a bit puzzled. Mostly because Wang Yuezhi’s grades aren’t much worse than hers, and it’s not like they’re competition questions, just regular homework questions. How could they be difficult for him?\n\"Should I go ask him what’s wrong?\"\n\"Caring for classmates is the right thing to do,\" Lin Li nodded, then suddenly shouted, \"Wang Yuezhi, are you okay?\"\n\"I’m fine! Don’t bother me!!\"\n\"Class rep, he’s fine, shouting loudly that he’s fine, which means he’s definitely fine, more than just fine.\" Lin Li reported back to Chen Yu Ying.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nSomething feels off.\n\"Also, class rep, although my grades aren’t great, your description of ’burn books and bury scholars’ was a bit too much. At the end of last term, I ranked in the 400s of my grade. You’re insulting not just me but also the 200 students who ranked behind me! Class rep, please apologize to me.\" Lin Li defended himself.\nNansang Middle School’s first-year students are split into 20 classes with a total of nearly 700 students. Ranking in the 400s is indeed somewhere in the lower middle.\n\"Alright, alright~ I’m sorry.\" Chen Yu Ying apologized with a smile.\nAs for Wang Yuezhi, since he said he’s fine, then he’s fine. Mainly because Wang Yuezhi’s sudden act of throwing his homework was too abrupt and without any warning. It felt like he was just emotionally unstable, something he should handle by himself.\nThe apology sounded so gentle, Lin Li found it very comforting, even more so than when friends invited him to game together on a rainy weekend night outside.\nThe class rep doesn’t seem like a little fairy at all; she easily apologizes to a man, which left Lin Li feeling not disappointed at all.\n\"Alright, let’s get back to the autumn outing plan. Although you’re not the real king of ’Autumn Exploring’~Lin Li, I still want to know, from your personal perspective, what do you think of my plan? Any suggestions for improvements?\" Chen Yu Ying asked, chuckling in the middle.\nThe ’Autumn Exploring’ king, Lin Li, picked up Chen Yu Ying’s plan, carefully read it, and then nodded seriously:\n\"Although I’m not an expert in this area, I’d like to share my views, but after carefully reviewing your guide and thinking for a long time, I honestly don’t know how to respond—Just like I said at the beginning, I’m not an expert in this area.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nBut before Chen Yu Ying could pout in dissatisfaction, Lin Li laughed and replied: \"Class rep, I don’t really travel, and I’m clueless about guides. Your travel plan looks interesting to me, and I can definitely agree to it.\nBut I don’t think you’d want that as an answer, so if I have to suggest something, I’d say don’t make the schedule too tight. I have no interest in ’commando-style’ tours. I go out to play, not to punch in, but to relax—just my personal opinion.\"\n\"You’re right; I’ll remove one sightseeing spot, so there’s more time to slot into other activities,\" Chen Yu Ying said, slightly frowning, while pinching her chin and looking at her plan, then picked up a pen and started making changes.\n\"How about now, isn’t this much better?\"\n\"Yes, yes.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Then if my autumn outing plan gets selected, will you go?\" Chen Yu Ying asked again.\n\"Of course, class rep, do you need my vote?\" Lin Li considered this possibility and said, \"Don’t worry, when the time comes my vote will definitely go to your dormitory. I’m not that close with Bai Bufan and the others; just surface friends. I’ve been annoyed with them for a long time.\"\n\"Indeed, I need your help with something, but not this vote,\" Chen Yu Ying hesitated slightly before speaking:\n\"Here’s the thing.\nThe girls actually don’t have much in mind, so they’ve fully entrusted me with this. Plus Zhuo Yongfei and a few of the boys didn’t find any issues, so it should be more than half of the class. After voting tomorrow, this can be our class’s plan.\"\nLin Li nodded.\nNo need for his vote indeed.\nBeing a professional sidekick, he knew that when the other person’s words were obviously not finished, all he needed to do was use body language to show he was listening, without interrupting with words like ’and then?’.\n\"However, Zhuo Yongfei told me he asked some of the other boys for their opinions, and they’re quite resistant to the idea of staying overnight outside during the autumn outing,\" Chen Yu Ying continued. \"Because many of them are indifferent to the outing itself—but this is on the premise that the outing only takes the designated one day.\nI asked the teacher what happens if we choose not to go on the outing. Teacher Xue said that those not going on the outing can’t go home early or stay in the dormitory. On Friday, all students not going on the autumn outing will have classrooms and teachers arranged by the school for self-study.\nAnd my plan would take up Saturday, which is normally a day they return home. So I worry many boys might choose to stay on campus for self-study and then go home ’normally’ on Friday.\"\nThe autumn outing, being an activity with personal expenses, naturally isn’t and can’t be mandatory. Students have the choice to go or not, and the school’s arrangement for self-study is a normal ’measure’ since it’s considered a team-building activity promoting overall student development. They certainly hope everyone can participate.\nWithout such an arrangement, a bunch of people might not go straight home, resulting in sparse photos on the school’s public account and admission materials, with only three to four students per class, making it look like the students are taking the teachers on an outing, giving an impression of a reversed hierarchy.\nPrincipal Wang might as well choose to put up a photo of him as the [Anti-Vice Pioneer], which would be more dignifying.\n\"Oh—\" Lin Li nodded, chiming in: \"So, class rep, you’re worried that Bai Bufan and the others, seeing that our class’s final plan is yours, will choose not to go?\"\n\"Yes, for many of us, this is the first and last chance for everyone to go on a trip together. After reclassifying next term, there might be only a few familiar faces in each class,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nNansang Middle School, located in Zhejiang Province, adopts the New Gaokao education system. The class division isn’t based on arts and sciences but offers students significant autonomy by allowing them to choose three out of seven subjects.\nAside from the basic three arts and three sciences subjects, there’s also a [Technology] course that includes general technology and information technology.\nStudents only need to select three out of seven subjects as their Gaokao test subjects. Regarding the different scoring challenges of each subject, the testing subjects use a point distribution system. Based on the exam ranking within the province, scores are distributed: top rank scores 100, second rank 97, third rank 94, and so on.\nIt’s said to be the most liberal college entrance examination system of Tokyo University, unique to Zhejiang Province. In other places, the new college entrance examination typically adopts the 3+1+2 method—choosing between physics and history is mandatory.\nHowever, after class divisions, there are only twenty classes, so some relatively niche combinations, such as physics, chemistry, plus politics—this combination of the most liberal arts and the most science subjects—may have choosers, but it’s basically impossible to form a class.\nSuch students either choose moving classes or opt for the top twenty combinations that are more popular in their year group.\nBut after all, there are twenty classes, so by the time of class division, it’s basically a case of everyone going their separate ways. It’s almost impossible to have more than ten students choose the same class unless it’s a competition class.\nThat’s why Chen Yu Ying said so.\nThe class monitor is quite sentimental, visibly showing some disappointment when saying this.\nLin Li reached out and patted Chen Yu Ying on the shoulder, comforting her:\n\"Don’t worry, class monitor. One call as class monitor, a lifetime class monitor. Even if we aren’t in the same class in the future, you’ll always be my class monitor. If you need anything later on, just call me, and I’ll provide all support except for physical help! I’m really looking forward to my new class monitor!\"\nChen Yu Ying was just about to feel touched, but the feeling dissipated. She chuckled and held it back, looking at Lin Li with a slightly resentful gaze.\n~~Let your new class monitor~~Let your new class monitor~~\nClass 4 of Year 1 is really a place full of pranksters. However, the little prankster that Chen Yu Ying transformed into is much cuter than the resentful ghosts Ding Sihan and Koukou turned into. Lin Li didn’t have the slightest intention to exorcise or run away.\nBut her silent staring was indeed unbearable, and Lin Li surrendered.\nHe raised his right arm at 45 degrees, fingers together pointing forward:\n\"I have only one class monitor in my heart! Loyalty! Honesty!\"\nChen Yu Ying, looking helpless, pressed down Lin Li’s hand which would subconsciously become a soap if seen by a Jew, and spoke again:\n\"Hmph, who cares if you’re looking forward to your new class monitor.\nSo, this is our Class 4 of Year 1’s only chance to go out and have fun together. I hope we can get as many people as possible to come. If many people are unwilling to come, I’d rather change the plan.\"\n\"So, class monitor, do you mean you want me to persuade Bai Bufan and the others?\" Lin Li had roughly understood Chen Yu Ying’s meaning, so he asked proactively.\n\"Yes! Bai Bufan and the others... Zhuo Yongfei doesn’t have much say with them and can’t persuade them, but you can. If your group doesn’t come, the class outing would lack a lot of excitement, and the atmosphere would be hard to maintain. You guys are really important.\"\nWhat Chen Yu Ying said was indeed true. If Lin Li and Bai Bufan didn’t go, the outing might be less noisy and annoying, but there would certainly be fewer interesting and funny things.\nHowever, Lin Li just shook his head and laughed:\n\"Class monitor, do you not understand the thin skin of fifteen or sixteen-year-old boys? Just your earlier speech, combined with your voice and appearance, do you really not understand how lethal it is?\nAs long as you personally tell them those words, I can guarantee that 90% of them will salute as if injected with chicken blood, saying, ’Thank you, class monitor, for your appreciation. We will ensure we complete the task.’\"\nA fellow from Xiling immediately stood at attention.\nHearing this, Chen Yu Ying lowered her head slightly, her voice noticeably lower than usual, with her ears turning a bit red:\n\"But you don’t understand the thin skin of fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls. I can only say such things in front of you, because I know your perviness! How could I say it to each of them? If I seriously said it and met the 10% who ruthlessly refuse, I wouldn’t know what to do.\"\nShe could only say it in front of Lin Li.\nThis special status was very gratifying.\nSo Lin Li chuckled.\nThe only problem was that his special status seemed to be a bit skewed.\n\"Class monitor, can you explain what’s meant by knowing my perviness?\" The non-chuckling Lin Li asked with a serious face.\nChen Yu Ying raised her head, her clear eyes staring at Lin Li, then she blinked.\nSilence speaks louder than words.\n——Does this even need an explanation?\nThat’s probably what Chen Yu Ying wanted to convey.\nBut seeing Lin Li’s expression not improving, still serious, even to the point where Chen Yu Ying was a bit frightened inside.\nShe started to regret making this joke, just about to apologize when she heard Lin Li begin to emphasize:\n\"You forgot to add a ’good’ before that.\"\n\"Eh?\"\n\"I’m a good pervert. You said it yourself, class monitor. This is very important. I absolutely won’t allow you to remove this prefix!\"\n\"...I’m sorry.\"\nAfter being stunned for a little while, Chen Yu Ying responded, with a smile flashing in her clear eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 71: Chapter 67: Finally Endured Until the Beauty Trap\nLin Li and Chen Yu Ying seem to have had an argument, and now they are in a standoff.\nBoth of their faces don’t look good.\nWang Yuezhi keenly noticed this.\nHee hee.\nHe excitedly placed his trusty little packet of tissues in his pocket, come on argue, argue to your heart’s content, let me, Wang Yuezhi the warm guy, have my moment to shine!\nThey say warm guys come after dogs, isn’t Lin Li that dog? Soon it will be my turn.\nThe pretty girl and the dog laughed again, seemingly resolving their misunderstandings.\nNot hee hee.\n...\n\"Class monitor, what are you laughing at? Is this funny to you? Just tell me, if I were a perverted creep, would you still dare say this in front of me? You wouldn’t even dare sit next to me, right!\nSo I’m emphasizing this matter very seriously to you now! Doing this is really disrespectful to me! There’s a world of difference between being a creep and not!\" Lin Li said earnestly.\n\"I’m really sorry, I won’t make this mistake again, please forgive me.\" Chen Yu Ying, trying hard to keep a straight face, failed and spoke with suppressed laughter.\nShe was really startled just now, thinking Lin Li was genuinely angry.\n\"Hehe, if there’s a next time, there better not be a third. If you dare do it a fourth time, I’ll let you know during the fifth just how mad I was the sixth.\" Lin Li said with a cold smile.\nChen Yu Ying blinked: \"You really are someone with strong principles.\"\n\"I think so too.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Alright then, back to the matter where I need your help. I truly don’t dare say this in front of them. Not many girls want to go, and I’m persuading those who don’t. But for the boys, those not familiar with Zhuo Yongfei or who can’t speak to him, you’re the only one I can rely on, Lin Li.\"\nChen Yu Ying looked at Lin Li with hopeful eyes, entrusting him.\n\"Such a reasonable request that’s for the sake of the class, as a fine young man of the new era, there’s no way to refuse, I’d agree immediately.\" Lin Li said.\n\"Thank you, Lin Li!\"\n\"Class monitor, you’re thanking me too early.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"It’s good I’m not a fine young man of the new era, remember class monitor, I’m a creep.\" Lin Li sincerely said, giving himself a thumbs-up with his right hand.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"But you’re a good creep.\" It was Chen Yu Ying’s turn to emphasize.\n\"Still a creep, so refusal is reasonable.\" Lin Li emphasized.\nDamn, Lin Li sure holds grudges!\nChen Yu Ying bit her lower lip, and after a while, released it. She suddenly reached out, grabbed the hem of Lin Li’s short sleeve, and started to shake it:\n\"Please, Lin Li~~\"\nBu Hao!\nIt’s the beauty trap!\nYet, as an Immortal Cultivator, how could Lin Li let such worldly temptations cloud his mind? He had an enhanced physique that increased resistance to allure by 100%!\nSo Lin Li turned his head aside: \"Hmph, begging me won’t work.\"\nKeep that mouth shut, no smiling!\nLin Li was in a furious battle with his own muscles.\nSeeing Lin Li’s almost sparking face, Chen Yu Ying shook Lin Li’s hem with more force: \"Please, Lin Li~~ help me~~\"\n\"I’ve been gutting fish at Da Run Fa for ten years. My heart is already cold as iron, class monitor, even if you call me brother several times, I won’t help you!\" the stoic teenager declared, looking out the window, firm in his refusal.\nThe young man’s resolve was iron-clad, unbreakable.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nShe didn’t even call him brother?\nWait.\n\"...\"\nFirst, Chen Yu Ying envisioned a little Lin Li in her mind and started to furiously stab him. Then, with teeth grazing her lower lip, she used a voice unimaginable in its sweetness:\n\"Brother, brother~~ Lin Li brother~~ please help me~~\"\nLin Li realized something.\nThe problem with clampers is only because one hasn’t met a good clamper.\nIs falling to the beauty trap truly a hero’s fate?\nXiaojing, I’m sorry, my moonlight might need to change people, wishing you well in the detention center, let’s not meet after you get out.\n\"Li·Li·Bro·ther!\"\nIn his daze, with a heavy voice and increased force, Lin Li was tugged a bit forward.\nTurning his head, he found Chen Yu Ying, who had called him numerous times without response, looking like she was about to get sulky.\n\"A fine young man of the new era, who else but me! Class monitor, leave this heavy burden to me. Even if Bai Bufan and the others die, I’ll carry their ashes with us, using them to light our path on the autumn trip!\"\nUnderstanding when to stop, Lin Li immediately patted his chest, taking on this arduous task.\n\"Remember what you said, if not done well, I won’t teach you again.\" Chen Yu Ying immediately withdrew her hand, turning to the desk, covering her face with her left hand, and with the right one holding a pen, doodling aimlessly, but looking extremely busy.\nBut upon closer inspection, you’d find the pen tip never touched the page.\n\"Rest assured in my ability to handle things!\"\nLin Li stretched lazily, looked up, and noticed only he and Chen Yu Ying were left in the classroom.\nWhen did Wang Yuezhi leave, and he didn’t even say a word.\nLooks like the math problem really troubled him today at noon.\n...\n\"Class monitor, how do you solve this?\" The lunch break officially began, and Lin Li entered study mode, encountering difficulties and asking for help.\n\"Today, I don’t want to answer any questions from a creep, whether good or not.\" Chen Yu Ying said sullenly without turning her head.\nDamn, the class monitor sure holds grudges.\nNo worries, just appease her.\nLin Li raised his voice into a playful tone: \"Lady~~\"\n\"Lin Li, don’t do that, it scares me!\" Chen Yu Ying shivered, quickly turned her head, and rapidly spoke: \"Give me the problem, I’ll teach you now, just please stop talking like that!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThe effect worked, she was indeed appeased.\nThe process wasn’t quite as he imagined.\nWhy does it feel a bit hurtful?\n...\n\"Class monitor, I’m going to the restroom.\"\nLin Li got up, at the same time taking out some accumulated small garbage from the drawer, walked to the trash can outside the door.\nSomeone was quite indulgent, throwing a brand-new unused pack of tissues in the trash can, wonder what they were thinking.\nUnderneath the tissues, there were no liquids, just draft papers. Looking around and seeing no one, Lin Li swiftly picked it up without anyone knowing.\nBingo, saved a dollar.\nThe restroom was at the end of the corridor.\nOutside the restroom was a relatively large open space, where there was a water dispenser.\nLin Li saw an acquaintance here.\nWhy was Wang Yuezhi sitting here, leaning against the wall on the ground, burying his head in his legs?\nWas he crying?\nLin Li had heard of diligent students being quite obsessive over problems, breaking down when failing to solve them. Today, he finally saw it in reality.\nSince Wang Yuezhi hadn’t disgusted him recently, Lin Li wasn’t going to act petty and mock him.\nLin Li sighed, walked over silently, took out the tissues he just picked up, placed them beside Wang Yuezhi, and then walked away.\nIn such moments, gestures or words of comfort would only cause more harm.\nSilently caring is what Wang Yuezhi needs most.\nIt’s not a crime for men to cry.\n...\nWang Yuezhi lifted his head.\nOut here to clear his mind, away from the eyesore, he sighed heavily in frustration.\nThen Yu Guang noticed the tissues.\nHe shuddered, rolling and crawling on the ground to the corner of the wall.\nDamn, haunted?\nA relentless ghost tissue that can’t be discarded?",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Chapter 68 Bai Bufan Really Deserves to Die\n\"Bai Bufan, if the school outing goes until Saturday night before coming home, are you still going?\" Lin Li asked directly when Bai Bufan sat back down next to him in the classroom.\nBai Bufan glanced at Lin Li, yawned, and replied, \"Zhuo Yongfei asked you too? I’m planning to decide then. If it takes up Saturday, I’ll definitely hesitate. Going home to sleep and play games is way better. I’m leaning towards not going.\"\n\"It’s great that you want to go.\" Lin Li nodded appreciatively.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Are your ears not working? I just said I’m leaning towards not wanting to go.\" Bai Bufan enunciated each word very clearly this time.\n\"You want to go, right?\" Lin Li smiled at Bai Bufan, his tone gentle.\n\"...\"\nLin Li’s eyes took on the mysterious look of a fish from a college entrance exam reading comprehension passage. Seeing this, Bai Bufan swallowed and nodded like a pecking chicken:\n\"I want to go, I really want to go, I have to go. Who said overnight outings are bad? This overnight outing is fantastic!\"\nIt was clear that if he didn’t plan on going for the outing next weekend, he couldn’t think of it this weekend either.\nLin Li’s eerie smile immediately shifted to a pleasant one as he patted Bai Bufan on the shoulder appreciatively:\n\"Great, then I’ll leave the responsibility of persuading the other five in your room to go, barring any special reasons, to you. Arigato, Feiyangyang-san.\"\nAlright, up to this point, the task assigned by the class monitor was almost done.\nI am a genius indeed.\nTime to sleep.\nJust as Lin Li was about to lie down on the desk for a nap, Bai Bufan forcibly pulled him up, grabbing Lin Li by the collar with wide eyes and questioning:\n\"What’s this arigato crap? Did Zhuo Yongfei control you with a remote? Let me check what’s stuffed in your butt!\"\n\"Crafty zero,\" Lin Li slapped away Bai Bufan’s hand, explaining, \"It has nothing to do with Zhuo Yongfei. I haven’t spoken a word to him today.\"\nBai Bufan pondered, then came to a new conclusion: \"Is everything an order from the class monitor? Were you controlled by her?\"\nAfter all, the only person Lin Li hung out with during lunch was Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Sort of, she hopes everyone can participate in this outing, to have a big, fun time together before the class separation.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"What benefits did she offer you?\" Bai Bufan asked doubtfully.\n\"What benefits are needed? The class monitor’s intentions are good from every angle. As a fine young person in the new era, it’s my duty to comply. Asking for benefits for such requests is really inhumane.\" Lin Li said contemptuously.\n\"I get that logic, but Lin Li, you’re not always rational. How about swearing on a chicken roll?\" Bai Bufan smiled.\nA trick that works wonders everywhere.\n\"I swear on a chicken roll that I didn’t plan on taking any benefits from the class monitor.\" Lin Li sneered.\nThis time, it doesn’t work on me!\nIn fact, my initial refusal at lunchtime was just joking; even without Yu Ying’s charm, I would have agreed, though there would be a difference: I wouldn’t make it a military order.\nI would probably just casually mention it, saying I want to join everyone for fun during the outing, without doing anything more.\nSadly, Lin Li’s verbal games couldn’t fool Bai Bufan, who also sneered, \"I want you to swear whether or not you received benefits!\"\nHeight of the Way, height of the Devil.\n\"That said, if the class monitor forced benefits on me, not accepting them would be disrespectful to her, wouldn’t it?\" Lin Li didn’t hide it.\n\"So you pass this difficult task onto me, but all the promised benefits from the Imperial Army you pocketed as profit?\" Bai Bufan was angry.\n\"Mm-hmm.\"\n\"?\"\nSeeing Lin Li nod and say \"mm-hmm,\" Bai Bufan scratched his ear, doubting he’d heard correctly.\n\"Do you have the nerve to ’mm-hmm’ like that!?\"\n\"So calmly nodding, admitting you think I’m livestock in your heart?\"\n\"Mm-hmm.\"\n\"You damn! Lin Li, if you don’t share a bit of the benefits with me, even if you threaten with the outing, I won’t budge! Livestock has dignity too!\" Bai Bufan said, crossing his arms firmly.\nLin Li, however, looked troubled.\n\"Bufan, do you really want me to share the benefits with you?\" Lin Li asked tentatively.\n\"Can really share? Yes, yes, yes!\" Bai Bufan nodded quickly.\n\"Alright.\" Lin Li nodded, took a deep breath, as if making a major decision.\nUnder Bai Bufan’s expectant gaze, Lin Li grabbed his own shirt hem.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWhat’s he doing?\n\"Bufan geigei~ help me please~~\" Clampy Lin Li went online.\nMany years later, every time Bai Bufan recalled this moment, he couldn’t tell what was in his mind back then, the mysteries of the universe? The essence of life? The end of mathematics? The derivation of physics? It felt like all of it, yet none of it.\nBut he remembered clearly that after the brain freeze ended, his reaction was:\n\"Lin Li, darn you, idiot, what are you doing, did Zhou Baowei bite you, did you catch rabies!\"\n—Bai Bufan, along with his chair, retreated two meters, and the chair cried out loudly in sorrow.\nBecause of the precedent with Chen Yu Ying, Lin Li had anticipated Bai Bufan’s current reaction somewhat, so although he felt a small amount of sadness, he remained generally calm, spreading his hands in slight innocence, sighed:\n\"You asked me to share the benefits with you, wasn’t I doing that? Your response really disappoints me.\"\nBai Bufan’s expression froze again.\nThat comment seems loaded with implications.\nLet’s analyze it.\nHe moved his chair and himself back to the desk, his expression vacant, eyes unfocused staring ahead, extending a hand towards Lin Li: \"Hold on, I’m barbecuing.\"\nLin Li nodded: \"Remember to add more spice.\"\nHalf a minute later, Bai Bufan finally pieced things together, mechanically turning his head to Lin Li, with an incredulous expression: \"Is it what I think it is? Did the class monitor use her charm?\"\nLin Li smiled and nodded, he’s smart indeed.\n\"So what you just did which could top the Qing’s Ten Great Tortures, you call that sharing a bit of the benefit with me?\" Bai Bufan laughed, this time genuinely laughed in anger.\n\"Firstly, I’d like a little more respect, I was clamping hard. Secondly, if you’re really unsatisfied, I could call over the class monitor to truly share some benefits with you, can’t I?\"\n\"No no no!\" Bai Bufan hastily waved his hands.\nOthers might stand excitedly if pulled by Chen Yu Ying, but Bai Bufan would probably stiffen to death.\n\"No can do, you’ve rejected what you wanted.\" Lin Li shrugged more innocently, his exhaled breath still carrying thick laughter.\nEven a flame punch couldn’t describe Bai Bufan’s complex emotions now.\nTotally had me under control.\nAfter a while, he accepted his fate with a sigh, \"I’ll give it a simple mention, just say that both you and I are going, so it would be more fun if everyone joins, but no guarantees.\"\n\"Sure, no problem.\" Lin Li nodded.\nIf Bai Bufan doesn’t agree, I’ll try to persuade him again tomorrow or before we leave next weekend. At worst, I’ll offer some perks.\nI can’t possibly wear out my good workhorse.\nNeed to exploit resources sustainably.\n\"But Lin Li, you must promise me one thing: never be the pinch hitter again.\" Bai Bufan said seriously.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n...\nAfter school today, since there was no urgent need to explore other places, Lin Li went straight home.\nHe opened his phone, and Song Luping still hadn’t sent him the document. You could say he’s the perfect office worker, strictly against early submissions before the deadline.\nLin Li didn’t want to rush him. If it still hasn’t been sent by Friday night, he might subtly check if there are any difficulties to hint at urgency.\nA rare early night returning home.\nTime to discover some treasures.\n\"Lin Li: Please send me the verification code, thanks orz.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: 06017.

Even joking about Hell needs moderation. \\\"Sweating Yellow Bean\\\"?\"\n\"Lin Li: You didn’t spare him either.\"\nLin Li closed WeChat, then logged into Bai Bufan’s cloud account on his computer by scanning a QR code.\nIt was like a mouse falling into a grain silo.\nBai Bufan had meticulously organized all the resources.\nGeneral, Games, Live Action, Non-Real.\nSkipping the general section even a dog wouldn’t look at, Lin Li first opened Games, surprised to find that Bai Bufan had categorized internally: Masterpiece, Excellent, Decent, Ordinary, Trash.\nEven more subdivisions inside, Lin Li opened Non-Japanese, greeted by titles like Virtue, Home Tutor, Agent 17...\nLin Li queued each of these compressed files for download but paused them all.\nTonight’s target wasn’t these; he’d critique them thoroughly when he had a chance.\nHe opened Live Action’s Masterpieces section, not large in number, but Lin Li’s eyes landed on a folder with a strong recommendation label.\nVTCC-410 [4K Restoration] [With Subtitles].\nHe clicked the preview image, and Lin Li smiled—it’s his favorite type and indeed one he hadn’t seen before.\nTonight’s decision is this, 11.4GB, reasonable for 4K, and the ID wasn’t from one of those outrageously extreme films he remembered, no problem.\nHe clicked download, then began his pre-play routines. Even with a membership, 11.4GB is quite a download.\n\"Wipes, check! Trash can, check! Post-shower water heater switch, check! Curtains, check! Lights, check! Immersive sound system, check! Pants, check!\"\nHaving prepared everything, Lin Li sat on his computer chair, ready for the moment, and clicked unzip! No password needed! Successfully unzipped!\nPlay!\n\"Live Baccarat Casino, Sexy Dealers, Online Dealing! Click to get a thousand startup...\"\nYes, absolutely yes! This is the right feel! Lin Li watched as the sound disappeared, and the computer screen went black, anticipating the main content was about to start.\n\"BabyBus!\"\n\"Starting today, I’ll go to the bathroom myself, Mum and Dad don’t underestimate me~~\"\nLin Li’s smile froze.\nWhen he saw a clumsy animated bear start singing in the bathroom on his big screen, he was dumbfounded.\n\"BabyBus teaches me toilet secrets, I can’t wait I need the toilet~~\"\nLin Li’s gaze fixed on the top left corner of the screen.\nCCTV14 Children’s Channel.\nLin Li pulled the progress bar.\n\"Hi Uncle Long!\"\n\"Hi Xiaoyu...

I’m gonna shove an umbrella up your a** and open it!\"\n\"Lin Li: I damn know you’re watching!\"\nSeemingly knowing he wouldn’t listen, Lin Li switched to sending messages.\nAfter setting his messages to Do Not Disturb, Bai Bufan squirmed like a worm, chuckling at the thought of Lin Li’s current state.\n\"That’s what you get for squeezing benefits out of me!\"\nThen the bed board received a kick, as Zhou Baowei from the lower bunk reproached, \"No rituals at night.\"\n\"Firstly, it’s even less appropriate in broad daylight, secondly, I’m not interested, I just thought of a geigei of mine who’s now completely disinterested, that’s all!\"\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nWhat a nutjob.",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Chapter 69: If the Qi Blood you improve is just blood pressure, I’ll be angry.\nBai Bufan is still considered human.\nExcept for the VTCC series of license plates, which are all recorded by CCTV, the other things are real.\nLet’s forgive him for now.\n...\nFriday.\nIt was only 3:50 AM when Lin Li was woken up by the alarm clock.\nThe sky was still dark and somewhat hazy, with few clouds, understandable since Lao Da had not yet gotten up to work at this time.\nThe moon was still hanging in the sky, but its brightness was indistinguishable from the surroundings, so you couldn’t notice it without looking carefully.\nLin Li was very sleepy, but he didn’t linger in bed; he got up immediately.\nWhen there’s motivation, getting up is always easy.\nUp till now, Lin Li thought the only significant physical improvement he had was a 100% enhancement in memory.\nToday, however, being the last day of Task One, his body was finally going to undergo a useful improvement. Getting up early might leave him some leeway in case of any unexpected situations.\n\"But... this 50% increase in Qi Blood won’t raise my blood pressure, will it?\" Lin Li stopped in his tracks while getting dressed to go downstairs, frowning as he muttered to himself.\nIf it’s true that his blood pressure increases by 50%, once he confirms this news, he might be able to increase it by another 50% in a short time.\nThat might be fatal.\nMost people don’t need to think like this, but Lin Li simply couldn’t ease his mind with this system.\nLin Li had to speculate with the greatest malice towards this system.\nStill, one can’t just stop eating because food might choke you; naturally, tasks have to be completed. However, for safety’s sake, it’s best to make some preparations.\nLin Li found a blood pressure monitor at home; this was something his mom was coaxed into buying during a door-to-door sales pitch, and he also found a matching box of blood pressure medication. The expiry date hadn’t passed yet.\nHe first used the blood pressure monitor to check his current blood pressure, which was normal. After recording the data, Lin Li went downstairs with the medication.\nIt was too early in the morning for the community park to be as lively as before. As Lin Li walked along, he only saw a few elderly people who were up early to buy groceries or breakfast; there wasn’t a single person exercising.\nAt his usual spot, Xiaozhou naturally wasn’t there either.\nBut whether he was there or not didn’t affect his exercise routine.\n[Consecutive awakening before 5:00 AM for a week, diligently practicing Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, a total of at least half an hour before 7:00 AM (7/7).]\n[Task One is complete.]\n[You have received Physical Improvement: Qi Blood increased by 50%; System Currency *100]\nWhen the system reward notification came through, Lin Li suddenly felt a bit dizzy, his vision went dark, and he nearly couldn’t stay on his feet.\nSystem, I fucking knew it! You really did it!\nI made good expectations, and you ignored them all, but when I talked about the bad ones, it hit right on.\nLin Li didn’t rush to take the medication, though. He noticed that his exposed hands and feet seemed to be turning red, which shouldn’t happen with high blood pressure.\nSo he quickly grabbed his water cup and ran back home.\nBetter go home first.\n\"Lin Li? Why are you here so early today?\" Zhou Youwei saw Lin Li rushing towards this entrance and asked in surprise.\nLin Li waved him off, having no time to respond, and ran around Zhou Youwei, continuing towards his home.\nZhou Youwei watched Lin Li run back to his residential building, full of confusion.\nWhat’s the matter?\nWhy did he come so early and leave so fast?\nZhou Youwei squinted suspiciously. This kid was sneaky and showed a panic-stricken look when spotted, almost as if there was undeniably something fishy.\nNo doubt.\nIt’s a trap.\nZhou Youwei went to the usual spot but didn’t start practicing; instead, he cautiously looked around.\nThis time, Lin Li won’t get away with setting me up!\n...\nLin Li ran all the way back home and sat down on the sofa.\nThe dizziness was beginning to ease, but his body was still turning red.\nLin Li started measuring his blood pressure again.\nIt was a bit higher than before, but still within the normal range. More likely a fluctuation from his exercise rather than a system-induced result.\nLin Li relaxed a bit, tossed the medication aside, got up, and went to the bathroom, looking at his truly red and warm self.\nThe blush on a young man’s face surpasses any sweet talk; now I’m all over with flirtatious talk.\nLin Li leaned on the sink, breathing slowly.\nThe dizziness was gone now.\nThe fatigue in his limbs, possibly from exercise-induced soreness, was starting to fade.\nAfter standing in place for a few more minutes, he noticed the unnatural redness on his body was also beginning to recede.\n\"So, were the discomforts just due to my body not adapting to the 50% Qi Blood increase all at once?\"\nLin Li could sense some vague changes in his body, similar to the mysterious feeling after practicing even-numbered Chapters with spirit stones, although the focus of both was different. However, he couldn’t pinpoint the exact changes yet.\nFeel... more energized?\nBut it’s likely that the Qi Blood increase would bring benefits to someone like me living in a modern world.\n\"Stamina? Vitality? Health?\"\nBut nothing to do with Yang energy.\nHe could only wait to feel it later. With a 50% increase, he’ll surely feel it obvious later on. Lin Li wasn’t in a hurry.\nNow, Lin Li turned his attention to the system.\n[Seven days passed in the blink of an eye, the body has sensed the strength, the path ahead is clear, keep the momentum, do not stop here.]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task One: For one month, get up before 5:00 AM, diligently practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, a total of at least half an hour before 7:00 AM.]\n[Rewards: Physical Improvement: Comprehensive Recovery Ability Enhancement 50%, Qi Blood Increase 50%; Lower Grade Spirit Stone *20; System Currency *150]\n[Comprehensive Recovery Ability: Includes recoverable values such as physical ability, spiritual power, blood production capacity, internal force, libido, mana, mecha endurance, etc.]\nThis was the new task activated when he completed the previous one, but his mind wasn’t on it then, so he only checked it now.\n\"...\"\nThe rewards are great.\nThe 20 spirit stones alone were enough to make Lin Li happy.\nBut is there something odd mixed into the description of this comprehensive recovery ability?\nWill my cooldown time be reduced by half in the future too?\nThe time a person can be a Wise One in their life is already limited, and now it’s going to be reduced even more?\nHehe.\nLooking forward to it.\n\"Worthy of the name ’comprehensive,’ truly comprehensive.\"\nJust being able to accelerate the recovery of physical strength and Spiritual Power already shows its value.\nUnfortunately, the task takes too long, it will take a whole month to complete.\n\"Sigh, one task after another, having to get up before 5:00 AM every day, with the system like this, I’ll never get to sleep in again in my life...\" Lin Li suddenly stopped mid-sentence.\nThis isn’t something to say lightly, Xiling Town has many dialects, Minnan is one of them, and Lin Li knows a few words used for cursing.\nIf you want to know what \"sleeping in\" means in Minnan, if you’ve watched Wang Lei’s livestream with Gan Lingniang, you should remember a word besides Zhu Zhenyi—\"lazy bones.\"\nThe two are similar.\nAnd the pronunciation of ’sleep’ in Minnan is somewhat like ’wash.’\n\"I still get to sleep in, and I can sleep.\" Thus said Lin Li.\n...\nBefore Lin Li went warm, Zhou Youwei did.\nThis morning he didn’t do anything, not even Tai Chi, spending all his time looking for the traps Lin Li had laid out.\nLooked for a whole hour.\nHe even found all the dog poop in the bushes, witnessing all this, Zhang Fang asked him if he wanted to join the neighborhood poop-scooping team.\nNone of this dog poop was fresh, so it probably wasn’t done by Lin Li,\nIt really seemed like Lin Li didn’t leave any traps.\nBut that’s impossible!\nNo one understands Lin Li better than Zhou Youwei.\nLost in thought, Zhou Youwei suddenly opened his eyes wide, haha, now he understood.\n\"Lin Li’s plan is to make me think he set traps, but actually, there are no traps, causing me to feel anxious and fearful!\"\nThe more Zhou Youwei thought about it, the more he felt it was true.\nThis guy is indeed extremely insidious!\n\"I’m not anxious or afraid!\"\nHaughtily muttering to himself, Zhou Youwei, having found his ’answer,’ finally contentedly headed home.\n...\nThe benefits brought by the improvement in Qi Blood, Lin Li quickly felt it.\nOn the way riding his bicycle, he could clearly see that the time he could sustain pedaling with all his strength had indeed increased.\nAfter the exhaustion from morning exercise completely faded away, feeling rested, he felt full of endless energy all over again.\nHis endurance was much stronger than before.\nBut the changes brought by Qi Blood were definitely not limited to this.\nBecause his spirits had visibly improved, and when he went out, he noticed that the faint dark circles he had accumulated had disappeared for this period.\nThe coating on his tongue had turned a healthy pink.\n——His kidneys seemed to have benefited from this improvement as well.\nGreat!\nSadly, the sleepiness didn’t disappear, after all, he did get up too early this morning.\nFull of spirit, Lin Li entered through the main door directly this time, exchanging glances with Wang Ze at the entrance.\nYesterday’s grudge was perhaps the perfect time for revenge today.\nSo Lin Li sneered, \"Wang Ze, my divine skill has reached its peak, and I’ve become the new sports student. You, come out and duel with me. After today, our class four can only have one sports student!\"\n\"I voluntarily give up competing for this sports student spot.\" Wang Ze first raised his hands in a surrender pose, then shouted to the left, \"But, Xie Wenjing, Lin Li said only one of you can survive.\"\nLeft Guardian’s half head peeked out from the podium, eyes meeting Lin Li’s.\nXie Wenjing, female, Left Guardian, sports student, special recruitment project is shot put.\nAlthough not as exaggerated as Nezha of ’Ten Cold,’ her biceps were indeed bigger than Lin Li’s.\nI fight Xie Wenjing? Is that for real?\nLin Li laughed, sneering at Wang Ze’s cowardice and weakness, disgracing the sports student title, while he backed out of the front door of the classroom, not forgetting to close the door behind him.\nAfter distributing breakfast, Lin Li asked about the progress of Bai Bufan’s commission from yesterday.\n\"What do the guys say?\"\n\"In our dorm, everyone except for Tianming has been persuaded. As for Tianming, he said he went to Pingjiang Amusement Park just last year with his family, and since he’s a bit timid, he didn’t dare to try many attractions and felt it wasn’t very fun. The amusement park takes up a large part of the class leader’s plan, so he doesn’t want to go.\nThe dorm next door with Wang Ze also agreed, only Haoyang still refuses to go; he just wants to be a homebody and finds going out too troublesome,\" Bai Bufan said, \"Lin Li, I’ve done everything I can, sold everything I got, managed to convince so many people, the last two you’ll have to handle yourself, and stop threatening me.\"\nPersuading familiar people to go out and play is actually quite easy.\nThe majority initially said they wouldn’t go because the other familiar people didn’t seem to go either.\nOnce someone changed their mind and started persuading others, the effect was significant:\n\"If XX goes, I’ll go too.\"; \"XX and I are both going, you’re not going?\"; \"XX said he’ll go if you go!\"; \"XX said he’s going\".\nWhen Bai Bufan and Lin Li confirmed they were going, some people then agreed to go, further influencing others until most were willing to go now.\n\"Alright, I’ll try to persuade them again at noon,\" Lin Li nodded hearing this, satisfied with the results.\n\"Your charisma isn’t as strong as mine, can you persuade them?\" Bai Bufan said with some disdain.\n\"I have a hypnosis app,\" Lin Li retorted with equal disdain.\n\"Hypnosis app? If it’s useful, why not get me one as well?\" Although Bai Bufan knew Lin Li could be full of it, he couldn’t resist his curiosity.\nTime pause pocket watch, hypnosis app, who could refuse these things? One look and no voice comes out.\nOnce in possession, at first, one might become Supercareful Man, but eventually turn into Happy Man.\n\"You’ve already installed it,\" Lin Li smiled mysteriously.\n\"Hmm? Which app?\"\n\"Alipay.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"I personally saw a Brother Fu at the mall show off this app to his female companion, and she was hypnotized, hearts in her eyes, so obedient to Brother Fu,\" Lin Li said seriously.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYou don’t say, you’re really saying it.\nBai Bufan found himself unable to refute it.",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Chapter 70 Hypnosis Really Is the Most Useful\n\"No way, this really can hypnotize. If the number was high enough, I think I’d willingly stick my butt up.\" Bai Bufan gave a thumbs up.\nHypnotize my butt.\n\"Selling your wild butt already? What happened to the gold beneath your knees?\" Lin Li sneered.\nHe’s different. Unless it’s a loyal 175 cm tall, 36D rich woman, Lin Li absolutely won’t stick his butt up.\nEven a butt has its dignity; it requires extra payment.\n\"Isn’t that gold being liquidated right now?\" Bai Bufan said indifferently, then changed his stance, \"Lin Li, if you’re using hypnosis technique, I don’t want to go on the autumn trip next week either, so feel free to hypnotize me at noon. Don’t pity me because I’m a delicate flower.\"\n\"No need for noon, I can do it now.\"\n\"Really? I didn’t bring my phone, but I can give you my card number...\" Bai Bufan got a bit excited.\nLin Li chuckled, nodded, stood up, then raised his chair to smash it toward Bai Bufan, \"Guaranteed to hypnotize you!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Your mom! How come it’s physical hypnosis with me! You actually treat me differently!\"\n...\nNot sure if it’s psychological, but Lin Li felt more focused after his Qi Blood improved.\nEven though practice today was exhausting and he woke up too early, these lessons in the first half of the day were better than before.\nHe even had some energy left for English class, with Bai Bufan cautiously chuckling away — no longer daring to be too cocky, afraid of hurting Koukou’s feelings.\nAfter lunch, Lin Li and Bai Bufan returned to their dorm, noticed Chen Tianming hadn’t come back, so Lin Li visited next door.\nThe next-door folks weren’t all there either, only two people, but luckily Zhang Haoyang, the target, was.\n\"Yo? Lin Li, coming to conquer Haoyang?\" Wang Ze spoke upon seeing Lin Li.\n\"It’s ’persuade,’ pronounced ’shuo,’ pronunciation changed ages ago, now only ’canvass’ is pronounced ’shui,’ both ’lobbyist’ and ’persuade’ are ’shuo.’\" Lin Li showed off his cultural knowledge.\n— Remembered from translating Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique before.\nWang Ze held his MP3, reading a novel, indifferent to Lin Li’s words, turned to ask, \"Lin Li, I’ve seen enough Beast Masters, got any novel type recommendations?\"\nLin Li thought carefully for a while, then said, \"Group image story then.\"\n\"What’s it like, about lots of characters? I don’t read many novels.\" Wang Ze asked.\n\"Those classic, unforgettable group image stories, start with just the main character alone, then everyone gathers from all directions because of different coincidences, becomes friends, later they all laugh together, cry together, adventure together, and in the end, some die, some die, some die, some die...\"\nLin Li explained eloquently.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\n\"Examples, Rainbow Cat Blue Rabbit Seven Swordsmen, Dream Journey animation, these are wonderful group animations.\"\nListening to Lin Li’s beautiful description, Wang Ze’s initially excitedly raised mouth soon stiffened.\nDon’t die, don’t all die.\nYour ’beautiful’ dam?\n\"Not reading anymore!\" Wang Ze shook his head like a rattle. \"I get it, all group image novels are written by Yu Hua.\"\n\"Alright, enough novel talk, we’ll discuss it later. Okay brothers, now eyes on me, I’ve got an announcement!\" Lin Li imitated Brother Hu, shouted loudly.\n\"I have a dream!\" Lin Li prepared to start his speech, although there were barely any people in the dorm.\n\"Can’t understand, can you translate?\" Wang Ze raised his hand to signal.\nIf Martin Luther King had such an audience back then, he’d be out of breath.\n\"Then not speaking English.\"\n\"People can’t have both youth and insight into it, folks, what you don’t cherish now will be what you desperately yearn for in the future, wishing to buy sweet osmanthus and ride with wine, but ultimately, unlike, youthful excursions...\" Lin Li began tugging at heartstrings.\n\"Still can’t understand, can you translate?\" Wang Ze raised his hand to signal.\nA sports student really has it tough.\n\"I’m not talking to you, Wang Ze, shut up and read your novel.\" Lin Li got annoyed.\n\"Oh.\"\n\"No.\" After denying the unreasonable request, Lin Li stopped going through the motions and directly faced Zhang Haoyang. \"Haoyang! Yang! My dear Yang! Why not go on the autumn trip? Come on, it’ll be fun with everyone, much happier than staying at home all day, isn’t that boring?\nJust thinking about not seeing you there makes my heart feel like it’s been squeezed and shattered!\nIf you don’t come with me, what’s the point of the autumn trip!\"\nZhang Haoyang was lying on the bottom bunk, so Lin Li straightforwardly jumped up to his bed to start a playful persuasion.\n\"Don’t want to go, I want to go home and play games.\" Zhang Haoyang wrapped himself tightly with the blanket, protecting his butt.\n\"Everyone’s going, who will you find to game with? In the team chat, you always complain and beg us to play games, and you’re the most over-the-top, making me suspect outside our high school group, you have no friends.\" Lin Li frowned and said,\n\"Wouldn’t it be perfect to go with us? Da Fei has won five championships in a row, still playing mom’s games, you know, I’ve always been a farming player, love farm work, watching all-Chinese teams win every season.\n\"When the time comes, let’s play some mobile games together, or maybe some physical games. Isn’t that better than staying home all day with only WeChat sports sending you messages?\"\nHaoyang: \"...\"\n\"We’re just classmates! Lin Li, you’re crossing the line!\"\n\"I don’t have friends besides you guys? Haha, sigh, haha! My WeChat is flooded with messages every day!!\"\n\"Just wait, Lin Li. Don’t leave after school today! I’ve got a truckload of breadmen to handle you!\"\n\"Are they bringing ketchup?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"This is outrageous! No way, I’m definitely not going. I’ve already made gaming plans with over a hundred good friends this Saturday!\" Haoyang covered his head with the blanket.\nLooking at Haoyang wrapped up, Lin Li got a new idea.\nIf Haoyang died, he wouldn’t be able to go. The class leader would probably be understanding, right?\n\"Haoyang, let me tuck in the blanket corners for you, don’t catch a cold.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\n\"Huh? Hmm—!! Hmm—!!\"\n...\nHe didn’t suffocate.\nAccidentally let Haoyang survive.\nLin Li sighed, realizing that compared to Bai Bufan, he really didn’t have extra leadership skills or charm.\nHe could only use his ultimate move.\n\"How about I find you a sweet-voiced girl to play with on Sunday?\" Lin Li whispered in Haoyang’s ear, \"Also, I’ll bring my family’s Switch and game cartridges for the autumn outing, but I’ll leave them at your place.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"I’ve wandered half my life, just regretting I haven’t met a worthy master. If you don’t mind, I’d like to recognize you as my godfather.\" Haoyang immediately turned around.\nSure enough, the hypnosis app is the most useful.\nBecause of the anti-pornography bonus, Lin Li, who didn’t have much extra expense, had a regular flow of allowance every week, and recently his funds were quite ample.\nThe reason for spending money in this area.\nLin Li believed that it’s necessary to maintain and improve relationships with Chen Yu Ying, spending money for this is considered an investment.\nThe enhancement in relationships didn’t mean he wanted to be in a romantic relationship.\nLin Li’s fondness for Chen Yu Ying has always been a pure appreciation of beauty—simply put, it’s just lust, pure lust.\nAs for romance, Lin Li at least doesn’t have that idea now.\nEven if Chen Yu Ying impulsively confessed to him, Lin Li would have agreed before, but now he would hesitate and then reject.\nAfter all, the system has opened the door to a new world for him, many thoughts and actions are no longer the same.\nJust a temptation of beauty!\nAmong the cultivators he has met so far, Lin Li’s heart is the most resolute.\nSo far, both tasks triggered by his ’second system’ have been related to Chen Yu Ying. Lin Li hasn’t had interactions with other women, including Koukou and other female classmates, but no other tasks have been triggered.\nHave to consider whether the system’s recognized trigger target might only be her.\nLin Li’s current objective is to become Chen Yu Ying’s close guy friend, allowing more opportunities for interaction between them.\nEmphasize that all these actions are grounded in rational analysis and judgment above, and have nothing to do with Chen Yu Ying sweetly calling him brother, nor because of impulsively promising something and not wanting to embarrass himself by failing and going back defeated.\nHe is not someone who can be swayed by beauty and pride.\n\"What you just said, is it true, godfather?\" Haoyang confirmed.\n\"Rest assured, sweet voice guaranteed.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Wait a minute, no, the focus should be ’beauty’ and ’girl’, right? You won’t use a voice changer yourself to accompany me for a day and then record my foolish behavior to share in the gaming group, right?\" Haoyang was a bit suspicious, \"Lin Li, say it again to make me feel reassured.\"\nWhat Haoyang described, wasn’t something Lin Li would do, but something he already did.\nIt’s just that last time he used a WeChat account pretending to be a girl.\nThis bunch of buddies are really sharp, leaving Lin Li with no room to maneuver.\nWho ruined the atmosphere? It’s really a shame.\nFinally, the two made mutual promises.\nHaoyang added: \"But Lin Li, let’s be clear, I might get tired and return to my place to rest or play on my phone; it’s unlikely I’ll stay with you all the time.\"\n\"No worries, as long as you get on the bus, whatever you do, Egyptian or whatever, nobody cares.\" Lin Li walked away with flair like a guy who wears pants and doesn’t recognize people.\nHaoyang: \"?\"\nDidn’t you just say that without me, you can’t even have fun playing?",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Chapter 71: My Big Melon Is Gone\nZhang Haoyang is settled, now only Chen Tianming is left.\nLin Li went back next door, the door was ajar.\nChen Tianming had already returned and was sitting at his place.\n\"Tianming!\" Lin Li called out his name with deep affection from the doorway.\nChen Tianming looked over.\n\"Wait, wait, wait!\" Lying on the top bunk, Bai Bufan hurriedly stopped Lin Li who was about to speak, jumped down from the bed, rummaged through his cabinet for a bag of chips, and then sat on Zhou Baowei’s bed.\nHe tore open the package, took a chip, crunched it in his mouth, licked his fingers, and then nodded to Lin Li with satisfaction:\n\"I’m ready, go on.\"\n\"So why are you sitting on my bed to watch the show?\" Zhou Baowei asked from his suddenly crowded half of the bed, sneaking a hand towards the chip bag.\n\"Crumbs falling on my bed would trouble me. Crunch. Crunch.\" Bai Bufan replied sincerely.\nZhou Baowei: \"...So it doesn’t trouble you if they fall on my bed? Get off!\"\nLin Li ignored these two guys and walked straight over to sit next to Chen Tianming: \"Tianming, courage is humanity’s greatest anthem, don’t choose cowardice...\"\nBefore Lin Li could continue philosophizing, Chen Tianming waved his hand indicating no need to say more, \"No need to say any more.\"\nOh no, this tone, this expression, is a tough nut to crack.\nDamn, my hypnosis app might fail this time, its numbers are still too weak.\n\"I’ll do it.\"\n\"Tianming, wouldn’t you consider taking the exam... huh?\" Lin Li, ready to make a final struggle, let out a puzzled sound after realising Chen Tianming’s reply.\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"I’ll do it,\" Chen Tianming calmly repeated.\nLin Li hadn’t spoken yet.\n\"Swish——\"\nBai Bufan’s reaction was even more excited than Lin Li’s. He threw away his chips and crawled over in disbelief, squeezing himself between the two, and stared at Chen Tianming.\nBehind him, Zhou Baowei also looked incredulously at his chip-laden bed, tearfully picking up and eating them. He felt like crying but then started to laugh while eating.\nBai Bufan wasn’t concerned with the chips. He was genuinely hurt now, grabbing Chen Tianming’s hands, and asked sternly, \"Chen Tianming, what do you mean?\"\n\"I’ve been sleeping with you for over half a year, and you treat me like this? Last time when you went to poop and forgot to bring paper, Bao Wei and the others just laughed at you; it was me who specially came down from the top bunk to give you paper!\nOver the past half year, there were so many hopes between us, did you know?\nBut what about the result? How did I beg you yesterday, and how did you respond? You didn’t give me a shred of hope, and now Lin Li comes along, and you agree immediately? He’s just a boarding student, never even slept one night with you! And I lost to him?\"\nBai Bufan’s eyes were filled with such grievance and sadness that he seemed more like Kayako than Lin Daiyu.\nSo after preparing to watch Lin Li bribe or beg Chen Tianming, the performance ends up like this?\nIt’s not about having less but about inequality, Bai Bufan was really hurt.\nLin Li then pushed Bai Bufan aside and patted Chen Tianming’s shoulder in relief: \"This decision is correct, fair, and incisive.\"\n\"Firstly, the paper you gave me back then was sandpaper, and it was only after I called you daddy twenty-seven times that you gave me normal tissue.\" Chen Tianming, not one to hold grudges, waved his hand again, \"Secondly, the reasons for refusing you yesterday and agreeing to Lin Li today are definitely not what you think.\"\n\"Lin Li, you want to complete your master’s orders and get the key to the chastity lock so you can stop peeing sitting down; that’s fine, but you have to do me a favor.\" Chen Tianming said, looking at Lin Li.\nLin Li turned his cold gaze toward Bai Bufan, who guiltily avoided it.\nDamn it.\nIt’s obvious that Bai Bufan concocted another weird persona for me.\n\"What’s the favor?\" Lin Li asked, temporarily ignoring Bai Bufan.\nChen Tianming hesitated for a moment, taking several seconds before saying, \"Help me get a WeChat or QQ ID.\"\n\"Swish——\" Zhou Baowei, who had just finished eating and was shaking the bed to clear the chip crumbs, threw aside his blanket and crawled over, squatting next to Bai Bufan.\nThe four heads gathered together, including Lin Li, and three pairs of eyes all locked onto Chen Tianming.\n\"Hey, where are my chips?\" Realizing there was another gossip to listen to, Bai Bufan only then remembered he was out of snacks.\n\"I’ll give it to you later in the bathroom, be quiet and let Tianming continue.\" Zhou Baowei remained focused, pressing his hand precisely over Bai Bufan’s mouth, indicating Chen Tianming to continue.\n\"Explain,\" Lin Li also looked curious and ready for gossip, \"Whose ID do you want? Someone from another class? Are they at our school? Do you want a tough guy or a softie?\"\n\"Of course, I want a girl’s! She’s from our school, also a first-year in Class 17, her name should be Yao Qiaoqiao.\" Even though they were all buddies, the situation made Chen Tianming a bit embarrassed, who sheepishly said.\nThe three exchanged glances, it was a name they’d never heard before.\n\"Do you like her?\"\n\"I have a bit of a crush, not sure if it’s like...\" Chen Tianming turned his head, waving his hand shyly.\nWith a tone that shy, and he’s saying he’s not sure if he likes her.\nTsk, men.\n\"How did you notice her?\" Lin Li continued to ask.\nNansang High School had clubs, but they were practically for show. Only freshmen and sophomores could join, with only one club activity period per week, often taken over by other activities, and most people didn’t bother joining these pointless clubs, opting to self-study during activity times instead.\nSo meeting people outside class, unless you’re an athlete like Wang Ze, was quite difficult.\nOh, the freshman QQ group was also an avenue, but after Lin Li saw someone asking if the school store accepted Bitcoin as payment, he left the group.\n\"Their class had PE at the same time as ours, last winter term during the fitness test, she helped pass me my watch and stuff, so I noticed her then...\" Chen Tianming recounted bashfully.\n\"This term, every time we run exercises, I’ve been looking for her, recently seeing Lin Li making such great progress, already getting tasks from his master, I’ve been feeling restless too...\"\n\"You damn masochist, stop using me as an excuse!\" Lin Li sighed deeply.\n\"Oh——so you knew I wouldn’t be able to help you with this, that’s why you didn’t agree to me yesterday?\" Bai Bufan also realized that Chen Tianming’s request was indeed something he couldn’t manage in any case.\n\"Yeah.\"\nChen Tianming didn’t explain more, not because he didn’t want to, but because there simply wasn’t more to say; they hadn’t even exchanged contact info yet, what else was there to say?\n\"Won’t you ask for it yourself? Wouldn’t it be better if you did? What if your goddess thinks it’s me who likes her and falls for me then?\" After understanding the background, Lin Li scratched his head, smugly speaking.\n\"At first, I wanted Baowei to help me ask, but I’m afraid he’s too ugly and would scare her away from giving her contact info. Plus, his cowardice is only slightly better than that of the pure waste Bufan. I don’t want too many people to know about this, and since it’s convenient that you have a favor to ask me, with your skin growing thicker lately and your looks matching mine seven-tenths, you’re the best candidate.\"\nLin Li, Bai Bufan, Zhou Baowei: \"?\"\nHe’s managed to insult everyone present in one sentence?",

      "content": "Chapter 76: Chapter 72 You’re Already Impressive, What More Do You Want\nChen Tianming got beaten up.\nIt’s human nature.\n\"So, as long as I help you get this contact information, you’ll go on the fall outing, right?\" Lin Li said to Chen Tianming, who seemed to think the ground was cooler and was definitely not lying there because three people were sitting on him, making it impossible to get up.\nChen Tianming nodded.\n\"Then I’ll try to get it in the afternoon, but let’s be clear, if the girl doesn’t give it to me, it’s not my fault, and you still have to go on the outing.\"\n\"Let me think about it.\"\n\"Alright, take your time. While you’re thinking, the three of us will keep beating you up, no rush for us, take your time.\"\n\"... Okay, but you have to give it your best effort to get it.\"\n\"I, Lin Li, am known worldwide for my trustworthiness.\"\nLin Li, who finally completed his mission satisfactorily, left feeling content.\n...\n\"So that’s the situation. I abandoned the gold under my knees, the bread in my pocket, gave up my dignity and face, and humbly begged like dust.\" Lin Li’s expression was sad but finally became a plain acceptance:\n\"Fortunately, my sacrifice was worth it. Class leader, they’ve changed their minds, they’ll vote for your plan and participate in this afternoon’s class meeting.\"\nThen Lin Li eagerly watched Chen Yu Ying’s reaction.\nChen Yu Ying blinked, making eye contact with him.\nHmm, it seems she doesn’t believe him at all.\n\"Well... it must have been tough for you, wow.\" After thinking for a long time, Chen Yu Ying could only squeeze out this one line, and it was delivered in a flat, emotionless tone.\n\"It was unimaginably tough! Really!\" Lin Li emphasized.\n\"So, what do you mean?\"\n\"Need to raise the price.\"\n\"How can you raise prices like that? I already paid you yesterday, we agreed!\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit displeased and turned her head away slightly, muttering, \"I won’t call you brother again like I did yesterday!\"\nWang Yuezhi, who had already gotten up in the front row to run away and protect his ears, silently sat back down.\nWang Yuezhi even wore a cross necklace today, which is against school rules, and no one knows why, as it doesn’t suit his style at all.\n\"No, no, no—\" Lin Li didn’t expect to be called brother again, and he continued to ask, \"Class leader, do you have money? How much do you have left?\"\nChen Yu Ying felt her pocket, found a few bills and coins, and said, \"I only have ten-something bucks here. Are you out of money? If so, I can go back to my seat and get some from my drawer.\"\nLin Li had treated her to breakfast for several days, and he had mentioned he spent some money to persuade the boys.\nTherefore, if Lin Li asked her for money, Chen Yu Ying wouldn’t take much offense.\n\"No need to get it; class leader, just give me what you have first.\" Lin Li said.\n\"Oh, here you go.\" Chen Yu Ying handed the money to Lin Li.\nThen she saw Lin Li holding the money for a moment, then returning it to her, saying, \"Class leader, I’m giving the money back to you, but you have to give it to me again and say, ’It’s your reward.’\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nBu Hao, Lin Li’s acting up again.\nThe priority is to calm the patient’s emotions to prevent the condition from worsening.\nSo Chen Yu Ying complied.\n\"Once more, say you want to buy my pen...\"\n\"Once more...\"\nAfter several repetitions, she finally couldn’t help but ask, \"Lin Li, what are you doing now?\"\nLin Li sighed inwardly, realizing no task had been triggered.\nNot sure if this kind of financial transaction wasn’t recognized or if it didn’t count as a condition at all.\nLin Li felt a bit regretful. Faced with Chen Yu Ying’s question, he thought for a moment and seriously answered, \"Helping Xiling boost its GDP a bit, so next time the county rankings will look better. This way, when we Xiling People go out, we’ll have more face.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nInhale—\nHe’s an idiot, he’s an idiot, he’s an idiot, he’s an idiot.\nExhale—\nChen Yu Ying flashed a knowing smile, nodding at Lin Li, \"Oh~~ okay, on behalf of everyone in Xiling, thank you.\"\nThis smile was familiar to Lin Li.\nChen Yu Ying had shown him this smile before, and so had he shown it to Song Luping.\nOh no, he’s being humored as an idiot again.\nLin Li felt that his image couldn’t be ruined like this.\nThere’s still hope.\n\"Class leader, just give me your money one last time!\" Lin Li said determinedly.\nChen Yu Ying, wearing a benevolent and caring smile, offered no opposition and handed him the money again.\nLin Li then suddenly pulled a coin out of his pocket, counted the amount, and slapped the money on Bai Bufan’s desk, saying loudly:\n\"Class leader, you gave me thirteen bucks, I give you back fourteen bucks!\"\n\"This means if you give me a lifetime, I’ll give you forever! It was hard for me to say before, but now I’m mentally prepared, and I finally dare to say it. Well, are you moved, class leader?\"\nChen Yu Ying’s benevolent smile froze on her face.\nShe had prepared herself a lot mentally, but now it seemed Lin Li had prepared himself thoroughly, but she had far too little preparation.\n\"Ha heh cough cough—\" A laugh that couldn’t be contained emerged.\nThere were only three people in the classroom; Lin Li didn’t laugh, nor did Chen Yu Ying.\nWhen Wang Yuezhi, who was holding back laughter, turned back to look at Lin Li, he quickly waved his hand: \"Sorry, continue, Lin Li, you’re incredible—\"\nWang Yuezhi considered himself a rival in love, something even Chen Tianming could see.\nWasn’t he saying romantic things to Chen Yu Ying?\nWhy could he still laugh?\nPraised Lin Li wasn’t happy.\n...\nClass 17 of Grade 1 is on the fourth floor.",

      "content": "Chapter 77: Chapter 72: You’re Already Impressive, What More Do You Want_2\nUnder the watchful eyes of Chen Tianming, Bai Bufan, and Lin Li, they found themselves on an unfamiliar floor.\nThe hallway was sparsely populated with familiar faces.\nThe four stood out, tall for first-year high schoolers, combined with a somewhat sneaky aura that caught people’s attention.\n\"They’re all looking at us. Do you think in their eyes we’re like F4 from ’Meteor Garden’? If so, I want to be Douming Temple!\" Zhou Baowei whispered.\nWhen both Lin Li and Bai Bufan turned their gaze toward him, Zhou Baowei immediately raised his hands in surrender, \"Sorry, pretend I didn’t say anything. Please don’t scold me, you two.\"\nHe sure knew when to back down.\n\"Wait, I——\" After walking a few steps, Lin Li turned to share his plan with the three, only to see them synchronized to a halt a few meters away at the corridor corner, as if some barrier prevented them from proceeding further.\n\"Good luck.\"\nChen Tianming, both nervous and excited, cheered Lin Li on.\nIt was obvious that the three planned to offer every support except actually acting.\nPerhaps they were playing it too safe.\nF4 indeed, more like three F5s.\n\"You three stand here and don’t move, I’ll go buy an orange for you. Seriously, don’t move! I need your goddess to see you from afar later, it’ll show more sincerity.\" Lin Li said resignedly. After Chen Tianming nodded, Lin Li dashed toward the battlefield.\n\"Hello, are you from Class 17?\" Lin Li grabbed a girl coming out of Class 17, and before she could answer, he followed up, \"Can you help me call out Yao Qiaoqiao? I have something to discuss with her.\"\nLin Li didn’t ask a boy because boys would usually stand at the door and shout, drawing the entire class’s attention to both Yao Qiaoqiao and himself.\nLin Li himself didn’t mind, his system hadn’t had time to enhance his tolerance for embarrassment yet, but system or no system, it greatly influences one’s mindset, so it didn’t matter. Lin Li mostly worried it might trouble Yao Qiaoqiao.\nTypically, in such situations, a girl would quietly return to the class to inform Yao Qiaoqiao, allowing her to sneak out quietly, which would be better for both parties.\nHe considered himself a meticulously thoughtful soul——\n\"Yao Qiaoqiao! Someone’s looking for you! He!\"\nHer voice was louder than Bai Bufan’s, bursting out and making Lin Li’s eardrums ache.\nNow everyone in the class and the hallway was looking at Lin Li, and it wasn’t just the students from Class 17.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nPoor judgment, how could he make assumptions about Class 17 based on Class 1’s precedent?\nWho would’ve thought this petite girl would harbor such a booming force.\nAfter yelling, she headed toward the bathroom, leaving Lin Li standing like he was on a bed of nails.\nHe could faintly feel, a little enmity from the boys in the hallway.\n\"Is it Yao Tongxue?\"\nSince Chen Tianming had described Yao Qiaoqiao’s general appearance to Lin Li, when a short-haired girl walked towards him somewhat confusedly, he softly inquired.\nThat someone Chen Tianming liked at first sight without knowing her, she naturally had to be quite attractive.\nThey say inner beauty is essential, but without outer beauty, who the heck cares about what’s inside.\nYao Qiaoqiao nodded, \"What do you need?\"\n\"Standing by the door blocks others, not ideal. How about chatting in the hallway over there?\" Lin Li spoke earnestly.\nThe stares from the boys in the hallway were starting to feel more dangerous and heated.\n\"Hm? Sure.\" Yao Qiaoqiao tilted her head slightly then nodded.\n\"Actually, I have a friend who wants your contact info. Could you give me a QQ or WeChat?\"\nAfter distancing themselves from the class, Lin Li cut to the chase and pulled out a pen and paper from his pocket.\nUpon hearing this, Yao Qiaoqiao paused and eyed Lin Li more closely, curiously asking:\n\"Your friend...\"\nIt was clear that Yao Qiaoqiao was a straightforward girl. In such a situation, most boys or girls would already be shy and awkward.\nLin Li remembered his own first experience of being asked for a QQ number. When he returned to the classroom, stoked by classmates’ teasing, his face was burning red, and his ears were blood-red, stunned for a long while, mind blanking out.\nBut to be honest, it did feel pretty awesome.\nEven when Bai Bufan and the others teased him about it, he pretended not to want to talk about it, but secretly, he was over the moon.\nThis is the sweet taste of youthful innocence.\n\"This time, the friend isn’t me.\" Lin Li shook his head with a smile, pointing toward the stairway corner, \"My friend was afraid he’d get too nervous to speak upon seeing you, so he asked me to get it for him. He’s right over there—\"\nWhere’d he go?\nBoth Lin Li and Yao Qiaoqiao looked in the direction he pointed to, but there was nobody there anymore.\nYao Qiaoqiao’s expression seemed a little odd.\n\"My friend has likely perished.\" Lin Li joked.\nIf he hadn’t, he probably should now.\nDamn those three idiots, especially you, Chen Tianming.\nI told him to stand still and not move.\n\"It’s okay, I trust you.\"\nYao Qiaoqiao smiled gently, then asked, \"Is your friend good-looking?\"\n\"Way better looking than me, just a little shorter, very gentle, and has an athlete’s physique.\" At a time like this, Lin Li wouldn’t badmouth Chen Tianming, so he showered him with praise.\n\"Better looking than you, well then, sure I’ll give my contact information. Hope you’re not lying to me.\" Yao Qiaoqiao’s tone was slightly surprised, then she smiled in delight, took the paper and pen from Lin Li, and wrote down a string of numbers. She then smiled at Lin Li and said:",

I’ll head off first, bye.\"\nWith the items in hand, Lin Li quickly and swiftly made his exit.\nLeaving Yao Qiaoqiao, who was still planning to say something, standing there.\nReaching the stairway corner, he found Chen Tianming and his two friends had already retreated to the stairs going down, with only half of their bodies visible.\n\"Didn’t I tell you guys to stay put?\"\n\"Tianming chickened out by himself, you can’t blame us for watching,\" Zhou Baowei said innocently.\n\"So, how did it go?\" Chen Tianming asked in a lowered voice, even though there was clearly no one else at the stairway.\n\"You guys aren’t reliable, but I, Lin Li, got it,\" Lin Li waved the folded paper in his hand.\n\"Dad! You’re my real dad! I must go on the autumn outing! Everyone must go! Anyone who doesn’t is my enemy!\" Chen Tianming excitedly rushed over, snatched the paper, and even kissed it in excitement.\nFeeling a bit creeped out, Lin Li rubbed his arms that had goosebumps, thought for a moment, and still said:\n\"Tianming, from the brief interaction we just had, this Yao Qiaoqiao is probably at a higher level than you, be careful not to get played like a fool.\"\nIt was strange why Yao Qiaoqiao wanted him to add her too, and at the time, her mannerisms felt meticulously planned.\nIt felt very crafted and unnatural.\n\"At the start of the season, I’m already a seventeen-star king, is she higher than me?\" Chen Tianming said with some distress, thinking games were his strong suit and a good way to build relationships. It was a pity if he couldn’t use this method now.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis damned kid.\nSeeing Chen Tianming already fall into Love River without even starting, Lin Li helplessly shook his head.\nHe didn’t emphasize further, after all, it was just his speculation. If it turned out to be a misunderstanding, the blame would shift onto him.\nPlus, whatever he said now would likely fall on deaf ears for Chen Tianming.\nLet’s discuss it later.\n...\nFriday, last period of the day.\nHalf of it was a math class, then it changed to a homeroom session.\nAs a consequence, next Monday’s homeroom session would naturally be cut short or entirely become a math class.\nAs expected, Chen Yu Ying’s autumn outing plan overwhelmingly won.\nBut whether it could become Class Four’s confirmed plan still depended on the school’s opinion, though it shouldn’t be a big issue. Chen Yu Ying seemed to have coordinated with other classes.\n\"On your way home after school, be safe, everyone.\" When the bell rang, the teacher, Xue Jian, left after his customary reminder.\nThe classroom immediately bustled with noise, but Lin Li and Bai Bufan didn’t move.\nAfter Xue Jian left, Bai Bufan openly took out his phone, chuckled, and asked Lin Li:\n\"Did Brother Ping send you the Death Note? Can we proceed tonight?\"\nBai Bufan wasn’t planning to go home for the weekend and then have his family drive him back, one of the perks of boarding school. Even though the cafeteria was closed on weekends, the school gates were free to enter and exit, so he could go outside to eat and drink.\nSo Bai Bufan wasn’t planning to go home this week.\nLin Li directly messaged Song Luping.\n\"Lin Li: Brother Ping, I’m out of school now. Although you highly recommend Tianhong, I still want to compare and see if there’s a better option. Have you prepared the map yet?\"\n\"Hope he sends it to you this week, or my staying at school is for nothing,\" Bai Bufan prayed while looking at the chat history.\nOnce they had the stuff, Lin Li could go all out without holding back.\nThey waited for seven or eight minutes at their seats before Song Luping finally replied.\n\"Song Luping: Working overtime today. I’ll send it to you tomorrow, during the day, so it won’t delay your plans.\"\n\"Lin Li: Alright, thanks, bro.\"\n\"Song Luping: No need for thanks between us brothers. Bufan, good luck this weekend. But remember to follow the 103 rules I told you. If you don’t, our connection ends here. You go your way, I’ll go mine, and you can’t use my name for perks anymore.\"\nBai Bufan had a very mixed expression on his face upon seeing his name there.\n\"Lin Li: No problem.\"\n\"Song Luping: ’Heart emoji’\"\n\"If nothing goes wrong, we’ll act Saturday night. I’ll head home first. If anything comes up, contact me via message in a bottle!\" Lin Li turned off his phone screen and told Bai Bufan.\n\"No problem, my sword is already thirsty!\"\n\"You better hope it’s just your sword that’s thirsty.\"",

Where did he go?\"\nUp from 3:30 AM to the community park, sat for four whole hours, then wandered around the community several times looking for a young figure, Zhou Youwei is in a daze, lips shivering.\nThe once robust physique is like a withering candle in the September wind.\n——\"Where’s Lin Li’s mom gone?\"\n——\"Where’s that wicked little brat! Ah!!\"\n...\nLin Li wakes up, the thing he’s been waiting for finally arrives.\nSong Luping: \"Compressed file.\"\nSong Luping: This is the first edition, later if I have updates, I’ll accumulate them and send you the second edition. Of course, if you find anything worth updating, feel free to let me know right away.\nDon’t feel obligated to accept all my opinions just because I’m senior, let’s encourage each other and improve together.\nWelcoming the great Xiling Chicken Farm document to the faithful Lin Li’s phone.\nLin Li: No problem, Brother Ping, I’ll definitely polish our map, align the granularity, iterate the existing tactics, form a combination punch, effectively empower the ecosystem, with a dimensional strike, ultimately nourishing the entire Xiling Farm.\nSong Luping: Can’t understand, but awesome!\nSong Luping: By the way, the grain-type baby hiccup bag is really useful, you should try it.\nAfter brushing off Song Luping, Lin Li opens the document on his computer, then his eyes light up.\nLin Li initially felt some complaint about Song Luping’s delay, after all, it’s been so many days.\nBut now all those complaints vanished.\nSong Luping truly has substance.\nThis document is meticulously organized, even clearer than Bai Bufan’s online drive.\nThe part about small shareholders and hotel delivery is also included by Song Luping, taking quite a large portion, which Lin Li skips entirely.\nFor physical stores, the names, addresses, business hours of chicken farms, naturally all this basic information is here.\nThe opaque prices and secret codes for services related to the poultry industry inside the store need no further explanation.\nBut there’s only one thing that only Song Luping could do, which is including detailed information and introduction videos of ladies in the store—not the same as those seen earlier at Light Bar, what Song Luping sent over is more detailed, with fuller perspectives, more variety.\nThese are videos that will be removed if watched too late.\n\"Isn’t this damn thing pornographic.\"\nLin Li remarked while analyzing frame by frame.\nSome of these videos have angles that don’t look self-recorded by the ladies themselves, seemingly to avoid Lin Li thinking he violated the playboy code, Song Luping specially highlighted in red:\n\"Many of these videos Madam doesn’t even have, because they were privately sent to me after getting to know these sisters and adding their real contacts voluntarily! Some are even willing to serve me privately for free, even want to date me.\"\n\"Bufan, in future, you’ll have such treatment too, but remember, even if you get contacts from a chicken farm, you still need to go through their channels.\"\n\"Otherwise, if private contacts are discovered, you’ll be blacklisted, it’s not worth saving a little money.\"\n\"For short-term gains, losing the future path, is not a wise choice.\"\nLooking at Song Luping’s introduction, Lin Li’s mouth twitched slightly.\nTo think you could still mooch like this, you’re impressive.\nLin Li knew that in the past, famous scholars were given free bed services by brothel prostitutes, but he never imagined seeing a virtuoso like Song Luping in this day and age.\nLin Li would like to call him Song Yu.\nBecause according to historical records, Han Yu, the top of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song, had so many wives and concubines that he couldn’t manage them, and eventually died from overdosing on aphrodisiacs.\nThe document had annotations regarding these videos, noting how closely they matched the person in question and, if not, what the differences were.\nMastery of skills and abilities, whether they had high emotional intelligence, and if they were considerate or gentle.\nThis was a real encyclopedia.\nSomething some people dream of having.\nSince the item was now in hand, it’s time to start taking action.\nLin Li took out his phone.\n\"Lin Li: This comment contains spoilers.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: I still want to see it!\"\n\"Lin Li: Everything is in place, only the east wind is missing. Are you ready to strike together?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: We must strike! Strike hard and fiercely! Should I meet you at your place first? Your address hasn’t changed, right?\"\n\"Lin Li: Remember to change into your own clothes, don’t wear the school uniform.\"\n...\nBai Bufan’s eyes lit up, almost wanting to stick his head into the screen.\n\"Isn’t this pushing the envelope? Can’t believe there’s so much of it at Xiling.\" Bai Bufan, who changed into his own clothes as soon as he received the notification and arrived at Lin Li’s house, licked his lips.\n\"Most are independent operators; it’s hard to define paying for a romp as a crime. These few marked in red are our real targets. But just before you came, I did a little comparison, and it’s still more reliable to go with the place I checked out earlier, the only issue is that it’s a bit far.\"\nFrom the perspective of the chicken farm now, Xiling is in the era of a dark, Great Qing purge, being more cautious, with many places only serving old customers like Tianhong.\nThe new customer is in the most pitiful episode, clearly being treated like a treasure on Pinduoduo.\n\"I’ll definitely listen to you, you’re the expert on this. Tell me what to do.\" Bai Bufan simply let his brain stop thinking, and started rummaging through Lin Li’s bedroom, trying to kick off a Holy Grail War.\n\"Then go fry a couple of dishes in the kitchen and get me a hundred thousand bucks, thank you.\"\n\"...You’re actually quite polite.\" Bai Bufan gave a middle finger.\nLin Li looked at Bai Bufan’s butt, high-raised and swaying as he dug under the bed, breathing deeply to suppress his desires.\nCouldn’t hold it in any longer, the beastly nature was about to erupt.\n—\"Thousand Years of Death!\"\n\"Ah——!!\"\nBai Bufan curled up on Lin Li’s bed, turning his head toward the half-filled trash can: \"Lin Li, you’re not seriously abstaining, are you? How come there’s not a single paper ball in the trash can?\"\n\"Who keeps smelly stuff in the bedroom?\"\n\"Let’s go downstairs, have a meal and head out, let’s go to Tianhong’s.\" Lin Li finally decided.\n...\nAfter dinner, they withdrew some cash. It was already 6 PM.\nLin Li’s bike didn’t have a back seat, and even if it did, riding someone for more than half an hour would be too torturous.\nXiling’s shared electric scooters had stopped services due to appeals from the rental company and management difficulties, leaving Lin Li with the final choice of taking a taxi.\nSplitting it between two wasn’t expensive, and they figured they’d get a dedicated ride back too.\n\"Hey, remember one thing, I don’t care who you are, but from now on, Bufan is me, I am Bufan,\" Lin Li reminded Bai Bufan while waiting for the car.\n\"First, my name’s not ’hey,’ it’s Zhou Baowei, second, remember the first, and third, remember the second.\" Bai Bufan gave an OK gesture.\nAnd Lin Li then took out his phone again, this time, making more preparations to avoid mishaps.\n\"Lin Li: Uncle, what are you up to? Are you working today?\"\nYangliang replied after a minute or two.\nAfter all, in their positions, they couldn’t keep their phones away for long; it’s hard to say they could ever have a true break.\n\"Yangliang: I’m not on shift today, just resting at home on the weekend, what’s up Xiaolin ’smile’.\"\n\"Lin Li: I wanted to see you.\"\n\"Yangliang: Absolutely no problem ’OK’! Uncle’s been waiting for you to say that for a long time, do you have any life troubles you need to talk about? Are you at home now? Should Uncle pick you up from your neighborhood downstairs? Have you eaten? If not, eat at Uncle’s place ’rose’ ’rose’ ’rose’ ’like’ ’like’ ’like’.\"\n\"Lin Li: I’m not at home right now.\"\n\"Yangliang: Then where are you?\"\n\"Lin Li: On my way to a massage, foot bath, and SPA.\"\n\"Yangliang: ?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Chapter 74: One Question Mark Isn’t Enough\n\"Yangliang: ??? Ah?\"\n\"Lin Li: Uncle, I’m afraid the credits might end up benefiting outsiders, so I’m not planning to report to the main station this time. But if you’re resting at home, could you pass this task to a colleague? I’ll send you a 1 directly when the timing is right, and you just need to have the on-duty colleague bring people over.\"\nIt was visibly clear that Yangliang’s brain had once again stopped working.\nBecause it kept showing \"the other party is typing,\" yet no messages were being sent.\n\"Yangliang initiated a voice call.\"\nLin Li answered it.\n\"Lin Li! What are you doing?\" Lin Li heard Yangliang’s warm greeting as soon as he picked up.\n\"Uncle, I know you’re in a hurry, but please, don’t rush.\"\nBecause you’ll be even more anxious in a moment.\n\"Firstly, Uncle, to infiltrate deeply this time, I need to reveal some of my identity information to gain the trust of adversarial forces. Hence, I’m now called Bai Bufan, Lin Li is dead. If you happen to come by, don’t call me Lin Li. Consider me nonexistent.\nIf it’s a colleague, they don’t know me anyway, so that’s fine.\"\n\"Also, isn’t your police station having a community renovation event today? There’s a male probationer involved, right? Be careful, he’s an insider and will leak info about your actions. Here’s the detailed situation...\nSo, during your operation later, try to avoid him, but not too obviously, or my undercover identity will be exposed. I recommend a few methods...\"\nLin Li naturally had to inform Yangliang about this first.\nYangliang was silent as he processed this information. After a long pause, he could only blurt out one sentence:\n\"You bastard kid...\"\nYangliang really felt uncomfortable not saying it out loud.\nLin Li shook his head.\nLuckily, he didn’t accept making Yangliang his father, or he’d also turn into someone without manners.\nDamn it, he really hates people who curse.\n\"So, Lin Li, are you trying to replicate the last scene again?\" Yangliang’s brain finally began to function reluctantly, and he asked.\n\"More or less.\" Lin Li nodded, even though only Bai Bufan beside him could see it.\n\"Didn’t you say your friend only knew about a chicken farm at Qingjue?\" Yangliang asked loudly.\n\"Uh... I made new friends.\" Lin Li responded, scratching his head.\n\"...\"\n\"What kind of friends are you making, damn it! Where do you even meet these people?\" After a brief silence, Yangliang was somewhat broken.\nHe really couldn’t understand how a student like Lin Li, who could get into Nansang Middle School, found these connections.\nAre there really that many talents in the world?\n\"Life is never short of beauty, only a lack of eyes to discover it.\" Lin Li answered.\nYangliang: \"...\"\nIs that how the phrase is used?\n\"Xiaolin, can you tell Uncle Yang the places your friends told you? We’ll send plainclothes officers to monitor and gather information there, and the capture operation will also be conducted quickly. As for you, please hurry and return the way you came back, alright?\" Yangliang advised gently.\n\"Once you’ve strung the bow, there’s no turning back. The two of us are already on the car, there’s no going back now. Besides, the longer we delay, the more men will be financially ruined and left destitute, how could I bear that?\nI, as your recognized ’Heroic Youth’ and ’Anti-vice Pioneer,’ how could I back down at this moment? How could I live up to the banner you awarded me! How could I live up to Sister Sun’s praise and publicity! How could I live up to Principal Wang’s careful nurturing!\"\nGoing back is absolutely not an option; if he went back, the anti-vice operation would be in vain. Lin Li righteously refused.\n\"The banner can be reclaimed, the publicity can be canceled. Your principal hasn’t even nurtured you, everything’s still on time!\" Yangliang loudly said on the other side of the phone.\nNot good.\nLin Li might appear abstract but is actually internally fragile and sensitive; things like banners and praise, those honors, to him must be something he clings to crying at night alone. Clearly, Lin Li has taken them as his life guidelines!\nNo one understands Lin Li better than himself, and that’s why Yangliang now deeply regrets not stopping the upper levels from giving this banner back then.\nFor a child like Lin Li, too high moral standards are definitely not a good thing.\nIt’s also his fault for not being careful enough.\n\"Eh? Wait a second.\" Before Lin Li could respond, Yangliang, who was lamenting over the banner issue, suddenly paused. With a slightly uncertain voice, he slowly asked:\n\"Xiaolin, I just heard you say ’the two of you are already on the car,’ it was ’two,’ haha, I must have misheard, right?\"\n\"You didn’t hear wrong, Uncle; this time I brought my classmate, who is also my good brother. He also wants to become someone like me, so he came today. Come on, Bao Wei, say hello.\" Lin Li patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder beside him.\n\"Uh, hello, Uncle. My original name is Bai Bufan, but since Lin Li borrowed it, now I’m called Zhou Baowei. We’ll meet soon. Nice to meet you.\" Bai Bufan leaned in and introduced himself.\n\"Uncle, remember to bring two hoods, huh? One isn’t enough,\" Lin Li added from the side.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Uncle?\" Bai Bufan, who hadn’t heard a response, asked somewhat nervously and fearfully.\n\"Quiet, I’m thinking.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nThe taxi had just arrived, so Lin Li and Bai Bufan got into the back seat first.\n\"Uncle, have you thought it over?\" Lin Li inquired after the car started.\n\"...So Lin Li, what’s your purpose in bringing this classmate of yours?\" Yangliang asked.\n\"He also longs to become a ’young hero,’ he also wants to gain the glory of banners and cultivation! Right, Bao Wei!\" Lin Li declared loudly.\n\"Huh? Uh, right! It’s for these noble things! What else? Could it be just for fun?\" Bai Bufan was a bit stunned by this, then nodded firmly.\nYangliang: \"...\"\nWhy does this sound more like a confession?\n\"Bufan... are you a local of Xiling? What’s your family situation like? How many people are there?\" Yangliang asked softly, probing.\nOnce bitten by a snake, ten years fear the well rope.\nYangliang didn’t want to have sleepless nights again.\n\"Huh?\" Bai Bufan was a bit bewildered, looking at Lin Li.\nWhy does it suddenly feel like a census is being conducted?\nLin Li, however, understood and took back his phone: \"Uncle, Bufan’s family is happy and harmonious; you don’t have to say anything more.\"\n—He won’t want to acknowledge you as his father either, Lin Li didn’t say this part.\nYangliang exhaled a sigh of relief.\nThen was completely sure\nthat this happy and harmonious kid was purely in it for fun! Noble goals, my foot, he even wavered just now!\nGood for you, Bai Bufan!\nHeh heh.\nYangliang remembered this name.\nMeanwhile, on Lin Li’s side, he heard a deep breath on the phone:\n\"Your Nansang Middle School, ah, well done, no wonder it’s the best school around here! There’s indeed a reason for its excellence, talents keep emerging.\"\nThe voice carried a hint of laughter, seemingly a sincere compliment.\n\"It’s just alright, you should tell Principal Wang this next time, he’d be quite pleased to hear it.\" Even while on the phone, Lin Li shook his head modestly.\nHopefully, he can come out pleased, Yangliang sighed deeply and finally confirmed: \"So Lin Li, and Bufan, you two must help us gather evidence, right?\"\n\"That’s right, Uncle Yang.\"\n\"Alright, alright, I’ll get up and go to work now.\" There was a touch of resentment and resignation in Yangliang’s tone: \"I know about the mole situation you mentioned. I’ll be careful during the operation later, won’t let him and those people on the road recognize our actions and identities.\nTell us the location name, that way we can head over in advance and respond to your messages faster, you wouldn’t want another situation like last time where you almost had to persuade a lady to respect herself and nearly lost your own virtue, would you?\"\n\"Uncle, you won’t backstab me, right, go ahead and catch them one step before me after hearing the location name, will you?\" Lin Li was quite cautious.\nYangliang: \"...\"\nThis kid is just like this, it’s just a protective shell; habitual mistrust of the outside world is normal, is normal, he is actually a kind and excellent but also pitiable good kid inside...\nAfter comforting himself for a long time, Yangliang said warmly:\n\"I won’t.\"\n\"Okay, Uncle, I trust you, trust is the basis of cooperation. After all, we’ll have many cooperative operations in the future, the place we’re going is Tianhong Foot Therapy and Spa, the specific address is 67 Chidun Street, when the time comes, just listen to my instructions on WeChat.\"\nYangliang didn’t remember the name and address.\nIt’s not that his memory is that bad.\nHe simply didn’t hear the latter part clearly; after Lin Li said the first half, his mind was filled with the echo of the first half:\n[We will have many more joint operations in the future]\n[Many operations]\n[Many]\nSo these two times are just the beginning!?\nWill I end up seeing Lin Li every time there’s a bust from now on?\nThis sort of thing is a bit too terrifying, isn’t it?\nThis isn’t just a [Pioneer in busts], it’s practically a [Mighty General in busts] already!\nYangliang took a deep breath, and compared to the address, he felt there was more important information to get from Lin Li now:\n\"Lin Li, do you mind introducing that friend of yours to Uncle, just want to meet him, no other intentions, just want to meet him.\"\nThe friend who led you astray, the one who caused Lin Li to end up like this, right!\nLet’s catch you, brat! Have a proper educational session! What exactly is your intention telling Lin Li so much information!\n\"Hey, Uncle Yang, how did you know? I was just thinking that!\" Lin Li exclaimed in surprise.\nYangliang: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Chapter 75: You Came, But You Shouldn’t Have Come\nYangliang paused momentarily, his brain kicking back into overdrive.\nOperation failed.\nYangliang had no choice but to admit it; Lin Li’s protective shell was sometimes just a bit too hard.\nTrying to keep up with Lin Li was still too strenuous for a normal person.\n\"Lin Li, so... what exactly do you mean by ’you had this intention’?\" Struggling to think, Yangliang opted to directly ask Lin Li.\n\"Prostitution is wrong. My friend is deeply entangled in it, and his body, mind, and spirit are severely harmed. I must help him turn back from this path, so Uncle Yang, I’ll find a chance for you all to catch him; upholding righteousness even against one’s family!\"\nLin Li, representing justice, spoke loudly.\nYangliang: \"...\"\n\"What kind of friend you’ve made, I don’t know... but your friend sure has a good friend.\" Yangliang found it hard to comment, but he ultimately chose to encourage.\n\"It’s what I should do.\" Lin Li was a bit modest.\n\"Alright then, I’ll wait for your update. I need to prepare on my end as well. Pay attention to your safety, remember not to cross the line, and record everything like last time. Even if you’re undercover, you can’t act recklessly.\" Yangliang said somewhat weakly.\nChatting with Lin Li really wasn’t an easy task, seemingly a drain on one’s lifespan.\n\"Weren’t you supposed to exercise discretion last time?\"\n\"Only if you were truly forced!\" Yangliang emphasized heavily.\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Did I just hear a hint of regret in your voice?\" Yangliang’s mouth twitched slightly.\n\"Haha, how could you think that? Alright, Uncle, you get busy, I’m hanging up.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"Driver, how much longer?\" After hanging up the phone, Lin Li asked the driver.\n\"About twenty minutes more, fifteen if there’s no traffic.\" The driver replied.\n\"Okay.\"\nSeeing that Lin Li had no intention of chatting, the driver continued driving.\nIn the domestic taxi industry, customers are like lords, but if you use Uber abroad, the driver might even rate you poorly for not greeting them when you get in, lowering your score so you can’t find a ride. The customer essentially becomes a nobody.\nWith the driver present, many things were hard to discuss, so Lin Li and Bai Bufan remained silent throughout the journey.\n\"We’ve arrived.\"\nThe car pulled up.\n\"Thank you, driver.\"\nThe two got out of the car.\nThe name of Tianhong could be seen not far away, and the lights at night were extremely conspicuous.\n\"How do you feel about being caught soon?\" Lin Li asked Bai Bufan beside him.\n\"I feel like taking a dump.\" Bai Bufan turned his head and spoke straightforwardly.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nIt somewhat spoiled the atmosphere.\n\"Lin Li, I’m starting to get a bit nervous, like I’m about to run a thousand meters.\" Bai Bufan swallowed and placed his hand on Lin Li’s shoulder: \"I’m afraid I won’t perform well.\"\n\"Who ever asked you to perform? Isn’t there a possibility that you might not get a chance to perform at all?\" Lin Li seemed a bit speechless.\n\"No, no, I wasn’t even thinking about that, I’m worried that as an undercover I might get exposed.\" Bai Bufan’s face still showed some anxiety, his hand incessantly rubbing Lin Li’s shoulder, \"How about... you go inside alone, and I’ll watch from outside, waiting for your uncle to arrive. We can team up from inside and out.\"\n\"Don’t be a coward! You’ve come all the way here, might as well go in. Just think of it as going to a regular massage parlor, go in, wait for a massage, or maybe just a foot wash.\"\nThe mission being at hand left no room for Bai Bufan to act out.\nLin Li’s expression suddenly turned cold, but not because of Bai Bufan’s change of heart, but rather: \"Damn it, Bai Bufan, could you stop wiping your sweaty hands on my clothes?\"\nThe hand resting on his shoulder had been wiping away the whole time, Lin Li finally noticed what he was doing.\n\"My clothes are new...\" The caught Bai Bufan awkwardly pulled back his hand, took several deep breaths, and finally nodded heavily, saying, seemingly to either himself or Lin Li: \" I’ll leave it all to you then.\"\n「Lin Li: Uncle, I’ve arrived at the entrance of Tianhong.」\n「Yangliang: We’ll be there in a minimum of twenty-five minutes. After you send a message, we’ll arrive and control Tianhong in two minutes. I recommend you wait for twenty-five minutes before going in.」\n「Lin Li: No worries, Uncle. Once inside, there are still procedures to go through. I’ll send you a message then.」\nAfter confirming this information, Lin Li went to the front, pushed open the door of Tianhong, and stepped inside.\nIt turned out the receptionist was still Xiaowen, which simplified matters.\nAs expected, upon seeing Lin Li, Xiaowen instantly waved at him.\n\"Bufan, you finally came~\"\n\"Oh! Sister Xiaowen, it’s me, Bufan.\"\nThis conversation gave Lin Li a warm feeling of coming home, welcoming and homely; hence he smiled and walked over.\nThis conversation gave Bai Bufan an overwhelming feeling to kick Lin Li’s virtual ass, was it your name? Yet he replied, though he still followed Lin Li with a smile.\n\"Is this the good brother you mentioned before?\" Xiaowen, having noticed Bai Bufan, inquired.\n\"Hello, Sister Zhou, my name is Xiaowen.\" Bai Bufan instantly snapped to attention like a young soldier, saluting Xiaowen as he answered.\nXiaowen: \"?\"\nYou’re called Xiaowen, then what should I be called?\n\"He’s a bit nervous, Sister Xiaowen, you should understand. If you’re going to call him, just call him Xiaozhou.\" Lin Li smiled, explaining on Bai Bufan’s behalf.\n\"Is Xiaozhou still a rookie?\" Xiaowen chuckled, \"Should we prepare a red envelope for him?\"\nWhen encountering a brand new, unused product client at a chicken farm, sometimes a small red envelope is given, with not much money, just for good luck. Different amounts have different meanings, although Lin Li didn’t quite understand this.\nTraditional culture, vast and profound!\nYou must live and learn until old age.\nSeeing Bai Bufan mumbling silently, Xiaowen didn’t tease him and spoke to Lin Li: \"Your spots have always been reserved. Normally, this kind is for single rooms; are you two going to use two small rooms, or...\"\nHearing this, Bai Bufan abruptly punched Lin Li in the back.\n\"With my friend like this, I wouldn’t be at ease leaving him alone, let’s book a double room, Sister Xiaowen.\" Lin Li noted down the punch in his mind and said to Xiaowen.\n\"Bufan, although we have our reasons for engaging in this not-so-glorious business, we also have our dignity...\"\n\"No problem with paying more, Sister Xiaowen.\"\nHaving heard this conversation once before, Lin Li interrupted before Xiaowen finished.\n\"Okay, sure thing, just make sure not to get mixed up. Our place only allows individual battles at different sides of the room, doesn’t accept group fights, even for a higher price.\" Satisfied with Lin Li’s discerning nature, Xiaowen nodded and emphasized.\n\"Sister Xiaowen, you’re overthinking it. We’re here just to find a tutor to guide us, not planning to take any exams. Look at my friend, does he look like he could sit an exam?\" Lin Li chuckled, \"Of course, who knows, maybe he’ll want to extend the session.\"\n\"Haha, you have a point, then the red envelope won’t work. Alright, you two go to your room, 107 Roushui Pavilion, just keep going straight, need me to show you the way?\" Xiaowen gave an \"I understand you\" nod, operated the computer, and indicated to them.\n\"No need, we’ll find it ourselves first, thank you, Sister Xiaowen.\" Without the procuress leading the way, this could also be more carefree. Lin Li waved his hand and began walking in the direction indicated by Xiaowen.\nBai Bufan followed closely behind.\n\"This thing really is like a thousand meters, the most nervous before starting, but now that we’ve started running, it doesn’t feel like much.\" Bai Bufan mumbled quietly to Lin Li ahead.\nThen he bumped into Lin Li’s back.\n\"Are we there?\" Bai Bufan asked.\nLin Li didn’t respond, just stared ahead.\nBai Bufan, a bit puzzled, poked his head out to see what was ahead.\nA radiant Xue Jian, holding hands with a woman, stood at the end of the corridor.\nTheir eyes met.",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Chapter 76: Parting Is for a Better Reunion\nFour pairs of eyes scrutinize each other.\nExcept for the woman beside Xue Jian, who is confused, the other three pairs of eyes are all shocked.\nBai Bufan is completely dumbfounded.\nAt 0 years old, I was born. At one, I learned to walk. By two, I was already speaking some simple human words. At three... Bai Bufan’s brief life started flashing before his eyes.\nWhat an exhilarating yet wasteful life.\nWhat situation is this even?\nAm I witnessing my class teacher doing such a thing?\nAlthough encountering something like this today is worth the price of admission, it’s a bit too much bang for my buck.\nHe suddenly isn’t nervous anymore—facing imminent death, what’s there to be nervous about?\nTeacher Xue, is a truce possible?\nHow about both turning a blind eye to each other?\n\"Lin Li... I don’t want to die, I haven’t lived enough, and I definitely don’t want to be silenced... Whatever you do, just keep us alive...\" Bai Bufan’s trembling hands clutched Lin Li’s clothes as if holding onto a last straw, unwilling to let go, pleading desperately.\n\"Don’t panic; you haven’t seen anything you shouldn’t have.\" Lin Li, now clear-headed after the shock, reassured Bai Bufan, \"Old Jian isn’t here to solicit; he’s probably just here for regular services. The woman next to him isn’t a worker here, if I recall correctly, she’s his wife.\"\nMany middle-aged people like using their photos as WeChat avatars, and Lin Li vaguely remembered Xue Jian’s companion—a woman with permed hair—from a peculiar Monday night.\nBesides, Xue Jian doesn’t seem like the type to do such things.\nAfter calming Bai Bufan, Lin Li shook his head at Xue Jian, didn’t speak, raised his hand to scratch his head, and gestured for silence by sliding his hand across his lips.\nThe corridor was crowded and under surveillance.\nLin Li didn’t want to hear the name ’Lin Li’ come from Xue Jian’s mouth.\nMeanwhile.\nAt this moment, Xue Jian’s expression was complex—even more complex than Bai Bufan’s.\nTo be honest, Lin Li’s gesture of silence was somewhat unnecessary; having seen Lin Li here at this time and place, even if Xue Jian were to make a comment, he wouldn’t have anything to say.\nHow did he bump into Lin Li after leaving school, casting a shadow over what was supposed to be a lovely weekend?\nHe couldn’t forget Monday’s events, and now that this kid Lin Li appeared here, does it mean... this shop also has a side hustle with such activities?\nXue Jian tilted his head, expressing this doubt, and Lin Li, having understood his confusion, nodded slightly.\nThe answer was self-evident.\nWell hidden indeed. I’ve been here many times and never noticed.\nBut that’s not important now. What’s important is whether Lin Li got addicted to going undercover or something?\nAre we going to the principal’s office again next Monday? Xue Jian didn’t dare to imagine what expressions Principal Wang might show then. Having a student like Lin Li is indeed a blessing for Nansang Middle School.\nCoping up to this point.\nWhen Bai Bufan’s head popped out from behind Lin Li, Xue Jian’s urge to punch the world peaked.\n—If I can’t punch the world, punching Lin Li can serve as a substitute.\nHow did you end up bringing Bai Bufan along!?\nCould Lin Li possibly have taken the principal’s words to heart, intending to set himself as an example, leading the whole school into paths related to X-rated activities!?\nDon’t want that kind of future!\nCould I still resign now? But the year-end bonus is just a few months away; not getting it seems like a pity.\nPrincipal Wang, look at what kind of ideas you’ve planted!\nLin Li, see where you’ve been putting your thoughts!\nBai Bufan, look at what excitement you’re involved in!\nXue Jian, look at the kinds of students you’re bringing up! Why did you come here today!\n—Xue Jian began attacking everyone in his heart indiscriminately, including himself.\n\"What’s wrong? Why aren’t we leaving?\" Xue Jian’s wife still wore a puzzled expression, glanced at Lin Li and Bai Bufan, and then asked, somewhat confused, \"Are those two your students? They look quite young, not quite the age to come to such a place.\"\n\"No, no, no, I don’t know them.\" Xue Jian finally regained his composure, and upon hearing his wife’s question, shook his head vigorously, \"I have nothing to do with those two! Let’s go, after the massage, let’s leave; this place is unsuitable for a prolonged stay, very dangerous.\"\nWife: \"?\"\nHow could a massage parlor be dangerous?\nThough she didn’t quite understand why, she nodded.\nAnd so, the four passed shoulder to shoulder.\nThey became the most familiar strangers in the world.\n...\nXue Jian took his wife back to their car.\n\"Why haven’t we left yet, did we leave something behind?\" his wife in the passenger seat, already buckled up, asked as she noticed Xue Jian still staring at Tianhong, with a trace of puzzlement in her eyes.\n\"No rush, sweetheart. In a bit, there’s likely to be a show to watch here.\" Xue Jian shook his head calmly.\n\"Hmm, what kind of show?\" Curiosity successfully piqued, the woman asked.\n\"According to reliable sources, this shop is about to get raided for prostitution.\" Xue Jian asserted firmly.\n\"Ah, this store provides such services?\" The woman reacted with similar surprise as Xue Jian upon hearing this.\n\"Yes.\"\nBefore Xue Jian could lift his head back up, his wife had fiercely grabbed his collar: \"Oh, Xue Jian, I wondered why you wanted a relaxing session here every week. There were several times when I didn’t come with you, and it turns out it was for this!\nYou always said you were too stressed by the students and couldn’t relax without a massage, but it seems your intentions were elsewhere!\nI also noticed that after putting our kids to bed, whenever I came near you, you shuddered. Every time, you made an excuse about being too tired from the next day’s work. Now, it seems your energy has been spent outside!\nIf you no longer want this life, let’s just end it! You take our eldest and the house; I take the car, the savings, and our youngest, while you get Wangcai!\"\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nNot even leaving a little good for me.\n\"What thoughts are you entertaining? I just found out about all this!\" Xue Jian retorted speechlessly.\nAs for dallying outside, at Xue Jian’s age, even keeping up with his wife at home is a struggle; where’s the energy for these outside endeavors? Xue Jian’s biggest fear is his wife going to bed early.\nXue Jian knows one thing: once his wife goes to bed, he must ’get sleepy’—must fall asleep within three minutes!\n\"About this matter... I don’t even know how to explain to you, but those kids earlier...\"\nXue Jian could only recount the events of last Monday.\nThe woman loosened her grip.\nThe tale she heard was enough to stupefy her for a century.\nHer perspective on looking at Tianhong had changed; she began to anticipate eagerly.\nGossiping is a human instinct, and this instinct is especially strong in women.\nQuickly, she yearns to see havoc.",

      "content": "Chapter 83: Chapter 77: Arigato, Song Luping\nInside Tianhong.\n\"So it was Xue Jian’s wife, that’s a relief, she’s still alive.\" After listening to Lin Li’s explanation, Bai Bufan felt like he’d narrowly escaped death, and let out a long breath. \"I really thought I witnessed a crime scene just now and was about to be killed to silence me.\"\n\"It’s not that serious. And don’t worry, my phone was recording the whole time. Even if you really die, the murderer will be found. No need to worry about dying with regrets,\" Lin Li reassured him.\n\"... Thank you for that.\"\nBut Lin Li didn’t expect to run into Xue Jian here.\nThis is great, if the Demon Suppression Bureau looks for him again next week, they’ll be mentally prepared.\nThe two of them had arrived at Room 107.\nThe double room was spacious, making Lin Li realize even more that Qing Jue couldn’t be considered a conscientious company.\nIt was because he had limited experience and preconceived notions.\nMassage robes hung on both sides of the room, with a privacy curtain that could be pulled between two lounge chairs.\nSince Lin Li planned to get a foot massage today, he lay down directly on the chair, waiting for the madam to provide the menu.\nBai Bufan was staring intently at Lin Li, mirroring his every action.\nA few minutes later.\nThe door to Room 107 was knocked on, and a female voice called, \"Can I come in?\"\nBai Bufan was a bit nervous, not daring to answer, and looked at Lin Li. Facing his gaze, Lin Li responded with slightly mocking eyes.\n\"Come in!\"\nThe door opened, and Bai Bufan witnessed an unforgettable scene.\nOne by one, women dressed in Tianhong technicians’ uniforms entered and stood in line in front of the projection screen, instantly making the once spacious room crowded.\nCould this be... the legendary selection of concubines?\n\"Welcome to Tianhong Club~~!\" Once everyone had entered, they all bowed in unison and shouted welcome.\nThe sound wasn’t loud, but in the small double room, there was a faint echo, loud enough to be termed as deafening.\nIt brought a significant shock to the spirit.\nSeeing this scene, Bai Bufan lost control of his facial expressions, his mouth subconsciously agape in amazement.\nA few seconds later, coming to his senses, Bai Bufan was somewhat disdainful of his own lack of composure, thinking he must have embarrassed Lin Li with his foolish look.\nSo Bai Bufan turned his head. The task at hand was to see how the experienced Lin Li would handle this situation and to learn deeply from him.\n——Lin Li’s eyes were wide open, and his mouth hadn’t closed, his face full of shock.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nDon’t you have experience? Why are you shocked like you’re at a farmer’s market?!\nThe disdainful gaze from the side was too intense, and Lin Li came back to his senses.\nHe really was shocked.\nNot because he was intimidated by the scene, but he looked at the madam with a slightly more sophisticated attire than the others and asked in confusion:\n\"Did Sister Xiaowen get it wrong? We only planned to order a consultation package, and now this is...\"\nLin Li, well-versed in the encyclopedia left by Song Luping, naturally knew a lot.\nAt Tianhong, to select technicians like this, the premise must be that the package is premium, to choose face-to-face, ensuring authenticity. His consultation package absolutely did not include this, so he suspected Sister Xiaowen misremembered what he just said.\n\"We know,\" the madam replied with a polite smile, shaking her head. \"But because you two guests were introduced by Boss Song, you are esteemed guests in our establishment. Besides giving sufficient discounts, this basic respect naturally needs to be arranged first.\"\n\"Oh, oh.\"\nThank you, Song Luping.\nTurns out I’m benefiting from your connections.\n\"Please, choose.\" The madam said.\nPerhaps because it’s the era of the Great Qing Cleanse, regular customers are fewer, resulting in quite a few free technicians.\nDepending on their years of experience, the technicians’ requirements for consultancy rates differed, and their work attitudes varied, showcasing different demeanors. Some looked at the two with anticipation and hope, while others had fake smiles, with wandering eyes, clearly unwilling to be chosen.\nProbably because they thought the pay was too low, or felt Bai Bufan was too unattractive.\nLin Li had already made his decision.\n\"I’ll pick Xiaojing.\"\nWhen he saw this name on the name tag in front of each person, Lin Li’s answer was clear.\nThough she wasn’t the best-looking in this lineup.\nXiaojing, I’ll commemorate you in this way, where you are, can you feel the connection?\n\"Thank you, boss.\"\nXiaojing probably didn’t expect to be chosen, and stepped forward to express her gratitude.\n\"Lin Li, you pick one for me...\" The extremely constrained Bai Bufan nearby wasn’t as natural, turning his head to solicit advice.\n\"You want me to choose? Alright, then let’s...\"\nLin Li first showed disbelief, pointed to himself, then nodded.\n\"Wait!! I’ll pick myself!\"\nBai Bufan suddenly realized, what if he let Lin Li choose?\nIf Lin Li chose the madam who seemed in her forties to serve him, Bai Bufan believed he would really do such a thing.\nBetter pick himself.\nHis gaze roamed, avoiding the eyes of the remaining technicians.\n\"I’ll pick her.\"\nBai Bufan shyly raised his hand, lightly pointed, and immediately turned his head.\nThere was even a faint blush on his face.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nBai Bufan, why are you acting all innocent and shy, like it’s a melodrama.\nThe technicians couldn’t hold back their laughter when they saw this.\n\"Xiaojing and Feifei, stay. The others, out. Have a good time, boss,\" nodded the madam.\n\"Have a good time, boss!\" everyone chorused their blessings and then filed out.\nWhen the door closed, only four people remained in the room.\n\"My friend is a bit nervous, let’s start with a regular foot massage to relax,\" Lin Li said naturally with his wealth of experience and having mentally rehearsed this.\n\"Alright, boss.\"\nUpon hearing this, Xiaojing and Feifei squatted down, started putting hygienic bags on the foot buckets, and began adjusting the warm water.\nLin Li pulled out his phone.\n\"Lin Li: I’m in position, starting the foot massage, feeling good.\"\n\"Yangliang: Taking a detour, seventeen minutes away, manage your time.\"\n\"Lin Li: Seventeen minutes? That’s enough, gotta go, something urgent.\"\n\"Yangliang: ?\"\n\"Yangliang: Wait, Lin Li, what are you doing! I didn’t mean manage time for that!\"\n\"Lin Li: Just kidding, uncle, message me when you’re close.\"\n\"Yangliang: Alright.\"\nThe warm water was soon adjusted, and at Xiaojing’s prompting, Lin Li placed his legs into the footbath.\nThe bottom of the basin wasn’t smooth, with a layer to ensure hygiene, and the sensation was novel and comfortable.\n\"How’s the water temperature, boss, need it higher or lower?\"\n\"No need, it’s just right.\" Lin Li was already comfortably leaning back in the chair, enjoying the soothing warmth of the water.\nHe would enjoy for a few minutes, waiting for Yangliang to message him.\nThe nearby Bai Bufan was clearly not as at ease as Lin Li.\nHe seemed like a student being reprimanded by a teacher, at a loss, with nowhere to put his limbs.\nWhatever the technician said, he stiffly responded and then followed the instructions stiffly.\nLin Li had just closed his eyes for a few seconds when a crisp splash sounded nearby.\nBai Bufan nearly kicked over the foot basin.\n\"Sis, could you be gentler, I’m quite sensitive, I just got a reflex,\" Bai Bufan said sheepishly.\nFeifei in front of him was dumbfounded, who has knees on their ankles?\n```",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Chapter 78: Hehe~ Hehe~ Hehe~\n\"Now, just regular service, what are you nervous about? Just imagine you’re here for a legitimate foot massage!\" Lin Li sighed and said to Bai Bufan, clearly disappointed in him.\n\"...Oh.\" Bai Bufan nodded, apologized to Feifei once more, took a deep breath, and simply followed Lin Li’s lead, closing his eyes and leaning back in the chair.\nLin Li picked up the remote for the room’s projector and selected a playlist of sentimental songs on the music app.\nLin Li’s words were meant for Bai Bufan, but Xiaojing and Feifei naturally heard them too, so they weren’t as anxious as Light Duke Xiaojing and started with the foot massage in earnest.\nA legitimate foot massage parlor has its merits.\nIt is indeed relaxing.\nLin Li turned his head; Bai Bufan had now completely relaxed, his head tilted as if he were asleep.\nLin Li checked his phone; unknowingly, twenty minutes had passed. Yangliang had already sent him messages and was now firing off question marks like crazy.\nIf Yangliang didn’t know his situation, he probably wouldn’t have resisted calling already.\n\"Xiaojing,\" Lin Li called out softly.\n\"Boss, are we starting now?\" Xiaojing asked, already reaching for Lin Li’s pants as she spoke.\n\"No rush,\" Lin Li shook his head, \"It’s just that you gave us face. We’d feel awkward only ordering the counseling package. Why don’t you and Feifei add a dance? The 299-tier dance. I brought enough cash for a few dances.\"\nLin Li counted the cash he’d just taken out of his pocket and then spoke to Xiaojing and Feifei.\nBai Bufan, who had been dozing, opened his eyes when he heard the conversation.\n\"Okay, boss. I’ll go change with Feifei,\" Xiaojing replied happily, knowing the commission from these additional services was high and could earn quite a bit.\nBai Bufan turned to Lin Li and took out his phone:\n\"What’s the situation now?\"\nHe understood the necessity of caution in undercover work.\n\"First, I’ll message my uncle soon. We’re about to get busted, and we need to create a scene of solicitation. We can’t have the door opening to us all being innocent, right?\"\nIn that way, Xiaojing and Feifei might have a chance to avoid trouble if they’re lucky.\nLin Li wouldn’t allow it otherwise.\n\"Secondly, bringing you to a sketchy place just to have all legitimate services would be pointless. After all, how could I live up to your week-long dedication to being my sidekick if I didn’t show you the real deal?\"\nI really have no interest myself; it’s all just flesh and bones to me. But if you want to see it, then I gotta keep you company, even if it kills me.\"\nReading this message, Bai Bufan’s eyes got teary, and he gave Lin Li a thumbs up.\nThis is what true brotherhood looks like.\nAs for the nonsense after that, he just ignored it.\n\"Actually, another reason is that Song Luping is quite prestigious. Xiaojing and Feifei haven’t asked for our money upfront. They intend to settle up once all is done.\"\nThis way, no matter how much we spend now, when Uncle Yang intervenes later, all the money remains in my pocket, not a cent less. It’s all free, so I went straight for the highest dance tier just now, hehe!\"\nThis way, I don’t even have to wait days to get my money back like last time. It’s a genuine free ride.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nHe raised his thumb again, expressing his admiration and respect. Lin Li’s tactic was indeed clever.\nThe door opened, and Feifei and Xiaojing walked in, each wrapped in a blanket.\n\"Boss, we’re changing the music in the room.\" Xiaojing walked into the aisle between the two loungers, picking up the remote on the table.\n\"As you please.\"\nThe music started.\nThe two of them tossed their blankets into the corner, revealing their new outfits.\nAuto-targeting mode on, precision lock-on started, accurate focus initiated, X-ray... well, that one couldn’t start.\nBai Bufan’s eyes widened, even though he’d certainly seen more revealing things online, the real-life experience was totally different.\nBai Bufan squirmed in his seat and tugged at his pants, which made Lin Li chuckle.\nKid, you’re pretty sensitive, huh?\nLin Li himself was fine; although his yang energy level had increased by fifty percent, perhaps due to a resistance to charm techniques, he handled it much better this time than when facing Light Duke Xiaojing last time.\n\"Boss, the dance is starting.\" Tianhong Xiaojing’s smile was all money.\n\"Uncle Yang, the dance is starting here,\" Xiling Lin Li’s smile was pure, with hidden meanings in his eyes.\n...\nTianhong focuses on value for money; at 299, the highest tier dance, there’s a reason for its cost.\nA good dance indeed, truly moving and mesmerizing.\nSome scenes were too indecent, so Bai Bufan chose to cover his eyes with his hand—index and middle fingers shielding his eyebrows, ring and pinky fingers covering his lower eyelid.\nThe music was getting slower, the clothing less, and the movements more suggestive.\nNow they held a soft fan, kneeling before Lin Li, continuing to dance while subtly brushing against Lin Li.\nEven Lin Li was struggling to hold himself; the allure was too tempting.\nLin Li wanted to say, ’keep the music playing, keep the dance going,’ but unfortunately, he already heard some noise outside.\nIf he’d known, he’d have contacted Yangliang later.\nLin Li turned to Bai Bufan, intending to prepare him.\n\"Hehe~ hehe~ hehe~\"\nThis silly kid was now foolishly staring at Feifei, giggling like an idiot, with no trace of his earlier tension.\nFeifei clasped his hand, interlocking fingers, swinging it left and right in the air, which made Bai Bufan’s entire body move along involuntarily.\n\"Hehe~ hehe~ hehe~\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"BAM BAM BAM!!\" A strong, heavy knock on the door rang out, startling everyone in the room, including Lin Li, who was mentally prepared.\nAt the small observation window in the door, Yangliang’s face appeared grim as he peered inside—since Lin Li had given him the room number, he naturally found his way here.\nThe door was soundproof, so even though Yangliang’s mouth kept moving, the inside couldn’t hear what he was saying, but Lin Li could imagine:\n\"Nano rescue! Kid! Hang in there!\"\nSince Yangliang wasn’t in uniform, Feifei threw a coat over herself and walked over to open the door, yelling, \"Who are you?! What are you doing?! Knocking like it’s your mom’s grave!\"\nYangliang sneered and showed his Demon Suppression Envoy badge, \"I’m the police!\"\nFeifei’s face froze instantly.\nBai Bufan, almost overtaken by Joyful Union Sect’s allure without Feifei’s charm abilities, finally snapped out of his daze, nearly forgetting he was undercover.\nHowever, he didn’t know what to do for a moment and quickly turned his head to follow Lin Li’s lead.\nHey, where’s Lin Li?\nWasn’t he just lying next to me?\nBut when Bai Bufan focused, he found that Lin Li had somehow already scampered to the corner of the room, squatting with his hands over his head, burying his head in his legs.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nBro, you’re really experienced.\nIs this the poise of an old-school artisan?",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Chapter 79: Truly Good Children\nBai Bufan followed suit, rolling off the chair and squatting down smoothly.\nFeifei and Xiaojing had been swept out of the room along with other Demon Suppression Envoys.\n\"Bai Bufan, why are you always involved every time there’s a sweep!\"\nBai Bufan instinctively looked up upon hearing this, only to see Yangliang perform a Leo Flying Kick at Lin Li in the corner.\nLin Li rolled over twice and started spitting ’blood’; Zhou Youwei would call this a professional move if he saw it.\nBai Bufan was dumbfounded, is this really part of the procedure? So being undercover requires some sacrifice?\nHe gritted his teeth, stuck out his backside, and tightened his body, waiting to be kicked.\nYangliang saw this and gave Bai Bufan a sideways glance, his voice cold: \"What’s wrong? Feeling unwell? Think this is novel and want to try?\"\nOnly then did Bai Bufan realize that Lin Li was simply adding extra drama for himself. This was a private arrangement with Yangliang, not a required process.\nRelieved, he nodded heavily at Yangliang, his voice loud, \"Yes!\"\nHe must be included, since he’s already there.\nYangliang: \"?\"\n\"I can’t believe you two could be brothers!\" Yangliang went up and delivered another Leo Flying Kick.\n\"Sir, did you forget to hold back?\" Bai Bufan, who rolled an extra circle compared to Lin Li, rubbed his butt and sharply inhaled, discovering a blind spot.\n\"Oh, I forgot, sorry.\" Yangliang apologized without much sincerity.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n...\nHaving experienced it last time, Lin Li was quiet with the headgear on, squatting obediently outside and following the Demon Suppression Envoys’ instructions.\nBai Bufan wanted to act, but lacked the courage, so he squatted beside Lin Li.\nLin Li followed the Demon Suppression Envoy downstairs and saw Xiaowen.\nThe two looked at each other.\nLin Li stared at Xiaowen with a gaze containing thirty percent coldness, thirty percent mocking, forty percent indifference, coupled with thirty percent sadness, disbelief, and disappointment.\n\"Why.\" His gaze conveyed these three words.\nThe headgear blocked his face, but made this gaze even more noticeable and intense.\nXiaowen felt her body being burned by this gaze, couldn’t meet Lin Li’s eyes, and turned her head away, murmuring ’Sorry.’\nShe never expected things to turn out this way and didn’t understand why they did.\nShe wanted to ask, Why?\nJust a few days ago, she proudly promised Bufan, but now it’s a joke, truly having no face left to face relatives in Jiangdong.\nAfter this matter settles, maybe she should truly wash her hands and find an honest man to marry, then divorce; it’s still the fastest way to make money legally.\nThe two passed by each other, leaving only their backs to each other, as Lin Li immediately resumed giggling.\nOkay, seems like he’s not suspected yet, his acting is still convincing.\nYangliang escorted Lin Li and Bai Bufan from behind, only to see Lin Li stopped walking. Peeking over, he saw the brat gestured with a peace sign?\nBai Bufan and Yangliang noticed this, and looked in the direction Lin Li was facing.\nThey then saw Xue Jian’s wife at the front line, excitedly snapping photos on her phone.\nBeside her, Xue Jian silently closed his eyes upon seeing Lin Li’s peace sign, and began taking deep breaths.\n—Maybe he should retire after finishing this batch? If he remains Lin Li’s homeroom teacher post-division, perhaps retire this year.\nSeems like the future blooms are growing crooked.\nYangliang smiled understandingly, finally someone who could empathize with him.\nBut seeing Bai Bufan start forming a heart shape with his hands in front of him, he couldn’t help but mutter, \"That’s enough, dial it down a bit!\"\nThen, unfriendly, he once again enforced nearly violently, sending Lin Li and Bai Bufan into his car.\nXue Jian’s wife watched the private car drive Lin Li and Bai Bufan away with reluctance, finally putting down her phone and admiring the photos on it, nodding and saying to Xue Jian:\n\"Now I believe you, those words you just said are true, these two kids are indeed...\"\nXue Jian’s wife was quite cultured, but couldn’t find words to describe, ultimately choosing to give a thumbs-up.\n...\nIn the car.\nBai Bufan and Lin Li had already taken off their headgear, and Lin Li put a pair of handcuffs on Bai Bufan, each cuffing one hand—it was undoubtedly requested by Lin Li and Bai Bufan themselves.\nLin Li mostly experienced having both hands cuffed last time, and remembered seeing this scene often in films, so this time tried it.\n\"You’ll still need to follow procedure and come with me back to the station.\" Yangliang said to the pair while driving, through the rearview mirror.\n\"Great, I thought you’d send us straight home.\" Bai Bufan sighed with relief.\nYangliang: \"...\"\nWhy is that good, pray tell.\nHe gazed at Bai Bufan with increasing displeasure.\nBai Bufan came from a happy family, with ample fortune, clearly this kid being abstract because he himself is abstract.\nNow Yangliang seriously suspected Lin Li chose being abstract as his shell simply because he had this brother, Bai Bufan.\nAlright, found the real culprit, turns out it’s not Sun Xiaochuan.\n\"Uncle, out of curiosity, will there be a bonus after this is done?\" Lin Li asked out of curiosity.\nThe system doesn’t give him money; he wanted to become Brother Fu, but needed to go step by step.\nAlso thought of helping with family expenses, really a good kid, contrasting Bai Bufan starkly.\nYangliang’s voice softened considerably: \"Last time, it was because you set an example in certain aspects counted as the first case, with a need for simple interviews and photos, the significance was different. This time there should be a bonus too, but the amount won’t be as much as last time, maybe just a few hundred bucks.\nI’ll try my best for you, but can’t help if more can’t be secured.\"\n\"Will there need to be another visit to the school?\" Lin Li asked again.\n\"Most likely not; give me a bank card number, I’ll transfer it directly then.\" Yangliang shook his head.\n\"Oh.\" Lin Li felt sorry for Principal Wang, unable to share this honor with him.\n\"Speaking of which, Xiaolin, uncle seriously wants to discuss something.\" Yangliang said through the mirror, exchanging looks with Lin Li.\n\"Uncle, please go ahead.\"\n\"Even though we award you a ’Sweep Pioneer’ banner, we don’t hope for you to be pioneering in this field, let specialists handle specialist tasks. As a freshman in high school, your priority should be studying hard, that’s sufficient.\nIf you have new friends giving you information on henhouses, just tell uncle, he’ll arrange people to clean up, no need for you to go alone and...\" Yangliang paused in his speech, glaring at Bai Bufan in the mirror before continuing:\n\"No need for you to go deep with others, it’s dangerous and affects you too, often near rivers getting wet boots is inevitable.\"\nYangliang spoke sincerely, and Lin Li nodded:\n\"Thanks for your kind advice, uncle. I understand, won’t do more than five times, rest assured.\"\nSeeing Lin Li finally take the advice, Yangliang smiled contentedly.\nWhat a good kid.\nWait, something seems off.\nNo more than five times?",

It’s all the system’s fault.\nYangliang took a deep breath, counting on his fingers in his mind, one, two, three, four... which means there are two more times.\n\"Xiaolin... do you guys know of any more chicken farms around here?\" Yangliang squinted and asked.\n\"No such thing.\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"Withholding information is also illegal.\" Yangliang continued.\n\"Still no such thing.\"\n\"Bufan, do you know?\"\n\"Me? I don’t know either. I just listen to Lin Li. It’s my first time here, I’m nervous as hell.\" Bai Bufan shook his head without showing any weakness.\nLin Li gave Bai Bufan an approving look, thumbs up, while Bai Bufan patted his chest slightly, indicating there’s no worry at all.\n\"Next time you two give a thumbs up and pat your chest, could you do it away from me? It feels a bit disrespectful.\" Yangliang smirked.\nBai Bufan and Lin Li immediately looked out their respective windows in sync and started whistling.\nIf these two really don’t know information about other chicken farms, I’ll change my last name to Lin.\nBut Yangliang just sighed and didn’t continue questioning.\nHonestly, if I told their parents what they did, or used some legal reasoning, I might threaten Bai Bufan and Lin Li.\nAs for brotherhood? Three strikes can break up brotherhood; the confession is all in brothers’ names.\nBut there’s no need, doing so is a bit cold-hearted, only discouraging the two kids’ enthusiasm.\n——Even if their enthusiasm is misguided into the positive area.\n\"Hope it’s truly just up to five times.\" Yangliang could only sigh.\n\"I’m a very trustworthy person.\" Lin Li proudly patted his chest.\nThe amused Yangliang was about to praise him when he heard Bai Bufan ask, \"And for the other 90%?\"\n\"Untrustworthiness.\" Lin Li answered instantly.\nThe premise of not going beyond five times is that the system doesn’t issue related tasks. If it decides to go nuts and make me go all the way dark, things might indeed go beyond five.\nYangliang: \"?\"\n\"Is it a percentile system?!\"\nYangliang stepped on the gas pedal.\nYou little brats, I’ll smack you two!\n...\nDidn’t smack them.\nIn the end, Yangliang’s heart softened.\nThey arrived safely at the station, and the records were completed.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan waited at the door for Yangliang to take them back—Yangliang still had some matters to deal with inside.\n\"Are you heading back to school directly or what?\" After snapping an ’ID photo’ for Bai Bufan, Lin Li returned the phone to him and then asked.\n\"Definitely going back to the dorm, I’ve got some urgent matters to handle later. Oh yeah, Lin Li, I’ll log back into the cloud drive account tonight, but I’m using the mobile app, so you can still use it on your computer without any interruption,\" Bai Bufan said.\n\"You’ve got a knack for the NoFap community talent, huh?\" Lin Li couldn’t hold back, \"You really are the familiar binary NoFap warrior, NoFap is either 0 or 1.\"\n\"The NoFap community said they were already champions before I came, and they don’t welcome me. I’ll start tomorrow, definitely tomorrow!\" Bai Bufan said, a little embarrassed.\n\"You understand NoFap.\" Lin Li expressed high recognition of this.\n\"Oh, right, Lin Li, I’ve got a question.\" Bai Bufan suddenly remembered something and asked.\n\"Just say it.\"\n\"Have you noticed that Uncle Yang seems to treat me a bit worse, like with a touch of aggression, but treats you particularly well? Why is that?\" Bai Bufan asked quietly.\nThe tone, attitude, and eye contact all make this clear.\nIf he was like this to everyone, one could blame it on his personality, but the contrast is stark—Yangliang’s attitude towards Lin Li is completely different, leaving Bai Bufan’s ’fragile’ heart severely shaken.\n\"I can explain this.\" Lin Li thought for a moment and said, \"Don’t tell anyone, but remember why Uncle Yang specifically asked about your family situation?\nHere’s the thing, Uncle Yang has unspoken difficulties... so, no children, doesn’t want to adopt, and hopes I’ll take care of him in old age, obviously he’ll be nice to me. Since you’re not in the running, he’s indifferent to you, get it?\"\nBai Bufan suddenly understood.\nLin Li’s explanation made everything clear.\nTurns out Uncle Yang’s a pitiable person too.\n\"Let’s go, I’ll send you guys back.\" Yangliang finally came out from the station and approached the two.\n\"What’s with that look? Bufan, I really must tell you, be mindful of your behavior and gestures outdoors. It’s not just outside, but inside as well—don’t let yourself influence others, leading them astray.\" Yangliang noticed Bai Bufan’s odd look and immediately advised.\nBai Bufan didn’t understand the sarcasm aimed at him. Knowing the truth, he was exceptionally tolerant; he nodded vigorously: \"Mm! Uncle Yang, I understand! You keep up the good work too!\"\nYangliang: \"?\"\nSomething feels odd.\n...\n\"Not really coming to uncle’s house for dinner tomorrow?\" The car stopped at the neighborhood entrance, and Yangliang rolled down the window to ask Lin Li walking home.\nBai Bufan had already been dropped back at school.\n\"Not really, thanks, uncle. That would delay your chicken farm sweeps. You should go back and continue interrogations quickly.\" Lin Li honestly said to Yangliang, turning his head.\nHis two task progresses hadn’t shown up yet, but with previous experience, there’s little worry. Still, sooner is better, and Lin Li was quite looking forward to the rewards the system would provide.\nEven if it’s a Stretch-and-Stare Pill, that’d be something small but handy.\nYangliang: \"...\"\nIs it now assumed I’ll work overtime tonight and tomorrow?\nWanting to chat more, Yangliang reluctantly stepped on the gas and drove off, unable to keep the conversation going.\nBack home, Lin Li comfortably lay on his sofa.\nHe was just about to watch some short videos to critique the dancing bloggers when he noticed he received several messages on WeChat.\nTurning off message vibration notifications had made him less sensitive to messages.\n「Song Luping: Bufan! I just got the news, Tianhong also got busted! Our perfect preparation didn’t work!

      "content": "Chapter 87: Chapter 81: Commemorating the Loyal and Unwavering Bond Between Master and Disciple\nNot long ago Xiaowen apologized to him, and now Song Luping was also apologizing, which made Lin Li feel a little embarrassed.\nWhat virtues or abilities do I have to deserve such great favor?\nIt’s me who should apologize to you.\nBut Lin Li chose not to reply for the moment. He didn’t know what to say, so he pretended to still be at the station, waiting for his parents to pick him up.\nLin Li, like Bai Bufan, had something urgent to deal with.\nHe decided to have a remote ranking match with Bai Bufan.\n...\n[Get up diligently before 5:00 AM for a month to practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique for at least half an hour before 7:00 AM (2/30).]\nLin Li didn’t go downstairs today. Since it was the weekend, he practiced in his pajamas at home, took a shower, and went back to sleep—it was more convenient that way.\nWhen he got up again, it was almost noon.\nHis phone was full of incense messages from Song Luping, which he had intermittently sent until three or four in the morning, hoping to see him alive or his corpse if dead.\nThinking it was about time, he didn’t want to run into Song Luping by chance when he went out for a meal—meeting Song Luping frequently proved they shared a special fate.\nThat would make it hard to explain why he hadn’t replied to his messages.\nSo Lin Li composed a message and sent it:\n\"Lin Li: Brother Ping, I just got out of the station. Meh, because it’s the second time I was caught, I was symbolically detained for a night and couldn’t reply in time, sorry.\"\n\"Lin Li: Brother Ping, you have nothing to apologize for. This has nothing to do with you. It’s just that my luck was too bad, happened to collide with misfortune. The heavens are toying with me, sigh, why am I treated so unfairly by the boundless heavens?\"\nSong Luping didn’t reply immediately; perhaps he was asleep.\nBy the time he replied, Lin Li had already finished his dinner.\n\"Song Luping: Just woke up, you scared me to death. I thought you were going to be detained for fifteen days. If that were true, I couldn’t bear the guilt. Can you take a call?\"\n\"Song Luping initiated a voice call.\"\nLin Li answered it.\n\"Hey, Brother Ping.\"\n\"Ah, Bufan, hearing your voice makes my heart settle a lot. I was so worried and guilty last night, thinking about you all the time, even during the act.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nDon’t think of me during those times!\n\"Thanks for your concern, Brother...\" Lin Li said with some fear.\n\"Now that you’re out, I am not worried anymore.\"\n\"But, Bufan, I’m really curious and puzzled about how those cops managed to find us. Didn’t the informants we set up internally and on the street work at all? Bufan, as someone who experienced it firsthand, do you have any clue?\nAlthough everyone from Tianhong is in, I asked our informant. He said even when Tianhong was all taken down, he didn’t notice anything unusual. That useless insider only realized Tianhong had been swept up when he saw his former subordinates reunite with him one by one.\"\nSong Luping truly couldn’t figure this out.\nSo, Lin Li didn’t think there was an issue with informants still being able to contact the outside—no penalties or interviews were made to maintain the confidentiality of the source of this information, and the informants still had the same movement restrictions as before. Naturally, they could still maintain normal contact.\n\"I really don’t have any idea how they did it.\" Lin Li lied through his teeth.\n\"Magic rises a foot, the Dao rises ten lengths, alas, the damage is done now, pondering this further is useless. Are you okay, Bufan?\" Song Luping asked concernedly.\n\"I’m already home, what could possibly go wrong?\" Lin Li shrugged.\n\"No, no, I’m not talking about physical issues, but your mindset about this bugging incident.\nTo be honest, your level of misfortune is unprecedented in my life. Out twice and caught twice, with less than a week’s gap between them. I’ve been caught twice in my life, and you’ve already caught up with me at such a young age. You’re indeed a promising candidate to become the King of Solicitation, outstanding in every aspect.\nI’m afraid this event might greatly impact your Dao heart.\"\nSong Luping marveled sincerely.\nThe definition of a promising candidate can sometimes be rather wide.\nLin Li immediately laughed and said, \"Don’t worry, Brother Ping, small setbacks can’t defeat me.\nAs the saying goes, things never happen more than three times, and people won’t always be unlucky. I’m not losing my heart of seeking the Dao because of this. On the contrary, I think these two catches actually provided me with very rich and valuable reference experience.\nI will learn from them, correct my mistakes, and be better prepared before the next action. What doesn’t kill me will only make me stronger!\nMy Dao heart has become even stronger because of this!\"\nThe task wasn’t completed yet, so how could he lose his heart of seeking the Dao?\n\"Good, very spirited, that’s the spirit and attitude a promising candidate I set my sights on should have!\" Song Luping excitedly slapped his thigh.\nHis judgment was right; he had not picked the wrong person.\nBai Bufan was even better than he imagined, the more he interacted with him, the more he could truly feel it.\nRecognizing and deciding to pass his knowledge onto Bai Bufan was undoubtedly the most correct decision he ever made in this life, so Song Luping extended an invitation to Lin Li:\n\"Bufan, how about going to Jiangnan Stories with me later for some entertainment?\"\nLin Li liked one of his lines:\n\"Huh?\"\nAnything mentioned from Song Luping’s mouth couldn’t be good, and this so-called Jiangnan Stories was just another brothel.\nWhat shocked Lin Li was that Song Luping even chose to visit there at this time?\n\"Brother, what did you say?\"\nAs if he couldn’t believe his ears, Lin Li asked.\n\"After eating, I’ll go to Jiangnan Stories for a small expense. Do you want to join? If yes, tell me your address, and I’ll come to pick you up. Together, we brothers can conquer anything.\" Song Luping repeated.\nThen hesitated for a moment and added, \"This time I’ll reimburse you two hundred. Don’t find it too little, Brother can only scrape this much from meal money, I’ve done my best.\"\nIt was evident that Song Luping truly felt guilty about his arrest. He was indeed a very responsible and committed man.\nBut Lin Li still slowly tapped out a question mark, feeling puzzled from the bottom of his heart.\n\"But Brother Ping, Tianhong was just busted yesterday, you dare to go today? Aren’t you afraid of being caught?\"\n\"This is the experience gap between you and me.\" Song Luping modestly shook his head, \"Precisely because it has been investigated, now is the best time to go.\"\n\"First, if you check past data, with your own database, you will find that large anti-prostitution operations are like thunderstorms, eliminating multiple brothels in a short time, while smaller operations target only one.\nAfter an operation, there will be a gap before the next. Why? Simply because once other owners hear the news, they will immediately mind their own business.\nThey also know that after news spreads, there will be no harvest outside for a while, and they will relax some ’vigilance’.\nBut this period is indefinite, and today is just the second day after Tianhong’s sweep, barely 24 hours.\nEven if they stay alert, their people inside are busy handling Tianhong’s employees’ trials, leaving no time to spare for other brothels?\nThey are in a blind spot at the moment! As loyal patrons trusted by the brothels, when should we take action if not now? This is the safest time, I have verified this theory several times successfully, with satisfactory endings. I also went last Saturday and Sunday.\"\nIndeed, Song Luping could justify anything he said with seemingly reasonable logic.\n\"Besides, Bufan, these consecutive two-week anti-prostitution operations have indeed plunged Xiling into an abyss, making this perhaps the darkest September for the brothels.\nThey no longer dare to receive new clients.\nBut precisely because of this, we, aspirational and ambitious patrons, should step up! Commissioned during crisis, appointed amid dire straits, this is what we should do!\nA gambling dad, a disabled mom, a schooling younger brother, a shattered her.\nIf neither you nor I patronize, what will happen to them? This is a responsibility we should bear, and if we cower now, how are we different from those useless ones!?\"\n\"So, Bufan, come along. I pledge with all my lifelong integrity and ’reputation’ that the cops will not act today. If you come with me, it will definitely be safe!\"\n\"Come on, Bufan, come on!\"\nThough they were on a call, Lin Li felt like he could see Song Luping bathed in pure golden divine light, reaching out a big hand toward him.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Chapter 82 Lin Li: Brother Ping, I’m sorry!\nFaced with Song Luping’s invitation, Lin Li was tempted for a moment. Using this chance, he could turn Task 2 into (2/3) and also complete Task 5 of betraying his mentor.\nBut after thinking it over, he decided against it.\nIt’s not because it’s Sunday and he has to go to evening self-study class. As a day-student and a freshman with the least pressure, apart from the month before midterms and finals, Sunday evenings aren’t strictly enforced.\n—But if you skip evening classes in the third year, it counts as truancy.\nThe real reason is going out with Bai Bufan puts the rhythm in his own hands, but with Song Luping, the rhythm will surely be controlled by him. Things might accidentally go beyond his expectations, and he might inadvertently lose something important.\nHaha, well, actually that’s not really a big issue.\nLin Li was worried about something else.\n—The real worry is becoming a notorious figure, which completely goes against his original intentions.\nToo many coincidences aren’t good either.\nNews like this gets widely spread, with many people following the gossip.\nBut if every time such a report goes out, there’s a bookish guy with a similar height and build in the pictures, that’s not good.\nLight Jazz and Tianhong, he had changed clothes, pants, and shoes, and it had been a week apart. This time Bai Bufan was there to confuse the situation, so it wasn’t easy to connect the dots.\nBut if he’s in the ’pictures’ both Saturday and Sunday, the chance of being noticed is high.\nEven if no one suspects him of being an alleged undercover, some meddlesome internet users might start digging into his identity.\nIn this era, some can pinpoint the location and time from a landscape photo; it’s really not hard to uncover his identity.\nHe’s not immortal yet; standing out now is a bit premature.\n\"Brother Ping, what you said makes sense, and I was really tempted, but after getting caught yesterday, my mom grounded me. I can’t go out today, really no choice.\" After figuring this out, Lin Li casually fabricated a reason.\n\"Oh, I see, in that case, there’s really no way.\" Song Luping expressed understanding and regret, \"Looks like I’ll be going alone tonight.\"\n\"Brother Ping, have you ever considered giving up these habits? I’m willing to take over as the new patron; you really can retire in peace, health matters.\" Lin Li hesitated for a moment before speaking.\nIf possible, he’d prefer Song Luping to mend his ways.\nAfter all, Song Luping was quite good to him.\n\"Bufan, I appreciate your sentiment. Some paths can’t be turned back, some desires can’t be resisted,\" Song Luping still chose to refuse, \"I won’t turn back until I’m completely burnt out.\"\n\"Hmm.\" Lin Li sighed lightly.\n\"Alright, I’ve said what I needed to say. I still haven’t eaten since this morning. I need to grab something to energize for tonight’s battle. Let’s meet up again next week. If you don’t have anything else to ask, I’ll hang up now.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Brother Ping, next week and the week after, you won’t have them.\" Watching the disconnected call, Lin Li spoke softly.\nSince Song Luping had made his choice, Lin Li had made his choice too.\nThe Xiling Rooster Breeding map was in place, Song Luping’s value was limited, and now was a good opportunity for him to complete his task.\nBetraying the mentor!\nLin Li switched contacts and sent a message.\n「Lin Li: Uncle, are you busy? I have something to tell you 「Rose」.」\n「Yangliang: I’m begging you, Lin Li, please don’t tell me you’re going to report a new chicken farm! Uncle doesn’t want to hear that, anything else, I’m all ears.」\n「Lin Li: Then, uncle, goodbye 「Pressed Palms」.」\n「Yangliang: ?」\n「Yangliang: No, come back! What do you mean!」\n「Yangliang: What do you have to say to me!」\n「Lin Li: Uncle, I suddenly found I have nothing to say, you go ahead and be busy with your work 「Rose」「Rose」「Rose」.」\nHe was anticipated.\nBut it seems normal, the only reason he would reach out to Yangliang is for this matter.\nLooks like Yangliang is quite busy now, he should inform the main office and have them pick someone else.\nHowever, Yangliang’s call was already coming in.\nLin Li answered, then immediately turned down the volume to protect his eardrums—\n\"Lin Li, didn’t you listen to anything I told you yesterday! You weren’t even willing to wait 24 hours, were you?\nYou, you, ugh! I don’t even know what to say to you! What else haven’t you experienced, can you just tell me directly! If you want to experience execution, I can come to your house and give you a shot with my gun right now!\"\nYangliang’s emotion-filled outburst made Lin Li feel a little embarrassed.\nOne has to admit, Yangliang’s nice weekend was indeed ruined by him.\nPutting oneself in another’s shoes, it’s indeed frustrating.\nIt’s his own problem.\n\"Uncle, I’m honestly staying at home, not going anywhere today. I just intended to provide you guys with some info about the chicken farm, not planning to collaborate with you.\" Lin Li weakly said.\nYangliang remained silent for a long while.\n\"...Good child, you really did listen.\"\nPerhaps it was a hallucination, but Lin Li even heard a hint of a sob.\n\"Later, send the information directly to me on WeChat. I’m a bit busy now, I’ll let my colleague handle it later, eh, Xiaolin, didn’t you say yesterday you didn’t know about other chicken farms?\nHow come you know today? Did your friend just tell you?\"\nAlthough he knew Lin Li was dismissing him yesterday, Yangliang still used a mockery tone to try and change Lin Li’s mind.\n\"He did, the one you need to catch later, is my friend. He just told me he plans to visit that store tonight, and I came to tell you right away.\"\nLin Li showed no awareness.\nThe phone was silent for a while, then asked a series of questions, \"He’s not an undercover, right? You can really arrest him, right?\"\n\"Yes.\" Lin Li nodded.\nIt felt like Yangliang’s breathing on the other end of the line got intense.\nWhat did Song Luping do to provoke him?\n\"Okay, Xiaolin, quickly send the info to my phone. I’ll personally prepare to catch him, I won’t let him escape.\" Yangliang on this end was already itching for action.\nColleague go? He’s going himself!\nBeen wanting to nab this guy for a while!\nThe main culprit who turned poor Lin Li into what he is now, is indeed Bai Bufan, but the friend keeping him tangled with the chicken farms, deserves the highest credit!\nMust eliminate! And it has to be personally eliminated!\nAfter the two hung up, Yangliang looked at the information sent to his phone and the approximate time Lin Li’s friend was going to show up, revealing a sinister smile.\nAfter finishing the phone call, Lin Li found himself a bit at loose ends.\nSince he had to wait for the outcome, he decided to skip evening self-study.\nLin Li turned on the projector, deciding to watch a few episodes of Family Guy to reinforce his views, suspected of being too positive lately.\n...\nA long time passed.\nAnother episode’s end credits played.\nLin Li turned his head, and the phone’s LED notification light was glowing, though he didn’t know when it had started.\n—There was a message.\nThe first sentence Lin Li saw when he opened it made him uneasy.\n「My name is Song Luping, by the time you read this, I’ve been caught.」",

By the time you see this message, I’ve already been arrested.\"\n\"Song Luping: Bufan, right now, all I have is regret. I’m locking my door, holding my phone, sending you my final message. But I can’t help but feel a bit relieved that you didn’t come along. If you got caught twice in two days because of me, I’d be too ashamed to live in this world.\"\n\"Song Luping: Practice is the only criterion for testing truth. In hindsight, my theory was wrong: never underestimate cops; rigid empiricism is dangerous.\"\n\"Song Luping: They will check my phone later. I can’t let this incident affect you again, and I can’t expose the map I gave you, so I have to delete you now.\"\n\"Song Luping: I know it’s impolite to delete you alone. Please forgive me, Bai Bufan, this is the last time.\"\n\"Song Luping: The cops are getting angry. If I don’t open the door, it won’t just be fifteen days. That’s all I can say.\"\n\"Song Luping: Bai Bufan, I’m glad to have met you. I’ve been really happy these past few days. We are fated, I believe we’ll meet again in fifteen days.\"\n\"Song Luping: ’Heart emoji’ ’Goodbye’\"\nBoiling tears streamed from Lin Li’s heart.\nTears welled up.\nIn ten cases of tears, nine are laughters, and one is a burst of laughter.\nLin Li clattered on the keyboard.\n\"Lin Li: Are you kidding? Mentor, did you take your medicine or not!\"\n\"Lin Li: You selfish guy, only thinking about yourself! I’ll never forgive you!\"\n\"Lin Li: Will we meet again? Brother Ping, you have to be happy when we meet again, okay? Brother Ping, you have to be happy, you have to be happy, okay? Be happy and joyful. Your world doesn’t have me anymore, it’s okay, you have to be happy by yourself. Brother Ping, Brother Ping, Brother Ping, how can I live without you... Brother Ping, take me with you, Brother Ping!\"\nBut no matter what Lin Li sent, all that responded to him was a cold and unfeeling red exclamation mark.\nLin Li clicked on Song Luping’s profile picture. His Moments only had a single dash left and a cold little white dot.\nSome people leave and never come back.\nLin Li sadly and helplessly slid off the couch, leaning back on the floor.\nAfter fake crying for a while, Lin Li couldn’t help but complain while looking at the system interface, \"Why hasn’t the task been completed? Hasn’t my mentor gone to prison yet?\"\n\"Uncle Yang, can’t you be a bit quicker?\"\n...\nAt this time, the story of Jiangnan who got arrested.\nSong Luping followed the crowd in dejection, the hunter who hunted birds all day was finally pecked in the eye by one.\nThese fifteen days are not going to be easy.\nSong Luping had a lot of experience in this regard. Just the thought of having to take various moral and legal lessons for another fifteen days gave him a headache.\nFortunately, due to the nature of his work, it wouldn’t cause him to lose his job, but his salary for this month would probably only be a third.\nOnce out, he’d have to tighten his belt again.\n——While others tighten their belts to forcibly suppress hunger, Song Luping did it to seal the demon inside him.\nSuddenly, Song Luping saw a familiar face.\n——It was the cop who personally caught Bai Bufan that day.\nSong Luping suddenly remembered, Bai Bufan told him before that he got released the same day last time because he had some connections at the precinct. At the time, he thought Bai Bufan was some big shot.\nCould he, as Bai Bufan’s beloved friend and family, use this connection?\nIf he couldn’t get himself released directly, that’s fine, even knocking a 10-20% discount off the detention time would be satisfying. Song Luping wasn’t picky.\nActions speak louder than words, Song Luping signaled to that cop, \"Psspss—Psspss—\"\nYangliang heard the sound and walked over, asking with a cold face, \"What is it?\"\nSong Luping leaned forward and lowered his voice, \"I know Bai Bufan, his connections are my connections, you know what to do.\"\nYangliang was stunned for a moment, then smiled.\nHe was troubled by forgetting to ask Lin Li about the characteristics of his friend so he could give him special care.\nNow this guy came up to his face.\n\"I understand.\" Yangliang smiled warmly.\nSeeing this scene, Song Luping maintained a calm face, but inside was overjoyed!\nSettled! Totally settled! The cop in front of him was one of his own! Maybe he’d regain his freedom in no time!\n...\n[Task Five Completed.]\n[You have received the reward: Random Ability*1; System Currency*50.]\nThe message Lin Li had been waiting for finally appeared before him.\nHis beloved mentor, Song Luping, finally reached his loyal destination—the Demon Suppression Bureau.\nLin Li clicked on ability. It wasn’t talent, so he wasn’t worried it would be something like dancing again.\n[You have obtained active ability: Enhanced Memory]\n[Enhanced Memory: After use, memory capacity becomes five times its normal level, lasts for twenty minutes, accumulates one use every eight hours, with a maximum of three uses stored.]\nAnother memory-related ability.\nLin Li longed to pull out his textbooks on the spot to experiment with this memory capability.\nToo bad he didn’t bring textbooks home at all.\nThat’s what a good student looks like.\nHowever, Lin Li believed the effect wouldn’t be bad because this ability is extra doubling; the doubling point is at the time of use based on his current memory capacity.\nNow that his memory has doubled, the effect is already noticeable. Using this ability, his memory should become ten times what it initially was, probably close to having an eidetic memory if not quite there.\nNow Lin Li is more concerned about something else.\nHis system currency has accumulated to six hundred, and he can finally unlock the first item.\n\"System, I hope you’re not like Pinduoduo.\"\nLin Li silently prayed in his heart before opening the [Marketplace].\n——As a young man with a mind fit to be a lamp post decoration, Lin Li thought the system had more ways to torment him.\nFor example, finding out after unlocking goods that buying also requires unlocking purchase qualifications, and once bought to the warehouse, unlocking usage qualifications.\nBut if the system did go that far, Lin Li would be furious.\nAfter finishing his prayers, Lin Li opened the marketplace.\n[Random Quality Spirit Stone: 20 system currency (Limit 1 per day) (Free Refresh Available)]\n[Unlock Refreshable Item Slot 2, requires a cumulative total of 1000 system currency. (600/1000)]\n[Unlock Refreshable Item Slot 3, requires a cumulative total of 1500 system currency. (600/1500)]\n[After unlocking one more refreshable item slot, you can view the requirements to unlock refreshable item slot 4.]\nFinally, the channel to purchase spirit stones was unlocked.\nLin Li had been waiting for this day for a long time.\nLin Li wasn’t sure if 20 was pricy since he had no referential standard.\nBut as someone who played many games, Lin Li knew the significance of the word \"Limited Purchase,\" especially when the limit is 1. Better buy it first!\n[You have purchased Random Quality Spirit Stone*1.]\n[Sold Out Today (Free Refresh Available)]\nLuckily, the system didn’t do anything heinous like unlocking a purchase qualification.\nIn terms of being beastly, the system was less adept than he was.\nLin Li checked the warehouse; it was quite standardized and even had probability disclosure.\n[Low-grade Spirit Stone: 95%; Medium-grade Spirit Stone: 4%; High-grade Spirit Stone: 0.9%; Spiritual Spring: 0.1%.]\n\"The probability feels too real, but there’s no guarantee mechanism; this violates the law, I must report this!\" Lin Li muttered to himself upon discovering there was no guarantee mechanism.\nUsed it.\n[Low-grade Spirit Stone*1.]\nThe expected result occurred, albeit somewhat predictably.\nLin Li checked the refresh mechanism for item slots.\nIt turned out that refreshing doesn’t reset the daily purchase count but directly refreshes the item type.\nHowever, the result after refreshing can be selected to be replaced, so there’s no worry about getting a worse outcome and regretting the choice.\nSince it is reversible, it doesn’t matter.\nRefresh.\n[You’ve received refreshed B++ Battle Armor (Lin Li Perfect Model): 1000 system currency, would you like to replace?]",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Chapter 84: I have seen the future, and there is only one way for us to win\nTo be honest, this sudden change of style left Lin Li a bit confused.\nOne second, he was pondering about Spirit Stones, and the next, a battle armor appeared.\nThough unexpected, it made sense in a way.\nAfter all, his system itself was schizophrenic, a fool, so hoping for it to be reliable was unreliable.\nBut there’s no denying, compared to the so-called Spirit Stones, this perfect replica of a battle armor truly tempted Lin Li.\nWhat man can refuse a drivable mecha that’s his perfect replica?\nUnfortunately, he can’t afford it at all.\nAnd even if he could, Lin Li felt he wouldn’t buy it any time soon.\nA mecha like this must have a power source, right? If it’s electric, does it come with a charging cable? If not, does it use type-c, round, or three-hole sockets?\nIs there after-sales service for the mecha? Can it be repaired if damaged? Is there an instruction manual?\nThese are all concerns Lin Li would have after buying it.\nNot being able to afford it saved Lin Li from a lot of indecision.\nSo Lin Li clicked no.\n[The cost of this refresh: 100 system currency]\nAs expected, if he wanted to refresh again after a free refresh, he’d have to pay.\nToo expensive, couldn’t bear it.\nThe 580 in his pocket wouldn’t withstand many spends.\nThe free refresh button didn’t disappear, it showed insufficient attempts when clicked, seems there will be more chances to earn such rewards later.\nWeighing the Spirit Stone in his hand, Lin Li felt quite good.\nHe could finally advance his Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique consistently, with a regular daily supply of at least one low-grade Spirit Stone, exactly enough to split his morning for cultivation.\nAt least things are on the right track now.\n...\nMonday.\nJust waking up, Lin Li squinted at the system ahead.\n[Update complete.]\nLooking at this somewhat familiar notification, Lin Li fell into thought.\nHere we go again?\nAfter the last update, he inexplicably ended up in the ’All-Girl World’, what’s going to happen this time? Will the schizophrenia get worse? Is the system going to split into a third direction?\nIs the update time fixed on Monday? Once a week?\nBoth times it was Monday morning when he saw the message, so naturally, Lin Li thought along these lines.\nThis Sunday night, stay up past midnight, and see if the update happens at midnight on Monday.\nLin Li was about to buy today’s Spirit Stones when he suddenly discovered that the system’s UI had an extra option, but there was no text, and it was gray, unclickable.\nGood news: this time the system indeed had an update, and it was observable.\nBad news:\n\"Damn system, you’re basically a half-finished product! Which uncultured, unskilled person researched you! Higher-dimensional beings, I f*** you... you’re really impressive.\" Considering the harm words can do, Lin Li chose to put on a facade.\nClicking into the shop, Lin Li saw the free refresh button was lit up again.\nAnother free refresh opportunity.\nDoes every system update provide one free refresh?\nBut regardless of whether it’s given post-update, it’s free, so why not take it.\n[You have refreshed and obtained a low-grade Spirit Stone: 20 system currency (limited to 5 per day), would you like to swap?]\nCompared to his current one, the upside is that the new one can be bought more in a day, the downside is it lacks the gamble of turning a bicycle into a motorcycle.\nAfter pondering for a while, Lin Li still chose not to swap.\nAfter all, Lin Li and poison cannot coexist.\nWho can refuse a 5% chance to obtain higher quality Spirit Stones or even the mysterious Spiritual Spring, which sounds impressive just by its probability?\nPlus, Lin Li didn’t have much system currency saved up himself, all his assets would only buy thirty, and even if limited to one per day, it’d be used up in a month.\nMight as well consider it controlling expenses.\nAs for his task regarding the Joyful Union Sect, there was still no progress, meaning the conditions for purging weren’t met yet.\nBut Lin Li understood, last time it was reported on Friday and wasn’t resolved until Monday, Tianhong was reported just the day before yesterday, and he cleared the Jiangnan story on Sunday too, Uncle Yang and the others must be busy to death now.\nNeeding more time is normal.\n[Rise for a month straight before 5:00 AM and diligently practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, before 7:00 AM, accumulate at least half an hour (3/30).]\nToday continued training at home, using just one low-grade Spirit Stone, while the one switched out yesterday was still stored in the [warehouse] for unforeseen needs.\nSince he was training at home, there was nothing to worry about, it was much more comfortable than in the community park.\n...\nSchool.\nLin Li just entered the classroom.\n\"Lin Li, run, don’t look back, run quickly—\" Bai Bufan shouted at him.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li bolted.\nThough he didn’t know why, running seemed like the best choice.\nWhen he noticed a group of boys chasing him, Lin Li understood he was right to run.\nDamn PE students.\nLin Li was eventually caught by Wang Ze.\n\"Seriously, dude, Lin Li, you... how come you’re running so fast now...\" Wang Ze, who used an unwavering grip to restrain Lin Li, was out of breath as he spoke.\nHe had been chasing for ages before finally catching up.\nLin Li felt quite gratified.\nHis over a week’s worth of physical training and Spirit Stone magic nourishing had honestly improved his stamina remarkably.\nBoth explosive speed and endurance showed notable improvements.\nHe was no longer the weakling who struggled to finish a thousand meters in over four and a half minutes.\nLin Li was even a bit excited to see what his time would be the next PE class when they run a thousand meters, surely making Bai Bufan uncomfortable.\nAfter all, as a brother, it’s okay to do well, but not too well.\n\"You wouldn’t understand if you’ve never settled, settling is just like this.\" Lin Li retorted to the PE students with dominance.\n\"Really, what are you planning to do to me in broad daylight? I might start shouting for help.\" Lin Li struggled as he looked at the boys approaching, already smirking.\n\"Lin Li! Why did you bring Bai Bufan but not us?!\" Finally catching up, Zhou Baowei asked grimly.\nThe jerks who revered Lin Li as the supreme sage last week now saw him as an enemy.\n\"Damn Bai Bufan, loose tongue, unreliable! Betrayed me so fast?\" Lin Li now understood his predicament.\n\"He does deserve some credit. My brother’s new matchmaking partner went in too, our family got the scoop, and I noticed from the photos circulated on the scene.\nYou two with the hats were just too conspicuous. Given the past incident, who wouldn’t suspect? A slight push, and Bai Bufan confessed,\" Zhou Baowei sneered.\n\"Come on, dude, are you sure the matchmaker your family knows isn’t actually a Madame? All the matches this precise? What a divine matching mechanism.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\nDoes he have to sweep twice more, possibly ruining Zhou Baowei’s brother’s matchmaking events again?\n\"That’s not the point, the point is why’d you only take Bai Bufan and not us!\" Zhou Baowei pressed further.\n\"Bufan volunteered to be my lackey in exchange, also, you guys weren’t around over the weekend.\" Lin Li chuckled awkwardly.\n\"That’s a ridiculous excuse!\"\nSadly, the crowd didn’t buy the excuse.\nAs they chatted, Lin Li found himself held at each limb by someone, suspended in mid-air.\nSeemed like he was about to meet Shang Yang’s fate.\nFortunately, no new task was triggered, letting Lin Li breathe a sigh of relief.\nHe feared the system would initiate a task asking him to slay monsters with fellow disciples.\n\"Lin Li, either take us next time, or face our revenge here, make your choice,\" Wang Ze and the others issued an ultimatum.\nLin Li took a deep breath: \"I laugh facing the sky with my blade in hand, my gallantry shines over Kunlun! I’m ready to die!\"\nEveryone: \"...\"\n\"I’ll teach you to face the sky with your blade! I’ll teach you Kunlun!\"\nSeems Lin Li had made his choice, so no one held back.\nLin Li wasn’t as heroic as Brother Tan, he couldn’t nobly go to his death.\nThe key thing was:\n\"Who the hell groped my butt amidst the chaos?!\"\n...\nLin Li dragged his beaten body back to the classroom, returning to his seat.\nBai Bufan’s face was calm, neither sad nor happy: \"I did my best, but they were too ruthless, there was nothing I could do, are you okay?\"\nLin Li squinted, looking at the pale-lipped, hollow-eyed Bai Bufan:\n\"Never mind about me, Bufan, how many times did you go at it after going home Saturday?\"\nLike Doctor Strange, Bai Bufan shakily and weakly raised one finger.\n\"This is the effect you got from just once?\" Lin Li simply didn’t believe it.\nThis was more extreme than Song Luping, couldn’t possibly just be once.\n\"One bottle.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Chapter 85: In this world, there is always someone silently caring about you\nIf it’s just one bottle, then it’s fine. This current weak state is entirely normal.\nLin Li patted Bai Bufan on the shoulder, both relieved and impressed:\n\"The human world record is thirty-six times in twenty-four hours, Bufan, I believe you can aim for that record.\"\n\"No interest at all. Right now, I have no interest in anything in this world.\" Bai Bufan shook his head.\nLin Li nodded again to show understanding.\nThat’s how a Wise One is.\n\"Lin Li, you’re finally here. By the way, what did Qiaoqiao say when she added you over the weekend?\" Chen Tianming suddenly came over and asked, looking vigilant.\n\"Huh? She added me? I didn’t notice.\" Lin Li was stunned for a moment upon hearing this, then suddenly realized: \"I used a secondary account over the weekend, didn’t notice at all. I haven’t added her back. Did you put in a good word for me?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"What, she likes me? Are you acting as Feiyangyang? Then when you push, put in more effort, or I’ll have to find a new Feiyangyang.\"\nLin Li said casually.\n\"Stop being so cocky. More friends, more opportunities. She’s just expanding her friends’ list, she added Bao Wei, Bai Bufan, and Wang Ze too.\" Chen Tianming immediately widened his eyes and said.\n\"She added all of them? Bufan, what did you talk to her about?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Did I talk? Maybe. I don’t remember. Not sure.\" A somewhat dumbfounded Bai Bufan shook his head, speaking haltingly.\nOne bottle is indeed too much for the body to handle.\nTake it as a warning.\nBy the way, if Bai Bufan can handle one bottle, I can probably handle one and a half, right?\nBut since she added everyone, I’m not special, so it’s fine. With that thought, Lin Li curiously asked Chen Tianming: \"Tianming, how did your weekend chats go? Any progress?\"\n\"653.\" Chen Tianming immediately said excitedly.\n\"Hmm, what’s that?\" Lin Li was confused.\n\"This weekend, she sent me a total of 653 words. If you include punctuation, that’s 724 characters! There were also lots of emoticons, not counting the default ones from WeChat, with a grand total of forty-seven, and they’re super cute! If you count those...\" Chen Tianming explained in detail to Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nLin Li was at a loss for words, then in a heartfelt tone, patted Chen Tianming on the shoulder: \"When I get married, you and Wang Yuezhi can sit together.\"\nThe two of you could squat outside the door as good luck charms.\n\"I’ve already reached the point where we can say goodnight to each other.\" Chen Tianming protested, \"It’s different from Wang Yuezhi! Lin Li, you’re being somewhat insulting!\"\nLin Li smiled and gave a thumbs up.\nWhatever you say.\nGo along with it.\n\"I can’t wait for the fall outing. I wonder if there’ll be some wonderful encounter with her.\" Chen Tianming went into a daydream, then patted Lin Li on the shoulder: \"Lin Li, thanks for encouraging me to go to the fall outing. When I get married, you’ll be seated at the table with my elders!\nGoing on the fall outing was the best decision I’ve ever made.\"\n\"Oh, right, how did the fall outing turn out? I haven’t been keeping track.\" Seeing Chen Tianming mention it, Lin Li was curious.\n\"We’re going with the class president’s plan. The other classes seem to approve. The class president only engaged one class, but a total of four classes chose a similar route to ours, including Class Seventeen.\" Chen Tianming replied.\nThe morning study session bell rang, and although Chen Tianming had more to say, he had to return to his seat.\n...\nThe first class meeting.\n\"If you have brought mobile phones or other electronic devices, please voluntarily hand them over.\" Xue Jian entered holding a large storage bag and addressed everyone.\nThere must have been an announcement in the group chat, and immediately a crowd gathered to hand over their phones and even gaming devices.\nIt’s quite usual to bring electronic devices during this week’s fall outing.\nXue Jian’s attention wasn’t on those handing over their phones, but on those who remained seated:\n\"I might not remember who handed over their phones or what model it was, but I clearly remember who didn’t! So be careful, and during the outing, those who didn’t hand over their phones better not let me catch you using them, or else, ha ha.\"\nXue Jian’s words had an effect, and a few people who had remained seated were persuaded to hand over their phones.\nBai Bufan remained unmoved.\nThis is how an elder artist remains calm (leaning back strategically).\nOf course, it could also be that this kid is daydreaming again, not even hearing what Xue Jian is saying.\nAs the saying goes, If I don’t go to the mountain, the mountain will come to me.\nSure enough, Xue Jian simply walked over to Bai Bufan, smiled, and said: \"Bufan, you’re staying on campus this week, don’t tell the teacher you didn’t bring your phone, be considerate.\"\nIt was clear that the tangled events of the weekend made Xue Jian firmly remember Bai Bufan.\nThe elder artist wasn’t so calm after all, just as Bai Bufan was about to speak, Xue Jian added:\n\"Don’t say you left your phone at Lin Li’s house; even if it’s there, Lin Li has to bring it tomorrow for me to store.\"\nBai Bufan swallowed a bit, realizing he had been called out, and could only smile sheepishly.\n\"Oh, um...\"\n\"Hand it over.\"\nUnder Xue Jian’s stern gaze, Bai Bufan finally silently took out his phone from his backpack and handed it over.\nXue Jian then let out a cold laugh, satisfied as he walked away.\n\"I should’ve bought a dummy phone, now I can’t grind on Genshin Impact for the next four days, I’ll miss out on so many primogems!\" After Xue Jian left, Bai Bufan grumbled, clutching his hair with regret and sadness.\n\"This is the price you paid for going to Tianhong with me.\" Lin Li joked with a smile.\n\"Even if I had to do it again, I would still go, it was too much fun. Handing over a phone is no big deal, not a loss. Lin Li, when are we going exploring again? Bao Wei and Wang Ze, we don’t need to bother with them, you know, we’ve never been really close to them, it’s all just pretend. It’s only real between us.\"\nLin Li shook his head; he had only brought Bai Bufan along for a task, and with the task complete, there was no need.\nBesides, I can’t be so flashy anymore. First, I’ve experienced most things already. Second, if I keep it up, others will soon find out my identity.\n\"If you want to do it openly, we can explore again.\" After weighing the pros and cons with Bai Bufan, Lin Li said.\n\"Uh... never mind.\"\nLin Li’s words made sense.\nBai Bufan was still cautious, fun things are only fun as long as his identity remains unknown—a secret he must keep from his family.\n...\nThat evening, upon returning home, Lin Li found an elderly person standing at his doorstep.\nUpon closer inspection, it was Zhang Fang.\n\"Grandma Zhang, what are you doing at my door? Is something wrong?\" Lin Li asked gently.\nSeeing Lin Li, Zhang Fang finally breathed a sigh of relief:\n\"Xiaolin, as long as you’re okay, that’s all that matters.\"\n\"Ah, what happened?\" Lin Li was even more confused.\n\"It’s Old Zhou, the Grandpa Zhou you usually exercise with in the mornings. He noticed you haven’t been around for several days and came to me.\"\n\"He kept saying things like ’you’re missing,’ ’there’s a conspiracy,’ ’it’s urgent,’ ’everyone’s in danger,’ ’we must find you immediately.’ I think he was just really worried and got a bit incoherent, thinking you were taken or deceived.\"\n\"Your situation is rather unique, with you being home alone most of the time, so it’s normal for Old Zhou to worry. I called the number your mom left with the property management, but it was disconnected. Worried that something really happened to you, I came to stake out your home. Now that I see you’re fine, your grandma can finally rest easy.\" Zhang Fang said, holding Lin Li’s hand.\nTurns out there are always people quietly caring about you in this world.\nXiaozhou was really concerned.\nAfter noticing your absence for three days, he actually thought something had happened to you.\nIt must be said, while it was somewhat ’overly sensitive,’ Lin Li was genuinely touched.\nThank you, Grandpa Zhou!",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Chapter 86: Progress! I want to improve!\n\"I understand the situation now, Grandma Zhang. Here’s the thing, I haven’t been going to the park to exercise these days, just been sleeping in at home. As for my mom’s phone number, she changed it a year ago but didn’t update it with the property management, so you couldn’t reach us.\nHow about this, Grandma, maybe you can take down my number, so you can contact me in case there’s anything in the future.\"\nLin Li explained to Zhang Fang after figuring it out.\nAs for exercising at home, mentioning these little details might lead to questions, so just saying I slept in is simpler.\n\"I guessed it might be like that. The security in our neighborhood... although we don’t really have property management maintaining security, most of the folks here are good people. How could accidents happen so easily?\nOld Zhou, he’s probably just a bit too anxious, caring too much and kind of panicking due to worry, don’t blame him for causing you trouble.\" Zhang Fang nodded and patted Lin Li’s hand.\n\"How could I blame him, Grandma Zhang? Of course, I know little... Grandpa Zhou means well for me. I’ll go down and talk to him tomorrow.\"\n\"Good, good, you two truly have an intergenerational friendship, little Grandpa Zhou, sounds endearing.\"\nAfter exchanging numbers and making some polite conversation, Zhang Fang said goodbye and left.\nLin Li then started to take a shower while reviewing the English words he noted down during evening study today.\nThe memory was still clear, not forgotten at all.\n[Strong Memory] effect is really significant.\nAlthough I’ve used it only once, just for twenty minutes, in those twenty minutes, Lin Li managed to memorize all the words starting with ’a’, estimating at least two to three hundred.\nAccumulating one hour of super strong memory every day, learning becomes a piece of cake?\n——Math and Physics excluded.\n...\nThe next day.\nLin Li ’long-awaited’ return to the community park, Xiaozhou was waiting there for a long time.\n\"Grandpa Zhou, it’s been days since we last saw each other, did you miss me?\" Lin Li greeted with a smile.\n\"Miss you? I wish you would leave our neighborhood and we’d never see you again!\" Zhou Youwei immediately said, glaring.\nAfter that, he seemed a bit happy and proud.\nFortunately, he reminded everyone in time, although he didn’t know what Lin Li’s scheme was, it should have been successfully thwarted.\nTrue to my name, Zhou Youwei, the silent guardian of the neighborhood.\nLin Li kept a benevolent smile at those words.\nA typical proud Old Deng, a sharp tongue and a soft heart.\nObviously cares a lot but pretends not to show any concern.\nSigh, pridefulness is outdated, luckily Grandma Zhang pointed out Xiaozhou’s intentions to me.\n\"In any case, thank you for your concern. If I don’t go down to exercise for a long time, I’ll inform you in advance. I’m not prone to accidents, so don’t worry too much,\" Lin Li sincerely said to Zhou Youwei.\n\"Huh? Who’s concerned about you? I can’t even hate you enough, I dislike you!\" Zhou Youwei said, stunned.\n\"Alright, alright, Grandpa Zhou, you don’t care about me, you dislike me the most, I understand, I understand~~ I’m really sorry for being disliked by you~\" Lin Li nodded with a friendly smile, even winking.\nOld folks are sensitive, no need to expose them, as long as I know what they really mean.\nZhou Youwei’s head was full of question marks.\nWhat the heck is this kid doing here? Are you teasing Old Deng like this?\nNo... this is sarcasm! It’s passive-aggressive!\nThis is too much. In this round, shouldn’t I have won? What right does Lin Li have to mock me?\nZhou Youwei unhappily stared at Lin Li.\nFeeling the gaze from behind, understanding the care within, Lin Li felt even more touched.\n...\nLast class of the morning.\nLin Li focused intensely on staring at the Physics teacher’s PPT, trying to understand.\nBai Bufan wasn’t beside him, he was standing in the back listening.\nAs for the reason.\nPhysics teacher: \"The basic action direction between electric charges is like charges repel and opposite charges attract.\"\nBai Bufan: \"Teacher, why do you assume the orientations of electric charges? Is it possible for an electric charge to have a positive physiological gender but a negative psychological gender?\"\nThe Physics teacher endured.\nAfter all, LGBT is politically correct, and he’s afraid of being reported by Bai Bufan to the Los Angeles First People’s Court.\nPhysics teacher: \"In winter, when wearing or taking off a sweater, you might see static electricity and electric sparks, but why doesn’t it occur in summer? Does anyone know?\"\nBai Bufan: \"Duh, wearing a sweater in summer, isn’t that a pure idiot move?\"\nThe Physics teacher couldn’t take it anymore, sending Bai Bufan to the back.\nLin Li could only say Bai Bufan deserved it.\n[Task Three Completed.]\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: Comprehension increase 10%; Memory increase 100%; Random Cultivation Technique*1.]\nWhen Lin Li saw this message pop up, he excitedly rubbed his eyes, shifted his gaze back to his textbook, pretending to study but actually taking a break.\nFinally, he could afford not to pay attention to the lecture for a while.\nHonestly speaking, Physics is more troublesome than Mathematics.\nAt least Xue Jian still has hair, but Luo Hao, the Physics teacher of Class Four, is already a shiny bald egg.\nAfter this message appeared, the clarity he once anticipated in his mind, he finally felt it momentarily.\nIs this the feeling brought by comprehension?\nThe difference is evident compared to the memory improvement that seems to have come in without any effect.\nIn only a few seconds, the change stirs wonder.\nI’ve become smarter, then this Physics problem, let me look again!\nLin Li raised his head in anticipation, but after a minute, when the teacher had moved on to the next page of the PPT while Lin Li was still pondering the previous one, his smile dried up and he lowered his head again.\nDarn it, 10% comprehension isn’t nearly enough.\nYou electric charges have so many issues, born with charges but nothing takes care of them. Wait till Brother Wu Jing arrives, all of you electric charges will meet your end!\nLin Li quietly raged against the electric charges in his heart.\n[Learning leads to progress, striving for the grand path, the sect once considered you merely ordinary, but diligence can change fate, yesterday’s seeds, today you reap the fruits, as the sect competition approaches, why not show your prowess, and become a sensation? Lin Li’s name, should resound through the heavens!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Three: Achieve significant progress in the Nansang Sect Competition, ranking within the top hundred among peers, and enter the sect’s genius list.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Comprehension increase 20%; Divine Sense improvement 100%; Random Artifact*1.]\nLike before, the completion of the old task accompanied the triggering of a new task, but this time it’s no longer about listening to the lecture intently.\nSect competition... it’s like a monthly or mid-term exam kind of big test, isn’t it?\nThis means the task requires you to rank within the top hundred in the entire school in the next big exam.\nAs for the so-called sect genius list, it’s the honor list, the kind with a photo and motto.\nLin Li has always wanted to show off there, but hasn’t had the chance.\nEvery time seeing those top students waste these spots, he felt it’s a pity.\nThe honor list isn’t just for the top hundred in the grade, that would be too many, only the top ten in the grade typically have a stable qualification, but if Lin Li reaches the top hundred, he doesn’t even need to be in the top hundred to get on -- in the Star of Progress section.\n\"I really want to improve.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Chapter 87: Does Making Calls to Gather People Count as Divination?\nHowever, since both are included in the task description, if I end up ranked 101, making the honor roll, this task might not be completed.\nIf I make too much progress this time, scoring 100 next time might mean I can’t make it onto the improvement roll.\nIf that happens, there’s still a way to handle it. If I’m not in the top hundred, I can just tell Xue Jian that I’m not satisfied with this score and don’t want to be on the improvement roll like this, and ask him to take me off the list until I make the top hundred.\nThen, when my improvement shows, it just needs to span a longer time period.\nXue Jian probably won’t refuse.\nIf he refuses, I’ll send Xue Jian a banner, just like the photos he showed me before, and he’ll surely be anxious.\nThinking about this, the only issue left is how to break into the top hundred.\nWhat position is most suitable?\nTrying to get my stable rank of over four hundred suddenly into the top hundred was practically a fantasy for the old Lin Li, both theoretically and practically.\nThe top hundred are basically filled with students from the pre-recruited Olympiad class and internal prodigies like Chen Yu Ying from various parallel classes, who could possibly be first in class but rank only twenty or thirty in the whole year.\nMy class has some bright students, ranking quite well among parallel classes, but in last semester’s final exams, only about five or six from my class made it into the top hundred.\nLuckily, besides working hard, I can also use some points.\nMy memory now consistently doubles, intelligence increased by 10%, and I have an almost photographic memory for one hour a day.\nThe daily spirit stone nourishment also continually enhances my body in all aspects, including vitality, energy, and spirit.\nThe next monthly exam has been postponed, and no date has been set yet. It’s probably after National Day at the latest or at the earliest by the end of September, giving me plenty of time.\nIt feels like there’s a chance.\nSo even though this task doesn’t require paying attention in class seriously, I still need to pay careful attention and work even harder during my spare time on reviewing and preparing.\nHaving figured this out, Lin Li looked up at the PPT.\nUnderstand first.\nThen fail.\nFinally, forget it.\nThis class, take a break first.\nLin Li looked at the system, checking out the random cultivation technique in the [Warehouse].\n[Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique].\nWow.\nIs it randomly assigned because I checked during physics class, and the currently covered subject is electromagnetic phenomena and technology?\nJudging by the name, it seems more impressive than the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\nThe former is a technique, the latter is control.\nIf I can master it, does it mean I can become Lei Gong? Does Jade Emperor cover the Dianmu part?\nLin Li indeed likes thunder quite a bit. Who can refuse a major thunder?\nMy cultivation path is finally taking a big step toward immortality.\nIf it weren’t for the many onlookers, Lin Li would really want to take it out and admire it for a while.\n...\nAt noon, due to the Thunder Control Technique, Lin Li decided to eat outside.\nUpon manifesting it, he found it resembled the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, also as a book, pretty thick but a bit thinner than the latter.\nWritten in classic literary style, traditional characters, Lin Li also confirmed that there are no reference answers at the back.\nSeems like I’ll have to translate and understand it all over again.\nLuckily, having had a previous experience, Lin Li’s heart remained calm, taking photos with his phone and heading to the print shop to print it out, ready to review during free time in evening study.\nMost importantly, I need to make notes, otherwise, I’d just use [Enhanced Memory] to remember it.\nReturning to the classroom, Wang Yuezhi and Chen Yu Ying were already there.\n\"Class president, to get into the top hundred of the year, approximately what score and what kind of grades are needed? How far do you think I’m lacking?\" Sitting at his seat, Lin Li rubbed his cheek and asked Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Why suddenly ask this, do you want to get into the top hundred?\" Chen Yu Ying asked, curious.\n\"It’s not about wanting; it’s about having to do it. Next monthly exam, I’m going to make a name for myself,\" Lin Li chuckled, bursting with youthful spirit.\n\"These scores definitely depend on the difficulty of the exam! If Luo Hao and other physics teachers aren’t strict, the physics parallel class average might be as low as forty—but as for how far you’re lacking...,\" Chen Yu Ying, hearing this, cast a thoughtful look at Lin Li.\n\"There might be or possibly a chance... The gap isn’t... exceptionally wide...well, there’s a chance, yes, there’s a chance,\" Chen Yu Ying encouraged.\n\"Class president, if those words are hard for you, you don’t have to force it; you don’t need to hypnotize yourself, I’m a yellow card on the forum, my defenses are maxed out,\" unfortunately Lin Li wasn’t encouraged at all.\n\"You’re too far off! I climbed from rank 100 to a stable rank between 20 and 40; I know very well the gap between you and my former self.\nLin Li, with your current way of studying, focusing on things other than learning, it’s really challenging. I’m genuinely saying this for your benefit, Lin Li, listen to my advice: your most important task now is to concentrate solely on studying on your own,\" Wang Yuezhi turned his head and sincerely told Lin Li.\nSince before the official lunch break, Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying usually chat without lowering their voices, so this guy often eavesdrops and Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying are used to it.\nWang Yuezhi’s eyes were really sincere.\nBut this guy is actually the one who’s focusing on things other than learning.\nAlso specially emphasized that he’s currently stabilized at ranks 20 to 50, right?\nWho asked you?\nIt’s like a tadpole with frog tattoos on its body—you’re flaunting your mom.\n\"When I marry Qiu Ya, can you not sing and dance here?\" Lin Li sighed lightly.\n\"The snowflakes flutter, the north wind whistles~~\" After saying that, Lin Li added sound effects for Wang Yuezhi.\nThe diligent efforts during early reading finally paid off, and it sounded quite nice.\nWang Yuezhi: \"...\"\nLin Li indeed scolds him without using dirty words now, but it sounds worse than when he used them.\n\"Putting good intentions to waste! With your attitude, there’s no chance you’ll get into the top hundred next monthly exam,\" Wang Yuezhi said angrily.\n\"What if I do score well!\" Lin Li squinted.\n\"Then I’ll recognize you as my dad for a semester, but obviously, no cheating in the scores!\" Wang Yuezhi immediately replied. High school boys’ bets are really too simple.\n\"Deal!\" Lin Li clapped strongly.\n\"Then what if you don’t score well?\" Wang Yuezhi retorted.\n\"If I don’t score well, I’ll recognize you as dad, also for a semester!\"\n\"Deal! I accept that too!\"\n\"OK!\" Lin Li nodded, \"The bet is set, the class president is the notary!\"\nBoth Lin Li and Wang Yuezhi looked at Chen Yu Ying, and facing their gaze, she nodded dumbly.\nScratching her head, did she just hear them right?\nWang Yuezhi slightly smirked, thinking that wanting to jump from over four hundred to the top hundred within half a month is absurd.\nThis bet, the advantage is on my side.\n...\nFive minutes later.\n\"Lin Li! Wait! No, there’s a problem! Why is it that if you lose, you recognize me as dad? Then either way, you’re my dad!\"\nWang Yuezhi suddenly turned and questioned.",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Chapter 88: Lin Li Can Be Human\nLin Li felt a bit regretful that the guy realized it.\nAfter realizing it, Wang Yuezhi naturally wouldn’t admit it.\nHowever, the two still made a bet, but the stakes were changed to one call of \"dad,\" and three not-too-demanding errands.\nThe main reason was that Lin Li wasn’t 100% confident he could get into the top 100 in the next monthly exam, so he wanted to leave some room for himself.\nLin Li would only ignore risks when it came to installing things, otherwise, he was a very cautious person.\n\"Why do you want to make this bet? It seems hard to win.\" Chen Yu Ying hesitated for a while and advised.\n\"The class rep knows what’s what.\" Wang Yuezhi, who had already turned around, thought very gratifiedly upon hearing this.\n\"If it were easy to win, I wouldn’t bet. I like challenges, and this can also push my desire to study, making it a fight to the death.\" Lin Li said casually.\nHow cool he can make it sound.\nChen Yu Ying blinked, her eyes showing some admiration: \"Such an awesome attitude, Lin Li. I hope you succeed. You can ask me anything you want, as long as I know, I’ll definitely teach you.\"\n\"Then thank you, class rep. Oh, by the way, class rep, a bet is a bet whether it’s one or two. How about you bet with me too? Same content, but our stakes are just a request that the other can accept, how about it?\"\nA small bet is delightful, fun, and can also enhance relationships, Lin Li then said.\n\"Hmm... okay.\" Chen Yu Ying thought for a moment, finding it interesting as well, and nodded.\nDamn, no matter winning or losing, this kind of bet seems fun!\nListening to the conversation between the two, Wang Yuezhi felt his nose itch.\nHe looked down with both eyes and somehow saw a small red ball growing out from the position of his nose?\n...\nAfternoon.\nHistory class.\nOnce again, Lin Li enjoyed the two seats of his and Bai Bufan’s by himself.\nBai Bufan was standing in the back again.\nThe reason this time was mainly that he didn’t do his history homework.\nActually, not doing it isn’t a big deal, he’s not the only one. But when the history teacher asked him why he didn’t do it, this guy said he was afraid of altering history, not writing was respecting history.\nThe teacher then made him stand for the class, saying it shows more respect for history.\nOne could only say that Bai Bufan’s every punishment for standing wasn’t innocent.\nThere was a time last semester when I used to stand with him often, but now I’m a reformed person.\n[Task four completed]\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: Appearance and Charm Increased by 10%; Random Pill *1; System Currency *50.]\n[Within a month, further discover and coordinate deeply with the Demon Suppression Bureau to eradicate three Hehuan Demon bases (1/3)]\nSeeing these messages, Lin Li felt very relieved.\nLooks like the Demon Suppression Bureau over there, Tianhong has finally completed the sweep.\nMy body now feels slightly uncomfortable, presumably like the Qi Blood enhancement, it’s the ’growing pains’ before boosting appearance and charm.\nBecause it’s only slight, Lin Li doesn’t care much.\nThis feeling soon disappeared.\nSo now I’ve become 10% more handsome than before? Sadly, Lin Li didn’t have a mirror, checking oneself through a window in the daytime is difficult.\nI’ll show off properly when I get home tonight.\nLin Li checked the pills in the [Warehouse].\n[Health and Illness Dispelling Pill]\nThe system still has a bit of humanity with the pills by providing introductions, at least not making me guess the effects based on the name.\nThe medicine instructions were quite long, Lin Li read through it carefully and felt a bit disappointed, relying on a pill to ascend might be a shattered dream.\nThis thing, once consumed, only strengthens the body, enhances immunity to common illnesses, cures, and alleviates chronic maladies.\nAmong the pills in the Cultivation Realm, this should be the most basic; ordinary people can consume it, or rather, it’s intended for ordinary people.\nAfter reading the introduction, Lin Li was convinced that the improvement after taking it should be minimal since it could be felt that my body was already moving in this direction.\nTaking it won’t result in 1+1 equals 2.\nBut it’s something I could leave for my mom to take; traveling long distances outside, even without major ailments, there might be continuous minor issues with her body, and it could be effective for her.\nAfter class.\nBai Bufan returned to his seat, rubbing his leg and complaining: \"Why am I so unlucky today, standing throughout the class?\"\n\"Is it unlucky? You deserve it.\" Lin Li sneered.\nBai Bufan looked at Lin Li, then frowned.\n\"What’s up?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Bro, you smell good.\"\n...\nWanting to see what this pill truly looks like, Lin Li decided to have dinner outside of school today.\n\"Is this pill even humanly ingestible?\"\nLooking at the pill materialized in his hand, Lin Li fell into thought.\nLike those herbal medicines, it’s a large ball, probably a full two centimeters in diameter. If one doesn’t chew it and swallows directly, they could choke to death.\nIt’s brown, looking like it’s hard to swallow.\nThis whole plan of secretly drugging my mom is now completely out of the question.\nThere’s no way a human can incorporate this thing into a regular diet and consume it unknowingly.\nIf I tell my mom this is a specially brewed stewed herbal medicine ball, would she buy it?\nDoesn’t seem very convincing.\n\"I’ll just have to figure it out later then.\"\n[Within a month, further discover and coordinate deeply with the Demon Suppression Bureau to eradicate three Hehuan Demon bases (2/3)]\nFaced with the popped-up message, Lin Li was stunned.\nᓖ뮤 (Not a buddy’s written version).\nHow did it become three minus two?\nThe weekend swept Hehuan Sect bases were only two, Tianhong and Jiangnan Story.\nGuess Jiangnan Story was counted in my achievements too.\nBut I didn’t personally get involved in the Jiangnan Story, just informed Yangliang of this info. Does this count as deep coordination?\nSo all along, I might have overthought this derived task? Deep coordination doesn’t necessarily include personal involvement?\nIt seems so.\nThough it’s fairly unfortunate, it’s also somewhat amusing. But it’s not a loss; without taking Bai Bufan along, just giving Yangliang the information, a task involving coordination with fellow disciples might not have been considered complete.\nGetting this result is good news; there’s no need for me to handle the last Hehuan Demon’s base either.\nAfter all, third time’s a charm.\nThinking of this, Lin Li took out his phone, first composing a file, and then sent a message to Yangliang.\n\"Lin Li: Uncle, are you busy?\"\n\"Yangliang: What time? What place?\"\n\"Yangliang: Are you the undercover agent this time or someone else? If it’s you, is it just you, or are you taking any other classmates? If yes, how many?\"\n\"Yangliang: I’m very busy today; I can’t go on the mission myself this time. I’ll ask colleagues from other areas to make the arrest; remember to keep a low profile.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nLooking at these seemingly auto-reply-like messages, Lin Li was a bit speechless.\nWhat kind of persona do I have in Yangliang’s mind now?\n\"Lin Li: Uncle... I’m not undercover this time; it’s a school day, I don’t have the time.\"\n\"Lin Li: ’Compressed file.’\n\"Lin Li: Uncle, I thought it through and agree with you that having info, I should report it truthfully. This is a map my friend gave me before; I decided to share it directly with you. You find a chance to visit and arrest, but call me if there’s anything you need.\"\nThe file Lin Li sent was the one Song Luping gave him, but a reduced version.\n—Lin Li kept back two chicken farms.\nThis isn’t because he plans to use them himself, but worries his judgment might be wrong. If the task requirement for coordination truly doesn’t stop at merely informing, even if the Demon Suppression Bureau successfully sweeps these places, the task might remain incomplete.\nThey can be activated as backup hidden reserves if needed, to ensure a safety net.\nIf the task is completed, then I’ll send these two as well.\n\"Yangliang: Kid, you’ve finally become more human.\"\n\"Yangliang retracted a message.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nI saw that message, hey!\n\"Yangliang: Kid, you finally became mature. Is this prepared by Song Luping?\"\n\"Lin Li: Uncle, you even know my friend’s name, and I didn’t tell you ’thumbs up’ ’thumbs up’.\n\"Yangliang: I’m quite familiar with him now.\"\n\"Yangliang: This map is pretty important to us, thanks to you, this year, the higher-ups won’t give us much of a target. But this will help for a bonus; providing this map should help me win a bit more for you.\"\n\"Lin Li: Thank you, Uncle. I don’t even know how to thank you enough.\"\n\"Yangliang: The best thanks is to ensure you steer clear from any more suspicious activities ’rose’\"\n\"Lin Li: \"Rose\"\n\"Yangliang: ?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Chapter 89 Do Not Get a Haircut at This Barbershop\nPromises carry significant weight and shouldn’t be made lightly.\nWith the system potentially malfunctioning at any moment, who knows if the next meeting will be at the Joyful Union Sect?\nThus, the \"rose\" is the best way to convey one’s feelings.\nUnfortunately, Yangliang seems unaware of my intentions, and when we said goodbye on WeChat, there was an air of resentment in the words.\nReally can’t do much about him.\n...\nAt night.\nAfter doing some research on the computer, Lin Li resolved some doubts on the photocopied materials. At this point, the translation of the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique was already halfway completed.\nThe speed was much faster than when translating the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique previously.\nApart from the content being considerably less than the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, the experience and knowledge gained from previous translations also provided significant benefits, greatly enhancing efficiency.\nWith a new cultivation technique, naturally, it should be learned.\nThe content at the beginning, which is the first step Lin Li wanted to practice with the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, is actually quite simple:\nTo control thunder, the body must be able to contain and wield it. The introduction explains how to use Spiritual Qi to transform one’s body into the Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body, enabling the absorption, transfer, and output of lightning.\nAs the transformation of the Thunder Body progresses, the efficiency of these steps also increases. Eventually, the efficiency will exceed 1—meaning that after a cycle of absorbed lightning within the body, its power upon output will be stronger than when absorbed, turning the Thunder Body into an amplifier.\nIf it were only an amplifier, this thunder technique wouldn’t be much of a technique. Once the Thunder Body’s transformation is complete, generating lightning naturally becomes a basic skill.\nWhen Yang Yongxin arrives, even he would have to respectfully call himself the Thunder King.\nElectric Shock Boy, quickly unleash your great Mars powers!\nThe creation of the Thunder Body requires Spiritual Qi. The unused spare low-grade Spirit Stone Lin Li redeemed on Sunday night now becomes useful.\nManifesting it, Lin Li began channeling Spiritual Qi within his body according to the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique’s instructions.\nToo many acupoints and terms are annotated in the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, and Lin Li couldn’t find these terms anywhere on modern networks, likely known only in the Cultivation Realm. Fortunately, it’s also an illustrated manual, allowing him to locate the positions based on the diagrams.\nThe Spiritual Qi section of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique had one of the most significant impacts on transforming his body: allowing the Spiritual Qi within him to be divided into two parts for usage.\nThis effect wasn’t so obvious when delving deeper into the Spiritual Qi sections, as the amount of Spiritual Qi needed increased, and the improved efficiency in utilizing Spiritual Qi was directly offset or even overshadowed.\nBut now, its benefits are vividly apparent.\nThis low-grade Spirit Stone feels so long-lasting now.\nTwenty minutes later, Lin Li opened his eyes, still wanting more, as the Spirit Stone in his hand had become an empty shell.\nBut its sacrifice was worthwhile.\nThe Spiritual Qi was already circulating according to the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique’s instructions, having traveled more than half a circle in his body. With just one more low-grade Spirit Stone, it should complete the full cycle, transforming his body into the most basic Thunder Body.\nThen let’s stay up late, wait until midnight.\nThe anticipation of the Thunder Body far outweighs the drowsiness, making it impossible to sleep even if he went to bed now.\nBut it’s only a bit past ten o’clock now.\nCan’t just wait idly for two hours.\nIn the past, Lin Li would have started watching short, entertaining videos.\nBut now, the rare occasion of bringing his backpack home served its purpose!\nStudy! I love studying! Studying loves me!\nTurning on the eye-protection lamp, Lin Li set out with the goal of making Wang Yuezhi his son.\n\"I can’t believe I’m doing such a thing,\" Lin Li couldn’t believe it himself.\nThis broken lamp was dusty, indicating how long it hadn’t been used.\nHowever, when Lin Li’s mom came home, she often saw Lin Li studying like this as a child.\nIt was only after she touched the TV or computer chassis and burned her fingers while cooling her earlobes that Lin Li knew his disguise had failed.\nLuckily, his mom rarely used a belt.\nA feather duster felt much better.\n...\n\"A green machine gun shooter and a blue ice shooter have offspring all being green machine gun shooters. Hmm, that means green and machine gun are dominant genes.\"\n\"When this machine gun shooter self-mates, the offspring will have four kinds, with all dominant and recessive genes making an appearance. This question is basic. What is the flower language of peas? 9331!\"\n\"Speaking of, what position is self-mating?\"\n\"Damn, how did your pea family suddenly start messing around with this question? So shameless! Can you raise your moral standards a bit?\"\n\"Damn you, Mendel, you used Church funds to till Church land, and then with your damn basket of peas, you toppled the Church! And Morgan, you and your cursed white-eyed fruit flies aren’t any good either!\"\nSince Lin Li was home alone, he could express his thoughts freely while studying.\nAlthough he was complaining, Lin Li believed biology is the kindest subject in the sciences and the best in his science grades.\nInitially, if the system hadn’t been activated, Lin Li would have likely chosen biology, geography, and technology out of the seven.\nBut with the foundational memory enhancement and Strong Recognition, Lin Li’s choices might lean more towards the arts now, but since it’s not finalized until the end of the term, there’s no rush.\n\"Ding-ling-ling—ding-ling-ling—\"\nThe alarm clock rang, signaling midnight had arrived.\n\"Yay! Only four more hours until I can play Genshin Impact daily!\"\nKidding, Lin Li doesn’t play Genshin Impact.\nHe immediately set down Mendel’s legacy and brought up the system to exchange today’s Spirit Stone.\nOnce again, it’s a mundane low-grade. The gambler still hasn’t achieved anything noteworthy.\n[570 (650)]\nSince being able to use Spirit Stones, the system currency section on his panel has shown a bracketed number indicating his total historical system currency obtained.\nPutting aside these distractions, Lin Li sat cross-legged again and began to absorb the Spiritual Qi from the Spirit Stone.\nMore than ten minutes passed.\nLin Li opened his eyes and exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.\nThere is still about half the Spiritual Qi left in the Spirit Stone in his hand, save it and put it in the warehouse first.\nThe Spiritual Qi has completed a circuit within his body according to the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, and the Thunder-Controlling Body is initially formed.\nLin Li took out his copy of the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique and looked at the content in the back.\nWith the Thunder-Controlling Body, one naturally begins to control thunder, but in the absence of the ability to generate thunder, the cultivation of the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique still requires external assistance.\nThe Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique indeed offered some advice on external aid, such as \"soaking in the Thunder Pool,\" \"going to Triple Thunder Heaven,\" \"searching for Thunder Seeds,\" \"consuming Purple Thunder Pills\"...\nIt’s extremely comprehensive, akin to a babysitter-level guide, the only problem is:\n\"Could you at least talk about something that’s actually possible?\"\n\"Why not just have Sister Cannon throw a coin at my forehead, wouldn’t that be more electrifying than the Thunder Pool?\"\nLin Li tossed the copy of the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique back onto the table.\nComplaints aside, he looked around.\nTo put it bluntly, thunder is just electricity, theoretically, in reality, it’s not only available but abundant, everywhere.\nFor instance, Lin Li’s gaze now rested on the power outlet beside him.\nIf you wash your hands but don’t dry them, and then stick them into the outlet while dancing a hand gesture, it should feel a bit painful.\nLin Li’s gaze then shifted to the charging cable of the desk lamp, which had a cracked rubber ring patched with several rounds of black tape to ensure safety.\nUnwrap those tapes, and if you put the copper wire in your mouth while knitting a sweater, it might taste a bit more numbing than Sichuan pepper.\nIf this power isn’t enough, you can often find sparrows chirping on the power pole, doing pull-ups on it should be quite fun too.\nLin Li thought that having such thoughts made him the bravest man in the world.\nMaybe in the future, he could put these ideas into practice.\nBut that must be in the future.\nLin Li thought he wouldn’t be able to handle it now.\nIf his corpse got charred black from being electrocuted, and when he went to heaven, God mistook him for a black man and sent him to pick cotton, what would he do?\nThe Thunder-Controlling Body is just starting, so as for the power of the thunder, he should start by trying gradually.\nWith the anti-electricity ability gained from his current Thunder-Controlling Body, he might not even rival the legendary electricity-resistant Wu Jing.\nWithout hesitation, Lin Li went straight to a shopping app to buy a few electric toys and then a basic model of a CNC power supply costing over six hundred, which can control current output from 0 to 220V.\nHowever, going to sleep now just waiting for delivery made Lin Li feel a bit unsatisfied.\nHe searched for other power sources at home.\nThe first thing Lin Li thought of was the \"Electric Little Devil Blood Crow Racket,\" which was placed right next to his desk.\nHe picked it up and examined it, noticing a warning that it was forbidden to touch, indicating that the internal power grid carried a voltage of 2100 volts.\nvolts sound more intimidating than 220 volts, but in reality, the actual threat lies with the current; the larger the current and the longer the time, the greater the harm.\nAfter checking information online, it showed that when the current reaches 10 mA AC or 50 mA DC, the human muscles spasm, the pain is noticeable, and if increased further, it will cause breathing difficulty and cardiac spasm, posing a life threat.\nMoreover, when the human body is not moist, there is some resistance, so touching this electric mosquito swatter may not be lethal, but it would definitely hurt immensely and could result in semi-permanent scars.\nSo it’s better not to try rashly.\nLin Li had painstakingly improved his charm and he didn’t want any blemishes due to such incidents.\nRemembering Bai Bufan’s reason for standing outside the physics class as punishment today, Lin Li decided to be that kind of foolish bubby who wears a sweater in summer, as Bai Bufan had said.\nOf course, just wearing sweaters is not enough.\nThe reason the physics teacher asked why taking off sweaters in summer doesn’t easily cause static electricity is that the air humidity is high in summer, which allows charges to be conducted away easily through water vapor in the air, avoiding accumulation, hence making static electricity rare.\n-- But a genius is always a genius, and Lin Li chose to run to the wardrobe with desiccants to rub his sweater.\nHe did manage to create a few crackling sparks, but they disappeared before he could even touch them.\nThe defeat of a genius.\nLin Li pondered.\n\"Wait a minute, how could I forget about that thing!\"\nLin Li tossed aside the sweater, climbed out of the wardrobe, and began searching at home.\nFinally, Lin Li smiled.\n--In his home tool cabinet, he found a few lighters.\nAnd Lin Li’s gaze was locked onto the piezoelectric igniter inside the lighter.\nWhen Lin Li was a kid, he played with this thing a lot.\nUsing it to zap people, and of course getting zapped as well--because it hurts a thousand enemies, harming eight hundred of oneself; if pressed by hand, you might also get shocked.\nIt’s essentially a ready-made electric toy.\nIn childhood, Lin Li even specifically searched the streets for discarded lighters, then smashed them to take out the igniter.\nHowever, violent destruction is inadvisable and dangerous. One time, the lighter even exploded when smashed, though he threw it far enough not to hurt himself.\nThis time, Lin Li chose a lighter with the least amount of butane, pried open the metal lid with a screwdriver, and twisted the plastic parts until they fell off.\nThis way, the piezoelectric igniter could be extracted very safely.\nWithout hesitation, since it wouldn’t cause substantial harm to the human body, Lin Li immediately aimed the wires at his skin and pressed down decisively.\n\"Click—\"\nIn the dim environment, he could even see a brief spark of electricity.",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Chapter 90: Cultivation Monetization, I Earn 2-3 Thousand in a Month!\nLin Li’s hand didn’t move at all, showing no reflex from the pain.\nNot only did it not hurt, but for a split second, it actually felt nice, like giving myself a massage. It’s a pity it was so fleeting, leaving a sense of wanting more.\nLin Li applied some water to the parts where he got shocked to reduce resistance, making the shocks feel even better, and then continued pressing.\nSure enough, it felt even better.\nWhen the snapping sound in the room stopped, Lin Li’s thumb was already indented.\nAfter electrifying himself, Lin Li started electrifying small objects around him.\nIt was fun.\nUnfortunately, the piezoelectric igniter could only ignite gas; it wasn’t realistic to use it to ignite dry wood chips.\nAfter all, he was no longer his childhood self. After a few minutes of playing, Lin Li rubbed his sore thumb and tossed the piezoelectric igniter back into the toolbox.\nEnough playing, time to sleep.\nLin Li stood up to leave.\nThen he stopped.\nWhat did I come here for again?\nAfter thinking for three seconds, Lin Li suddenly laughed relievedly.\nDamn it, I wasn’t here to reminisce about childhood; I got so caught up in getting shocked I forgot to operate the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to absorb the electricity.\n—With only a small mastery of the Thunder Body, I still can’t absorb passively.\nRemembering the main task, Lin Li first absorbed some Spiritual Qi from a Spirit Stone, then made it circulate in his body along the meridians of the Thunder Body, before pressing the igniter against himself again.\nAn indistinct current circulated quickly throughout his body the instant he heard the crackling sound, then vanished, feeling different from just being shocked.\nBut the amount was too little to ’form’ inside his body.\nSo Lin Li shocked himself a few more times, and finally faintly felt that there was something more within his body that he could control.\n\"So is this considered absorbed and stored well?\"\nTo test it, Lin Li tore a tiny piece of paper, placed it on the table, and pointed his index finger at it to release the stored current inside his body according to the Thunder Control Technique method.\n\"Pop—\" A weak explosion of charge.\nThe paper didn’t even move.\nIf it weren’t for that little explosion sound, there would be no telling Lin Li had discharged.\nAnd that was from less than five millimeters between Lin Li’s finger and the paper—a greater distance wouldn’t carry any charge.\nThis effect was actually much weaker than directly using an electric shock device.\nYet Lin Li was delighted.\nAt this moment, he wanted to (scream) (twist) (crawl in darkness) (squirm).\nBecause at this moment, Lin Li had finally achieved something humans cannot.\nThis small step for Lin Li was a giant leap for Lin Li!\nHis efforts had meaning.\n\"Thanks, butt!\"\nLin Li made his acceptance speech.\nBecause Lin Li always remembered one thing: in any difficult situation, his butt was always there silently supporting him from behind. Without his butt, he wouldn’t have lasted to this day.\nThe weak power was just because his cultivation wasn’t advanced enough; he barely absorbed any electricity, and the newly formed Thunder Body still had losses during release, so having any power was a miracle.\nOnce the Thunder Body greatly develops in the future, generating and amplifying electricity can become possible, and then Lin Li will challenge this paper piece again!\nMoreover, if he uses his ’Kirin Arm’ in a [power storage] state to release the current, he could add extra doubling to the power.\nSo, although the current result is disappointing, the future is promising!\n[Peering into the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, the method has initially taken shape. To advance further, secluded development won’t work; practical sparring is indispensable. It’s not undesirable to spar with friends and to slay demons with enemies.]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Four: Spar with ten fellow practitioners using the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, and use it to slay at least ten demons.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Qingzheng Thunder-Controlling Body effect increased by 50%; Ley Seed*1; System Currency*50]\nJust as Lin Li thought of it, the system suddenly popped up a mission notification.\nAfter reading the task description, Lin Li scratched his head.\nSlaying ten demons with the Thunder Technique seems easy; zapping some mosquitoes will do, although the system specifically demands it to be the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, so using an electric mosquito swatter doesn’t count, but it’s still simple.\nAll I have to do is drop the ’Blood Crow Assassin’ title, stretch my hand outside the window, and those blood crows will naturally stick to my skin, then I can shock them to death.\nWhat Lin Li finds more puzzling is the sparring portion with ten fellow practitioners—how to spar with each one? Zap them all?\nThough it would be fun, that seems not quite right, haha.\n\"I’ll think about the sparring tomorrow, for now, let’s focus on slaying demons.\"\n\"But relying on this piezoelectric igniter feels unrealistic, the current is a bit too small.\" Lin Li looked at the igniter in his hand, feeling it might be challenging.\nJust like with the paper, a mosquito likely wouldn’t be killed by a single zap.\nAnd it required pressing for a long time to release just a little bit.\nIt’s so small, it doesn’t satisfy Lin Li at all.\nSo Lin Li went online to look for information, researching how to make a long-lasting yet relatively safe current release device.\nThere indeed were some basic tutorials.\nSo Lin Li rummaged through his toolbox and found a pack that’s better than six units but without advertising fees, so no names mentioned batteries, using a very simple and brutal way, he tightly wound two copper wires around the poles of the batteries and connected them in series to increase voltage.\nA pack of twelve gave only eighteen volts, still within the safe range for human tolerance.\nThen Lin Li made sure his hands were thoroughly wet to further reduce resistance, allowing more current into his body.",

As expected, the prerequisite for comfort is still his ability to absorb.\nHis capacity was still too small it felt like it wasn’t even 100 milliamps.\nLin Li let go and went back to the desk to discharge at the piece of paper again, and with a noticeably clearer snap than before, the paper flipped over.\nAnd with some reserve in the body finally, Lin Li could control the force of the output — could output extremely high voltage in an instant, or output low voltage weak current for a long time.\nHowever, the effective attack range was still absurdly short.\nBut killing a mosquito shouldn’t be a problem.\nBefore killing mosquitoes, Lin Li excitedly dug out his old cellphone from home.\nHe plugged in the charging cable, but the plug was pressed against his index finger and thumb.\n\"...\"\n\"Knock knock.\"\n\"...\"\nIn just over ten seconds, the phone’s charging icon only lit up for a moment.\n\"I’ve really become a power bank,\" Lin Li looked at his hands with excitement and surprise.\nThe lack of response for the rest of the time was because he still couldn’t skillfully control the voltage and current, making it incompatible with the charger.\nWhen he can control it precisely, he will definitely be able to provide stable power.\nA human power bank, this is too convenient, indeed, cultivation is the primary productive force!\nThe future looks even more promising.\nBy then, if he stood on the street telling passersby \"one and a half bucks and I’ll fully charge your phone,\" wouldn’t he make a hundred or eighty bucks a day?\nCultivation monetization, wouldn’t that rake in two or three grand a month!\nThe world’s richest person is just ahead!\nDreaming can wait until later, now he should complete the task.\nSo, as Lin Li envisioned before, he removed the title, used [Charge], stretched out his right hand out of the window, waiting for willing prey to take the bait.\n[Using the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to slay at least ten demons (1/10)]\nWhen a mosquito that came to suck blood only absorbed electricity and fell from his arm, the system informed Lin Li that his plan was effective.\nUnfortunately, Lin Li was still not very skilled at controlling his thunder body. When the mosquito clung to the middle of his forearm, Lin Li couldn’t zap it in just the little area where it was, but rather had almost the entire forearm electrified.\nThis wasted a lot of electricity, causing Lin Li to charge back and recharge (physically).\nBeing a power bank was really troublesome at this stage, with small capacity and unstable output.\n...\n[Using the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to slay at least ten demons (9/10)]\n[Using the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to slay at least ten demons (10/10)]\n\"With this, the monster-slaying part of the task is complete, leaving only the discussion.\" After finishing, Lin Li thought of ways to complete the remaining half of the task as he recharged.\nAnd then gave up thinking about it now.\nDoing research and charging and discharging late at night, it was already 1:30 AM, and he still had to get up before 5 AM tomorrow...no, today, so time was really running out for him.\nIf he didn’t sleep now, he wouldn’t need to sleep at all.\nYawning, Lin Li, who had been keeping a regular schedule recently, was indeed tired, though his anticipation for the Thunder Technique had kept him up until now.\nLaying down on the bed, adjusting to a position that felt most comfortable: \"Good night.\"\n\"Buzz—— (Good night)\"\nAlready at the point of falling asleep immediately, Lin Li grumbled as he got up.\nDamn it, he forgot to close the window, and the Great Demon Heaven Blood Crow came again.\n...\nAlthough he went to bed late, he got up in the morning after all, and as for tiredness, it was unavoidable.\nAfter a quick wash, Lin Li went downstairs to prepare for practice.\nBecause today’s Spirit Stone quota was almost used up by the early morning, only a little under half was left, so he decided to only practice the odd-numbered Chapters this morning.\nWhen he saw Zhou Youwei, Lin Li glanced at him several times.\nThinking back, it was Xiaozhou who helped him accomplish the sparring task last time.\nSo could he also become a tenth for him this time?\nBut after thinking it over, Lin Li decided against it, as being an electric geezer was worse than staying up all night with the Battle Eagle playing chess.\nThe more crucial reason is that what is not fatal to many people could be deadly for those with bad hearts or who’ve had surgery with stents.\nLin Li was also aware of Xiaozhou’s physical condition; he seemed robust but was actually quite frail.\nWho knew if his heart or somewhere else had a stent? What if a zap made him fall apart?\nAnd considering previous fraudulent incidents, from every assessment, he was not a suitable sparring partner, even if he treated Lin Li well.\nBetter to save the electricity for electrifying Bai Bufan, he can handle it.\nThinking of this, Lin Li put his thoughts aside and focused on his practice.\nZhou Youwei felt a chill down his back and turned to glance at Lin Li.\nWhy did it feel like he had just walked through the gates of hell?\nWhat mischievous plan does this wicked brat have now?\n...\n\"According to folklore, Zhao Yun had a daring leap, and because Liu Bei held the remote, he vowed to follow Liu Bei to the death.\"\n\"I know this folklore; the cause of death was cholecystitis, right?\"\n\"What will I say tomorrow if you blurt this out?\"\nThis week, since Bai Bufan didn’t have his phone with him in the morning, the breakfast portions he brought reduced significantly.

Instead, he thought for a while before responding:\n\"Thunder? Didn’t we discuss this already? Personally, I prefer it petite or even non-existent. A grip-sized one is the best; big thunders aren’t for me.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWho was asking about that kind of thunder?\nBut the matter was too important, serious enough to need dispatching Ding Zhen to the Adhesion Union for discussion.\nSo much so that Lin Li had to clarify this issue first, putting the system task on hold.\n\"You really lack vision,\" Lin Li’s expression turned cold suddenly, \"Deep affection never stays, only big thunder wins people’s hearts. Unable to see your toes, that’s the ultimate beauty in the world!\"\n\"How can you rule the world without a broad chest?\" Bai Bufan wouldn’t back down on this point, questioning.\n\"How can you win people’s hearts without a full bust?\" Lin Li retorted.\n\"Dead wood! Ignorance! I have no common ground with someone who plays Blue!\" Bai Bufan shook his head in exasperation.\n\"Alright, let me ask you, do you peel off and eat dead skin when you lick someone’s foot? Is dead skin an extra surprise or a deducting factor?\" Lin Li began a mental attack.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nIs this Chinese, bro?\n\"Lin Li, do you even listen to yourself? Is what you’re saying Chinese? Jade feet have no dead skin! Those with dead skin aren’t jade feet! Why don’t you ask if I chew on fungal nails instead?\"\nThe attack was effective; Bai Bufan was infuriated, feeling his preferences were insulted!\n\"So do you chew on them or not—\"\n\"I’ll beat you to death!\"\n...\n\"I really need to cut back on my excesses, how come I’m losing to you more and more.\" Bai Bufan looked distressed.\nHe had just been subdued by Lin Li in no time.\nThis dude must be pulling a Nine Dragon Coffin move recently.\nBai Bufan wanted to pat Lin Li’s head, to see if it was pointy.\n\"Alright, I know you’re anxious, but hold on a moment; the thunder I meant was actually about thunder techniques in anime or reality, which do you think is the strongest?\" Lin Li finally got back on topic.\nLin Li’s question cleverly led to the topic of combat power, which is a timeless subject; a bunch of people love to compare blindly across worlds.\nTherefore, Bai Bufan immediately had something to say: \"I think Yang Five Thunder is pretty strong...\"\n...\nThey chatted for a while until the morning class began, and the system still showed (0/10).\nIt seems verbal sparring doesn’t count; the system described it as being fundamentally about martial arts discourse.\nToday, it seems Bai Bufan must endure this electric shock.\nSo Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan, looking for a chance to give him a shock.\nA direct shock won’t do, as he can’t attack from afar yet; being caught releasing it up close would be hard to explain.\nBut Bai Bufan gave him an opportunity; at this moment, his hand was on the support pillars on each side of the desk, which were made of sheetiron and connected with the entire desk’s support pieces.\nSo Lin Li pretended to pick something up from the ground but actually touched the desk’s supporting leg.\nElectric Shock Boy of Mars Grand Majors, strike!\n\"Hiss—\" Bai Bufan jerked his hand back sharply.\n[Use Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to spar and discuss with ten fellow cultivators (0/10)]\nLooking a bit troubled at the unchanged number on the system, Lin Li had to feign concern and ask Bai Bufan: \"Bufan, what’s wrong?\"\n\"Seems like there was static electricity from the chair just now, damn you Xiaoluo Hao, didn’t you say it’s hard to have static electricity in summer!\" Bai Bufan rubbed his fingers, with no suspicion of Lin Li.\nThough the task wasn’t completed, Lin Li suddenly felt amazing.\nFor what do people cultivate, apart from acting as a human power bank earning three thousand a month on the street, isn’t it just to shock Bai Bufan at the pier?\nHe deserves it!\nAll who don’t like big thunder go get shocked!\nSo Lin Li, with a puzzled face, reached out his hand, touched it, then more puzzled: \"There’s nothing.\"\n\"Probably the static disa... No wait, there’s still electricity!\" Bai Bufan explained himself, then absent-mindedly put his hand back, only to be shocked again, yanking his hand back and shouting.\n\"I don’t believe it, is this electricity only shocking me, is it targeting? I’m not Black, why discriminate against me?\"\nBai Bufan rubbed his head, then curiously and irritably placed his hand back once more, with the result being another shock.\n\"There’s indeed electricity, and continuously too; this is no longer static, could there be a circuit leak at the school? The electricity is traveling through the ground? Lin Li, let me touch your desk, strange, why no electricity?\"\nBai Bufan was utterly confused now.\nThen Bai Bufan abruptly grabbed Lin Li’s hand, opened it, found nothing, then grabbed Lin Li’s other hand.\n\"Turns out it’s not your doing?\" Bai Bufan scrutinized Lin Li suspiciously, even starting to search Lin Li’s shoes for electric devices.\nAll this shows how well he knew Lin Li.\nHowever, Lin Li didn’t have time to respond to Bai Bufan.\n[Use Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to spar and discuss with ten fellow cultivators (1/10)]\nProgress unexpectedly increased!\nThis actually made Lin Li feel a bit like Louis XVI, puzzled.\nThe progress added one when Bai Bufan got shocked the third time.\nDoes this mean getting shocked three times counts as sparring?\nDoesn’t seem right.\nThe last time he got knocked down with one move by Zhou Youwei, the task was completed smoothly.\nLin Li thought about it and felt he might have pinpointed the key issue.\nThe difference in the third instance was that Bai Bufan suspected a circuit leak by then, so he touched it knowing there was electricity.\nThe task description asked him to spar using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique.\nSo the system considered that when the other party knows there’s electricity and still attempts to withstand his thunder technique with their body, it’s like testing whose body is stronger against his thunder technique.\nIs this counted as sparring?",

      "content": "Chapter 99: Chapter 91: The Inventive Genius is Truly Bai Bufan\nIt can be concluded that the system’s determination for sparring doesn’t require the other party to know that the electricity is coming from oneself.\nAs long as the other party knowingly heads toward the mountain with electricity, it’s enough.\nTurns out it’s that simple to call it sparring, just like last time’s fake match was also acknowledged, same principle.\nSystem, you’ve done well, the most anthropomorphic one yet.\nThe thought process for completing the task quickly appeared in Lin Li’s mind.\nAll I need to do is bring an electric toy.\nWhen the time comes, all I need to do is remove the battery, then openly tell everyone that I have this electric toy in my hand, and they’ll ’know’ there’s electricity here.\nAs long as the other party touches it, and I release electricity, it’s considered sparring, and I can complete the task.\nIt’s a pity I don’t have... wait, no, I really do have something with me.\nLin Li took out a piezoelectric igniter from his pants pocket.\n\"So it was you, the culprit of this CS prank!\" Bai Bufan, who had been secretly observing Lin Li while searching for the source of the desk’s electricity, jumped with excitement when he saw the object and rushed to snatch it.\nAnd then he got electrocuted.\n\"Alright, now it’s mine. Left zero, right fire, Lei Gong help me!\" After getting shocked a few times, Bai Bufan finally managed to snatch it and aimed at Lin Li’s neck.\nLin Li sneered contemptuously, opting to just grip his hand.\n\"Snap!\"\nBai Bufan started pondering life in confusion—why, even though the wires were on Lin Li’s face, was he the one getting shocked?\n...\nDuring recess.\n\"My dear friend, I am actually a disciple of the Thunder Technique. Dare you spar with me?\" As soon as morning self-study ended, Lin Li walked up to Zhou Baowei, igniter in hand, and said seriously.\nBai Bufan, who was ready to watch the show, was stunned.\nDo you even know how to play? Just zap him, why the formalities?\nZhou Baowei turned his head. Upon seeing what Lin Li was holding, he instantly retreated with his chair: \"You’re forthright for not ambushing, but let’s skip this, pal. I’m actually Burmese, so I’m immune to electricity.\"\n\"What a punny hell joke. Isn’t Burma a major electricity consumer? Come on, give it a shot. Getting shocked is quite fun.\" Lin Li smiled as he continued approaching.\n\"Really, no need, pal,\" Zhou Baowei, whose hands were now too nervous to approach Lin Li, explained, \"I already know if it’s fun or not. I’m an Apple user, and with their darn cables, I often get shocked.\"\nRolling over onto a charger line in bed, numb all night long, five bucks on electricity, three of which go into me. That’s the charm of an Apple cable, ensuring nothing goes to waste.\nLin Li pondered: \"Baowei, is that leaky data cable of yours still around? Lend it to me.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\n\"Alright, quit dodging. Let’s spar a bit and see if your physique or my Thunder Technique is mightier!\"\nUnable to retreat any further in his seat, Zhou Baowei found some respite when Lin Li firmly pressed a finger against his neck, a slight electric current flowing through.\n[Sparring with ten fellow cultivators using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique (2/10)]\nIt really worked, and the focus was on sparring, not debate.\n——Lin Li didn’t discuss big thunder or small thunder with Zhou Baowei, yet it was recorded in the data.\nThus, this task became even easier to complete.\n\"Eh, why does it just feel tingly? It’s quite comfortable. Lin Li, give it another go.\" Zhou Baowei stretched his once-tensed neck, saying in surprise.\nLin Li smiled subtly.\nJust now, there was no feeling because the igniter’s electrode was actually aimed at himself, while Zhou Baowei only felt the faint current Lin Li released.\nNow it’s time to get serious.\n\"Ah!!\"\n...\nHaving mastered the method, just go around electrocuting people one by one.\n[Sparring with ten fellow cultivators using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique (9/10)]\n[Sparring with ten fellow cultivators using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique (10/10)]\nBefore the first class, Lin Li finally completed the task, electrocuting all the guys he knew.\n[Task four completed.]\n[You have received rewards: Physical Improvement: Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body effect increased by 50%; Thunder Seed*1; System Currency*50]\n[Speed that terrifies! In just a single day, you vanquished multiple fiends with Thunder Technique and sparred with many fellow cultivators. Why not apply these strengths, delve into the mysteries of Thunder Technique, and achieve Thunder Body to vanquish more fiends?]\n[Timed task triggered!]\n[Task One: Within twelve hours, spar with a hundred fellow cultivators using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique and vanquish at least a hundred fiends with it.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body effect increased by 50%; Title: Thunder Caller; System Currency*100]\n[Thunder Caller: With this title, increase the wearer’s insight and perception towards lightning-related things or people, becoming more acute.\nAt the same time, nearby moveable lightning-related things or people will start gravitating toward you subconsciously, developing a slight sense of closeness, with this effect growing stronger over time, reaching its peak after three days of wearing.]\nWhat a moving lightning rod.\nA lightning rod prioritizes channeling lightning onto itself before conducting the current from inside the rod to the ground through grounding wires.\nCall it a lightning rod, but it’s really an attraction device, similar to my title’s effect.\nGetting this title after rainstorms won’t be worn else you’ll get strikes that leave you with black and blue marks.\nBut wearing this in the Cultivation Realm possibly equals an acquired lightning attribute body.\nLike beating the Blood Crow before, the limited-time task stems from fast completion, yet this task isn’t easy.\nKilling a hundred fiends is simple, just keep squashing mosquitoes.\nBut sparring with a hundred people.\nLet’s not even mention the embarrassment of zapping girls or the somewhat unfamiliar Wang Yuezhi; even if they all got zapped, Lin Li doesn’t even know a hundred people at school.\nCan’t just indiscriminately zap people in the hallway with the igniter, writing a reflection is minor, getting sent to a mental hospital is major.\nHowever, seeing (0/100), Lin Li still had something to do.\nHe glanced at Bai Bufan: \"Bufan, I’ve cultivated Peach Blossom Eyes. Come, have a staring contest with me, I guarantee you’ll feel electrified.\"\nBai Bufan looked at the igniter that Lin Li blatantly brought out and moved closer: \"?\"\nWho the heck calls physical electric shocks \"Peach Blossom Eyes\"!?\n\"No-no... ah!!!\"\n[Sparring with a hundred fellow cultivators using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique (1/100)]\nWhew—thankfully, the previous zaps still count.\n...\n\"Lin Li.\" Bai Bufan suddenly poked Lin Li’s arm.\n\"What’s up?\"\nThis time Lin Li responded to Bai Bufan.\nNow in General Technology class, currently explaining orthographic views, which are quite simple, anyone with decent spatial imagination won’t make mistakes, so Lin Li needn’t listen as intently as before when completing tasks, and class is about to end.\nLin Li was also pondering how to achieve the hundred-man task.\n[Sparring with a hundred fellow cultivators using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique (13/100)]\nAfter electrocuting everyone he knew, the count reached 13.\n\"Do you know how to spell the word for chest?\"\n\"Chest.\" Having already memorized the C starting words, Lin Li instantly replied.\n\"Ah? There’s such a word?\" Bai Bufan scratched his head, baffled.\n\"You mean boob?\" Lin Li asked.\nThis one’s on me.\nThe English words Bai Bufan remembers aren’t exactly the noblest.\nBai Bufan is multilingual, but if it’s non-vulgar, non-swearing words, he’s at a loss.\n\"Exactly, I finally figured out where this word came from.\" Bai Bufan seriously looked at Lin Li, emphasizing each word.\n\"Go on.\" Lin Li knew whatever Bai Bufan would say next would probably be nonsense, but he was curious anyway.\nAs Red Stone King should be aware.\n\"It’s inspiration from this class,\" Bai Bufan nodded, then showed his textbook to Lin Li, where one could see ’Boob’ written.\n\"Lin Li, don’t you see? This word is the orthographic views of what it represents!\"\n\"This B is the top view of the chest, this oo is the front view, and this b is the left view! All three views complete, the person who invented this word is a genius!\" Bai Bufan exclaimed excitedly.\nLin Li: \"...\"",

the wind is too strong on the rooftop that students can’t handle it.\nAlso, practically no one comes to the 6.5th floor—except for couples looking for a spot to make out.\nSomeone even discovered a used \"route map\" on the 6.5th floor of the Art Building, after all, although it’s a key high school, like any school, it’s a mixed bag with special admissions and connections; not everyone is a goody-two-shoes, and some good students become more extravagant once they let loose.\nLin Li came here alone, naturally with a purpose beyond these trivialities, his gaze fixed on the stair railing all the way.\nIron, and perfectly connecting all floors.\nIf he sends a charge from any point, the current can be transmitted to all stair railings on six floors.\nThis is the key to his competition with strangers.\nWhen the march plays again, signaling all classes to exit, Lin Li starts warming up, ready to generate electricity.\nSoon, Lin Li can see through the window students who’ve reached the teaching building, some were ahead of the line and already in the building.\nFaint chatter and footsteps gradually reached from downstairs.\nIt’s time, not hesitating any longer, Lin Li’s right hand touched the railing, first charging, then releasing electricity.\nThen he watched the system, silently waiting and praying.\nFirst floor seems to have become more noisy, though still couldn’t hear what they were saying.\nFive seconds, ten seconds, twenty seconds, nothing happened.\nBut just as Lin Li was getting a bit disappointed, the next moment:\n[Using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to spar with fellow cultivators (14/100)]\nSuccess!\nLin Li smiled, and before his smile faded, notifications popped up repeatedly, the number instantly jumped to 17.\nAs expected, as long as the electric shock is weak enough, not even painful, just a bit numbing, many people would react like Wang Ze or Bai Bufan, knowing there’s a shock and still touching it again.\nLin Li could now imagine the scene on the first floor.\nClassmate A: \"Damn, the railing seems electrified, feels tingly!\"\nClassmate B: \"Really?—Wow, it really is electrified!\"\nClassmate A: \"But it feels fun, let me touch it again.\"\nClassmate C: \"Really? Let me try too...\"\nOnce this scenario occurs, even those girls or less mischievous boys would be intrigued and touch it.\nIt’s herd mentality.\nThis was the fundamental reason for the wild jump in numbers now.\nPerhaps in the system’s eyes, Lin Li’s current actions were like using his thunder technique to set up an array on the path, blocking the passing heroes, and upon discovering the array, some choose to avoid it—no longer touching the railing, while others face the array head-on.\nIn the system’s eyes, the latter counts as sparring, comparing strength.\nExchanging insights without meeting!\nA covert contest between experts!\n[Using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to spar with fellow cultivators (47/100)]\nThe numbers were jumping very fast, which reassured Lin Li a bit—trying to maintain the electrical energy transfer from the sixth floor to the first floor was a significant consumption for Lin Li, even though iron had strong conductivity.\nIf it weren’t for the 50% boost from the Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body, and his ability to save half the ’electricity’ with his right hand using [Charge], Lin Li would have run out of power long ago.\nIf any quick-moving students on the sixth floor were around, they might still hear the frantic ’click’ sounds coming from upstairs—because Lin Li was discharging with his right hand while using a piezoelectric igniter with his left hand to recharge himself as much as possible.\nAlthough it charged very little, even a small devil’s blood crow meat is still meat.\nIf only he’d brought his battery pack, he wouldn’t have to suffer so much.\n[Using Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique to spar and discuss with a hundred fellow Daoists (96/100)]\nJust as Lin Li was at the end of his tether, the number stopped at 96.\nLin Li’s left hand was already red from pressing, and with students from the sixth floor gradually returning, someone might irrationally attempt to come to the 6.5th floor.\nAt that point, although they wouldn’t think the electricity was his doing, they’d definitely think he was insane.\nIt’s time to go back.\nThis afternoon, I’ll go to Zhou Baowei’s dorm to borrow his leaky charging cable—he’s definitely carrying it with him on this week’s autumn excursion.\nThe remaining four numbers will be easy to deal with; there are more fellow Daoists in my class not yet ’sparred’ with than that number. If need be, I’ll go home at noon to get the battery pack, and during dinner, as everyone goes up and down the stairs, it can easily be completed for a second time.\nWhen Lin Li returned to the second floor, he saw a group of people surrounding the physics teacher, Luo Hao.\n\"So, this electrical phenomenon should be as I just explained. Before the school identifies the problem node, you should remain cautious, as the electrical current will gradually increase over time.\" Luo Hao analyzed calmly.\n\"I see, the teacher is amazing.\"\nLin Li scratched his head, curious about the scientific method Luo Hao used to explain the phenomenon just now.\n\"Teacher, the electricity seems to be gone now.\" Lin Li said.\nLuo Hao paused, touched the handrail, then beamed: \"Look at the efficiency of our school, they’ve found and solved the problem so quickly! You’ve chosen the right place by coming to Nansang!\"\n\"I see, the school is amazing.\" The surrounding students continued to go along with the applause quite diligently.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWhat the hell, will this actually work?\n...\n\"Class President, can I shock you a little?\"\nIn Bai Bufan’s dorm, after recharging himself using Zhou Baowei’s charging cable, Lin Li returned to the classroom and saw Chen Yu Ying, then sincerely asked while holding the piezoelectric igniter.\n\"You shocking me a little is indeed not okay.\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head after a second of thought.\nDarn.\nThe class president is indeed not as easy as Bai Bufan, simple language tricks can’t defeat her.\n\"So this is what you guys have been playing today, I was wondering why you kept calling incessantly.\" Chen Yu Ying reached out, and Lin Li handed the igniter to her willingly as she examined it.\n\"I need to clarify on their behalf, this has nothing to do with it. They normally call incessantly anyway.\" Lin Li explained.\n\"Does it hurt to be shocked by this?\" Chen Yu Ying asked curiously.\n\"If you shock yourself, it would hurt, but if I shock you, it would just tingle.\" Lin Li assured confidently.\n\"Really?\"\n\"Why not try it, Class President? You know me, I can fool anyone but not you.\" Seeing Chen Yu Ying’s genuine interest, Lin Li coaxed her.\n\"Then go ahead and shock me, but if it hurts, I’ll get mad.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded after pondering, placing her fair arm on Lin Li’s desk as if ready to receive a shot.\n\"Only shocking the neck can ensure a pleasant tingling.\" Lin Li added.\nMainly because he couldn’t twist the wire with Chen Yu Ying watching; if the wire went directly to the arm, pressing it would indeed sting.\nChen Yu Ying suspiciously watched Lin Li for a moment before turning around, brushing aside her shiny dark hair as if it were 0.5mm lead pencil graphite, revealing her porcelain-white skin.\nLin Li stood up.\nHis peripheral vision caught Wang Yuezhi biting his finger in pain.\nHeh heh.\n\"Click.\"\nThe igniter’s wire connected to his body, Lin Li’s fingertip gently brushed against the girl’s neck, and Chen Yu Ying tightened her shoulders.\n\"It really is~\" she marveled in surprise.\nIt really was just a tingly feeling.\n\"Would I ever deceive you?\" Lin Li chuckled lightly.\nHe didn’t look at the system.\nBecause the task for 100 people was already accomplished in the morning, by transmitting electricity via handrails from other class corridors.\nWhat Lin Li just did was solely because he wanted to shock Chen Yu Ying.\nIt was that simple.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, do you want to try too?\" Lin Li asked the gritting Wang Yuezhi.\nThe three of them spending longer lunchtime together, Lin Li felt there was already a bond among them.\n\"No way I’m agreeing!\" Wang Yuezhi couldn’t possibly acquiesce.\n\"Then, Class President, shall we continue shocking? I’ll make you feel even better.\"\n\"How could you, Lin Li! Shock me, Lin Li, discharge all your energy onto me!\" Wang Yuezhi abruptly changed his tune.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nWhy are these two saying such wild things?\nBut when she saw Wang Yuezhi scream, hair standing up after a click, Chen Yu Ying became even more surprised and perplexed, and she asked as Lin Li returned:\n\"Why does it seem like Wang Yuezhi isn’t... tingling?\"\n\"Numb, why wouldn’t he be numb? Isn’t he very numb right now?\" Lin Li pointed at the still trembling Wang Yuezhi and asked, puzzled.\nWhat more ’numb’ could you want? A bit more, and he’d be foaming at the mouth, causing trouble.\n\"This ’numb’ doesn’t seem quite right...\" Chen Yu Ying blinked.\n\"Why wouldn’t it be right? It just is.\"\nIn fact, Lin Li had just dumped most of the accumulated electric charge into Wang Yuezhi’s body, but he thought this explanation was a bit too flimsy, so he came up with a new justification:\n\"Everyone’s physique is different, that’s quite normal.\"\nChen Yu Ying: (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧ (I see)\nLin Li: (＾－＾)V (Exactly, exactly)\nWang Yuezhi: ┏┛墓┗┓ (Dead)\nThis was the bond between the three, indispensable.",

      "content": "Chapter 101: Chapter 93: Misunderstanding Finally Resolved, Truth Revealed!\n\"I didn’t expect Wang Yuezhi to be so afraid of electricity, do you think he’ll be okay?\" asked Chen Yu Ying, her mind filled with concern for the world as she looked at the still unresponsive Wang Yuezhi.\n\"Don’t worry, he’s fine.\" Lin Li had controlled the strength just right, enough to daze without harming his brain. \"Class leader, if you don’t believe me, watch me perform some magic for you.\"\nLin Li moved next to Wang Yuezhi, gently stroked him, and shouted powerfully, \"Pain, pain, fly away!\"\nChildren’s books don’t lie; indeed, under this incantation, Wang Yuezhi’s pain seemed to fly away, making him jerk and sit up.\nActually, the unlucky kid was shocked again, clutching his neck while staring warily and confusedly at the ’powerful’ lighter in Lin Li’s hand.\nHow does this thing control the strength of the electric shock?\nIsn’t its maximum power just like being pricked by a needle?\nWasn’t Chen Yu Ying just tingling? Why did it make me jump?\nIs it really a matter of physical constitution?\nMany questions floated in Wang Yuezhi’s mind, even causing him to doubt himself.\nAfter all, with short sleeves, everyone could see that Lin Li only had this in his hand, nothing else. Who would have thought Lin Li’s hand was discharging electricity?\n\"So, Lin Li, what’s your constitution like?\" After Lin Li returned to his seat, Chen Yu Ying curiously asked.\n\"Class leader, do you want to shock me? You can just say so.\" Lin Li spread his hands, speaking somewhat innocently.\n\"Oh, I want to shock you,\" Chen Yu Ying stated sincerely, staring into Lin Li’s eyes.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHow did the class leader come to be just like me in mischief?\nShe didn’t learn any of my many virtues but mastered this sincere knockout move instead.\nBut what can you do? Let her shock you then.\n\"After shocking me, remember to say the pain flew away, thank you.\"\n...\nAfter school.\nLin Li rode his bike home, picked up his battery pack, and returned to the familiar shrubs.\nIt’s time for the thrilling electric shock experiments with the Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow.\nIf he did it at his window at home, like last night, it would take at least until two or three in the morning to finish electrocuting a hundred of them, which is too long.\nHowever, this time, although Lin Li was concerned for the Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow, he was very cautious, keeping a constant watch on his surroundings.\nAs the saying goes, the key to the problem is to find the critical issue.\nAnd sure enough!\nThat mother and son pair who like to stroll around at this time soon appeared at the end of the road.\nSo Lin Li faced them with a kind and gentle smile.\nA saint will not stumble in the same place twice.\nBefore, the situation didn’t allow, but this time, Lin Li must explain that he isn’t an idiot.\nHe’s a human being!\n\"Mom, it’s that silly big brother!\" The little boy shouted as soon as he saw Lin Li, illuminated by the streetlights.\nKids say the darndest things, and Lin Li doesn’t hold grudges.\nHe might even repay enmity with kindness; when he succeeds in cultivation, women and children will be the first to fly.\nWhen the mother saw Lin Li, she was initially stunned. She hadn’t seen this kid since last time and thought he had been taken in by his family.\nBut now, as she noticed Lin Li smiling at her, visible fear appeared on her face.\n—Who wouldn’t be scared seeing a stranger smiling at them in the bushes at night?\n\"Xiaobao, let’s go!\" The mother didn’t even let the kid walk, picking him up and turning back the way they came.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li immediately chased after them because he knew that if he didn’t catch up and explain, the community might start spreading a bizarre tale—an idiot smiling in the bushes at midnight.\n\"Auntie, I’m not crazy, let me explain, I’ve actually been conducting scientific experiments these past few times!\" Lin Li knew he must simultaneously chase and explain; merely pursuing without explanation wouldn’t do.\nUnfortunately, even though he spoke up, it didn’t seem to have the desired effect:\nThe woman looked back to see a freak running, holding a rattling string of batteries.\n—Despite his logical explanation, she only ran faster.\nThe kid was already scared to tears.\nHowever, holding the child, she was no match for Lin Li at this stage; seeing he was about to catch up.\nThe hero arrived!\n\"Lin Li, what are you doing?\" Zhou Youwei squinted, looking at the duo running toward his building and asked, frowning.\nSeeing Xiaozhou, Lin Li sighed with relief and gave up the chase:\n\"Grandpa Zhou, this aunt mistook me for an idiot, I wanted to explain to her, but she got too scared. Since you both live in the same building, help me explain to her, would you? I still have my research to continue, goodbye, auntie, goodbye Grandpa Zhou, and goodbye little brother.\"\nAfter a polite explanation, Lin Li waved to the child in the woman’s arms and slowly walked away.\nXiaozhou knew very well what a good kid Lin Li was, and with him there, the misunderstanding between him and the mother and child would surely be resolved entirely, leaving nothing for Lin Li to worry about.\nHe could let go of the burden and go back to electrocuting mosquitoes.\n\"Elder Zhou? Does this kid...not actually have any mental problems?\" Looking at Lin Li departing, the woman indeed began to doubt her judgment.\nAfter all, Lin Li’s polite speech didn’t match her image of an idiot madman.\nHad she really misunderstood?\n\"He has problems? Impossible, his brain is sharp!\" Zhou Youwei stared at the already darkened figure of Lin Li, snorted coldly, and said.\n\"Ah! It seems I made a mistake, jumping to conclusions. I’ll catch up and apologize to him with Xiaobao.\" The woman, upon hearing this, thought the cold snort was because of her misunderstanding Lin Li, and she immediately felt a bit guilty and awkward, wanting to go apologize.\n\"If you don’t want bad luck, don’t.\" Zhou Youwei stopped her.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"That kid, he’s the most evil and insidious child in our community! Although I don’t know why you think he’s an idiot, I’m afraid it’s all part of his scheming, you’ve been trapped in his ploy the whole time.\" Zhou Youwei sighed deeply, \"Luckily, I was around tonight, luckily, from now on, it seems it’s better not to go to bed early, I should patrol the neighborhood.\"\nWoman: \"?\"\nShe stepped back with her child in her arms and quietly covered the child’s ears.\nMaster Zhou wasn’t quite right either.\n...\n[With Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, slay at least a hundred demons (97/100)]\nLin Li squatted on the ground, happily electrocuting termites.\nAfter electrocuting mosquitoes for two minutes, Lin Li suddenly realized he had entered into a thought trap.\nWhy was he limiting demons to just mosquitoes?\nThe system never said he could only slay the Little Demon Heaven Blood Crow.\nWith how the system behaves, other harmful insects or animals should also be considered demons, right?\nIn fact, that was indeed the case.\nLin Li had electrocuted ordinary ants, but the counter hadn’t increased.\nBut when he found a termite nest, seemingly recently appeared, and started electrocuting, the task progress immediately changed.\nTermites are also demons.\nThough he didn’t know what they’re called.\nBut electrocuting these crispy chicken-flavored termites packed with six times the protein of beef was much better than dealing with those elusive annoying mosquitoes.\n[With Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, slay at least a hundred demons (100/100)]\n[Task Four Completed.]\n[You have received the reward: Physical Improvement: Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body Effect +50%; Title: Thunder Summoner; System Currency * 100]\nAfter electrocuting three more termites, the task was finally completed.\nLin Li stood up, a bit tired from squatting for over twenty minutes, and stretched.\nHe didn’t rush home; instead, he went to the neighborhood washbasin, filled an entire bucket of water, and came back to pour it down the hole of the termite nest.\nFlooding an ant nest might be excessive, but flooding a termite nest is a good thing for the entire community.\nThese creatures are especially destructive to buildings, particularly in old neighborhoods like Lin Li’s.\nLin Li only regretted not having molten aluminum to pour into the nest, which would have been his fourth stress-relief video hobby after restoring old items, cleaning carpets, and fixing cow hooves.\nBut surely water should drown the queen termite.\nAfter doing all this, and returning the bucket, Lin Li walked home.\nAs he reached the bottom of his building.\n[The work is done, and the technique is practiced!

      "content": "Chapter 102: Chapter 94: This Lightning Attractor Feels Off\nWhat kind of heaven-defying task is this?\nTime reversal, Lin Li took a few steps back.\nHe looked at the notice board that had just triggered the task, where he had just passed by.\nThere was a bright yellow poster stuck on it:\n[Recruiting Delivery Knights!]\n[Work close to home, more freedom and pay!]\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHuh? Is it asking me to become a food delivery guy?\nThis is second only to truck drivers on Douyin as a high-risk job; carelessly you’ll end up ’We’re all living on the edge~~’.\nAlso, system, how much did Meituan pay you? I’ll pay you double from Ele.me.\nWait a minute.\nThere really is an Ele.me ad.\nLin Li had already noticed the Ele.me advertisement.\nIt wasn’t very conspicuous since its recruitment ad was pasted below Meituan’s.\nIt’s actually a business war!\nSo many empty spaces on the bulletin board, yet the Meituan ad intentionally covered Ele.me’s ad—such malicious intent!\n——High-level business wars indeed often proceed in unpretentious manners, while the ones in TV dramas are what ordinary people fantasize about with golden hoes.\nLin Li seriously suspected that if he had entered the building from the side with the Ele.me ad, the task activated by the system would have been with the Ele.me Escort Sect?\nSpeaking of which, isn’t a courier more like an escort than a delivery guy?\nCan’t understand, but I respect it, because since the task has been issued, it won’t be changed. For now, the urgent thing is to think carefully about how to complete it properly.\n...\nLin Li returned home, fiddled with his phone for a while, then tossed it aside, looking up at the ceiling helplessly: \"I can’t register.\"\nLin Li encountered a very severe issue.\nAlthough the law stipulates that you can be hired to work at sixteen, most platforms, to avoid any potential risks, even for the lowest requirement crowdsourcing, have strictly set the age limit to 18 and above.\nAt 17, registration is impossible.\nLin Li couldn’t enter the Meituan Escort Sect at all now.\nHe still has almost two months until adulthood, should this task be delayed until then?\nLin Li looked at the task, frowning slightly.\n[Task Four: Perfectly complete thirty sect tasks issued by Meituan Escort Sect.]\n\"No, it seems there’s no requirement for me to personally join Meituan Escort Sect, just to perfectly complete thirty tasks issued by Meituan,\" Lin Li mumbled to himself, \"Could I just use someone else’s account to deliver orders? As for ’perfectly complete’, does it mean getting five-star reviews?\"\nThis is somewhat feasible to a certain extent.\nBut it’s not as simple as asking his mom to register a rider account for him just to experience the hardship of earning money, Lin Li searched and found that when a rider logs in to accept orders, facial recognition is required.\nAdditionally, during the order-taking process, random recognition might be needed.\nThis means if he runs orders using someone else’s registered account, the person must be nearby so he can come over when recognition is necessary.\nTruly registering with his mom’s information would have to wait until she’s at home.\nLin Li now considered that the positions offered by the Meituan Escort Sect aren’t limited to delivery couriers.\nCouldn’t he be a customer service rep, handle customer queries, and also consider that task completion?\nWait a minute.\nThere’s also a public review group in Meituan, isn’t there? Responsible for deciding if negative reviews are customers being unreasonable or if it’s the merchant’s fault, ultimately deciding whether to display them.\nDoes this count as a sect task?\nUpon thinking this, Lin Li immediately opened the review panel.\n「User Review: \"One Star\" Clearly ordered warm, but it’s scalding hot.」\n「Merchant Evidence: Still able to type, proves you’re alive, you’re lying, applying to block.」\nLin Li: \"...\"\nNot allowed to block.\n「User Review: \"One Star\" No meat in minced meat eggplant \"Picture\"」\n「Merchant Evidence: We are precooked dishes, second on the ingredient list is meat \"Picture\" applying to block.」\nAlthough you’re honest, not allowed to block.\n「User Review: \"One Star\" Didn’t read the notes.」\n「Merchant Evidence: He ordered a combo meal for seven yuan eight, wants twenty packs of ketchup, ten packs of pickled veggies, five pairs of chopsticks.」\nYou know, I rarely side with the merchants, allowed to block!\nYou guys ordering combo meals are really something (shaking head).\n...\nAfter being a light soup judge for a few minutes, looking at the system, it cruelly responded with a (0/30).\nIt seems such entertaining activities do not count as tasks issued by the escort sect, unless Lin Li becomes a real internal reviewer making decisions about whether to display them.\nStill considering using someone else’s information to register or work part-time as a customer service agent as a completion direction.\nNo rush anyway, worst comes to worst I’ll wait until late October and finish it after I turn eighteen.\nLin Li looked at [Warehouse], which still held a [Lei Zi Capsule], and unlike other pills, it had no introduction.\nFortunately, he still had the [Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique], which he could use to find the section describing the [Lei Zi Capsule] after manifesting it.\n[Absorbs Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi, nourishes pure thunder, freely taken, and can also be set internally with an explosive array to be used as an attack Dao treasure.]\nFor the attack Dao treasure part, Lin Li ignored it as he didn’t understand arrays.\nA Spiritual Qi powered charging treasure?\nBut in the modern day without Spiritual Qi, is it a one-time use thing? Or does he have to ’charge’ it with Spiritual Qi himself? The latter is something Lin Li absolutely can’t afford, as he doesn’t even have enough for himself.\nManifest.\nA smooth brown spherical stone, flickering with electric arcs all around it.\nLin Li held it for a few seconds before putting it back into the [Warehouse]—even operating his own Thunder Body couldn’t withstand the electricity it discharged, and his palm throbbed with pain.\nThis point was noted in the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique; beginners need to weaken and control its electricity with an Array.\nThis kind of lightning, rich with Spiritual Qi, is something Lin Li cannot handle right now.\nBut the good news is, even if it’s a disposable power bank, it should be fully charged now.\nHe decided to consider absorbing it once his Thunder Body is more developed or when he finds a way to weaken the output.\nThen, Lin Li changed his title to [Thunder Attractor].\n\"Damn, electronic devices are all considered thunder-element items?\" At the moment of the change, Lin Li couldn’t help but exclaim.\nBecause now he could vaguely sense the presence of electronic devices around him, like he had turned on a radar.\nThe range of this perception isn’t far, only about two to three meters, and Lin Li can barely sense the electronics in his room.\nAnd the perception isn’t clear; he can’t precisely know where they are, only a vague direction and distance.\nLin Li tossed his phone onto the bed, then closed his eyes and spun around in place ten times, feeling dizzy and disoriented.\n\"This clearer one should be the computer; if the computer is this way, then the bed is over here, and this should be the phone.\"\nWith eyes closed, Lin Li murmured to himself, slowly adjusting his body to face the direction of the bed, and reached out to grab his phone.\n—Different electronic devices provide different perceptions.\n\"Wow! I’ve become someone with a strong magnetic field!\"\nHaving done all this, Lin Li opened his eyes, feeling somewhat elated.\nThis title is more useful than I imagined, even outshining the humorous [Blood Crow Assassin].\nLin Li continued experimenting with this title.\n...\nThe perception can be blocked by physical objects—walls, backpacks, clothes can all hinder his perception.\nThe perception distance is very short, without any obstacles about four to five meters radius—standing by the window, he can’t sense the ’signal’ from the power poles outside.\nElectrical devices have to be powered on to be perceived—after tripping the power switch at home, Lin Li can only sense items with built-in power sources like phones and batteries.\nThe strength of the perception depends on the ’thunder element’ content; the same object can have different perceptions—perhaps due to differences in power consumption between a computer on standby and one running games, the sensation might differ.\nAs for the [Embedded Thunderstone], his perception of it is as strikingly apparent as a 0 amidst a group of straight men, outshining the crowd.\nConsciously trying to perceive these things consumes his energy and mental power, which seems to be the main factor influencing the ability of this title—during the test, Lin Li noticeably felt mentally exhausted and all previously tested perceptions became worse than initially.\nMental power, or rather Divine Sense, fundamentally affects this ability’s effectiveness.\nRubbing his swollen head, Lin Li took a piezoelectric lighter out of his pocket.\nPressed it.\nThe enhanced insight made the electric arc that lasted only a moment appear much clearer in Lin Li’s eyes.\nAnd after pressing it several times, he noticed the arc that’s supposed to scatter randomly showed signs of twisting towards him.\nThe attraction can affect even lightning without consciousness.\nUnsure what the effect will be after wearing it for three days.\nLin Li first checked the weather forecast, confirming that the probability of thunderstorms tonight is zero—so that he doesn’t end up struck by a lightning bolt twisting its way through the window while asleep.\nHaving overused his brain tonight, Lin Li washed up and then went to sleep after confirming all this.\n...\nThursday, today’s the official start of the autumn outing.\n[Low-grade Spirit Stone*1]\nToday’s also a low-grade Spirit Stone, no surprises.\n\"Grandpa Zhou, you explained everything to Auntie last night, right?\" Lin Li mentioned this after running into Zhou Youwei on his way downstairs.\n\"Don’t worry, I’ve made sure she’s fully aware of your true colors, hehe.\" Zhou Youwei said with a sneer.\n\"Okay, then I’m at ease.\" Although the term ’true colors’ sounds a bit strange when applied to himself, it’s quite normal for Xiaozhou, who’s sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.\nLin Li threw himself into practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\nOnly practiced the odd-numbered Chapters.\nThe half Spirit Stone in the [Warehouse] won’t be used for now, saving it up.\nBecause Lin Li is hesitating whether to practice the thunder technique first or the Spiritual Qi Chapter of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\nThe former could provide substantial ’Immortal Technique’ growth, with a 100% enhancement after cultivating the Thunder Body, a promising future; while the latter could improve his efficiency in utilizing Spiritual Qi.\nIn the long run, the latter is undoubtedly the highest in cost-effectiveness.\nBut immediate benefits are sometimes hard to overlook.\nSo, he’s saving it in the [Warehouse], since he also needs some Spirit Stones to prepare for unforeseen needs.\nSigh, if only the gambling dog could win once and get a high-grade Spirit Stone for Spiritual Qi freedom, or if Yangliang could act faster to replenish five Spirit Stones, it wouldn’t be so perplexing.\n[Consistency: Wake up and diligently practice Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique before 5:00 AM for at least half an hour cumulatively before 7:00 AM for a month (6/30).]\nUnknowingly, a fifth has already been completed.\n...\nLin Li arrived at the classroom.\nEntering through the front door, he handed breakfast to Chen Yu Ying and instinctively looked up because he sensed someone brought electrical devices.\nHe looked at Yu Yu, who seemed to sense his gaze and looked back.\nLin Li slowly placed a question mark on the system.\nYu Yu, a girl in the class, is most notably known for her... size.\nWhy... could I sense thunder from Yu Yu?\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nDamn, could this [Thunder Attractor] be a concept-level title?",

      "content": "Chapter 103: Chapter 95: Invisibility Technique is Truly Amazing\nIf this [Attractor of Thunder] were a concept-level title, it would be a bit absurd.\nThings at the concept level are never weak; the phrase \"The River of Time is indeed a river\" once shook the young heart of Lin Li.\nCould the system have mistaken the big thunder I mentioned while discussing with Bai Bufan as actual thunder?\nThen how would this title’s attraction and affinity towards thunder-type individuals manifest?\nWell done, system.\nHowever, after pondering for a moment, Lin Li’s bubble of imagination burst.\nNot all the girls in the class are flat, but I don’t have any perception of them. At most, when I get close, I can barely sense the electronic watch on my wrist.\nSurely you can’t just terminate the thunder status for not being big enough, right?\nOh, Yu Yu probably has some sort of tiny electronic device, like an electronic watch, on her chest, right?\nAfter all, if something is indeed hidden in such a big thing, you wouldn’t really be able to see it.\nEven though Yu Yu doesn’t have any necklace string around her neck.\nWithout any conclusions, Lin Li retracted his gaze, knowing full well that if he continued to stare, he would be categorized as Bai Bufan.\nReturning to his seat, Lin Li, after confirming no teacher was around, took out his phone.\nUpon noticing this, Bai Bufan first sat up straight to block Lin Li from view as much as possible, then glanced over to see what Lin Li was doing.\nMinesweeper.\n?\nAre you kidding me? All this fuss just to take out your phone and play Minesweeper in class?\nIf you want to play Minesweeper, why not just play on the multimedia table at the podium?\n\"Are you sick?\" Bai Bufan said, exasperated, slumping back and losing interest in covering for Lin Li.\nSomeone playing on their phone and getting caught deserves it.\nLin Li also put away his phone.\nUnfortunately, further confirmation showed that the [Attractor of Thunder] is probably not an absolute concept-level title—because when playing Minesweeper, I couldn’t discern which cells were the mines.\nHaving some perception, Lin Li turned his head again, and sure enough, Yu Yu was rummaging through her belongings in the classroom cabinet.\nAnd once again, Yu Yu turned her head and made eye contact with Lin Li.\n\"Lin Li... is there something wrong?\" she initiated, gathering her courage as her character was always relatively introverted.\nCan I confirm your thunder?\nHow can you say such a thing?\n\"Nothing.\"\nLin Li shook his head and chose to remove the [Attractor of Thunder] title.\n...\nAfternoon.\nThe last class on Thursday is a math class, but it’s not scheduled on the timetable; it’s deliberately swapped by Xue Jian.\nAnd with almost seamless connection to the previous class, after consciously speeding up, the class content was covered with more than ten minutes still remaining.\n\"Alright, everyone come up and take your phones, first group come forward.\" After assigning holiday homework and passing down a test paper, Xue Jian took out the storage pouch.\nThe classroom was already entering the noisy phase of the Autumn outing.\n\"Our bus will depart at 5:40, so let’s set our meeting time at 5:30. Everyone manage your time, don’t delay the schedule for everyone because of one person. One minute per person, for a class of forty, that’s forty minutes.\"\nXue Jian took the opportunity to emphasize this.\nWe’re going to play in the downtown area, so starting tomorrow morning would indeed waste time. According to the plan, we will leave tonight and spend the night in the Pingjiang City District.\nBeing a key public school, we do have some resources, plus the large group offers bargaining power. This trip involves staying two nights away for the Autumn outing, including play activities, all for just 340.\nIt’s impeccable in terms of cost-effectiveness.\nClass 4 doesn’t really have any impoverished students, and this 340 isn’t a burden for any family in Class 4. In Chen Yu Ying’s efforts, virtually everyone is participating.\n\"Though it’s been stressed before, I still need to say it again, when playing outside, always pay attention to safety. During non-free activity times, if anyone wants to leave the main group, whether out of boredom or feeling unwell and wanting to rest, you must report to your dorm leader. I have to approve it first.\nAnyone found not adhering, whether or not something happens, will receive a disciplinary record once back at school...\"\nFor high school students with phones, safety is still relatively assured, but Xue Jian persistently emphasizes it.\nBecause should anything happen, even if unrelated to the school, it would have a significant impact.\nEveryone responded with laughter and chatter.\n\"Even during free activity time, when going out, someone must accompany you.\nHowever, I must emphasize here that freedom is limited. In places where you’re forbidden from entering, like massage parlors, foot massage shops, SPA centers, you must never enter. If found, it’s a major offense! A huge offense! No, direct expulsion!\"\nXue Jian stressed this point heavily.\nMost of the class was puzzled, as what Xue Jian seemed to emphasize all seemed to be the same thing, and his emphasis seemed inexplicable.\nWho would do such a thing?\nMeanwhile, Lin Li and Bai Bufan, in unison, gazed out the window, whistling.\n——After all, Xue Jian looked directly at the corner where they were sitting when he said that, leaving no subtlety.\nThis was outrageous, Lin Li complained inwardly.\nMaking it seem as though only he and Bai Bufan from the class would go to such places.\nClearly, Xue Jian, you have gone too.\nBesides, this concern really is unnecessary.\nLin Li’s respected mentor is merely Xiling’s patron of the red-light district, still having no knowledge of Pingjiang’s brothels, even if I wanted to go, there’s no way.\n\"Alright, there’s no need for the last self-study class, you can all go back to your dorms to pack or go eat.\" Having emphasized a few more points, once the phones were distributed, Xue Jian waved them off.\nThe classroom crowd dispersed in a clamor.\nLin Li also needed to go home to change clothes—Nansang didn’t require wearing school uniforms for the autumn outing.\nWearing those tacky school uniforms for a trip would indeed be pretty silly.\n...\nAfter having dinner outside and changing into his own clothes, Lin Li rode his bike back to school.\nA few buses were already parked at the school gate, and groups of students were gathering around.\nAfter all, several classes had chosen a route plan similar to Chen Yu Ying’s.\nLin Li found the crowd of his own class.\nBecause it was still early after class, just past five, the bus drivers probably hadn’t arrived yet; the bus doors behind were still closed.\nThe buses were quite tall. At first glance, Lin Li thought they were the 50-60 capacity buses, but upon getting closer, he found out it was just 45 seats.\nInside was a rare 3+2 seating arrangement, with a spacious interior, and it seemed like there was a luggage area below too, so luggage could be stored there instead of being squeezed next to the seats.\nPretty luxurious, definitely more comfortable than a regular bus.\nLin Li would rate this bus 88, which is a full score, after all, the remaining 12 points are in the hands of the traffic police.\nOnce again, Lin Li marveled at the incredible cost-effectiveness of the 340-dollar trip.\nLin Li, as agreed, handed his backpack directly to Zhang Haoyang—it contained the gaming console he had promised earlier, anyway, Lin Li wasn’t planning to play games.\nAs for the two sets of clothes in the backpack, he let him hold onto them too.\nAs for the things to pass the time on the bus, he had downloaded the real treasure on his phone.\nThen, seeing Bai Bufan and the others with bulging backpacks, Lin Li curiously asked, \"What did you all bring?\"\n\"I’ve got all snacks in here, everyone will have something to eat tonight.\" Zhou Baowei patted his backpack, and a plastic rustling sound came from inside.\n\"I brought something really good.\" Bai Bufan seemed more mischievous, as he carefully opened his backpack to show Lin Li what was inside.\nSnowflakes.\n\"Tonight, everyone can have a little drink.\" Bai Bufan raised an eyebrow.\nLin Li looked disgusted.\nHe couldn’t drink beer.\nNot that he couldn’t handle alcohol; he just thought beer tasted terrible.\nPure liquor wasn’t to his liking either; Lin Li preferred cocktails with a mix of fruit juice to dilute the alcohol flavor.\n\"I brought Uno, aeroplane chess, Three Kingdoms Kill — plenty of board games for everyone.\" Wang Ze patted his own backpack.\n\"I brought my love for Yao Qiaoqiao, something for everyone to envy.\" Chen Tianming lovingly caressed his backpack, and after speaking, immediately took out his phone to check it, visibly disappointed, then eagerly continued to type.\nHow did a weirdo sneak in here?\nLin Li slightly turned aside.\nHe saw a sea of green chat logs.\nIt was Chen Tianming’s self-esteem overflowing.\nHe looked over at Bai Bufan and the others—what’s up with this idiot?\nBai Bufan gloomily shook his head: \"You’ll get used to it, he’s beyond saving now, had similar symptoms even before getting a phone, you weren’t in our dorm, so you didn’t feel it, now that he has a phone, the symptoms fully erupted.\"\nThen Bai Bufan squinted at Lin Li, who hadn’t brought anything else with him, no luggage either: \"Lin Li, what did you bring?\"\nLin Li pointed to his backpack on Zhang Haoyang’s back, sincerely saying: \"I brought everyone.\"\nAfter all, who will eat, drink, play, and envy without them?\nBai Bufan shook his head as if he expected this, then sighed, \"Lin Li, do you know the most important thing when going out into the world?\"\nLin Li: \"It’s ’heading out’.\"\n\"It’s loyalty... eh? Cough! Cough!\" Bai Bufan was caught off guard by Lin Li’s answer, choking on his words. After recovering, he waved his hand in resignation, \"We really didn’t assign you any tasks; just bringing everyone is enough.\"\nEven if Lin Li just eats and drinks from them the whole way, nobody would mind.\n\"Lin Li.\"\nHearing his name, Lin Li turned around.\nThe setting sun shone through the treetops, falling on Chen Yu Ying, who was wearing a white long dress. The snug fit highlighted her well-proportioned figure, and the skirt hem danced lightly in the wind. Usually letting her hair hang loose, today it was styled in a high ponytail using a blue ribbon, swaying with her steps, exuding youthful energy.\nThe pure and beautiful moment was revealed.\n\"Class president, this set looks really nice.\" Lin Li never holds back his compliments.\n\"Thank you, you look nice today too.\" Chen Yu Ying gradually started accepting Lin Li’s praises, though her voice was still a bit lower.\n\"I matched it specially, there’s an even cooler set.\" Lin Li accepted the compliment graciously.\n\"Lin Li... I just... greeted you too...\" A resentful voice suddenly appeared beside Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Ding Sihan? When did you get here?\" Lin Li was startled to see the source of the voice, how did she appear out of nowhere?\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nShe smiled.\nWhat do you mean when did I get here?\nI’ve been beside Yu Ying from the start, walked with her, and even followed her to call your name!\nYou only have eyes for Yu Ying, huh!\nJust wait, you jerk, I’ll whisper bad things about you tonight!\nIf I fail to sway you, I’ll write my name backward from now on!\nDing Sihan gritted her teeth while continuing to smile.",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Chapter 96: This Is True Music\n\"Lin Li, didn’t you bring anything?\"\nChen Yu Ying wasn’t carrying a backpack, but she had a crossbody bag and a suitcase she was dragging. It seemed heavy from the sound, so she curiously asked Lin Li, who appeared empty-handed.\n\"I brought a backpack full of snacks, another one with board games, plus drinks and some mysterious liquids. If you need anything, just let me know,\" Lin Li said with a smile.\nHis demeanor was confident, and what he said was even more so.\nBut beside him, Zhou Baowei, Bai Bufan, and Wang Ze: \"?\"\nAre you being polite?\nAre those even your things to take?\nThe three of them subtly gave him the middle finger but didn’t argue.\n\"No need, I brought a lot of stuff too,\" Chen Yu Ying patted her suitcase and replied with a smile.\nThe driver of the bus seemed to have just finished dinner at a small shop outside the school. Now, leisurely patting his stomach, he approached the bus, opened the door, and turned on the air conditioning inside.\nHe then got off again to open the storage compartment under the bus.\n\"Put any luggage you don’t plan to carry here! It won’t be opened until we reach the destination, so don’t put anything you’ll need on the way in there!\" the driver shouted to everyone.\nThe students who were already there started putting their suitcases and other items inside.\n\"This is hard to lift!\" The storage space for the luggage was quite high off the ground, so it needed to be lifted up to be placed inside, causing Ding Sihan to complain loudly.\n\"Class president, want me to help you lift it?\" Lin Li offered to Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Huh? Sure, thank you,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"Class president, you’re not like Patrick Star and filled it with rocks, are you?\" Upon lifting it, Lin Li realized how dense the suitcase actually was.\nIt’s just a two-day, two-night trip, how could it be so heavy?\nLin Li was grateful that his physical fitness had improved significantly. Had he not improved his physical strength before, he could still have managed to lift it, but it would have been visibly strenuous, even a bit embarrassing.\nBut now, Lin Li could lift the suitcase effortlessly and place it inside.\n\"It just ended up this heavy after packing,\" Chen Yu Ying said, a bit embarrassed.\n\"Alright, it’s done. You can get on the bus now,\" Lin Li habitually clapped his hands and told Chen Yu Ying.\n\"You guys go up first. I need to count people with Teacher Xue down here, so I’ll be the last to board,\" Chen Yu Ying replied.\n\"Okay, then I’ll head up first,\" Lin Li nodded, turned to see Bai Bufan and the others had already gotten on the bus, and nodded again.\n\"Alright.\"\nLin Li turned to leave but suddenly felt a chill on his back.\nIs it haunted again?\nHe turned his head to see Ding Sihan from Class Four, standing with an expressionless smile, holding a heavy suitcase, looking at him like she was seeing a ghost.\nWas she the one who needed help just now?\nNot sure, didn’t really remember.\n\"Ding Sihan, do you need my help?\" Lin Li confirmed.\n\"How could that be?\" Ding Sihan shook her head, saying each word slowly.\nYou can blow that pillow talk all you want!!!\n...\nAfter loading Ding Sihan’s luggage too, Lin Li boarded the bus.\nThe bus had a 3+2 seating format. There were over twenty minutes left before departure, and many had yet to arrive, leaving lots of empty seats. But Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei had saved a spot for him, calling his name.\n\"I want the window seat, Baowei, move over,\" Lin Li said, not only ungrateful but pushing his luck.\n\"What’s that stuck behind your ear?\" After sitting down, Lin Li noticed a small round patch behind Bai Bufan’s ear and curiously asked.\n\"Motion sickness patch. I get a little carsick, but on a bus of this quality, I should be fine playing on my phone today,\" Bai Bufan explained.\n\"Got it.\"\nLin Li nodded; he used to get carsick too, but he wasn’t sure if it was because of frequent travel or a change in his physical condition growing up. Eventually, it stopped occurring.\nCar sickness is truly a dreadful experience.\n\"Wanna play games? Something exciting, colorful, side-scrolling single-handed shooting game?\" Bai Bufan turned his phone sideways, suggesting.\n\"Angry Birds, right?\"\n\"No, you guys go ahead, I’m just going to listen to music,\" Lin Li shook his head, pulling out two pairs of earphones from his pocket, put the wired ones costing over a thousand back, and wore a pair of Bluetooth earphones costing a bit over a hundred.\nThe music later is rather cheap.\n...\nThe score was 14 against 60.\n\"That was quite a thrilling close loss,\" Bai Bufan lamented over his defeat.\nHe turned to check on Lin Li, finding him quite content, listening to music and reading a novel.\nPlaying games on a bus is rather shaky, so Bai Bufan decided to watch some downloaded videos and nudged Lin Li a few times: \"Wanna watch ’Alien and Refugee’ together? The latest season, produced by the Remo team, pretty good quality.\"\n\"No, I’m listening to music,\" Lin Li shook his head, focused.\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan directly took the earphone from Lin Li on his side and placed it in his own ear, murmuring, \"Let me check out your music taste.\"\n\"Excuse me.\"\nOh, it’s an English song, not bad.\n\"Can you tell me how much the shirt is?—Yes, it’s nine fifteen. Look at the options, the shirt is priced at 9 pounds and 15 pence, so you choose item C and mark it on the test paper,\" a standard yet familiar robotic male voice slowly said.\n\"Whoosh—\" The phone in Bai Bufan’s left hand suddenly slipped out, falling to the ground.\nHe froze.\nAfter a while, Bai Bufan finally turned his head.\nUpon closer inspection, he was shocked.\nThe text on Lin Li’s phone wasn’t a novel at all; it was a text-format English listening comprehension test!\n\"Why did your phone fall? Damn, Bufan, what’s with that face? We haven’t even started moving and you’re already carsick?\" Zhou Baowei picked up the phone and handed it back to Bai Bufan, startled by Bai Bufan’s expression.\nBai Bufan didn’t say anything, his face pale, as he put the Bluetooth headphones he was holding onto Zhou Baowei’s ears.\nThree seconds later.\n\"Swoosh——\" Both of Zhou Baowei’s phones fell to the ground.\nSilence.\nSilence.\nThe storm is coming——\n\"Lin Li! You’re freaking crazy!\" Bai Bufan roared at Lin Li, his eyes filled with panic and disbelief.\n\"Lin Li! Are you nuts?\" Zhou Baowei followed closely behind.\nLin Li sneered, spreading his hands in a loose grip, closing his eyes, with an expression of enjoyment: \"This is real music.\"\nEnglish written exams rely on memorizing vocabulary, generally not losing points, but listening is different, it’s always been a weak point for Lin Li, and it needs language sense to solve the problem, relying solely on memory is not enough.\nNeed to do more listening.\nTo rank in the top hundred in the next monthly exam, this is the price one must pay.\nBut in the eyes of Bai Bufan and others, this is a blatant betrayal.\n\"Hey! I don’t care who you are, you’ve been using Lin Li’s body long enough, right? Enough already, give us back the Lin Li we know!\" Bai Bufan righteously shouted to the demon inside Lin Li, then hesitated: \"Why don’t you possess me and make me fall in love with studying too?\"\nLin Li sneered and looked at Bai Bufan, reached out: \"Give me back the headphones, I want to continue listening to music.\"\n\"No way! Lin Li, have you forgotten Old Jian’s words? He said if you’re going out to play, just play properly. Turn off the listening practice right now, switch to Xiaomo’s rap or ’Eighteen Touches’, or I’ll die right here!\"\nBai Bufan refused to return the headphones and threatened him sorrowfully.\n\"Before you die, can you loan me some cash? I’ll send you the list of loan apps, you just need to download them now.\" Lin Li’s eyes lit up.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nThis buddy is really a buddy, huh.\n\"Did you see my look? Three parts sorrow, three parts nostalgia, four parts despair, Lin Li, quickly remember who you are, quickly recall our good old days!\" Bai Bufan’s voice was mournful.\n\"Let your eyes tone down the sector graph.\" Lin Li was unmoved, listening with just one headphone, preparing to continue doing exercises.\nZhou Baowei’s expression shook, his head moved closer, seriously staring at Lin Li: \"Speaking of sector graphs, Japan’s flag is a sector graph showing all places in the world that were hit by atomic bombs, did you know this, Lin Li?\"\nLin Li paused slightly, looked at his phone, licked his lips a few times, and finally turned his head to Zhou Baowei:\n\"Bao Wei, do you hate Japan so much because you’re chubby, and you’ll explode if you cross over?\"\nBai Bufan’s eyes lit up, Bao Wei indeed knew Lin Li’s user manual—the Hell joke segment indeed piqued his interest.\n\"The priests think Japan is the most beautiful place to preach because little boys fall from the sky here!\" Whatever the reason, Lin Li finally stopped listening to those annoying listening files, which was worth celebrating, so Bai Bufan also said.\nLin Li thought for a while and spoke:\n\"Every time Japan’s college entrance examination rolls around, Japan’s perverts increase dramatically because these guys have figured out the mindset of girls taking exams — the college entrance exam is a major life event, and mistakes mustn’t be made. So even if harassed, girls dare not speak out and can only endure silently.\nThis was exposed by the media and caused a sensation, people condemned these despicable perverts, parents were even more anxious.\nTo prevent their children from being bullied, fathers took leave to escort their daughters to exams.\nThus, the perverts in society doubled.\"\n\"I have, I have more...\"\n\"...\"\nFrom the front row, Wang Ze stood up and turned around, as a righteous sports student, he couldn’t bear it anymore: \"You guys seem to be a little too Hellish.\"\n\"Just now Buddha messaged me on QQ, said it’s okay to laugh freely this time, no loss of virtue.\" Lin Li waved, watching Wang Ze trying not to laugh.\n\"Then carry on, sounds good, love to listen.\" Wang Ze immediately grinned, \"You three are really attacking from all angles, impressive.\"\n\"It’s not really a full attack,\" Lin Li waved again, \"We don’t criticize three things about Japan: music, anime, and ’movies’.\"\nBai Bufan and Zhou Baowei nodded in agreement.\nWang Ze scratched his head in confusion: \"Music, anime, and what’s the third one?\"\nThe three snickered in unison, sports students are just sports students, this is a difference of paths, no mutual consultation.\n\"Darn, it’s music, anime, ’movies’!\" Wang Ze belatedly realized.\n...\n\"Alright, I really have to continue listening now, I have a bet with Wang Yuezhi...\" After being Hellish for a while, Lin Li spoke about his bet with Wang Yuezhi, \"...so, nothing can stop me from studying on the way to Pingjiang.\"\n\"How dare you make such a bet?\" Bai Bufan exclaimed unexpectedly.\n\"The class president is the notary? Isn’t this bringing shame to yourself?\" Zhou Baowei was equally surprised.\nThey also couldn’t believe Lin Li could reach the top hundred in the next monthly exam without cheating.\nThat’s too far-fetched.\nAlthough they didn’t understand, they reluctantly accepted Lin Li’s plan to study on the way.\nA listening exercise ended.\nLin Li glanced at the scenery outside the window.\nThe afterglow of the setting sun was like a golden thread, piercing through the clouds, illuminating the entire sky.\nOne could see this scenery every day from the classroom, but it always seemed a bit prettier now.\nMaybe it’s a different mood.\nThe time was about right to depart, everyone should have arrived, Lin Li saw Xue Jian and Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan who was accompanying her checking the door of the storage space, then walking toward the car.\nRest for a minute and then listen to another passage.\nWith this in mind, Lin Li closed his eyes.\n[After your relationship with Chen Yu Ying warmed up, she finally agreed to take you into and ride the Mecha together, this is your best chance to become more familiar with this world, how can you miss it?]\n[Mission Triggered!]\n[Mission Five: Observe, study, and imitate Chen Yu Ying’s operations on the Mecha.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha synchronization index +10; random ability *1; system currency *50]\nᓖ뮤?",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Chapter 97: The Wound of Betrayal Never Heals!!\nLin Li suddenly opened his eyes.\nDamn it, why give me this task at this time?\nMecha? Can this luxury bus also become a mecha? Is my system’s previously refreshed B++ combat armor also an Optimus Prime?\nWhere is the perfect mold made, it couldn’t be the exhaust pipe, right?\nBut these can wait, the pressing matter is figuring out how to complete this task now.\nTasks come with abilities and are definitely worth completing.\nThe task doesn’t have specific numerical indicators but, like progress-based tasks, it gave me a long progress bar.\nLin Li’s genius brain started spinning wildly and within three seconds, he made what he believed was the most correct decision.\nSuddenly, he turned his head and shouted at Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei: \"Bao Wei! Bufan! Get up, both of you get up and into the aisle! Quick! It’s urgent!\"\n\"Ah? Why? Ah!?\"\n\"No time to explain!\"\nThough a bit puzzled, because Lin Li’s current demeanor and tone didn’t seem joking but rather quite serious, they got up and walked out, trusting their brother wouldn’t harm them.\nThe two hadn’t even fully walked out.\n\"Class rep! Ding Sihan! I reserved these two seats for you! Come sit here!\" Lin Li immediately stood up and raised his hand, calling out to Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan who had just boarded the bus looking for seats.\nHis voice was loud, everyone on the bus heard him and instinctively turned their gaze to Lin Li.\nTwo gazes were especially intense and burning.\nZhou Baowei.\nBai Bufan.\nAt this moment, their faces showed expressions more surprised and unbelieving than when they caught Lin Li listening to English comprehension exercises on the bus.\nTheir eyes seemed to say nothing, yet said everything: virtual dad, virtual mom, virtual genealogy sprouting flowers.\nIs this guy even human?\nIf Lin Li’s human they’d rather eat shit!\nGetting us up was for this!?\nReally going all-out for a brother, but stabbing brothers for women huh?\nYet Lin Li really had no time to deal with these two classmates he wasn’t very familiar with; who the heck were they?\nNo choice, the system demanded he observes, learns, and mimics Chen Yu Ying’s actions, but if they were far apart, this task wouldn’t be easy at all. He couldn’t keep running over to Chen Yu Ying thinking about what she was doing, right?\nNot to mention, provoking the bus to veer towards a mental hospital.\nSo to complete this task, the friendliest situation is for Chen Yu Ying to sit next to him. Then learning and mimicking would be most convenient.\nAnd Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan heard Lin Li’s voice.\nChen Yu Ying froze for a moment, not expecting this situation, but Ding Sihan reacted first, grabbing Chen Yu Ying’s hand: \"Yu Ying, then let’s sit over there.\"\nPulled along, Chen Yu Ying pointed at her roommate Qu Wanqiu hesitantly: \"Wanqiu already reserved for us...\"\nKnowing they’d be the last onto the bus, they naturally asked their roommate to reserve spots ahead of time.\n\"Oh, anywhere is fine, they can sit together in pairs, Wanqiu won’t mind.\" Ding Sihan eagerly urged Chen Yu Ying toward Lin Li.\nAs she passed Qu Wanqiu, she exchanged a glance and Wanqiu smiled and gestured an OK at the two who ’ignored’ her.\nNo sadness at being ’stood up’, Qu Wanqiu was already looking forward to tonight’s girls’ talk session.\nDespite asking Chen Yu Ying previously, she got no useful information, it was always ’nothing much’, ’just studying’...\nWith Ding Sihan supervising this time, there’d definitely be tons of new things to discuss, way more important than sitting near her roommate.\nLin Li had no idea what was going through their minds, the outcome was what mattered; if not for the crowd, he’d want to bow to Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu.\nAs Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan arrived next to Lin Li, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei hadn’t left yet, making the area seem crowded.\nChen Yu Ying glanced at Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei, then softly and embarrassedly confirmed: \"Are these two seats really empty?\"\n\"Nope! Haha! Empty! Lin Li reserved them specially for you two! Haha!\" Bai Bufan nodded through gritted teeth, forcing a smile.\nThen Bai Bufan was surprised at how calm he’d become.\nHe suddenly realized he no longer felt as anxious facing girls, even able to speak and make eye contact without stammering with classmates.\nThis was something Bai Bufan could never imagine before.\nAll thanks to Feifei.\nNo wonder Lin Li’s changed so much recently, it must be Xiaojing’s influence on him.\nWondering how Feifei is doing at the institute? Would she remember this pure and handsome guest, and if they’d meet again?\nWhy do guys suddenly space out? Chen Yu Ying wondered, shifting her gaze to Zhou Baowei for confirmation.\n\"Yep! No one’s sitting! Nope!\" Zhou Baowei also nodded through gritted teeth.\nLin Li treats them like animals, but they still treated Lin Li as a brother.\nThis year, they’ll definitely be among Tokyo University’s ten most inspirational people.\nBut Lin Li won’t get away with this betrayal.\nThe scar of betrayal never heals, unless they also get sweet-voiced female companions!\n\"What are these two backpacks...\" Ding Sihan wanted Chen Yu Ying to sit in the middle — couldn’t let herself be stuck in the middle like a 250-watt bulb and saw two backpacks on the floor, asking.\n\"Haha, I wondered where my backpack disappeared, turns out dumped here! Thank you, finally found it!\" Bai Bufan’s fake smile widened, smoothly bent to grab his and Zhou Baowei’s backpacks, turning and leaving without pause.\nNot so awkward sitting by Qu Wanqiu’s side.\nThe bus has 45 seats; even with accompanying Xue Jian, the four classes don’t total forty, leaving several extra spots.\nAfter negotiating with others, the two ended up in the row behind Lin Li, ensuring they’d keep a dark gaze fixed on this scoundrel friend the entire journey.\nMeanwhile.\nWang Yuezhi’s heart broke.\nAll his efforts went to waste.\nHe, upon boarding, first observed where Chen Yu Ying’s roommates sat then chose a seat nearby, picking an aisle spot to ease interaction, aiming for unforgettable autumn trip memories.\nCrushing on someone invokes subtle strategies.\nBut suddenly Lin Li appeared as a disruptive force!\nInitially mocking Lin Li’s stupidity when he saw his seat choice at the back.\nYet when he carefully maneuvered his hand, Lin Li flipped the table! With cheats thrown in, this was unplayable!\nDespite the pangs of jealousy, Wang Yuezhi envied Lin Li’s nerve, the composure of the strong ones, daring to invite girls to sit beside him in front of Xue Jian.\nEven if given ten courage pills, Wang Yuezhi wouldn’t dare.\nHe rubbed his rosy nose and sighed.\nYet Lin Li discreetly monitored Xue Jian’s reaction.\nThough his intent wasn’t romantic, Lin Li knew others wouldn’t see it that way, with Nansang Middle School’s no dating rule.\nPerhaps due to being off-campus or trust in him — even aggressive pursuit from Chen Yu Ying wouldn’t break rules, his noble character wouldn’t wrong her, hence Xue Jian said nothing, merely chuckling before taking the reserved ’teacher’s front seat’.\n— These are Lin Li’s thoughts.",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Chapter 98 It Turns Out to Be the Luckiest Person in the World\nFortunately, Xue Jian doesn’t know the Mind Reading Technique. If he knew what Lin Li was thinking, he would definitely sit beside him the whole time, smiling and staring at him, not for any reason but to make Lin Li uncomfortable.\nHe just thinks there’s nothing wrong with boys and girls sitting together, and overly emphasizing gender differences is the real mistake. Besides, although Lin Li is unreliable, he indeed trusts Chen Yu Ying.\nThe space in a luxury bus is naturally spacious. Although the three of them sit together, it’s not cramped, and the three of them are quite comfortable.\nLin Li observed the system. After Chen Yu Ying sat down, the progress bar of the system started to change.\nIt’s probably because Lin Li ’mimicked’ Chen Yu Ying and also sat down at that moment.\nHowever, the change in speed is better than nothing. At this growth rate, even sitting on this bus for three days and two nights wouldn’t complete it.\nSo, he definitely has to mimic Chen Yu Ying’s behavior in more ways.\nAfter realizing this, Lin Li leaned back slightly, using his peripheral vision to observe Chen Yu Ying, who had just sat down and was now rummaging through her little bag.\nLin Li’s backpack was with Zhang Haoyang, and it would practically mean little to get it now, as Chen Yu Ying wouldn’t be sorting her bag endlessly. So Lin Li thought for a bit and started looking through his pockets, fumbling with his wired earphones.\nThe progress jumped a bit faster; this time, sitting on the bus for three days and two nights should do it.\nBut the completion idea was confirmed again: the more accurately he mimics, the faster it completes.\nEveryone had arrived, and after the driver confirmed with Xue Jian, the bus started.\n\"Yu Ying, do you want to eat?\" Ding Sihan had already opened a pack of onion rings and placed it in front of Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Mm, thank you.\" Chen Yu Ying politely and elegantly reached out and took one.\n\"Mm, thank you too.\" A large hand followed suit, grabbing a handful, but in the end, only took out one.\nReaching out was mimicking, grabbing a handful was instinct, taking only one meant mimicking triumphed over instinct.\nThe progress bar nudged forward slightly.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nDid I ask you to take it? So rude, minus points!\nFortunately, Lin Li immediately turned his head, reaching over to snatch a piece of gummy from Bai Bufan’s hand and handed it to Ding Sihan: \"Do you want these?\"\nDing Sihan nodded and took one, which was more or less fair, reciprocation, plus points!\nSeeing Chen Yu Ying also took one to eat, Lin Li followed suit.\nHowever, this time, the anticipated boost in progress did not occur.\nLin Li thought for a moment, realizing that interfering with Chen Yu Ying’s actions before mimicking can’t speed up the task completion.\nSome of the original plans instantly fell apart.\n\"Being generous with others’ generosity, could the leftovers after being generous be returned so that others might taste it too?\" A slightly bitter voice came from behind.\nSpooky occurrences again in Nansang Sect, one full of Ghost Cultivators.\n\"Sorry, it was an unconscious habit to pocket it; I thought no one would pick it up!\" Lin Li returned the leftover candy he instinctively put in his pocket to Bai Bufan, expressing his gratitude: \"Next week, breakfast is on me.\"\nThen he continued to observe Chen Yu Ying and saw that she had already taken out her phone.\nLin Li also immediately took out his phone.\nChen Yu Ying opened Tencent Video.\nLin Li also opened Tencent Video.\nThe bus hit a speed bump, causing a slight shake.\nLin Li and Chen Yu Ying’s phone screens instantly switched to the Pinduoduo Double Eleven event site, and both became the world’s luckiest people, receiving messages like ’Heaven-sent Fortune, Lucky Boost, Congratulations Again’... In short, they could receive ¥500 in cash withdrawals with no threshold by inviting just one more friend.\nWhat the hell.\n\"Class monitor, do you know how modern technology predicts earthquakes?\" Lin Li sighed and asked.\n\"How do they predict it?\" Chen Yu Ying turned her head and inquired.\n\"Place a phone in each of the eight directions. If one of them switches to Pinduoduo, that area is having an earthquake.\" Lin Li confidently claimed.\nChen Yu Ying was startled for a moment and then burst out laughing.\n\"Modern Zhang Heng, acknowledged.\" Ding Sihan, upon hearing this, gave a big thumbs up.\n\"Whoever invented the shake-your-phone-to-open-ads feature should really be shot, and it should be executed repeatedly.\" Lin Li exclaimed from the heart.\n\"I second that, and that fast app thing, whoever invented it should really be shot with a machine gun.\" Ding Sihan evidently shared similar feelings.\nChen Yu Ying, however, didn’t participate in their sentencing discussion.\nAfter chatting simply for a bit, she started a variety show, and after taking out her earphones, she shared them with Ding Sihan. The two started watching the show to pass the time.\nLin Li remembered the variety show’s name and searched for it on his phone.\nWhat the hell, it’s subscription-only.\nBut for the task, for a deeper mimicry, this small amount of money is inconsequential.\nSign up for a new user first month of continuous monthly subscription for just ¥12!\nPayment, switch back to WeChat, cancel the continuous monthly service, all done effortlessly by Lin Li.\nThus, Lin Li began to watch the show.\nA few minutes later, Lin Li noticed something was amiss.\nNot only did the progress bar speed not increase, but it even slowed down, even slower than just sitting at the beginning, almost to a halt.\nBut when Lin Li glanced at Chen Yu Ying, she was still watching the variety show with Ding Sihan. He even mimicked her way of watching, with one hand supporting his cheek, so the stagnant speed made no sense.\nWait.\nLin Li looked at the system again, realizing that when he watched Chen Yu Ying’s screen, the speed returned to normal.\n\"...\"\nThe problematic system.\nTo mimic Chen Yu Ying watching the variety show, he had to watch the show on her phone, did he? Oh, it’s truly frustrating.\nBut with the system having the sole right to explain, Lin Li had no choice but to comply.\nBefore complying, though, Lin Li had one thing to do:\n\"Tencent User 9000821: Hello, support, my kid accidentally subscribed to a membership on my phone, can I get a refund?\"\nTwelve yuan, well, is still spring breeze elf fragment (Komodo dragon mold), saving when necessary, spending when necessary.\n...\n\"Lin Li, are you watching too?\"\nAfter a segment of the variety show ended, as Chen Yu Ying moved her body, she noticed that Lin Li had been watching his phone all along, so she curiously asked.\n\"Yeah, I just took a peek, it’s quite interesting.\" There’s nothing to hide here; the more you try to hide it, the weirder it looks. So, Lin Li naturally admitted, nodding.\nIn just over ten minutes, the progress bar increased at a pace that was quite satisfying.\n\"Isn’t it? It’s super interesting! This variety show is really good, it...\"\nUpon hearing that, Chen Yu Ying immediately started describing the show’s details to Lin Li, who nodded in response.\n\"Isn’t it uncomfortable to watch it without sound? How about I give you this earphone?\" After finishing her introduction, Chen Yu Ying took off her earphone and handed it to Lin Li.\n\"What about you?\"\n\"I recommended this show to Si Han; I’ve actually watched it once. You two go ahead, I’ve brought my tablet anyway.\" Chen Yu Ying waved her hand dismissively.\nFor girls, successfully getting others to enjoy what you like is a fulfilling task.\n\"That’s not right.\" Lin Li undoubtedly refused.\nHis watching of the show only held meaning because Chen Yu Ying was also watching it.\nHer stopping to watch and him continuing would be doing things backward, wouldn’t it?\nBut naturally, the words couldn’t be said so bluntly:\n\"How can it be that you can’t watch it on your phone? No worries, I’m good like this. Don’t insist, class monitor. If you’re not watching, then neither will I.\"\nNext to him, Ding Sihan couldn’t help but smile upon hearing that.\nIt is known that there are three people right now.\nThe class monitor doesn’t watch, Lin Li doesn’t watch; the class monitor watches, Lin Li watches. The earphones support only two people watching, not three.\nShe shouldn’t be in the bus; she should be under it.\nDing Sihan removed her own earphones and handed them to Lin Li: \"How about I give you my earphones?\"\n\"Thank you, Si Han! And you have the most beautiful eyes.\" Lin Li immediately accepted them and expressed his sincere gratitude.\nNot even a moment of hesitation?\nEven better, Lin Li.\n\"Should I just play it out loud?\" Chen Yu Ying asked upon seeing the situation.\n\"No need, playing it out loud isn’t ideal, you two can watch. Yu Ying, I’m much clumsier than you, I really need to spend some time watching this,\" Lin Li said as he fiddled a bit, smiling as he put on the earphones, \"Don’t worry, class monitor, I can just watch like this—don’t try to persuade me, if you’re not watching, I’m not watching either.\"\nThere you go.\nDing Sihan folded her now empty hands, her face maintaining a smile.\nNot a second of hesitation?\nShe should probably be under the bus rather than inside.\nDing Sihan removed her earphone and handed it to Lin Li: \"Here, take my earphone then?\"\n\"Thank you so much, Ding Sihan, you’re the best Nansang girl ever, your eyes shine like stars.\" Lin Li immediately took the earphones, expressing his heartfelt thanks.\nSure enough, with the earphones on, listening improved the experience.\nNot even a moment’s hesitation?\nGood, good, Lin Li.\n\"How about I just play it out loud? Should I?\"\n\"No need, playing it out loud isn’t a great idea. You two just watch it. Yu Ying, my hands are much clumsier than yours, I need to focus now to watch for a while,\" Chen Yu Ying suggested.\n\"Alright then.\" Chen Yu Ying thought for a moment and then nodded.\nWhen people aren’t around, Lin Li owes Ding Sihan two bows.\nHe gave a thankful look to Ding Sihan, even if she probably didn’t notice, and then Lin Li continued to immerse himself in watching the show.\nAs they drew closer together, the light fragrance of her shampoo became more intense, lingering at the tip of his nose, quite pleasant to smell.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Chapter 99: I never care what day of the week it is when I eat KFC, we are people from two different worlds\nDing Sihan leaned back with her phone in hand, then slightly adjusted the angle to take some photos of Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying with their heads together.\nUnfortunately, all six of them in the dorm had a great relationship, so there was no exclusive group without Chen Yu Ying to share this photo and let the other four indulge in it.\nAfter thinking about it, Ding Sihan decided not to create a separate group. Although her intention in making a small group wasn’t bad this time, it might lead to unwanted outcomes. She figured she’d just send it to the dorm group after they got off, which would also let her see her deskmate’s embarrassed reaction.\nSo, Ding Sihan continued to take stealthy photos.\nYu Guang noticed other people’s cameras.\nDing Sihan met the gaze of Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei, who were also taking sneak shots.\nThe three of them exchanged knowing smiles and continued to capture the moment individually.\n...\nThe progress bar of their mission was synchronized with the progress bar of the variety show, steadily advancing amidst their low giggles.\n\"Yu Ying, we’re getting on the highway now.\" Ding Sihan suddenly patted Chen Yu Ying’s shoulder and said.\n\"Alright, let’s begin then.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded in response, took off her earphones, and handed them to Lin Li, \"Lin Li, you can have these earphones.\"\nAnd then she straightforwardly lowered the small table in front of Lin Li and placed her phone on it.\n\"Class representative, aren’t you watching?\" Lin Li inquired.\n\"No, Si Han and I are going to start practicing makeup now.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nOnly then did Lin Li notice that under the snacks in Ding Sihan’s big backpack were all kinds of bottles and jars, seemingly makeup products.\n\"Makeup?\" he asked.\n\"Yeah, we can’t wear makeup at school, but since we’re out to have fun, we wanted to give it a try. Although we’ll have to remove it by tonight, it’s just for practice for the next morning, and it’s a good way to kill time.\" Chen Yu Ying continued explaining.\nLin Li understood immediately.\nAs for why they only started now, they didn’t need to ask. Before getting on the highway, the bus often accelerated, decelerated, or even made sudden stops, making it unsuitable for makeup. But on the highway, they wouldn’t have such trouble, it could maintain a constant speed almost the whole way.\n\"So it’s perfect, letting you watch immersively on your own.\" Chen Yu Ying chuckled.\nDing Sihan and Chen Yu Ying had already set up a makeup mirror on the small table, with a phone next to Ding Sihan playing a tutorial. The two of them started working with the bottles and jars, beginning their makeup routine.\nWatching as the mission progress bar visibly slowed down due to their makeup session, Lin Li sighed inwardly.\nWithout you, representative, this variety show has no value to me—even though it’s really quite entertaining.\nAnd out of all the things to do, why makeup?\nBut to not appear too deliberate, Lin Li decided to hold on and finish watching the variety show—not because it’s good, just to maintain nonchalance.\nThe show was just at its conclusion anyway. After Lin Li finished watching it, he turned off Chen Yu Ying’s phone screen and set it back on her table.\nThen he ’curiously’ examined Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying’s processes.\nDing Sihan was clearly a bit clumsy, often letting out small gasps of surprise at little mishaps. Chen Yu Ying was also pretty inexperienced, but her dexterity made everything go smoothly.\n\"Class representative, I want to try makeup too, can I?\" After being curious for a while, Lin Li finally spoke up.\nBoth Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan looked at Lin Li in surprise.\n\"You want me to help you with it?\" Chen Yu Ying hesitated before asking.\nThere’s actually nothing wrong with guys wearing makeup, but in high school, a guy showing interest in makeup pretty much equates to losing his male card and being labeled as effeminate.\nPlus, based on Lin Li’s usual behavior and character, he didn’t seem like someone who would be interested in this.\n\"No, I want to do it myself, it looks fun, and I want to try.\" Lin Li wasn’t embarrassed by their looks but responded with a bright smile.\nIf Chen Yu Ying is applying her own makeup, then naturally, he ought to do his own too.\nAfter a moment of being dumbfounded, Chen Yu Ying also showed a look of interest. She nodded and pointed at her makeup bag:\n\"Except for lipstick and lip gloss—I doubt you can apply them—you can use anything else from mine.\"\nShe suddenly felt curious about how Lin Li would turn out.\n\"Thank you so much.\" Lin Li clasped his hands together gratefully.\n\"There are no extra makeup mirrors... Can you make do with this small mirror?\" Chen Yu Ying rummaged through her little bag but only found a small round mirror the size of her palm.\n\"Sure, I’m not picky.\" Lin Li replied easily.\n\"Do you know anything about makeup, Lin Li?\" Chen Yu Ying asked again.\n\"Not at all!\" Lin Li blinked.\nAs expected, Chen Yu Ying chuckled softly, then set her phone up in front of Lin Li again, \"This collection is all about makeup tutorials. You can watch and learn. Good luck.\"\n\"Thanks, class representative, you’re the most beautiful Tokyo University girl I’ve ever met. Your eyes hold the universe.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\n\"It feels like Yu Ying’s makeup will all go to waste. Lin Li, use it carefully, they’re expensive.\" Ding Sihan, whose eyes only saw sparkles, made a dissatisfied remark.\nShe wasn’t stingy, just couldn’t bear to see those products go to waste.\n\"It’s okay, feel free to use them; most of them here are samples, not worth much.\" Before Lin Li could respond, Chen Yu Ying casually responded.\n\"Alright, alright~ our class representative’s so rich, truly doesn’t care about little things like this. Lin Li, enjoy the royal grace, use them freely.\" Ding Sihan teased indulgently.\n\"Is the class representative’s family really wealthy?\" Lin Li was still watching a video to distinguish between primer and foundation, but looked up when he heard, missing the point.\n\"Yu Ying never checks the day of the week when eating KFC, choosing to order separately even when there’s a set meal, never using any delivery discounts. What do you think?\" Ding Sihan answered.\n\"Can’t argue with that, that’s real wealth!\" Lin Li responded with a thumbs-up.\n\"Hey! Wealthy doesn’t mean crazy. I’ve never ordered separately when there’s a set meal, and I do use discount codes!\" Chen Yu Ying argued back.\n\"Did you hear that, Lin Li? Yu Ying didn’t deny having money.\" Ding Sihan made a face.\n\"Got it, sir! I’m holding on tight to these beautiful slender thighs.\" Lin Li saluted.\n\"You’ve got ambition and taste; Yu Ying’s legs are indeed beautiful! Keep it up!\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Pervert.\"\nThe two of them played along with each other, while Chen Yu Ying muttered softly, crossing her straight legs more closely.\nLin Li heard it and turned to her, assessing with his gaze.\nBefore she could speak, this time Chen Yu Ying realized her mistake:\n\"Sorry, sorry, I forgot, you’re a good pervert.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Chapter 100: He Is the Great Qing’s Number 1 Assassin\nLin Li realized that he actually didn’t need to look at any tutorials at all.\nAll he needed to do was stare at Chen Yu Ying, see what she was doing, and blindly smear stuff on his own face the same way.\nThis was the fastest way to make progress.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t look at any tutorials, so him looking at them was unnecessary.\nBy now, it had been more than twenty minutes since Lin Li started putting on makeup. The task progress bar had moved a quarter of the way in these twenty minutes, and now it was nearly halfway. You couldn’t say it wasn’t fast.\nIf only this makeup time could keep going.\nBut unfortunately, Chen Yu Ying had reached the final step of makeup, dabbing a layer of hydrating grapefruit-colored lip gloss on her lips, pressing them lightly so the lovely color blended out.\nLin Li followed suit—although Chen Yu Ying didn’t offer him any lip gloss, it didn’t matter; he just smeared the excess foundation on his lips. Eating a little of it was no big deal anyway.\nAfter glancing at herself a few times in the mirror, Chen Yu Ying turned to see how Lin Li was doing.\nLin Li was already watching Chen Yu Ying, so at this moment, the two of them made eye contact.\nMakeup really was a magical thing.\nThe streetlight’s sheen, coming through the car window, highlighted Chen Yu Ying’s face, giving her skin a near-transparent fairness. The eyeshadow at the corners of her eyes gave her clear, spring-like eyes a hint of elusive liveliness, like a deer hiding within.\nLin Li’s vocabulary failed him; he didn’t know how to describe this makeup. Although it was faint, you could even call it pseudo-natural, it truly had that dazzling quality.\nIt was probably a kind of elegant freshness. In any case, the color palette was harmonious, complementing each other and fully showcasing Chen Yu Ying’s pure vitality.\nMa Xiaotiao came over, exclaiming she was like white moonlight.\nXiaojing Xiaojing Xiaojing Xiaojing Xiaojing.\nMentally repeating \"dark secret moonlight\" to himself, Lin Li’s expression remained calm, his cultivator’s steady heart still firm.\nAs for Chen Yu Ying, who was not a cultivator, her mind was not so steady.\nJust as she wanted to speak, seeing Lin Li’s face with his imitation makeup, she stopped short.\nThen the whole of Chen Yu Ying started trembling, holding her mouth tightly as the full moon shattered into two crescents, reflecting in her eyes.\nHer trembling body became unstable, collapsing into Ding Sihan’s arms, still shaking.\nLin Li chuckled softly. Clearly, the class president was completely captivated by his charm, almost fainting.\nIt would be better if Chen Yu Ying could control her laughter a bit. Otherwise, Lin Li felt a bit unconvincing when trying to deceive and comfort himself.\nAnd Ding Sihan, who had been ’attacked,’ had just finished her makeup too, so she also turned to look at Lin Li.\nHer laughter was neither ladylike nor contained nor did it possess any decorum.\n\"Lin Li, what kind of makeup did you do! Hahaha!\"\nThe commotion in the front was making Bai Bufan curious. He stood up, leaning over to see Lin Li’s face, nearly spitting out a mouthful of water. Fortunately, Lin Li was prepared and slapped it aside, so the saliva sprayed onto Zhou Baowei’s face beside him.\nBut Zhou Baowei didn’t lose out too much because as Lin Li slapped at Bai Bufan, he turned his head to the back, so when Zhou Baowei saw Lin Li, he also sprayed water onto Bai Bufan’s face.\nYou could only say they were in a crazy exchange of bodily fluids.\nWishing them eternal happiness and growing old together.\nLaughter gradually began to spread outward from the center.\nFeeling indignant, Lin Li picked up the small mirror on the table and looked at himself, and then he was relieved.\nNo way to fake it, this was genuinely ugly.\nLin Li realized one thing: when he was putting on makeup, he was so focused on following Chen Yu Ying’s steps that he didn’t pay attention to whether he put things in the right places on his face.\nHe ended up laughing too.\n\"Lin Li, come on, let’s take a selfie!\" Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei leaned out from behind, holding a phone with the front camera on.\nLin Li had no fear of the camera, confidently flashing a peace sign.\nHe was the kind of guy who’d get busted in a sweep and still be beaming at the camera; what did he care about an ugly photo?\nBeside him, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan finally calmed down a bit, sitting up straight.\n\"Can we take a selfie too?\" There was still some laughter in Chen Yu Ying’s voice.\n\"Of course you can.\"\nLin Li had long arms. He took Chen Yu Ying’s phone, extended it toward the window, and snapped a few photos of the three of them together.\nAfter taking the photos, Lin Li zoomed in on his own part, studied it carefully, and seriously said to Chen Yu Ying:\n\"Class president, I think inner beauty is more important, don’t you?\"\nThat statement finally dissolved Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan’s attempts to stifle their laughter.\nLin Li gently smiled too. He was also quite happy, as there was nothing embarrassing about this. Lin Li was even sure this would become a cherished memory in the future.\nEspecially when he saw the task progress bar rapidly rising, he felt even more delighted.\nIt seemed the system couldn’t account for Lin Li deliberately guiding Chen Yu Ying’s actions, but it acknowledged the butterfly effect triggered by this mimicry.\n\"It’s okay, just try harder next time.\" Tired from laughing, Chen Yu Ying rubbed the corners of her mouth, half-heartedly comforting Lin Li.\n\"There probably won’t be a next time.\" Lin Li chuckled.\n\"Can I post this picture to my Moments?\" Chen Yu Ying looked at the selfie on her phone and asked.\n\"Of course, go ahead.\"\nLin Li didn’t mind and was even starting to look forward to one thing: whether his good buddy (nap time version) Wang Yuezhi would like Chen Yu Ying’s post after she shared it to Moments?\nWhenever it was about Chen Yu Ying, whether it was a post, a Moment, or even a status message, this kid seemed afraid to be even a second late in liking it.\nAnd this time?\nHehe.\nLin Li leaned out and just made eye contact with Wang Yuezhi, who had been silently watching since hearing Chen Yu Ying’s laughter.\nUrgent notice! Physics doesn’t exist anymore!\nAccording to the conservation of hehe, hehe doesn’t disappear or appear out of nowhere. It only transforms from one form to another or transfers from one object to others, keeping the total amount constant.\nBut at this moment, Lin Li saw non-laughing Wang Yuezhi become more hehe after seeing what Lin Li looked like now! He even hehe’d too!\nHow did the hehe just appear out of nowhere?\nThe sky has fallen.\n\"Lin Li, does my makeup look nice?\" Meanwhile, Chen Yu Ying, looking at the photos in her album, poked Lin Li and asked.\nEyelashes gently tremble, like a butterfly brushing past petals, eyebrows are long and soft, slightly raised, hiding anticipation.\nLuckily, Lin Li is a Cultivator, with a stable mind, otherwise he really couldn’t handle it.\nHe thought for a moment and gave a thumbs-up: \"Lost north and south in direction, quite stunning.\"\nChen Yu Ying had already built some resistance to Lin Li’s compliments, but when this little flirt came out, she couldn’t help but feel a bit shy.\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"My turn, my turn!\" Ding Sihan raised her hand, pointing at her own face with both hands, sincerely asking: \"Lin Li, what about me, what about me, how do you think my makeup is, does it look good?\"\nLin Li looked at Ding Sihan.\nThis makeup is real makeup.\n\"Ding Sihan, do you want to hear the truth or a lie?\" Lin Li thought for a while and sincerely asked.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nChanged the tune at my turn!\nThe eager smile turned fake, Ding Sihan took a deep breath, then said with a smile: \"I want to hear a lie.\"\nThe toad mustn’t eat swan meat! I, Ding Sihan, will not allow it if you want to be with Yu Ying! Lin Li? Do you deserve it!\nTonight I’ll blow and blow and blow the pillow wind to death!\nHumph!\nBut for now, listening to compliments makes me feel better.\n\"Not good-looking.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nKnew it.\nHey, wait.\nIs a lie not good-looking?\nAfter realizing, Ding Sihan’s lips twitched up and down, repeatedly, like twitching.\nTrying to suppress but couldn’t hold it down.\nDead mouth! Be reserved! Don’t laugh!\nSpeaking of which, Lin Li does seem quite suited for Yu Ying, huh.\nLin Li, he’s so cheeky.\nHis little tricks are really skilled, my emotions were truly stirred by this kid, up and down.\nSigh, will Yu Ying be deceived round and round like this in the future?\nDing Sihan observed Lin Li, then was a bit surprised — isn’t Lin Li much more handsome compared to last semester when I met him? And his physique has improved?\nThere’s no doubting Lin Li’s height, but he used to be quite thin. This lanky figure is fine in winter, a walking coat hanger, but in summer short sleeves, sometimes even seems scary, a top-tier skeleton soldier. But Ding Sihan now noticed, Lin Li doesn’t seem as thin as before?\nFeels like his arms have beefed up, the whole person looks, whether in temperament, physique, or features, much better than last semester.\nHas he been working out?\nAlright, Ding Sihan had to admit, Lin Li might not be merely a toad, at least a frog.\nAnd still willing to praise me looking good, fine, fine, forget past grievances, the pillow wind continues to blow, but blow in a good direction instead.\nDing Sihan chuckled foolishly, shook her head, and asked Lin Li: \"Then I want to hear the truth, hehe.\"\n\"Really not good-looking.\" Lin Li immediately replied.\n\"Hehe, thank you, hehe.\" Ding Sihan kept laughing.\n1.14514 seconds later, Ding Sihan’s smile froze.\nJust what did I hear?\nThe lie is not good-looking, the truth is really not good-looking?\nDamnit! Is this how real truth works!\nAlright, alright Lin Li! You damn toad! I’ll blow, blow, blow, blow, blow you with pillow wind to death!!!\n\"Lin Li you’re a nasty stinky dog, I hate you!\"\nGirl, you curse like you’re whining.\n\"Just kidding, your skin looks much better after brightening, really perfect!\" After seeing Ding Sihan pouting, and getting a glare from Chen Yu Ying, Lin Li began to backtrack.\n\"Humph!\" Late compliments are cheaper than grass, I, Ding Sihan, won’t accept this.\nMight as well blow your pillow wind one less time.\nJust then Wang Ze in the front row turned his head, saw Ding Sihan’s look, disdainfully said to Lin Li: \"Ding Sihan’s makeup isn’t quite good?\"\nWang Ze good, Lin Li bad.\nEven before Ding Sihan could react proudly to this compliment, she heard Wang Ze continue: \"However, Ding Sihan, I still prefer your look after removing makeup, ready to celebrate Halloween.\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"You! You!\" As Ding Sihan gritted her teeth in anger, Lin Li suddenly leaned over, signaled Ding Sihan to bring her ear closer.\nAfter pondering for a moment, Ding Sihan leaned in, listened to the teaching, suddenly brightened, pointed at Wang Ze’s nose:\n\"Ha, Wang Ze, when you take off your pants, you can still celebrate Children’s Day!\"\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nChen Yu Ying lowered her head and began to chuckle.\nIt’s really hard to tell whose attack is stronger.\n\"Lin Li! Beast! Your male citizenship is revoked!\" Wang Ze, as expected, realized instantly this was taught by Lin Li to Ding Sihan, said heartbrokenly.\n\"I’ve already put on makeup, who cares about male citizenship.\" Lin Li pointed at his own face, said indifferently.\nFor three seconds looking at Lin Li’s face, Wang Ze couldn’t hold back the laughter first.\n\"I’m the Great Qing’s number one assassin, who dares to look me in the eye for ten seconds?\" Lin Li became more arrogant, began to belittle heroic figures.\nNo one dared to challenge, even Xue Jian who transcended student ranks, after a glance turned away awkwardly.\nThis, is invincibility.\nThe invincible Cultivator really is lonely like snow.",

Lin Li is still a good frog!\nLin Li high-fived her understandingly and eagerly asked, \"No problem, Sister Ding, but since we’re sisters, can Sister Lin sleep in the same room as you tonight?\"\n\"Is that so?\" Wang Ze turned his head sharply like a dog spotting something unsavory, saying to Ding Sihan, \"Sister Ding, I’m actually your Sister Wang! Count me in tonight!\"\n\"Wang Ze, you’re so disgusting, go away, go away, go away——\" Ding Sihan pinched her nose in disdain, waving her hand as if shooing away flies.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\n\"Isn’t there some bias here? Wasn’t it Lin Li who suggested it first? Why am I the only one called disgusting? Scold him too!\"\nBeing scolded himself was fine, but Wang Ze was unhappy that Lin Li didn’t get scolded too; after all, it wasn’t about scarcity but about equity.\n\"Do you even compare to Lin Li? You’re not even fit to hold his shoes!\"\nOf course, this wasn’t said by Ding Sihan but by Lin Li on her behalf, and he confirmed with her, \"Right?\"\nDing Sihan blinked, then nodded, \"Hmm... right.\"\nWang Ze gave a middle finger in response and turned his head back.\nWith makeup done, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan started taking selfies happily, and Lin Li naturally joined in, without any objection from them.\nAfter all, how else to highlight the flowers? Especially the makeup skills? Wouldn’t you need a pile of cow dung with makeup?\nWho else but Lin Li to be that cow dung?\nAt this point, Lin Li’s deliberate imitation of Chen Yu Ying’s movements only appeared amusing to them, with no one minding, and the progress bar soared.\nAfter selfies, Chen Yu Ying started watching variety shows with Lin Li again.\n...\nLin Li furrowed his brow slightly.\nThe new variety show didn’t have many episodes, and after watching, Chen Yu Ying chose to rest in place, leaning back, as naturally, sitting on the bus for long became tiring, not even glancing at her phone.\nLin Li, naturally followed suit.\nThe progress rate was decent, but it suddenly slowed just before completion.\nLin Li opened his eyes; Chen Yu Ying wasn’t doing anything else.\nSo what’s the issue here?\nLin Li kept silently adjusting his position, searching for the problem’s cause.\nHe should’ve found it.\nLin Li saw Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan’s hands were now holding each other’s, swaying back and forth.\nGirls doing such things aren’t unusual.\nClearly, the system judged that Chen Yu Ying was no longer resting with her eyes closed but was holding hands with Ding Sihan.\nLin Li blinked.\nEven though he and Ding Sihan were nominally sisters, really walking to the aisle and grabbing her hand to sway together should earn quite a backlash.\nBy now, the bus was already within Pingjiang City limits; soon, they’d reach their destination. Although there was no time limit to this task, and on the return trip, it would still be judged on the same mecha, it’s ideal not to procrastinate as there was just a tiny bit left.\nLooks like a detour is the only way.\nLin Li glanced at his phone, memorizing some terminology, then poked his head out, \"Ding Sihan, are you bored?\"\n\"Not really, why?\" Ding Sihan asked curiously.\nHearing the conversation, Chen Yu Ying opened her eyes too.\n\"Want me to read your palm?\" Lin Li resorted to this tactic.\nUnexpectedly, Ding Sihan looked wary, \"Hey, Lin Li, what are you up to, trying to take advantage of shaking my hand under the guise of palm reading?\"\nReally sees through one’s intentions in a heartbeat.\n\"What a joke, if I were to take advantage, wouldn’t it be to take advantage of the monitor?\" But Lin Li retorted righteously.\nFull of confidence.\n\"Who knows if you’re trying to bypass me and take advantage of Yu Ying, what do you know about palmistry?\" Ding Sihan remained cautious.\n\"You dare call us sisters and trust me this little?\" Lin Li feigned being hurt, \"Give me your hand, and you’ll see if I know palmistry soon enough.\"\nDing Sihan looked at Lin Li, half skeptical, then placed her hand in front of Lin Li, letting him hold it.\nIt surged up! It surged up!\nThough now Yu Ying and Ding Sihan weren’t holding hands, mimicking study didn’t require perfectly syncing every moment, so it didn’t impede the progress from speeding up.\nAnd when Lin Li started swaying Ding Sihan’s hand, the speed increased even more.\nWatching her hand sway back and forth, Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nPalm reading?\n\"This is the Mount of Jupiter, full here, meaning your health and vitality are good,\" but before she could pull back and retort, Lin Li began analyzing, \"The sway of the Mount of Saturn is slightly indented, showing a bit of a lack in confidence, the first and second Mounts of Mars are symmetrical, meaning...\"\nReally bro, you know this stuff?\nDoes palmistry really need swaying? Could it be a step needed by masters?\nHearing these professional terms, Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying were left stupefied.\nDing Sihan simply let Lin Li sway her hand steadily, she bought it.\n\"These five lines, you may have heard a little bit about them. These three are the Heaven, Earth, and Human lines, and these two are the Career and Marriage lines...\"\nAlthough Lin Li seemed to be looking at Ding Sihan’s hand, in reality, her eyes were closed the entire time — after all, that’s what Chen Yu Ying just did too.\nThe two thought she was observing the palm, and didn’t notice this detail.\nThe so-called jargon coming from her mouth was all memorized just now, now used to stall for time.\nHold on, victory is almost here!\n[Task Five Completed!]\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha Sync Rating +10; Random Ability*1; System Currency*50]\nThis notification was like a heavenly melody to her ears.\nLin Li opened her eyes, her face filled with relief.\nNo more suffering for me.\nLin Li raised her head and said to Ding Sihan, \"I’ve pretty much analyzed everything, do you have any questions?\"\n\"Master, of course, I’m more concerned about my love life!\" Ding Sihan said seriously but with anticipation.\n\"Your love line extending to the index finger, ending below the Saturn mount on the index finger, means you’re naive and romantic, with keen feelings and a love for beautiful things, but with unrealistic ideas,\" Lin Li stated.\n\"Mm-hmm! That’s true! That’s so accurate, Lin Li!\" Ding Sihan nodded.\n\"Ding Sihan, do you also believe in astrology?\" Hearing this familiar answer, Lin Li suddenly looked up and asked.\n\"Yeah, why?\" Ding Sihan was puzzled; is there a connection between astrology and palm reading?\nNo wonder she’s so easy to fool, Lin Li shook her head, marking for the future to sell Ding Sihan health supplements in her old age.\n\"Too bad your palm shows broken lines.\" Lin Li suddenly sighed regretfully.\n\"What does that mean?\" Ding Sihan’s heart tightened.\nMeanwhile, Chen Yu Ying was drawn to the phone that had fallen to the ground from Lin Li’s pocket, the screen still lit up.\n\"Before you’re twenty-five, you’ll be frustrated and hurt because you can’t meet someone truly suitable for you,\" Lin Li sighed.\n\"I knew it! It’s so hard to find someone suitable!\" Ding Sihan nodded heavily, then cracked her fingers, \"So I can only meet someone after twenty-five. That’s okay, I can wait.\"\n\"Uh, no, actually even after twenty-five you won’t meet anyone, you’ll just get used to it and won’t be frustrated and hurt anymore,\" Lin Li explained bluntly.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Good news, you’ll meet someone at sixty,\" seeing Ding Sihan struck by two bad news, Lin Li hurriedly comforted.\n\"What’s the use of meeting someone at sixty! I’ll be menopausal by then!\" Ding Sihan raged.\n\"Oh no, oh no, what am I going to do in this life! Sixty? Yu Ying, how can I delay menopause?\" After her bout of anger, Ding Sihan fell into a helpless panic, seeking ways to remedy the situation.\nIt’s just that her methods seemed a bit off.\n\"Si Han, don’t be so upset, Lin Li was lying to you, everything he just said was checked on the spot,\" Chen Yu Ying said, wanting to laugh but holding back, patting Ding Sihan’s shoulder, showing her the phone in her hand.\n\"Zhihu: Palmistry Guide, for Cheating Only.\"\nAll the terms Lin Li just used were on there.\nLin Li saw this scene and patted his pants pocket, wondering how his phone fell out.\n\"It was all fake?\" Ding Sihan’s face stiffened, then mechanically turned her head, glaring at Lin Li, articulating each word.\n\"Hello, yes.\" Lin Li nodded with a smile.\n\"Lin Li, I can’t stand being in the same world as you anymore, you’re not my friend!\" Ding Sihan roared.\n\"Then I can only return to the male roster.\" Lin Li sighed dramatically.\n\"Sorry, on behalf of the males, I refuse,\" Wang Ze said without turning his head.\n\"Then I can only return to Bai Bufan’s roster.\" Hearing this, Bai Bufan, who wanted to respond, was held back by Lin Li.\n\"I will never believe in your stupid astrology and palm reading again!\" Ding Sihan gritted her teeth.\nIn a way, they had done a good thing, and Lin Li felt even more reassured.\nThis expression, however, seemed even more infuriating in Ding Sihan’s eyes, and she immediately changed her tone to threaten, \"Hmph! I will definitely not let Yu Ying fall into the hands of someone like you, Lin Li. You’d better not have any designs on Yu Ying, or I will become your biggest obstacle!\"\nIf I had known, I wouldn’t have been the wingman! Next time I need to change my position while gossiping!\nMeanwhile, Chen Yu Ying felt a bit embarrassed and lightly scolded, tapping Ding Sihan’s hand, \"Don’t say such things.\"\nHaving completed the task, Lin Li felt light and unbothered, instead, looking at Chen Yu Ying, he said, \"Class President.\"\n\"W-what is it?\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit scared, worried Lin Li might really confess.\nA confession wouldn’t be a good thing; it would make her look black-hearted.\n\"Do you know why Snow White had a turbulent life?\" Of course, Lin Li had no intention of confessing; he’d even hesitate if Chen Yu Ying confessed first, instead saying.\n\"Why?\" Although not knowing why the topic shifted to this, Chen Yu Ying was a bit curious.\n\"Because she had too many little people around her; remember to take this as a cautionary tale.\"\nSeven dwarfs surely count as little people.\nSnow White Chen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nLittle person Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nSo you’ve been mocking me all along!\n\"Lin Li!!!!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 110: Chapter 102: Tribute to the Legendary Horse Hunter\nA man should kneel only for a worthy cause. Lin Li immediately apologized.\nIt was clear that Ding Sihan was just as magnanimous as he was, so she accepted the apology at once. Apart from occasionally giving him a venomous glare like Nanny Rong’s towards Ziwei, she didn’t have much of a reaction.\nBeing forgiving is a good trait, Lin Li gave her some brownie points for that.\nHowever, he had to be more cautious when crossing the street later and make sure to stand behind her, otherwise, he might really end up tripping a big truck.\nAfter getting Chen Yu Ying to help pacify things a bit longer, Lin Li turned his attention to the reward.\nHe hadn’t yet paid attention to what ability he had gained this time.\n[You have acquired an active ability: Mimicry.]\n[Mimicry: You can imitate a behavior pattern, skill, or ability you’ve witnessed in person within the past month for one hour after use. You will gain 50% to 150% proficiency, determined by your physical fitness and the difference between your ability and that of the person you are imitating.]\nYou accumulate one usage opportunity every 48 hours, with a maximum storage capacity of two.\nAnother active ability.\nAnd it looks quite useful too.\nFor instance, Lin Li could now choose Xiaojing, whom he saw at Tianhong, and mimic her seductive dance that cost 299 in front of him.\nHis own body flexibility might not equal that of Tianhong Xiaojing, so maybe he could replicate 70% to 80% of the sexiness?\nNo, that’s not right. He almost forgot that he also knows ballet. He’s technically a dancer with \"systematic training,\" with quite a bit of dance techniques in his memory.\nWith these foundations, he might even dance more seductively than Tianhong Xiaojing.\nThe most commendable point about this ability is that it assures at least a 50% mimicry effect.\nBut whether he can only mimic that 299 dance or mimic Xiaojing’s entire dance ability to dance other routines, remains to be verified later on through usage.\nIt takes two days to accumulate one usage opportunity, which is quite a while.\nRight now, it’s only about ten minutes until they reach the hotel, and the remaining time isn’t even enough to listen to a piece for English listening practice.\nRelax a bit.\nLin Li simply stood up and crawled forward to see what Wang Ze and the others were doing.\nWang Ze was playing chess with Zhang Haoyang.\nThe sporty jock being crushed by the smart couch potato, Wang Ze’s opponent was trying to multitask, still playing on a game console, Zhang Haoyang.\nThe battle was one-sided.\nWang Ze seemed to start moving Zhang Haoyang’s pieces.\n\"Get lost, Haoyang, playing with you is no fun, I want to play with Lin Li!\" Noticing Lin Li’s gaze, the brainstorming Wang Ze immediately found someone equally matched to compete with.\n\"Okay.\" Zhang Haoyang didn’t even look up.\n\"Come on, Lin Li, let’s have a round.\"\n\"OK.\"\n\"I’m Red, and I go first.\" Lin Li accepted the challenge, committed to a cannon attack, and laughed, \"Haha, Wang Ze, you’ve lost your horse.\"\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nAt this point, capturing the cannon with the chariot was the sure win, but his hand instinctively pressed on his cannon.\nIt was a matter of horse dignity.\nRevenge was necessary.\nBut at that moment, Lin Li’s hand pressed down on Wang Ze’s hand.\nWang Ze looked up to see Lin Li shaking his head, \"I concede, Wang Ze, you’re strong, though you’ve lost your horse, you won, fortunately, I’m the loser but still have my horse.\"\nWang Ze: \"?\"\n\"You’re saying your goal in the game was just to kill my horse, right?\" Wang Ze roared.\n\"One more game! I’m on the red side now!\" Wang Ze was determined to reclaim his honor.\n\"Then I concede now, Wang Ze, you’re strong, you’ve won twice, lost only a horse, now let’s start the third game, and I’m on the red side again.\" Lin Li excitedly rubbed his hands together.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\n\"You lost, you’re a loser!\"\n\"Yes, I’m a loser, but your horse is gone.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Get lost, Lin Li, Haoyang, let’s continue!\"\nWang Ze decided he would never play chess with Lin Li, this legendary Horse Hunter, again in his life.\n\"The skill gap is huge, if you want to win, Wang Ze, use your horse well.\" True masters find loneliness in boredom, it seems like no more chess is to be played, Lin Li patted Wang Ze on the shoulder, advising this junior.\n\"What nonsense are you spewing? Show some respect to my horse.\" Horses matter, Wang Ze was very cautious, even covering both horses with his hand.\n\"No harm done, rumor says you can win quickly with a horse and a player, just wanted to share the trick.\" Lin Li said.\nZhang Haoyang pulled his gaze from the game console, looked at the board, moved a piece, and then addressed Lin Li, \"Time Circus super topic, who’s Lin Li?\"\n\"Couldn’t let them go either.\"\nThe chess here wasn’t thrilling, nor was there a sacrificial horse for him, so Lin Li looked over to see what Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei were doing.\nThey were farming.\n\"Such an economic disparity, better surrender, can’t play without money.\" Zhou Baowei frowned heavily.\nHe was playing with Han Xin, 2/1/3, and starting with two kills with red and blue buffs is basic for Han Xin in the early game.\n\"Bao Wei, aren’t you a bit too materialistic? Do you only see money in your eyes?\" Bai Bufan frowned and said from hearing that, \"I don’t like a materialistic man like you.\"\nZhou Baowei took a deep breath, Lin Li saw his fist clench for a moment.\nLin Li checked out the situation; oh, Bai Bufan was playing Diao Chan in the solo lane, 0/11/3, Bao Wei’s materialism was all because of his useless losses.\n\"Bao Wei, your temperament is pretty good.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\nNothing worth watching here either.\nWell, it’s better to study, ten minutes is still ten minutes, learning even a little bit counts.\n...\nThe bus slowing down made Lin Li lean forward.\nThe bus stopped.\nLin Li looked around, noticing that it didn’t look like a hotel outside.\n\"There’s a height limit on the road ahead, our bus can’t get through, so we have to walk a bit, it’s not far, just around a hundred meters. Everyone check your belongings and take everything when you disembark. Tomorrow’s ride might not be the same bus.\" Xue Jian got up and explained.\n\"Lin Li, are you crazy! Studying right now?\" Perhaps because she saw Lin Li’s phone screen while looking outside, Ding Sihan’s face turned white.\nIt was terrifying.\n\"This is how a good student is.\" Lin Li said proudly.\n\"Are you referring to watching a variety show with Yu Ying for two hours, putting on makeup with us for an hour, then sleeping for an hour, and finally studying for ten minutes as a good student, right?\" Ding Sihan counted meticulously on her fingers.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nPlans can never keep up with changes.\n\"Why are you so concerned about me? Ding Sihan, are you secretly in love with me?\" Lin Li counterattacked immediately.\n\"Quack!\" The girl who initially wanted to say ’Get lost’ accidentally said ’Quack’ because she spoke too quickly and immediately covered her mouth.\nBut the little rascal, Lin Li, wouldn’t let this opportunity pass, transforming into a toad immediately: \"Quack, quack, quack!\"\nDing Sihan’s face turned red with anger: \"Watch out when you cross the street later!\"\nBu Hao might really hit the jackpot.\nLin Li felt a chill down his back and nudged Chen Yu Ying with his elbow: \"Class monitor, save me.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Chapter 103: The School is a Shelter, but Classmates May Not Be\nStill the same saying, Ding Sihan doesn’t hold grudges.\nAfter checking there was nothing left behind, everyone started to get off the bus one after another.\n\"This time I’ll prioritize grabbing your suitcase. You’ll calm down, right?\" Lin Li took Ding Sihan’s suitcase out of the storage space while asking.\n\"I put mine last... Of course, it’s first to come out. Show me how you’d take Yu Ying’s suitcase out first...\" Ding Sihan, sounding like a vengeful spirit, said faintly.\nStill has a brain, huh? Annoying.\nDing Sihan absolutely cannot leave my sight, otherwise it could be dangerous.\n\"Class rep, you guys go ahead, I’ll bring up the rear.\" After handing Chen Yu Ying’s suitcase to her, Lin Li casually cradled his head and said.\nTheoretically speaking, a gentleman at this time would offer to carry a girl’s suitcase all the way. But the only thing Lin Li has in common with a gentleman is shi.\nOf course, if Chen Yu Ying got really tired carrying it or actively asked for help, Lin Li wouldn’t hesitate to take over.\nAs for offering first? Forget it.\nSuck-up lines up after Bai Bufan.\n\"Are we bunking together tonight?\" Lin Li walked over to Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei to ask.\nGiven the price for this two-day, one-night autumn trip, no single rooms were possible, the school arranged four-person dorm-style rooms. From the group’s accommodation preview pics, the environment looks very excellent and luxurious—creates anticipation.\n\"Yeah, the four of us. And there’s Tianming. Hey, where’s Tianming?\" Bai Bufan nodded in response, then looked around with some confusion.\n\"Tianming, what are you doing?\" After finding Chen Tianming, Bai Bufan went over and gave him a hefty slap on the back.\n\"Qiaoqiao and the others seem to be arriving soon, might even run into them now. I’ll keep watching.\" Chen Tianming looked expectantly toward the direction the bus was coming from.\nLin Li and the others: \"...\"\n\"Why is his condition so severe? Seems worse than Wang Yuezhi’s as a suck-up.\" Bai Bufan frowned and asked.\n\"Wang Yuezhi is actually still quite an interesting suck-up, way better than Tianming.\" Lin Li threw in a good word for his good buddy (limited edition, midday).\n\"You two, can’t you make snide remarks behind my back? Plus, what’s with this world, why call deep affections ’suck-up’?\" Chen Tianming couldn’t bear it anymore.\n\"Alright, Mr. True Feelings, stop waiting, let’s go, Xue Jian will get mad.\" Lin Li indicated that the classmates had already sorted their things and were following Xue Jian, who noticed the four and was not pleased.\n\"Oh crap—\" Chen Tianming shivered.\nSeems Xue Jian still has a way to wake Chen Tianming up.\n\"What did I just say on the bus and at school?! Forget your own actions, haha— cough, cough! Forget your own actions, you four haha—\"\nKeeping a straight face, Xue Jian was about to scold the foursome not following the group. But upon seeing Lin Li’s face, he laughed before finishing his sentence twice.\n\"Lin Li, lower your head, just seeing your face ticks me off!!\" Xue Jian got even angrier.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nBeing the target of anger seems a tad unfair; drawing circles on the ground with his foot to curse.\nAfter the scolding, Class Four started to move.\nThe words of adults simply can’t be trusted.\nTheir \"soon\" is never soon; their \"in a little while\" is never in a little while; their hundred meters definitely isn’t just a hundred meters.\n\"Teacher, are you sure the place we’re staying at is only a hundred meters away?\" Having walked what felt like several hundred meters, Lin Li sincerely asked while waiting at the crosswalk.\n\"I said it’s the straight-line distance.\" Xue Jian replied lightly, \"We’re not walking in a straight line now. Also, keep your head down, don’t look my way.\"\nTrue to being a math teacher, precise to the point. Lin Li understood.\nBut appearance-based discrimination is not acceptable.\n\"Why is waiting for the red light called waiting for the red light, aren’t we waiting for the green light?\" At this point, Bai Bufan suddenly posed a question.\nJust as Xue Jian was about to explain it’s meant to wait for the red light to end, Lin Li piped up: \"Raw anchovies or dead anchovies? Fighting fire or putting out fire? Alive before or dead before? Sitting in an elevator or standing in one? Cigarette tip or cigarette butt? One and a half hours or three half-hours?\"\nZhou Baowei chimed in right after: \"Caffeine comes from coffee fruit, then the fruit is the reason, the reason is the fruit? Why is drinking called nightclub, and staying over called hotel?\"\nStill occasionally watching behind, Chen Tianming joined: \"Dante is Italian, Ding Zhen is Chinese. Yielding three points for pedestrians, not yielding, is also three points. The surgery succeeded, my failed life ended, does that count as success?\"\nStop the noise, I’m thinking here.\nXue Jian felt his brain tremble.\nThe strangest things were filling his mind! Why do these kids ask such bizarre questions so fluently!!\nSeeing the look of shock in Xue Jian’s pupils, and in some of those nearby, Lin Li sighed.\nSee, the result of not properly playing dumb phone games while young, only focusing on studying.\n...\nThe destination actually wasn’t quite a hotel, more like a youth base or guesthouse, meant for hosting group activities like this.\nSince the school had already uploaded identity info, Xue Jian’s interaction with the front desk didn’t require each person to show ID again.\nAfter getting their room numbers and each receiving a room card, the four headed to their room.\nOpen it.\nDamn it.\nEverything’s decided by the real thing.\nThat phrase’s worth keeps rising.\nBut it’s alright, just not as luxurious as imagined, still much better regarding space and bed comfort compared to six-person dorms.\nConsidering the autumn outing cost, the value remains satisfactory.\n\"Qiaoqiao’s here; I’ll guide them around, don’t worry, I won’t leave the area.\" Having put his belongings down, Chen Tianming quickly told the group before leaving.\nWere it not for needing to report his itinerary, Lin Li guessed he’d dart off without a word.\n\"Lin Li, you really shouldn’t have helped Tianming get this WeChat.\" Zhou Baowei shook his head, \"Just one weekend, and the suck-up cells have spread all over him.\"\n\"Honestly, the cure for this disease is bringing Tianming to visit the chicken farm to see Feifei; Feifei’s a miracle worker.\" Bai Bufan praised Feifei’s name.\nHe was now a chicken farm believer, convinced it could cure any mind-related illness.\nSince he himself was a living example.\n\"Then prioritize taking me there.\" Zhou Baowei said seriously, \"Truth is, I’m a suck-up as well.\"\n\"Then you’re a suck-up pig.\" Lin Li tested the bed’s firmness, suddenly saying.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Who showers first?\" Zhou Baowei tossed his backpack into the corner and sighed while asking.\n\"Baowei, the way you say ’shower’ sounds weird, use another term next time.\" Lin Li continued.\n\"Huh? What term?\"\nPeople love asking for trouble. Though Zhou Baowei knew no ivory would come from Lin Li’s dog mouth, curiosity couldn’t be resisted.\n\"You’re more suited to say ’get a dip’.\" Lin Li explained.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nSo ruthless.\n\"Or Baowei, you can say ’I, old pig, am going to scrub away the filth’ too.\" Bai Bufan wouldn’t miss any chance to join a humiliate-Baowei contest.\n\"You guys, you guys!\"\n\"I’m going to lose weight! I’ll slim down to a lightning bolt!\" Zhou Baowei was inspired and motivated!\n\"Great chance, I even planned on filming a tribute movie called ’Hot Pot Roll.’ We could collaborate.\" Bai Bufan applauded and suggested to Zhou Baowei.\n\"But... is there a way to quickly burn fat without exercising or controlling diet?\" Zhou Baowei’s three-second enthusiasm trial period expired, making him grin while asking.\n\"There actually is.\" Lin Li thought for a while, then nodded, \"I’ll set it up for you now?\"\n\"What’s it?\" Zhou Baowei asked curiously.\n\"The closest crematorium is 1.2 kilometers away, you can head straight over; I’ll make the appointment now, still on time.\" Lin Li checked his phone, then looked up and said.\n\"I’m not looking for physical fat burning!!\"\nThey say school is a safe hideaway, the last pure soil before entering society’s colorful mess.\nYet when Zhou Baowei left Freshman Year Class Four, why did he discover that society is full of good people?",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Chapter 104: Challenge Failed, Next Challenger Please\nZhou Baowei couldn’t take it anymore and swung his fist at Bai Bufan.\n\"Damn it—it’s not Baowei, it’s Lin Li who’s supposed to cremate you! Why are you hitting me first?\"\nBai Bufan, who was getting hit, dodged while protesting the injustice he felt.\n\"As a strong man, I only swing my fist at those who are stronger. Lin Li has been getting weaker lately and doesn’t deserve to be my opponent. Hitting you doesn’t go against my principles,\" Zhou Baowei said righteously.\nBai Bufan was both amused and exasperated by this grand justification.\n\"You just pick the softest target, don’t you! I swear I’m going to be just like Lin Li and abstain from everything! You all just wait and see!\" Bai Bufan declared before getting beaten up any further.\nThe two ended their fight and their rivalry, while Lin Li got up and walked to the sink to wash his face.\nHe soon discovered that the makeup on his face was troublesome; neither warm nor cold water was ideal for removing it.\nIt was no wonder the expensive cosmetics from the class president remained intact even when wet.\nMakeup shouldn’t stay on the face long term; it’s harmful to the skin, so Lin Li took out his phone.\n\"Lin Li: Madam President, did you bring any makeup remover? It’s hard to get off over here.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Oh, oh, yes, I did. I forgot you have makeup on too.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: I have makeup remover and pads, but we’re also taking off makeup here. Why not come to our dormitory to remove it?\"\n\"Lin Li: Is that convenient? If not, I can wait until you’re done and borrow it and return it later.\"\nIt took Chen Yu Ying half a minute to reply.\n\"Chen Yu Ying: I asked around; it’s convenient. We just got back to the dorm and no one’s going to sleep yet, nothing inconvenient for others to see.\"\n\"Lin Li: Okay.\"\n\"I’ll go remove my makeup.\" Lin Li got the dorm number from Chen Yu Ying and informed the love-struck Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei in the corner before leaving the room.\n\"Knock, knock, knock.\"\n\"It’s me,\" Lin Li said as he knocked on the door.\n\"Just a moment.\" Lin Li recognized Qu Wanqiu’s voice.\nAfter half a minute, the door opened.\nIt was also a four-person room with Chen Yu Ying, Ding Sihan, Qu Wanqiu, and Yu Yu living there.\nQu Wanqiu and Yu Yu were watching a variety show via projection.\n\"There’s a basin of water here, be careful not to step in it,\" Qu Wanqiu warned as she opened the door.\n\"Why is there a basin of water here? Is it a trap?\" Lin Li asked curiously, looking at the setup.\nThis spot was indeed easy to step into by mistake.\n\"Xiao Yu has a bit of rhinitis. The dryer the room is with the air conditioning on, the more uncomfortable she gets, so putting a basin of water under the AC makes her feel a bit better,\" Qu Wanqiu explained, pointing to the AC above the door.\n\"Got it.\"\nThere are many kinds of rhinitis, and some do have these symptoms.\nLin Li himself used to have mild rhinitis, but over the past half month, it almost seemed cured.\nLin Li casually greeted Yu Yu in the corner.\nShe shyly nodded in response.\nI’m doing well with not looking at that challenge; I got a great score of 0.001 seconds, you should try it too.\nLin Li briefly switched his title and still felt the presence there, but it didn’t really matter. He was okay with whatever the outcome of sensing this thunder was.\nApproaching the sink, it felt crowded with three people. Luckily, Ding Sihan seemed nearly done and made way.\n\"You can take my spot. I’m done.\"\n\"Why do you keep facing me?\" Ding Sihan asked, puzzled as she prepared to leave, but Lin Li kept turning towards her.\n\"There’s no surveillance here, so I’m afraid I might accidentally slip in your room and hit my head on a sharp wall corner and die instantly. As a boy entering a wolf’s den, I have to protect myself,\" Lin Li explained sincerely.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"Who holds grudges like you! Besides, we should be the ones protecting ourselves!\" she thought, feeling an urge to shove Lin Li from behind. His worry wasn’t unwarranted after all.\nDing Sihan left in a huff.\n\"This is the makeup remover pad, and this is the remover solution. Here’s how you use them—\" Chen Yu Ying began instructing Lin Li on how to remove makeup.\nWith the help of tools, after about ten minutes, Lin Li’s face finally became clear and free of the haze.\n\"Outer beauty is still more important,\" Lin Li said contentedly, examining his face in the mirror, ensuring no makeup remained.\nChen Yu Ying smiled, continuing to apply stuff on her face.\nIt wasn’t that she was slower at removing makeup than Lin Li, but she had a big skincare routine after makeup removal.\nNo wonder her luggage was so heavy and full, explaining why her skin condition stood out in all of class 1-4.\nNatural talent plus effort couldn’t lose; what else could others compare with her?\nExcept not enough grand allure to resonate with the thunder bringers.\n\"I’ll be leaving then, Madam President.\" After internally complimenting her, Lin Li had no desire to stay any longer and took his leave.\n\"Okay.\"\nLin Li left the sink and returned to the room, ready to leave when he noticed Qu Wanqiu and Ding Sihan eyeing him, whispering suspiciously.\n\"See you, bye-bye.\"\n\"Lin Li, have you been hitting the gym lately?\" Qu Wanqiu asked directly as Lin Li was about to leave.\n\"Not the gym, but I have been working out. How could you tell? Because my figure has become more perfect?\" Lin Li stopped, nodding with a slight pride.\nHis achievements were built on his own sweat—even the sweat the system dripped on Lin Li’s back counted as his own.\n\"Because your head’s become pointy,\" Ding Sihan chimed in out of nowhere.\n\"...\"\n\"Damn.\"\nLin Li responded with a middle finger.\nThen quietly patted his head. Good, nothing wrong, clearly it was just little miss Ding Sihan’s verbal retaliation.\n\"Have you developed abs then?\" Qu Wanqiu asked with interest.\nGirls often have more interest in hidden muscles like pecs or abs.\n\"Skinny guys naturally have abs, but they look different from gym-sculpted ones—they’re irregular and asymmetrical. Honestly, they don’t look good,\" Lin Li answered truthfully.\nAs a reed-thin guy, Lin Li’s abs were noticeable with just slight effort even before he got the system, but he never claimed he had abs.\n\"Can we see them?\" Qu Wanqiu asked expectantly.\n\"?\"\nQu Wanqiu seemed like a perv; Lin Li felt he needed to stay away from her. A guy must protect himself outside.\n\"My mom says not to let random women see my abs, she says that lacks male virtue,\" Lin Li naturally refused.\nIf it were Chen Yu Ying interested, he might hesitate but eventually show her, but Qu Wanqiu? No way.\n\"Tch—\"\n[With the wind and rain, you become a dragon—a unique male capturing attention in this world, making women curious. Conquer this world and exude your charm starting now!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Five: charm and earn more recognition from Ding Sihan, Qu Wanqiu, and Yu Yu.]\n[Task Reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha Sync Index +10; Random Talent*1]\nAnother cold progress bar appeared in front of him.\nLin Li sighed.\nHe turned to face Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu, with a look of resolve, and lifted his shirt hem.\nThen, like a seal, he patted his belly.\n\"See?\"\nLin Li felt somewhat pleased.\nBecause compared to the evening task with Chen Yu Ying, this was much easier—just flashing his abs made the progress jump a bit.\nThe girls couldn’t resist his charm.\nHowever, it seemed the reward was rather stingy—not an ability but a talent, and not even basic system currency.\nIf he could choose tasks from the system, Lin Li might not have bothered with this one.\nAll three covered their eyes, but only Yu Yu did it genuinely. The other two peeked through their fingers with eyes wide as saucers.\n\"Weren’t you supposed to restrain for male virtue?\" Qu Wanqiu asked, unwilling to blink.\n\"You’re not just any women out there, I trust you,\" Lin Li replied with a gentle smile, his voice tender.\nThe progress bar appeared again and came to a halt with a clink.\n\"Lin Li, don’t say it like that. You scare me,\" Ding Sihan said, truly covering her eyes in fear.\nLin Li shook his head and sighed.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Chapter 105: Some fall in love in the wind, some watch the sea at night, some are considered a calamity\n\"You really don’t appreciate it,\" Lin Li resumed talking normally.\nThe progress bar started moving again.\nSo frustrating!\n\"It doesn’t look like fake abs to me, is it really possible to slim down like this?\" After getting a closer look, Qu Wanqiu seemed skeptical and patted her own belly through her clothes, \"I’m pretty slim too, how come I don’t have a six-pack?\"\nBecause you’re actually not slim.\nBut the charming Lin Li would never say that, so he could only say it to himself.\nThough his own abs indeed look better now.\nAfter all, the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique is all about improving the physique, and the nourishment of Spiritual Qi is the same. After half a month, the abdomen lines will definitely look good.\n\"It’s because I’ve been working out, so there’s some sign of training, and an important reason is that I’m holding my breath. If I let it out, it wouldn’t be this tight — ha— ha! Ha!\"\nThe three girls, including Yu Yu who finally dared to open her eyes a bit, all laughed.\nBecause Lin Li had been holding his breath and tightening his belly, but his sentence was too long, and he ran out of breath, couldn’t continue speaking, and started gasping.\n\"See, my abs don’t look as good as they just did,\" Lin Li patted his belly again.\nThe progress bar jumped up again.\nHonesty and self-deprecating humor, it seems, are also a type of charm, and Lin Li’s little tactic worked again.\nHahaha, fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls are really easy to fool!\nThis task is really easy to complete, in less than two minutes it’s already halfway done, so Lin Li could understand the lackluster rewards.\nJust see it as a freebie to sync Mecha indices, originally thought it was meaningless to him, but now it’s not right — he can redeem combat Mechas from the shop.\nHearing Yu Yu’s laughter, Lin Li suddenly thought of something.\nHe changed his title again to \"Thunder Attractor.\"\nOnce again, when Lin Li looked at Yu Yu, she was looking at him as well.\nMore importantly, the stalled progress bar started moving forward steadily at a weak speed.\nThis time it can really be confirmed.\n\"Thunder Attractor\" really treats big thunder as thunder, but the problem is it only treats big thunder as thunder, non-big thunder is instantly expelled from the thunder category, seems a bit too extreme.\nThose with thunder attributes get a sense of closeness from the title with me, at this moment my ’charm’ in this task should come from this sense of closeness.\nCould it be because I spoke about big thunder when discussing with Bai Bufan, so the system automatically corrected this bug within a bug?\nIf only I’d talked a bit more during the discussion.\nLin Li checked the \"Thunder Attractor\" title description again.\n\"...Meanwhile, any moveable related objects or people with thunder attributes around you will subconsciously approach you and have a weak sense of closeness, this effect strengthens as the duration of wearing the title increases, reaching its limit after three days.\"\nWeak and has a limit.\nDarn it! Still a bit disappointing.\nHuh? My thunder technique can absorb... huh?\nHow does this thing absorb? Can it output after absorbing?\nHow exists in my body?\nAfter achieving mastery of my thunder body technique, can I double the output? Can I produce and sell all by myself?\nCan transfer it from one person to another?\nAs a pile of questions swarmed suddenly, Lin Li’s mind couldn’t process them all.\nWhat is this Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body, if it’s like I imagined, it’s basically a holy grail for gynecology, the gospel of tiptoes down!\nGirls might even establish a Lin Clan!\n\"So how do you train? Lin Li? Lin Li? What’s keeping your mind wandering?\" Qu Wanqiu’s voice grew louder and louder.\nLin Li snapped back to reality, this is all speculation, better focus on the task at hand.\nBesides, these guesses are hard to verify.\n\"Since you’re asking so sincerely, I’ll gladly tell you,\" Lin Li began.\nEven he was amazed at himself for early rising these past half months, why wouldn’t these gullible little girls admire him?\n\"...\"\n\"Above all, unwavering self-discipline, strong determination, and relentless courage.\"\n\"That’s the fundamental reason for my drastic change in such a short time.\"\nLin Li finally ended the self-praise segment and then frowned, looking at Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu: \"You two don’t believe me, do you?\"\nThe rate of progress increased rapidly initially but slowed down with my explanation, now there’s only a weak increment from the \"Thunder Attractor\".\n\"No we believe you, haha,\" Ding Sihan clapped.\nHmm.\nDon’t believe.\n\"I opened my heart with difficulty only to be met with doubts, truly disappointing.\" Lin Li felt a bit regretful.\n\"Aw, Lin Li what you said is too fake, waking up before 5 every day for at least an hour of boxing, including weekends, and doing it consistently, who would believe that.\" Qu Wanqiu had an I-want-to-believe-but-it’s-too-ridiculous expression.\n\"Seeing is believing, tomorrow and the day after, I’ll stick to waking up before 5 and boxing for an hour, whether it’s true or not, you can witness it yourselves, how about that?\" Lin Li said with a smile.\nLin Li felt that nothing could demonstrate his charm more than letting them witness his efforts firsthand.\nBecause Lin Li still didn’t know how many people were watching Emiya Shirou’s high jump under that sunset.\nAnyway, he definitely had to complete his training tasks in the next couple of days, so whether he let them watch or not didn’t matter much.\nBeing seventeen, satisfying that little vanity wasn’t a bad thing at all.\n\"Using challenges on me is useless; Yu Ying and I have to get up early to do our makeup, so we might really be up by five,\" Ding Sihan said with more confidence.\n\"That’s even better. Just wait and see tomorrow,\" Lin Li got up, walked to the window, pulled the curtain aside, and pointed to a corner of the field outside the base: \"I’ll be training here tomorrow morning. It’ll be convenient for you to verify.\"\n\"What? Are you serious?\" Ding Sihan was taken aback by Lin Li’s confident and assertive demeanor. \"You wouldn’t just wake up early for appearances and foolishly stand there for an hour, would you? It’s unnecessary.\"\n\"I’m not that bored. You’ll see if I’m serious about training when the time comes,\" Lin Li chuckled.\n\"Alright! If you really can do it, I’ll call you ’Bro’ for a day!\"\n\"Can you change it to ’Dad’?\" Lin Li’s words escaped before he thought about it.\nBut it didn’t matter. Since he had the \"Lightning Inducer\" as a backup, he would complete the task sooner or later.\nBut.\nHold on.\nWhy did the progress bar just tick up again?\nIs it a problem with the system’s logic, or did one of the three girls misjudge his charm?\n\"Fine by me!\" Ding Sihan nodded, \"But if you don’t do it, or if you’re not serious at all, you’ll have to call me ’Mom’ and be my servant for a day. If I say head east, you head east!\"\n\"No problem.\"\n\"I want to join in, too! Count me in, count me in! I’ll be Lin Li’s second mom,\" Qu Wanqiu raised her hand.\n\"You better be ready to be my second daughter,\" Lin Li said calmly.\nChen Yu Ying slowly came out of the bathroom with a face mask on. Upon learning of their bet, she looked amused.\n\"Yu Ying, whose side are you on?\"\n\"I don’t think Lin Li would gamble on something he’s not confident about,\" Chen Yu Ying said after rubbing her cheeks and pondering for a moment.\n\"The class president understands me,\" Lin Li had barely spoken when there was a knock on the door.\n\"Who is it?\" Lin Li asked.\n...\nOn the first night of the autumn trip, Xue Jian planned to check on every room belonging to his class, ensuring they didn’t play too late or get too wild, and to remind them once again about safety and the rules they had to follow.\nHis first stop was Chen Yu Ying’s room, as there were some things he needed to discuss with her.\nDespite having a universal access card issued by the base, he couldn’t just enter girls’ dorms, so Xue Jian knocked on the door.\n\"Knock, knock, knock.\"\n\"Who is it?\"\n\"It’s me, Teacher Xue,\" Xue Jian replied.\n\"Oh, okay, wait a minute, teacher. I’ll open the door for you right away.\"\n\"Alright,\" Xue Jian nodded instinctively and waited.\nWait a second.\nXue Jian paused.\nHe took a step back and looked at the room number. This was indeed Chen Yu Ying’s room.\nWho kept answering him just now? He must have heard wrong. How could he vaguely hear Lin Li’s voice, that troublemaker?\nXue Jian cleaned his ear with his pinky, uncertainly saying, \"Lin Li?\"\n\"I’m here.\"\nIt’s really you!\nXue Jian quickly pulled out the universal access card, swiped it, and entered the room.\nHe looked at Lin Li, who seemed startled standing right in front of him, and loudly demanded, \"How did you get in this room!\"\nBut Lin Li’s gaze was on Xue Jian’s feet, and he stepped back a few paces.\nAn icy sensation spread, and as Xue Jian looked down, he realized he had accidentally kicked over a basin full of water.\nXue Jian’s feet felt cold, and so did Lin Li’s heart.\n\"Teacher, you’re here to wash your feet too, huh? If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave first,\" Lin Li tried to slip past Xue Jian.\n\"Halt.\"\nXiling’s young man, stand at attention!\nGet ready to be scolded~\n...\nYu Yu sat twisting her hands on the bed, not knowing what to do, Chen Yu Ying stifled laughter, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu mopped the floor, Xue Jian scolded, and Lin Li got scolded.\nThe six people depicted a harmonious scene, each with a promising future.",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Chapter 106: But This Place Is Really Nice\n\"Lin Li, oh Lin Li, you always manage to meet me in the most unexpected places!\" Xue Jian said, his middle-aged face serious.\nLin Li immediately remembered their last encounter and then burst out laughing.\nAfter laughing, Lin Li realized he’d messed up, knowing he shouldn’t have laughed at that moment.\nSure enough, Xue Jian’s face darkened instantly: \"Even if you had your reasons, you can’t just use that as an opportunity to go in and out of girls’ rooms willy-nilly. Your thoughts aren’t right. After Mid-Autumn Festival, submit an 800-word reflection.\"\n\"It’s the class monitor who asked me to come over directly.\" Lin Li thought for a moment and decided to drag Chen Yu Ying into it.\nAt least he ought to share the reflection task; she should help him write 400 words. No, better have five people share, so each writes 160 words.\nXue Jian looked at Chen Yu Ying, who was initially watching the drama and felt a bit embarrassed but nodded. She handed over a tissue, letting Xue Jian wipe his shoes.\n\"Yu Ying must have her reasons for doing this.\" Xue Jian nodded, \"You can go back, no need to write the reflection.\"\nLin Li gave a thumbs up, good students do have special privileges.\nHopefully, after the monthly exams, I could enjoy such treatments too.\n...\nOpening his room door, Chen Tianming hadn’t returned yet. The two who were bickering fiercely upon leaving were now lying in a bed together, appreciating one of Japan’s ’Three No-Spray’ films.\nAnd using an IMAX projection.\n\"You guys are really something.\" Listening to the tantalizing sounds in his ears, Lin Li was truly amazed.\n\"Why did you take so long? We’ve already finished blanching. Not sure if there’s enough hot water left, so be aware if you want a shower. Or you could heat it up again.\" Zhou Baowei, leaning on a pillow, watching the subtitles on the projection, advised tactically.\nThe film was played at 3x speed, with frequent fast-forwarding. Clearly, they weren’t watching this film for its intended use; they were just appreciating the plot. True artists indeed.\nThen Lin Li walked up to Zhou Baowei and grabbed his chest.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nBai Bufan: \"!\"\nThe groped Zhou Baowei suddenly covered his butt: \"What are you up to? Bufan! Change to a normal program, else Lin Li might unleash his beastly nature!\"\n\"Applying lard to the hands moisturizes and protects the skin, preventing frostbite.\" Lin Li said flatly.\n\"Makes sense!\" Bai Bufan immediately pressed down on the other side of Zhou Baowei.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nLin Li, having groaned, thought he should’ve used all the hot water for himself when blanching earlier.\nLin Li headed to the bathroom, realizing he had just attempted the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, but it didn’t react at all.\nThe experiment is certainly lacking rigor, but unfortunately, Lin Li couldn’t find suitable experimental tools.\nHe couldn’t just ask Yu Yu if he could cooperate in his experiment.\n...\nAfter the shower, Lin Li joined the viewing segment on the bed.\nThey were watching a Minotaur now.\nQuickly going through the film plot.\n\"Though I’m a pure love warrior, this film is really good, substituting into Huang Mao is truly exhilarating,\" Lin Li remarked.\n\"Though I’m a pure love warrior, this film is really good, substituting into the victim is truly exhilarating,\" Bai Bufan remarked.\n\"Though I’m a pure love warrior, this film is really good, substituting into the heroine is truly exhilarating,\" Zhou Baowei remarked.\nEveryone truly has a bright future.\n\"Knock, knock, knock.\"\n\"There’s still a dog left in the film. Just perfect for Tian Ming to substitute into.\" Being closest to the door, Zhou Baowei got up to open it.\nThen he froze.\nBai Bufan, curious, also sat up to see who it was, then he too stood straight.\nXue Jian slowly walked in.\nThe four of them exchanged glances, creating a silent scene.\nWell, not quite silent; the tantalizing sounds hadn’t stopped yet.\n\"Ah~ ah~ ah~\"\n\"Yamete~\"\nIt was scarier than silence.\nBai Bufan, startled, rushed to stand in front of the screen, attempting to conceal the criminal evidence.\nThis kid was also scared witless; a projection can’t be concealed this way. Instead, it made the plot start playing on his face.\nThe scene wasn’t eerily terrifying anymore, but watching those things play on Bai Bufan’s face and body, the scenario became abstract.\nIf Lin Li hadn’t just gone through the ’don’t laugh challenge’ training, he might’ve laughed again.\nLin Li inwardly scolded Bao Wei for not asking who’s there before opening the door, then sensibly stood up and turned off the projection.\n\"What were you watching?\" Xue Jian, returning after changing into slippers, asked, already knowing the answer.\nLin Li: \"It’s a normal movie.\"\n\"If it’s a normal movie, why is everyone in it naked?\" Xue Jian asked with a cold smile.\n\"The internet is too slow; it hasn’t loaded yet,\" Lin Li replied warmly.\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nThen he sighed, holding his forehead: \"Next door they’re playing Poker; you’re watching films, I don’t even dare imagine what the next dorm will surprise me with. You guys are honestly the hardest group I’ve ever handled.\"\nThere’s no spray this time; truly the toughest batch.\nWith vice and gambling combined, opening the next dorm won’t involve skating, right?\nThe three could only smile wryly.\n\"But when out for fun, I won’t use school rules to spoil your fun. Where’s Chen Tianming, where is the kid?\" Xue Jian was, at this point, rather open-minded. He didn’t disperse the Poker game next door and was even convinced to participate earlier.\nRelaxing with the students is rather nice, but knowing the relaxation content here was probably less suitable to participate in.\n\"Teacher, I’m here!\" Chen Tianming returned timely, \"I was room-hopping.\"\n\"Okay, let me remind you...\" Xue Jian reiterated some rules and then prepared to leave.\n\"This stuff you should watch less, it’s unhealthy for the body. The younger you are, the more you should cherish your body, don’t wait to regret it at my age.\" Xue Jian said before leaving.\nThe message was quite extensive.\n\"Sad! Old Jian isn’t up to it anymore!\" Zhou Baowei lamented on the ground.\nXue Jian returned when he opened the door.\nZhou Baowei now didn’t know whether to cry or not.\nMessed up!\nBut Xue Jian wasn’t back for Zhou Baowei, pointing at Lin Li and Bai Bufan: \"Thinking over it, you two can watch a bit more here, but just finish watching here, and don’t go to any places with dubious reputation, understood?\"\nLin Li, Bai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Understood.\"\nOnly then did Xue Jian truly leave.\nZhou Baowei couldn’t cry, so he started laughing.\n\"What happened? What were you watching?\" Chen Tianming, who had just returned, looked utterly confused, but then he didn’t mind and instead opened his suitcase, flipping it open on the floor, rapidly taking out clothes:\n\"What do you think about this outfit on me, or this one? Lin Li, you’re about my height, do you have any really cool clothes? Help a brother out and match me!\"\n\"What’s up? Are you going on a date tomorrow?\" Lin Li inquired curiously.\n\"Yeah, yeah, I’m meeting Qiaoqiao for a date tomorrow!\" Chen Tianming nodded emphatically.\n\"You call that a damn date? We’re all going to Pingjiang Amusement Park, isn’t meeting up normal?\" Lin Li couldn’t hold back.\n\"Oh well anyway, I’m not hanging with you guys at the park tomorrow, does this outfit work? Never mind, you two have no sense of aesthetics, Lin Li, what do you think?\" Chen Tianming turned to Lin Li.\nBai Bufan and Zhou Baowei didn’t mind either; they enthusiastically left the room, planning to join the Poker game next door.\nAnd to share the amazing experience they just had.\nIt would definitely leave Wang Ze and his crew astonished.\n\"Did you bring a suit?\" Lin Li frowned and asked.\n\"Who wears a suit in September? It’s so hot, although a suit would look nice.\" Chen Tianming shook his head.\n\"Then let me change your hairstyle. I guarantee you’ll have Qiaoqiao wrapped around your finger.\" Lin Li nodded a bit regretfully, then said.\n\"Okay! I trust you, Lin Li!\"\nThree minutes later.\n\"This hairstyle... is it Hannibal?\"\nWhen Lin Li brought Chen Tianming in front of the mirror, he squinted skeptically.\n\"It’s a unisex hairstyle, suitable for both men and women, an all-purpose style, and if you had a suit, it would be even more perfect.\" Lin Li countered earnestly.\n\"Is this a Hannibal style?\" Chen Tianming, squinting, questioned as Lin Li brought him to the mirror.\n\"Yeah, it can cut through both men and women, a universal hairstyle. With a suit, it’d be perfect.\" Lin Li genuinely explained.",

Of course, just to have a look, and after that, he would return to study.\nLin Li’s diary.\n9:10 AM: Playing cards.\n9:30 AM: Playing cards.\n9:50 AM: Playing cards.\n10:10 AM: Lin Li, oh Lin Li! How could you fall so far? Have you forgotten the study plan you set earlier? Confucius said, \"I reflect upon myself three times a day.\" You can’t go on like this.\n10:30 AM: Playing cards.\n...\n\"My life is like walking on thin ice, can I really make it into the top hundred in my grade?\" Lin Li returned to his room, plunged into regret.\nBai Bufan and Zhou Baowei were quite pleased, as they were playing the role of useless companions, willing to give their chips to Lin Li, rather than let him leave to study.\nBedtime.\nLin Li also realized something: over the past six months, Bai Bufan, Chen Tianming and the others have had a truly difficult time, maybe he should scold them a bit less in the future.\n\"Buzz---!!! Thud thud!! Buzz---!!! Thud thud!!\"\nHe opened his eyes, confused.\nIt must’ve been his imagination, who would drive a tractor into the room?\nTurning his head, the tractor driver Zhou Baowei was sound asleep.\nBut heroes always make an entrance, Galio arrived.\n\"Baowei, wake up.\" Bai Bufan skillfully flipped over onto Zhou Baowei and, without hesitation, gave him a solid wake-up slap.\n\"Slap!\"\n\"What’s happening?\" The tractor stopped, and the slapped-awake Zhou Baowei mumbled in confusion.\n\"Take a sleeping pill, prepare to sleep.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nSeeing Zhou Baowei awake, Bai Bufan returned to his spot, turning to Lin Li, who wasn’t quite used to this scene yet.\n\"Lin Li, use your time wisely, in about three minutes, steady snoring will begin, in ten minutes, chaotic snoring will follow.\nIf I’m already asleep by then, just go slap Baowei; don’t worry, you don’t have to hold back, he’s used to it.\"\nThe fact is, irregular snoring is truly terrifying.\nIf the snoring is regular, you can force yourself to sleep using it as white noise, but irregular snoring, which can’t be predicted, is pure torture.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Thank you for all your hard work over the years.\" Lin Li said with genuine sincerity.\n\"It’s okay, everyone is used to it, plus Baowei usually goes to sleep quite late by himself, tonight this jerk probably drank a lot next door.\"\nIt was clear they were used to it, after all, the series of moves was so smooth, it couldn’t be done like this without practice.\nFortunately, Lin Li hadn’t been getting sufficient sleep recently, and with today’s Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique focusing on odd-numbered physical Chapters, not even three minutes had passed before Lin Li fell asleep.\n...\n\"Beep beep beep! Beep beep beep!\"\nThe familiar magical sound of the Apple alarm clock rang out, and Lin Li opened his eyes.\n\"Slap!\" At this moment, a clear slap landed on Zhou Baowei’s face.\nBai Bufan, full of resentment, said, \"Baowei, turn off your damn Apple!\"\n\"Huh? Oh! I didn’t set an alarm...\" Zhou Baowei murmured, still dazed.\n\"Bullshit! You’re the only one of the four of us using Apple, hurry up! It’s annoying!\" Bai Bufan slapped him again.\n\"I can’t turn off the alarm! It really might not be my alarm!\"\n\"You’re the only one using Apple, and it’s not yours! Slap! Turn it off quickly!\"\nThe three slaps you took for me were of great value.\nLin Li quietly turned off the alarm.\nIt was now 4:40 AM.\n[Low-grade Spirit Stone*1.]\nAnother low-grade spirit stone was acquired, but today, spiritual qi Chapters wouldn’t be practiced; it would be kept in the [Warehouse] for now.\nLin Li quickly arrived at the designated open space from last night.\nHe looked for Chen Yu Ying and her room, the curtains were still closed, it seemed they hadn’t woken up yet.\nLin Li set up his phone at the side so they couldn’t deny it when he finished his practice, and then began the exercises.\n...\n\"Lin Li, do you really exercise like this every day?\" Chen Yu Ying’s pleasant voice drifted over on the morning breeze from nearby.\nLin Li turned his head and saw Chen Yu Ying, wearing a cute bear-head hairband, rubbing her cheeks to reduce the slight puffiness that comes naturally from waking up, all while looking surprised.\n\"Have my girls woken up yet, so they don’t deny it later.\" Even though Lin Li’s physical condition now allowed him to exercise for an hour straight without breaks, he took advantage of this time to rest for a few minutes, grabbing a nearby bottled water for big gulps.\n\"Wanqiu is still sleeping, and Si Han is at the window, afraid of disturbing others, so she has been sending you messages and calling, but you haven’t noticed.\" Chen Yu Ying explained as she pointed towards the room.\n\"No notification, that’s how it is.\" Lin Li turned his head to see Ding Sihan at the window, waving to her.\nShe responded with a middle finger.\n\"She asked me to come and see if you’re slacking off.\" Chen Yu Ying said with a smile.\n\"Sweat can’t lie, plus I recorded a video.\"\n\"I believe you, I’ve been standing here for two minutes already, you’re super focused.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"How do you trust just like that? I wanted you to smell my sweat.\"\n\"You’re a real creep.\"\n\"Hey, by the way, having seen my charming side, won’t my image as class monitor in your mind upgrade from ’creep’?\" Lin Li asked with a smile.\n\"How about ’self-disciplined creep’?\" Chen Yu Ying tilted her head, exhaling with a faint smile.\n\"That way others might mistake ’self-disciplined’ for describing the creepiness, I prefer ’creepily disciplined’.\" Lin Li offered a better suggestion.\n\"Okay, your image is updated, from today, you’re ’creepily disciplined’.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nFinished with the water, Lin Li twisted the empty bottle into a twirl, then popped the cap off.\n\"Bang!\"\nThe bottle cap flew high.\nLin Li watched it soar into the sky, then, waiting for it to land, picked it up and tossed both the cap and bottle into the trash bin.\n\"Then, class monitor, I’ll continue working out, I haven’t met today’s time quota yet.\" Lin Li said.\n\"Do you want me to get you a bottle of water?\" Chen Yu Ying asked upon seeing Lin Li’s actions.\n\"My stomach is not good.\" Lin Li replied.\n\"Huh? Can’t drink too much water? Is hot water okay?\" Chen Yu Ying didn’t comprehend.\n\"Can’t refuse a free meal.\" Lin Li winked.\n\"Wait a moment then.\" Chen Yu Ying laughed, then left.\nLin Li watched Chen Yu Ying’s retreating figure.\nSummer sleepwear is really short, indeed so white and slender, quite attractive.\n...\n\"Class monitor, why aren’t you going back, don’t you need to do your makeup?\"\nSeeing Chen Yu Ying not only return with water but also sat nearby, Lin Li curiously asked.\n\"I’m going to stay out for a while, letting the puffiness subside, I’ll go back soon, keep on with your practice.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nThe drowsy Ding Sihan by the window, now seemed very spirited.\nHolding a camera, clicking away.\nThe picture gradually freezes.\nThe first light of dawn shines, golden sunlight filtering through treetops, falling on Chen Yu Ying, who sits quietly on the bench like a flower blossoming in the morning dew.\nThe girl’s long hair gently flows over her shoulders, swinging with her lightly swaying legs.\nLin Li was practicing, which Ding Sihan didn’t understand but seemed very powerful, every motion was full of strength.\nLooks like I’m only balanced when consuming everything.\nDing Sihan looked at her captured photo, excitedly slapping her thigh.\nThe image was perfect.\nHer Ying Bao, cute! Pure! Beauty!\nToday’s scenery with sunlight breeze and treetops, just right!\nLin Li nearby, well, he was just a guy!\nAt this moment, time seemed to freeze, the girl, breeze, dawn, treetops, and that unnecessary boy nearby, all together formed a beautiful picture.\n——From Ding Sihan, purely subjective, purely malicious.\n--\nBeginning of the month asking for votes.\nGive me your votes, I’ll do anything.\n\"Yay\" \"Blushing white-eyed\" \"Yay\"\nor2",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Chapter 108: Is the Light Novel Really True or False\n[Get up before 5:00 AM continuously for one month to diligently practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, accumulating at least half an hour before 7:00 AM (7/30)]\nWhen the exercise task was completed, Chen Yu Ying had long gone back.\nLetting out a long breath of turbid air, Lin Li turned his head to look out the window and saw Qu Wanqiu and Yu Yu’s faces. No wonder the progress on his task five had been steadily increasing, with just one final push needed to complete it.\nFeeling how charming he was, he hoped they wouldn’t become infatuated with him.\nWaving goodbye to the two, Lin Li put his hands in his pockets and swaggered away.\nAfter making sure they couldn’t see him, Lin Li scratched his butt and pulled out the pants that were stuck in the crease due to sweat.\nLuckily he checked the window just now.\nHe used to have no such reservations in front of Xiaozhou.\nHe returned to his dorm, ready for a shower.\nBai Bufan and Zhou Baowei were still lying in bed, while Chen Tianming was already up and fussing over himself. As for his fussing, Lin Li’s assessment was it was like putting fecal matter on a dung beetle.\n\"Lin Li, where have you been?\" Bai Bufan asked, barely opening one eye.\n\"I’m covered in sweat. You guess what I went out to do?\"\n\"Wrestle with Wang Ze,\" Bai Bufan analyzed rationally, offering an answer.\n\"Exactly.\" Lin Li yawned, opened his backpack, and searched for clothes.\n\"Lin Li, do you think this wavy hairstyle suits me?\" Chen Tianming asked Lin Li, somewhat expectantly.\nLin Li shook his head.\n\"Then what hairstyle do you think suits me? Let’s forget about yesterday’s rare style,\" Chen Tianming decided to trust Lin Li once more.\n\"Tombstone style.\"\n\"Get lost.\" Chen Tianming decided never to trust Lin Li again.\nAfter showering and simply washing the clothes, letting them dry in the machine, it was already close to 6:30. However, the assembly time at the door is 7:20, so Bai Bufan and the others were still not up.\nThe departure was at 7:30, and the base was about a 20-minute drive from Pingjiang Amusement Park, catching the park’s opening time at 8:00 to be the first batch of tourists.\nAfter working out for an hour, Lin Li was already hungry, so he left the room alone to head to the breakfast area included in the accommodation fee at the base.\nUnexpectedly, they were still assigned the task of bringing breakfast for those few animals, even during an autumn outing.\nLove is often feeling indebted.\nLately, Lin Li often felt indebted to Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei; it seems this is love.\nDamn, am I actually gay?\nSurely I can’t genuinely owe them something, right?\nAfter photographing the types of breakfast and sending it to them for their choices, Lin Li carried big bags and headed back.\nAt the entrance of the breakfast area, he saw Chen Yu Ying and the other three approaching.\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu avoided Lin Li’s gaze, hiding behind Chen Yu Ying and Yu Yu.\nTrying to play dead? No way.\nLin Li chuckled, blocking the door: \"You two know what to do, or else don’t think about getting through this door.\"\nSeeing this, Chen Yu Ying laughed, pulling Yu Yu aside, indicating she would not shield them.\n\"Oh, stop it, Dad, Dad, is that okay! Tch—\" Ding Sihan initially wanted to resist, but Lin Li’s gaze made her too uncomfortable, surrendering in defeat, her voice dejected.\n\"Ah! My little Dingding!\" Lin Li’s smile was benevolent.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Dad...\" Qu Wanqiu also called out helplessly.\n\"Ah! My little Tweettweet!\" Lin Li’s smile was even more benevolent.\nQu Wanqiu: \"?\"\n\"Alright, you can go in now, permission granted for breakfast,\" Lin Li comfortably nodded, finally stepping aside.\nA few girls from other classes were following the four.\nWhen Lin Li finished reveling, ready to step aside and apologize for blocking their path, he saw several girls shaking their heads vigorously like rattles: \"We don’t need to eat, we don’t need to eat, we don’t have to shout, right?!\"\nThen they fled, without a moment’s hesitation.\nNo one mentioned they need to acknowledge a dad to eat breakfast here?\nHow could this place be like this! No wonder it’s so cheap! Sure enough, there’s a catch.\n\"Hey! Buddies! No, sisters! No! Eh!\" Lin Li took a second to realize their misunderstanding, but they were already gone when he tried to explain.\n\"Bu Hao, I have a vague feeling of being scolded again,\" Lin Li gave up the chase and squinted his eyes.\n...\nLin Li was actually Spider-Man, that was his spider-sense reacting just now.\nClass Dad Lin Li was once again disciplined by Xue Jian.\nOld Jian’s scolding has become so smooth recently that Lin Li only regained his freedom after promising not to make himself anyone’s dad again.\nWith Bai Bufan and others boarding the bus, Lin Li sat in his usual spot, realizing afterward that Bai and Zhou also silently sat behind him.\nClearly, the seat next to him was empty.\nLin Li turned back: \"Why not sit next to me?\"\n\"Do you want to humiliate us twice before you’re satisfied?\" Bai Bufan gave him the middle finger.\n\"Lin Li, I’ve come to understand your nature. I’d rather sit next to a stray dog by the roadside than sit next to you.\" Zhou Baowei cursed more vividly.\n\"Agreed!\" Bai Bufan nodded heavily.\nLin Li sighed, looking at Bai Bufan with a ’you idiot’ gaze: \"You’re still standing in support here? Care to guess which stray dog Baowei just mentioned?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nBai Bufan mechanically turned to look at Zhou Baowei, pointing at himself sitting beside Baowei: \"Could it be me?\"\nZhou Baowei looked at Bai Bufan on his left and the window on his right, sincerely shaking his head: \"No, look at that window, doesn’t it look just like a stray dog by the roadside? Of course, I was referring to it.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Baowei, you %#@&* (flower talk).\"\nThe two quickly patched things up, Lin Li smiled lightly, hiding his merits and fame.\nThis was indeed the strategy of driving tigers to swallow wolves.\nBless you, bless you.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan were loyal too. The four roommates sat in the six seats in front; they could have sat in the front, but seeing him sitting alone, they came to sit next to him, not leaving him alone.\nThough Lin Li didn’t mind.\nHis great daughter was not a petty person, it seemed, not whispering anything bad about him at least, a decent human at best.\nUnfortunately, this time, Chen Yu Ying boarding the bus didn’t trigger any task.\n[Task Five Completed.]\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha Sync Ratio +10; Random Artistry*1]\nThe title quietly nourished Task Five after Yu Yu boarded the bus, and it was already just one step away; now it was complete.\n[You have acquired the artistry: Singing]\nBetter than ballet a bit, but still just the icing on the cake because Lin Li considered himself a singing god already.\nSuddenly, Lin Li had many skills in singing, such as vocal techniques, in his mind, but this ability, like ballet, didn’t appear on Lin Li’s panel.\nOn the way to Pingjiang Amusement Park, everyone was quiet because quite a few of them, including Lin Li, chose to take a nap in the bumpy twenty minutes.\nDing Sihan and Chen Yu Ying were also catching up on sleep, leaning against each other.\nLight novels are deceitful.\nAt this time, shouldn’t Chen Yu Ying sway with the vehicle’s motion, and unknowingly lean on my shoulder, being all dreamy?\nWith this thought, Lin Li also closed his eyes and fell asleep.\n\"Alright, those who are asleep wake up, everyone, disembark in an orderly fashion, don’t scatter after disembarking, stay together...\"\nAwoken.\nLight novels are true.\nWhen Lin Li was woken by Xue Jian’s voice, he found they were leaning against each other.\nThe only flaw was that he was leaning on Chen Yu Ying’s shoulder, a bit like reversing the role of the Big Dipper.\nHowever, a girl, even if it’s her shoulder, is really fragrant and soft.\nLin Li found his arm unusually uncomfortable.\nChen Yu Ying seemed not to be awake yet, so Lin Li immediately sat up straight and instinctively touched his mouth. Fortunately, he didn’t drool in his sleep, or else he’d be utterly embarrassed.\nChen Yu Ying then woke up, stretched elegantly yet restrainedly, with her gaze seemingly avoiding Lin Li.\nLin Li squinted: \"Class president, did you wake up earlier?\"\nChen Yu Ying pursed her lips, her cheeks slightly flushed at being caught, yet somewhat indignant as she said: \"Lin Li, you’re too chatty.\"\nThen she rubbed her shoulders, having one leaning on the left and another on the right. Sitting in the middle was indeed too heavy an experience.\nNext time, she would rather sit... never mind, sitting in the middle it is.\n\"Class president, it’s not that my EQ is low; it’s just that I have thick skin and won’t feel awkward, so I simply wanted to see you embarrassed.\" Lin Li laughed heartily, getting his answer.\nChen Yu Ying faking sleep was indeed to avoid making Lin Li awkward.\nBut she overthought.\nPerverts, especially disciplined good perverts, won’t be embarrassed.\n\"Hmph!\"\nChen Yu Ying decided in her heart to put a spiked board on her right shoulder next time.\nLet it pierce Lin Li to death.",

      "content": "Chapter 117: Chapter 109: Courage Is the Funeral Song of Humanity\nThe bus stopped at the entrance of Pingjiang Amusement Park.\nAlthough today is Friday, perhaps because many schools are on autumn break, and amusement parks are popular autumn excursion destinations, there was already a small crowd of visitors who arrived before the park opened, mostly students.\nMoreover, many schools obviously have mandatory uniforms.\nAs the students from Nansang arrived, the number of people increased.\n\"This is the homeroom teacher of Class 17, Teacher Wang Ziyan, and this is the homeroom teacher of Class 6, Teacher Zhou Pei. If you encounter any situation or difficulty in the amusement park, you can ask any of us for help via your phone...\"\nAfter entering the amusement park, it’s impossible to move as a group anymore; students will certainly be allowed to play according to their wishes. Therefore, while distributing the group tickets taken from the ticket counter, Xue Jian emphasized safety issues again and again to everyone.\nThe homeroom teachers of the other two classes are quite young, one male and one female, they look like they just graduated from college not long ago, yet they are already homeroom teachers, starting their career at such a young age down a path of no return.\nThese days, even a prince wants to become a teacher.\nLin Li and the others quickly got their tickets.\nThere’s some mystery on the ticket, after scanning it with a phone and entering the e-ticket, an option pops up allowing you to choose eight attractions you most want to play.\nAfter entering the park, you only need to scan the e-ticket at the entrance of the corresponding attraction to have a chance to use the fast pass once, so even when it’s crowded, you can at least play the attractions you want once.\nFast passes that require payment elsewhere are provided for free here, which is quite thoughtful.\nHowever, for popular attractions, using the fast pass doesn’t necessarily mean it’s quick.\nBut since it’s free, there’s nothing to complain about.\n\"What do you plan to choose?\" Lin Li looked at Zhou Baowei and Bai Bufan, asking.\nAs an all-ages large amusement park, the attractions in Pingjiang Amusement Park are of various types, covering all sorts of attributes.\nInside the amusement park, Lin Li still plans to hang out with Bai Bufan and the others rather than with Chen Yu Ying and her group, aside from having initially agreed, it’s indeed more relaxing to play with buddies than with girls.\nIt’s not that Lin Li thinks the projects girls choose are childish or boring.\nDon’t even mention it.\nDamn it, that lunatic Ding Sihan, as soon as she got off the bus, pointed to the longest and largest roller coaster with inverted sections in the distance, immediately saying she’s going to ride it ten times today.\nQu Wanqiu even said directly that she’ll do it twenty times.\nCompared to them, Lin Li seemed more like a rookie who prefers carousels and Barbie dolls.\nFor this ultra-long roller coaster that even requires upside-down suspension, Lin Li still feels a bit daunted.\nIt might be a bit overly thrilling.\nTherefore, it’s better to show fear in front of the guys than in front of the girls.\nAnd Zhou Baowei, looking at his phone, then looked excited: \"Isn’t there a recommendation for the most thrilling options here, so let’s just pick these eight, after playing them all we can even get a warrior badge.\nInto the Sky, Canglong Roller Coaster, Log Flume, Tianshan Hospital... too bad, bungee jumping is an additional fee item, 80 per person, so expensive, otherwise we could have jumped ten or eight times.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nFuck you, Zhou Baowei, when I’m getting married in the future, you need to sit with Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu.\nLin Li wore a calm expression and didn’t speak, because he knew someone would act more cowardly than him first.\n\"Hey, are you trying to kill me!\" Bai Bufan stepped back half a step, \"Bao Wei, I really can’t handle excessive weightlessness, I’m also afraid of heights, playing things like the log flume is already my limit, this spin-dive machine and roller coasters that spin in the sky, I’ll definitely die riding them.\"\n\"No, I checked, in the twelve years since Pingjiang Amusement Park opened, there hasn’t been a single death, you won’t die, at most break an arm or a leg,\" Zhou Baowei denied.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nToo rigorous, buddy.\nYou’ve mastered the essence of comforting from Lin Li.\nBai Bufan looked at the ’calm and collected’ Lin Li, just like Lin Li knows his bravery, he also knows Lin Li’s courage is only a bit bigger than his, so Bai Bufan spoke again:\n\"Bao Wei, it’s meaningless if only the two of us decide, for the sake of democracy so all of us can have fun, we can only go with majority rule!\"\n\"So now the crucial vote lies with you, Lin Li, who are you going to stand with?\"\nReceiving the signal, Lin Li gave Bai Bufan a ’you know it’, ’leave it to me’ look.\n\"So, what do you say, Lin Li?\"\nZhou Baowei sighed, looking at the two exchanging meaningful glances, his goal has already become to strive to retain at least one or two thrilling attractions for the fast pass.\nAs for just playing by himself, Zhou Baowei feels it’s better to enjoy ’boring’ attractions with friends, it would be more fun.\nFriends are the highest configuration.\nSeeing Zhou Baowei agree, the plan was a success.\nLin Li laughed heartily.\nThen stopped laughing.\n\"I fully support Bao Wei’s idea, let’s choose the eight most thrilling ones.\" He said.\n\"Great! Bao Wei, did you hear that, so we... huh?\" Bai Bufan, realizing halfway through his chuckle, stopped chuckling.\nHe turned his head, pressing his forehead against Lin Li’s, staring at Lin Li like a Piggy Hero meme: \"Lin Li, what did you say?\"\nLin Li, like a soulless shell, smiled without warmth: \"I said, if we’re going to play, let’s play the most thrilling ones.\"\nScrew the system.\nWhat changed Lin Li’s mind was, of course, the task just issued.\n[Today’s chance to enter Pingjiang Secret Realm, naturally a series of trials before opportunity, crises arise, but a cultivator should have a determined heart to move forward, how can they be scared and weak? They must sweep through and pass the secret realm, earning the warrior’s proof!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task 5: With a fearless and carefree stance, surpass the eight challenges of the Pingjiang Secret Realm.]\n[Rewards: Physical Improvement: 100% increase in body control ability; Random Skill *1; System Currency *100.]\nWhat else could he do?\nDo it!\nBut Bai Bufan didn’t know, he only knew he was betrayed again, and now, trembling his lips, he couldn’t utter a word.\n\"A wise choice, Lin Li!\" There’s always someone happy when another is sad, Zhou Baowei excitedly patted Lin Li on the shoulder, very pleased with Lin Li’s growth, then looked at Bai Bufan: \"Bufan, you said it yourself, minority obeys majority, now you no longer have the right to refuse.\"\n\"I think... how about we reconsider for a bit? Come to think of it, logically speaking, the truth often lies in the hands of a minority, so the majority should follow the minority. You two should listen to me.\" Bai Bufan always had his own logic.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nYou have way too many damn reasonings.\nLin Li and Bao Wei exchanged a glance.\n\"You do have a point.\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan and nodded.\nSeeing there was room for discussion, Bai Bufan immediately got excited: \"Right! Lin Li, think it over some more! Wouldn’t it be nice to do something relaxing? Imagine us riding a carousel, all heroic and manly, with gleaming armor! How masculine and grand that would be!\"\nApologize to masculinity and grandeur on my behalf.\n\"Let me think about it.\" But Lin Li frowned and fell into contemplation.\nBai Bufan naturally started his relentless persuasion from the side, determined to win Lin Li over.\n\"Is it done?\" Lin Li suddenly spoke.\n\"Finished what?\" Bai Bufan was puzzled.\n\"All set.\" Zhou Baowei nodded.\n\"Alright, let’s get ready to enter the park.\" Lin Li turned around and walked away.\n\"Wait, what’s happening here? Before entering, we should discuss which fast track to choose!\" Bai Bufan felt sidelined as he watched the two walk away.\nUntil he saw Zhou Baowei holding his own phone.\nBai Bufan touched his empty pocket and swallowed hard.\nBu Hao, just now was a classic misdirection! A crafty diversion! A nefarious conspiracy! Collaboration with evil!\n\"How is my phone in your hand!\"\n\"Huh? How it’s in my hand, no idea. Here you go.\" Zhou Baowei’s acting was so poor, Bai Bufan couldn’t be bothered to comment.\nBai Bufan took a deep breath, unlocking his phone.\nGood news, no extra 200,000 in it.\nBad news, eight projects already submitted.\nHaha.\n\"Doing this, I’ll make you regret it!\" Bai Bufan roared, looking at the backs of the two.\nThis behavior of deciding without him had touched Bai Bufan’s sore spot, he couldn’t forgive.\nActing carefree all the time doesn’t mean he had no bottom line!\n\"Haha.\"\nLin Li and Zhou Baowei didn’t even bother to turn back.\nBai Bufan took out his phone, maxed out beauty mode, and added bunny ears effect, snapping a photo, making sure to give them a piece of his mind.\nThen he sulkily followed behind, now left with no choice but to hang around these lowlifes.\nScanned the tickets, followed the two to find a spot by the side to sit — the park gate wasn’t open yet, passing through the turnstile only led to a buffering queue area.\n\"Life is like being flipped over a skillet, either getting burned out or feeling the thrill.\" Zhou Baowei comforted Bai Bufan, who looked soulless.\n\"Society, like a forced flip, either resist or enjoy.\" Lin Li nodded, speaking to Bai Bufan and himself.\n\"Though crude, your reasoning isn’t wrong, but this is too crude!\" Bai Bufan responded with a middle finger, then looking at the park’s interior which could now be seen more clearly — the heights and curves of those terrifying rides were also more visible.\nSo Bai Bufan sighed deeply: \"Why must you seek such troubles, isn’t living peacefully better?\"\n\"Courage is man’s ode, have you heard of Ozaki’s Eight Challenges? Ozaki Kono mentioned that once humans pass these eight challenges, they can achieve transcendence, and what we’re participating in now is the simplified Pingjiang Eight Challenges. Believe me, once you pass them, transformation awaits.\" Zhou Baowei patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder.\n\"The Ozaki Eight Challenges? I know, fire’s purification, village’s banquet, relative’s gift, dish’s packing, wife’s remarriage, child’s renaming, grass two meters, tomb’s uprooting. Once done, weight including human and box is five kilos, definitely a transformation.\" Bai Bufan smiled, pallid.\nBai Bufan already joined Fei Sect, convinced the only thing that causes transformation in the world is Feifei from the chicken farm.\nFei Sect’s greatness needs no words.\nAside from that, anything about Ozaki’s Eight Challenges is backward superstitious rubbish.\nZhou Baowei: \"When the real banquet starts, make sure to invite me, I’ll be sitting at the kids’ table, packing the smoke and wine.\"\nLin Li: \"If there’s a real remarriage, prioritize considering me, no need for the kids.\"\nPassing by Wang Ze: \"Did I hear about uprooting? Who’s getting uprooted? Doesn’t matter, count me in, uproot first then talk!\"\nBai Bufan chose to smile.\nIf Liu Bang showed up, he’d have to shout a big Chu Sheng seeing these three.\nLife is like Tao Zhe, everything must be solved with one’s own hands; Bai Bufan thought he must find an opportunity to deal with these three lowlifes.\n\"It’s about to open, let’s go.\" Zhou Baowei spotted staff standing by the barrier, holding its switch, so he stood up and said to the two.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan stood up quickly.\n\"That seems to be the entrance for the Canglong roller coaster; let’s dash there immediately, and we can ride it without needing the fast track, then once we finish the ride, surely there’ll be more people, allowing us to use the fast track again for optimal efficiency.\" Zhou Baowei said expectantly.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan sat back down, swiftly.\nWhile walking, Zhou Baowei discovered there wasn’t a soul behind him: \"?\"\n\"When going out to have fun, why be so busy like a special forces soldier? Leisure is the true essence of fun.\" Bai Bufan poured mineral water in the bottle cap, blew on it a couple of times like drinking tea, and finished it in one go.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Bao Wei, be considerate of Bai Bufan. We only have one Bai Bufan; don’t play him to death.\" Lin Li said.\nUnlike Bai Bufan, Lin Li didn’t fear the Pingjiang Eight Challenges but couldn’t enjoy them like Zhou Baowei, so one time of torment was enough, doing it more seemed redundant.\n\"Thank you, Lin Li, indeed you’re good to me.\" Bai Bufan was genuinely touched.\nLin Li was a good person; when he eventually decided to deal with him, he would make it quick, Zhou Baowei must be slowly executed.\nLin Li smiled warmly.\nHe still owed us thanks.",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Chapter 110: The Wilderness, Humans Are Born of Mothers!\n\"Then we should at least go for one ride, we can’t waste the time when there are the fewest people, right?\" Zhou Baowei agreed, though rationally analyzed.\n\"Let’s ride the roller coaster.\" Bai Bufan suddenly agreed.\n\"You can do it now?\" Both Zhou Baowei and Lin Li were a bit surprised.\n\"Yes, let’s go on that roller coaster. That one looks the most thrilling and suitable for us.\" Bai Bufan pointed in a direction, eyes shining with excitement.\nLin Li looked over and then fell silent.\nIn a large amusement park, there’s not just one roller coaster, some even have seven or eight in a single area. The Canglong is just the most exciting one in Pingjiang Amusement Park.\nThe roller coaster Bai Bufan was pointing at now was another one.\nThis roller coaster covers about 500,000 square centimeters and can accommodate up to two people at a time. The highest point of the track is about 300 centimeters from the ground, and even Cultivator Lin Li would have to jump up to reach it.\nIn the middle of the roller coaster, there’s a terrifying dragon statue that glitters with multicolored lights, spinning endlessly and making noises: \"Milky, milky, I am milky!\"\nZhou Baowei looked at the amusement park’s electronic map on his phone, which had an introduction: \"Cute Dragon Soaring, suitable for ages 3-7. Bufan, it’s smaller than your shoe size — does this thrill your currency?\"\n\"I want to take a photo with the milky dragon, can’t I? It’s all dragons, the milky dragon is similar to the Canglong. Why don’t we skip the Canglong and focus on the milky dragon?\" Bai Bufan argued righteously.\n\"Those who like the milky dragon really should line up and get swept by machine gun fire.\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"Don’t be like that, a lot of kids like the milky dragon.\" Bai Bufan defended the milky dragon.\nLin Li pondered for a while and then provided a solution:\n\"Just lower the muzzle.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nNo response came, Lin Li truly was a devil.\nAt eight o’clock, the barricade was opened on time, and a crowd of people rushed in.\nThe three finally decided to first go play a moderately thrilling castle drift, to warm up for the rapids adventure.\nExperience complete.\nThe project wasn’t too thrilling; it was just drifting in a dark, haunted setting. Apart from occasionally getting surprised in the front seat, there was nothing else worth mentioning.\n\"Lin Li, did you hear that? The woman behind us kept saying she was afraid of the dark and ghosts when she was playing,\" Bai Bufan asked Lin Li on their way out after it was over.\n\"I heard, she kept screaming, so annoying, and the perfume smell was insanely strong.\" Lin Li nodded, full of disdain.\nThe smell was so pungent, the longer he smelled it, the more he missed the bus’s aroma.\n\"Then tell me, why when the dark and ghost combined, was she no longer scared?\" Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li, indicating his gaze behind him.\nLin Li turned his head slightly, only to find that the woman behind them was holding hands with a black ghost.\nCase solved, half of the perfume smell they just detected probably came from this black ghost.\nEspecially foreigners like black ghosts, to cover up armpit odor, they spray perfume like it’s free.\nLin Li turned back to look at Bai Bufan, his expression very serious at that moment: \"Bufan, never mind about being afraid of the dark or ghosts, I’ve found a murderer, immediately call headquarters, I didn’t bring weapons, I can’t empty the magazine, I need backup, quick!\"\n\"Report to the FBI tomorrow.\"\nBai Bufan and Zhou Baowei were both stunned for a moment, then tacitly gave a thumbs-up.\nFollowing their plan, the trio arrived at the Canglong roller coaster’s express entrance, lining up at the back of the line.\nAt that moment, the machine was already operating continuously, with screams echoing from far to near, and near to far, as if it was performing ASMR.\nBai Bufan gulped loudly.\n\"Didn’t the Great Qing fall? Why is the torture still here?! Haven’t they recruited yet?\" Bai Bufan denounced the world’s sins.\nNobody paid him any attention.\nAfter all, no one asked, how to recruit.\n\"I suddenly remembered, my dad is having my milk, I have to go see if it’s a boy or a girl, brothers, enjoy yourselves, I’m outta here.\" Bai Bufan suddenly recalled this matter and turned to leave.\nNow someone minded him.\nFour hands grabbed Bai Bufan’s collar in an instant, no matter how hard he tried, he could only march in place.\nHe fled, they pursued, he was trapped like a bird with clipped wings.\nBai Bufan turned his head, earnestly pleading with Lin Li: \"Bro, I really can’t, I ate something that my stomach couldn’t take this morning, it feels uncomfortable now, you don’t want to see flying, do you?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nZhang Wansen, going under.\nTo be honest, Bai Bufan dared to describe such a scene, but Lin Li didn’t dare to imagine it, and his body subconsciously was trying to stay away from the roller coaster track as much as possible.\nLin Li knew Bai Bufan was making excuses.\nBut Lin Li had to keep him there because, as good brothers, he must teach Bai Bufan what courage is, how to overcome fears, what it means that the rainbow comes after the storm, and when a brother is facing death, you damn sure shouldn’t be thinking about living alone.\n\"I really can’t do anything about you, take this, it should solve your issue.\"\nLin Li sighed, took out a glasses case, and handed it to Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan took it, opened it, took out the glasses inside, put them on, took a look, felt dizzy, a bit confused: \"What’s this for, to get used to dizziness in advance?\"\n\"No, I want you to shove it up, this way, the flight won’t come out.\" Lin Li explained.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nBai Bufan sneered, and without the child, there’s no catching the wolf. He really made a motion to reach behind himself and said at the same time: \"I’m really doing it now, don’t be unhappy.\"\nBut this time he was wrong, Lin Li was calm: \"I’d be happy.\"\n\"Isn’t this expensive? You’re not going to keep it?\" Bai Bufan was surprised.\n\"Not keeping it.\"\n\"Because damn it, that’s my glasses case!\" Zhou Baowei looked back; the more he looked, the more familiar it seemed, finally confirming it was his own glasses, snatched them back abruptly.\nLin Li was really a rogue, Zhou Baowei despised such a person, and after the contempt, placed his half-drank beverage back near Lin Li’s backpack.\n\"Alright, my treat, I’ll go to the nursing room for you to get a diaper, this should solve your issue, can’t do anything about you.\" Lin Li sighed.\n\"You even deal with diapers?\" Bai Bufan looked disgusted.\nLin Li was stunned and then laughed.\nThe two were in a heated battle, fiery and loud.\nDue to the fast track, within a few minutes, it would be their turn.\n\"Ze Yu, how’s this ride, scary or not?\" Bai Bufan saw a classmate coming down and immediately asked.\n\"Didn’t feel much, actually got quite bored.\" Qin Zeyu shook his head.\n\"Really?\" Bai Bufan’s eyes lit up at the words.\nBored is great; he liked boring things the most.\n\"Yeah, I got bored and fell asleep shortly after getting on, and the staff woke me up later.\" After saying this, Qin Zeyu staggered past the three with trembling legs.\nBai Bufan’s smile froze on his face.\nCan’t you stop calling passing out from fear falling asleep!\nThen Bai Bufan showed concern, walked up to support Qin Zeyu, and waved back to Lin Li and Zhou Baowei, saying, \"Zeyu’s not doing so well, I’ll escort him to the amusement park’s medical room, you guys go ahead and play.\"\nFour hands grabbed Bai Bufan, while two hands pushed him away.\nThe three spoke in unison: \"No need.\"\nBai Bufan’s smile turned bleak.\n...\nThe roller coaster had four seats per row, with Lin Li on the left, Bai Bufan in the middle, Zhou Baowei on the right, and a student from another school on the far right.\nAt this moment, all three of their hair was being blown back, refusing to come down, and all looked ashen-faced.\nThe safety bar started to rise slowly after the staff’s operation.\nLin Li took a deep breath and stood up: \"Oh crap——\"\nBut in just two minutes, his voice turned a bit hoarse from yelling.\nBai Bufan, however, said nothing beside him; when Lin Li looked at him, the guy didn’t even have his eyes open.\nNot everyone screams on these thrill rides; in fact, a large portion of people, like the Bai Bufan in front of him, just keep their eyes closed tightly and grip the equipment, unable to make a sound.\nThis is true fear.\n\"Get up, Bufan.\" Zhou Baowei urged Bai Bufan, whose lips were still trembling, though he himself wasn’t much better.\nHe underestimated the power of the Canglong roller coaster.\nBefore getting on, Zhou Baowei: \"Mom, life is a vast wilderness, the world is so big, I want to see it.\"\nAfter getting off, Zhou Baowei: \"Wilderness, people are born of mothers. Ding Zhen was right, I want to find my mom.\"\nKinda like liking dragons too much but fearing them.\n\"Just now on the roller coaster, I think someone peed in my pants.\" Hearing Zhou Baowei’s urging, Bai Bufan calmly said.\nLin Li, Zhou Baowei: \"...\"\nLin Li took a step to the left, Zhou Baowei took a step to the right, both pinching their noses.\nCrap.\nAre you serious with your half-step retreat?\n\"What the hell, just kidding, but my legs are really weak, help me out, hurry!\" Bai Bufan, wounded once more by his friends, shouted out.\nLin Li chuckled, then pulled Bai Bufan’s arm onto his shoulder.\nHow come boys are still smelly and hard after being scared stiff, Lin Li somewhat missed the fragrant and soft class leader.\nWait a minute.\nLin Li frowned.\n[With a fearless and dashing stance, pass through the eight challenges of the Pingjiang Secret Realm (0/8)]\nOn the task interface, the bold 0 hadn’t turned into a fierce 1, stabbing Lin Li’s heart deeply.\nBu Hao!\nEven after the three had left the Canglong roller coaster area, the number still hadn’t changed.\nLin Li laughed.\nA painful laugh.\nWhat else could it be, except that his earlier self was not fearless enough and not dashing enough.\nSystem, damn it, some blessing from the Feng.\n\"Do we really have to go through such trials seven more times?\" At this moment, Bai Bufan, drooping beside Zhou Baowei, spoke with a trembling voice.\n\"I think maybe, indeed, we shouldn’t play the other seven thrill rides for now.\" Zhou Baowei, at this point, also suggested sincerely.\nHe needed to take a breather too.\n\"Agreed,\" Bai Bufan looked at the seven speed-run rides on his phone, \"If you let me play these back-to-back, I can’t handle it mentally or physically, but I’m totally onboard with playing something else.\"\n\"Okay, I already have something suitable for your needs, I’ll lead the way.\" Lin Li nodded at their words.\n\"Alright, we’ll trust you, Lin Li, you lead the way!\" The three of them, in a rare moment, reached a consensus instantly; such was the power of the Canglong roller coaster.\nSo Lin Li led the way, and half a minute later, they started queuing.\nBai Bufan was a bit surprised: \"How did we get here so quickly, what’s the ride?\"\nHe felt they hadn’t walked for even a minute, what sort of leisure ride is this, why is it so close to the Canglong roller coaster?\nZhou Baowei squinted his eyes: \"Bufan, check out the queue next to us, it looks really familiar, seems like the fast lane for the Canglong roller coaster.\"\n\"Seems like it.\"\n\"How come the destination looks the same too?\"\nFeeling a jolt in their hearts, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei both looked up simultaneously.\nAn electronic sign:\n「Canglong Roller Coaster (Normal Queue Entry) (Estimated queuing time ’15’ minutes)」\nFour hands immediately grabbed Lin Li’s neck, and Lin Li could already see his great-grandmother waving at him.\n\"Lin Li, what the hell are you doing!\" Bai Bufan was the most furious one.\n\"No, you said, as long as it’s not those seven rides, everything else is fine, right, didn’t I meet your requirements——\" Lin Li, whose throat was being strangled by fate, struggled to speak.\n\"Are you seriously calling this meeting our requirements?\" Bai Bufan roared.\n\"Just answer me, did it or didn’t it?\"\n\"I’ll strangle you!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Chapter 111 Haha! Azure Dragon, you are nothing special, watch me... today I slay the dragon!\nWord is bond, Bai Bufan.\nLuckily, Lin Li is practically an athlete now; after watching a fifteen-second ad, he revived.\n\"The first time is unfamiliar, the second time brings skill. Trust me, guys. With the last experience, this time, we can definitely handle it better.\" Lin Li encouraged his two buddies.\nMostly, Lin Li didn’t want to suffer alone.\n\"Isn’t it possible it’s unfamiliar the first time, deadly the second?\" Bai Bufan gritted his teeth.\nZhou Baowei touched his nose on the side, but he didn’t back down. Mainly, he boasted initially about wanting to ride ten or eight times, but now admitting defeat didn’t look good, so he asked:\n\"Lin Li, are you addicted? But I heard you screaming just as much earlier?\"\n\"Indeed, I found it quite interesting. But precisely because of the screaming, I’m not satisfied with my performance. What meaning is there in winning the warrior badge through the Pingjiang eight challenges without style? If I’m to get it, I want to get it with flair!\"\nLin Li, who mentally cursed at the system countless times, had to make a bold explanation on the surface.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nWho the hell cares about meaning!\n\"Bao Wei, didn’t you plan on multiple rides? I’ll accompany you and fulfill your wish. Bufan, if you really can’t take it, want to wait for us nearby for a bit?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"At least you have some conscience. I really need to rest. I still feel unsteady on the ground.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nOne ride was the true limit.\nLin Li knew this, so he said so.\n\"Is it that serious? Let me take care of you a bit?\" Hearing this, Zhou Baowei showed concern and approached to support Bai Bufan.\nTwo hands grabbed Zhou Baowei, and another set of hands pushed him away.\nThe two in front and behind spoke in unison: \"No need.\"\nZhou Baowei wore a bitter smile.\nBut Bai Bufan’s smile seemed sincere.\nAt this moment, like that moment.\nYou’re having your day too.\n\"Just kidding, I didn’t really want to take care of you. Many want my attention, and besides, you’re really quite pretentious.\" Zhou Baowei, showing goodwill but getting rejected, scoffed scornfully.\nFifteen minutes later, the two were back on the Canglong roller coaster, starting the ride.\nThe sound of the whistling wind filled the ears.\nBut it wasn’t just wind noise:\n\"Hahaha! Ah! Damn, hahaha! Ah! Goddamn, hahaha—\"\nZhou Baowei struggled in the headwind to turn his head, looking at Lin Li, who was alternately screaming, laughing, suffering, and enjoying: \"?\"\nWhat’s going on?\n...\n\"Riding twice isn’t too hard, really fun, love it.\" Zhou Baowei released his sweat-soaked hands and said, smiling.\nLin Li fell into a slight silence.\n[With an unafraid and free spirit, pass the Pingjiang Secret Realm’s eight challenges (0/8)]\nEven when howling, he wasn’t fearless or free enough?\n\"Since you love it, let’s ride a third time.\" Lin Li turned his head, sincerely inquiring.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nBuddy, are you insane?!\n\"Lin Li, bro, no, Lord Lin Li, I’m sorry, I won’t fake it anymore. I’m not the bravest man in class four, I’m really just another Bai Bufan, no, I’m even more Bai Bufan than Bai Bufan, please spare me.\"\nWhen Zhou Baowei realized he had to choose between pride and life, he began to insult himself in the most extreme way.\nPingjiang Amusement Park is no joke; it wasn’t the excitement I imagined.\n\"But I really need at least one more ride. I feel I’m still not handling it with enough ease.\" This time it was Lin Li’s turn to feel a bit awkward.\nZhou Baowei bolted right away.\n\"All done? Where’s Lin Li?\" Bai Bufan looked at Zhou Baowei, who seemed a bit weary, holding back laughter as he asked.\n\"Gone for a third round.\" Zhou Baowei sat down, pointing not far away, then closed his eyes.\nLin Li was queuing in the single rider line.\nSome attractions have fast, single rider, and regular lines, where the so-called single rider line means queuing there, and linked groups in the line don’t sit together within the ride.\nFor example, on rides like the Canglong roller coaster, with four seats per row, if there’s a team of three in one row, leaving one extra seat, it’s unreasonable to let others come up one at a time, this is when single rider line participants join.\nEven if the regular line is mostly groups of four or two, at each turn a group from the single rider line will get on.\nTherefore, this queue moves faster than the regular line.\n\"He’s coming back again, is he really hooked?\" Seeing this scene, Bai Bufan’s eyes widened.\n\"Mm.\"\n\"The change in Lin Li this term compared to last is really huge, he’s become so unfamiliar, how did he suddenly become the boldest man in class four?\" Bai Bufan was shocked, then shook his head, somewhat emotional.\n\"You’re his desk mate, you’re the closest, did you know?\" Zhou Baowei asked out of curiosity.\n\"Asked many times, Lin Li says he’s abstaining.\" Bai Bufan replied.\n\"Do you believe it?\" Zhou Baowei frowned.\n\"...\"\nAfter a brief silence, Bai Bufan scratched his head, a little embarrassed: \"I don’t know, I’ve never abstained, I don’t understand, what about you?\"\n\"This... I don’t get it either.\"\nSilence, after which the two exchanged a look, then both chuckled in sync.\nCanglong roller coaster.\n\"Hi, I have a case of being juvenile.\" Being alone meant sitting next to strangers, so before starting, Lin Li introduced himself.\n\"Ah? Oh, you too, well... I have an ingrown toenail.\" The person next to him seemed puzzled by Lin Li’s words, and, out of politeness, mimicked the template of Lin Li’s response.\nLin Li nodded, stopped talking, letting the other breathe easy.\nHe really dreaded patient interaction.\nClang, the roller coaster restraints were released, and off we go.\nForward.\nLin Li took a deep breath.\n\"With hands holding the sun and moon, plucking stars! In this world, none are like me! Interesting, truly interesting! Blue Dragon, you’re no more than this! Watch me slay the dragon!\"\nThe brother next to him with ingrown toenails was dumbfounded: \"?\"\nBro, are you seriously sick? I thought you were just saying that!\n...\nWhen the safety bar lifted, Lin Li ran without glancing back, afraid that everyone on this ride would remember his face.\nHowever, while running, Lin Li’s face showed some relief, his embarrassment was worth it:\n[With fearless and carefree demeanor, passed Pingjiang Secret Realm eight challenges (1/8)]\nFinally being recognized as fearless and carefree.\nDamn it, playing the ride normally without freaking out, and this stupid system just won’t acknowledge it, right?\nSystem, I swear again.\nWhen Lin Li walked over to Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei, he spoke before they could ask: \"There won’t be a fourth time, I’ve had enough and conquered this ride thoroughly, I won’t play it ever again in this life.\"\n\"Phew—wise decision. Let’s move on to another ride then. But first, let’s be clear, no bungee jumping among these eight rides!\" Bai Bufan sighed with relief, then emphasized.\n\"Agreed.\" Zhou Baowei nodded, the stance of attack and defense quickly changed.\n\"How about riding a thrilling, heart-pounding merry-go-round?\" Lin Li squinted his eyes, also needing to ease down.\nBai Bufan: \"Childish, a little girl’s ride, but I like it.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"Boring, a child’s play, but I’ll participate.\"\nBai Bufan: \"Lin Li, this is the most human-like you’ve ever been.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"Finally can distinguish Lin Li from a dog.\"\nLin Li thought that bickering was actually quite relaxing.\n...\nIt didn’t come to actually playing the merry-go-round, after finishing a less stimulating ride, the three were heading towards the big spinning wheel when they encountered Wang Ze and Zhang Haoyang, among a few others.\nNone of them seemed capable of walking in a straight line now, especially Wang Ze, who was covering his mouth, appearing to be on the verge of vomiting.\nUpon seeing Lin Li, Wang Ze’s eyes lit up, staggering his way over: \"Ugh—\"\n\"This shirt costs eighteen hundred.\" Lin Li stated.\nWang Ze quickly re-covered his mouth, turning to Bai Bufan: \"Bufan, could you bring your shirt over here, please. Thank you.\"\nThat’s wisdom for you.\nLin Li’s shirt actually cost thirty-two point nine, bought from a street stall.\n\"Get lost!\" Bai Bufan refused mercilessly, then asked curiously yet fearfully: \"What did you guys play to end up like this, was it this big spinning wheel? Damn, don’t scare me, I already get motion sickness, if you all turned out like this, what about me?\"\n\"The bear tea cup.\" Wang Ze pointed to the spinning wheel... next to the spinning tea cup.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You guys... resolved for victory and even life and death?\" As this type of teacup spins around on the platform, one can control the teacup’s spinning speed themselves, thus Lin Li asked.\n\"Yes, it felt like my brain was shaken uniformly.\" Wang Ze nodded.\n\"Did you guys play the big spinning wheel?\" Bai Bufan inquired.\n\"Who on earth would willingly play that, so ridiculous? Every round, people come down vomiting, didn’t you see, there’re puke buckets directly at the entrance and exit.\" Wang Ze retorted.\n\"So what are you planning to play next?\" Bai Bufan asked squinting his eyes.\n\"First the bumper cars, then the indoor roller coaster, and maybe check out a show. There’re float parades at noon.\" Wang Ze counted on his fingers.\n\"You’re not going to play any of the eight most thrilling rides?\" Bai Bufan’s eyes showed urgency.\n\"We might play a few, but that’ll be decided later, honestly, it feels like torture, doesn’t even compare to Dairy Dragon’s Adorable Dragon Flight.\" Zhang Haoyang shook his head disdainfully.\nFound the squad.\nTaking a deep breath, Bai Bufan wiped the nonexistent tears from the corner of his eyes, then happily threw his arm around them:\n\"Count me in!\"\n\"Weren’t you with Lin Li and Bao Wei?\" Wang Ze asked.\nOnly then did Bai Bufan ’surprisedly’ notice Zhou Baowei and Lin Li, patting his head: \"Is this Zhou Tongxue and Lin Tongxue? Hello to you both, goodbye to you both, wishing you a wonderful day.\"\nLin Li, Zhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Lin Tongxue, good day to you, goodbye to you too, I also wish you a wonderful day.\" Zhou Baowei was quick to adapt, aligning with the other group.\n\"OKOK, you all play together then, I’ll play solo.\" After thinking for a while, Lin Li nodded.\n\"I was joking, I’ll still play with you guys, not abandoning or giving up! Even in death, I’ll die with you!\" Bai Bufan immediately returned.\nLin Li felt a warmth in his heart, because he could tell, Bai Bufan assumed he was upset.\nNonetheless, he really didn’t have such thoughts, so he smiled and said: \"I’m not being sarcastic, today I’m planning to square up with the eight big rides, possibly playing each one more than once. It’s not quite right to trouble you both to wait for me, splitting up’s indeed appropriate.\nAlso, a not so crucial reason is that I discovered the solo line goes super fast, you both feel a bit like baggage to me, just emphasizing, this is a secondary reason.\"\n\"If it’s secondary, why do you keep stressing it!\"\nUnderstanding that Lin Li was kidding, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei felt assured since Lin Li said so.\n\"I wonder if Lin Li’s going to find the class monitor later, become a bootlicker like Chen Tianming? Actually, he’s been dissatisfied with you two for a while, might have regretted agreeing to play with you guys from the start.\" Wang Ze interjected.\nLin Li shook his head; athletes like Wang Ze who enjoy sowing discord are the worst.\nNext week secretly swap out his laxative with super glue in his dorm room.\n\"Don’t wrongly accuse clear innocence.\" Lin Li denied.\n\"Then swear you’ll play alone the whole time.\" Wang Ze immediately followed up.\n\"...That won’t do.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Chapter 112: This time, we’re truly going to make a fortune\nSo Lin Li experienced a wave of collective isolation.\nEvery person who passed by gave him a disdainful look, and spat on the ground for good measure.\nSigh, outstanding people always face exclusion, it’s just a trial one must go through.\nAfter everyone left, Lin Li looked at the big spinning wheel next to the spinning teacups.\nTaking a deep breath, Lin Li headed towards it.\n\"Spin! Jump! I close my eyes! The so-called wheel is just a toy underfoot!\"\nBesides the weightless feeling from centrifugal force, the main thing about this big wheel is the dizziness, but Lin Li found that his anti-dizziness ability seemed to have been greatly enhanced over the past half month. He could even leisurely sing a song on it.\nIf it weren’t for the safety bar holding him, Lin Li could even dance a piece of \"Little Swan Dance\" on it.\nPassing it in one go was really easy.\nLin Li suspected that in terms of anti-dizziness, he had reached the level of a pilot or even an astronaut.\nAnd the equally exciting high-altitude swiveling flying chairs were also easily conquered by Lin Li amidst his singing.\nAfter losing confidence on the Canglong Roller Coaster, Lin Li regained it on these two rides.\nThe only minor flaw was that after each ride finished, he had to quickly leave the \"crime scene.\"\nOtherwise, no matter how thick-skinned, it’s easy to lose confidence under the strange looks of others.\nDear Nansang Middle School, be glad you didn’t make your students wear school uniforms during the autumn outing, otherwise you would have had a lot more trouble.\n[With fearless grace, passing the Pingjiang Secret Realm’s eight challenges (3/8)]\n...\nThe sports student did have a bit of skill and really predicted it.\nWhen it was almost Lin Li’s turn for the rapid river adventure, he saw Chen Yu Ying and her two companions queueing in the regular lane.\nOnly three people, Yu Yu wasn’t there.\n\"Lin Li!\" Over there, Chen Yu Ying also saw Lin Li and greeted him.\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu didn’t greet him, and didn’t even want to look at him.\nBut Lin Li could understand.\nA father is just such a role. You might have many things you want to tell him, but when the father-daughter meeting finally happens, all the words get stuck.\nFatherly love, steady as a mountain!\nCalculating that he was relatively at the front of this line, Lin Li let the people behind go first, and eventually successfully sat with them on the same raft.\nSeeing from the queue position, it was usually Chen Yu Ying who sat in the middle, but upon seeing Lin Li, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu automatically sat to one side.\nPiety really is shown through actions.\n\"Why isn’t Yu Yu with you?\" Lin Li asked while fastening his seatbelt.\n\"She can’t really handle these thrilling rides, so she’s playing with Shuyang and them,\" Chen Yu Ying explained.\nVery understandable, normal humans would not want to ride the Canglong ten or eight times.\nWhen I get married, Yu Yu will be at my table.\nLin Li didn’t wait for Chen Yu Ying to ask before he explained: \"The reason I’m alone is similar to yours. They couldn’t keep up with my pace, so I kicked them all out.\"\n\"Why does it sound more like they kicked you out?\" Qu Wanqiu poked her head out.\n\"You’re talking too much, Little Qiuqiu.\"\n\"You damn well change that nickname!\"\n\"Oh, oh,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, but still looked a bit puzzled, \"So Lin Li, why aren’t you wearing a raincoat?\"\nRaincoats here don’t have additional charges, so it definitely wasn’t to save money.\n\"Because it’s not cool enough. Only by bathing in wind and rain, experiencing the torrents, can you grasp the true meaning of advancement.\" Lin Li said with a gentle smile, exuding a sage-like demeanor.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nDing Sihan poked her head out while fastening her raincoat and said, \"A friendly reminder: the rapid river connects to a children’s pool, so, unless by accident, there’s a lot of pee in it.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nBu Hao!\n\"Raincoat! Raincoat! Miss! Give me a raincoat, please! Sorry, my voice was a bit loud when I rejected you earlier, forgive me! I’m sorry! I’m really sorry!\"\nLin Li raised his hand and sincerely pleaded with the staff.\nHowever, it was too late.\n\"There’s no children’s pool, don’t talk nonsense.\" Fortunately, Chen Yu Ying clarified.\nOtherwise, Lin Li suspected he wouldn’t be able to stay calm when faced with a deluge of pee.\n\"Let the pee storm come even fiercer!\" When the raft rushed down, Lin Li spread his arms to welcome the wind and rain.\n\"Don’t say such disgusting things!\"\n[With fearless grace, passing the Pingjiang Secret Realm’s eight challenges (4/8)]\nThe tasks were halfway through.\nA lot of water splashed on him, but Lin Li felt okay; especially since it’s still hot in September, it was quite comfortable.\nSince he was surrounded by familiar faces this time, Lin Li didn’t run away but left leisurely with the three of them.\n\"Lin Li, you were really middle-schooler just now.\" Ding Sihan laughed.\n\"That’s your dad for you.\" Lin Li nodded.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"The bet yesterday was to call you once, not for you to act as my dad all day!\" Ding Sihan complained.\n\"Do you need a photo? With a frame, it’s only thirty yuan.\" On the way out, the shop assistant from a nearby shop was promoting.\nThe journey of the rapid river ride was an excellent place to set up photo points, and this little shop was the official place selling those souvenir photos capturing tourists in action.\nGirls always can’t resist stopping when they hear about photos, so all three gathered around, but soon lost interest and dispersed.\nBecause they hadn’t known photos would be taken, so they hadn’t managed their expressions throughout.\nThis resulted in most of the photos being indescribably bad, unsuitable for their tastes.\nGood-looking people still look good in photos, but the better you look, the higher your standard for photos.\nSo even Chen Yu Ying wasn’t satisfied.\n\"Wait for me, I’m going to buy two photos.\" But Lin Li was different; his eyes lit up.\nHe then spent ten yuan to buy two without frames.\n\"Why did you buy these? They seem to make you look ugly too, wouldn’t it be better to ride again with poses and buy those?\" Chen Yu Ying asked, curious after Lin Li finished buying.\n\"Because they could make money; riding again wouldn’t have the same effect.\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"Make money? How will this make money?\" Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu leaned in upon hearing.\nIf it could earn money, they’d be interested.\n\"See the photos, then you’ll understand.\" Lin Li handed the photos to the three.\nThe three of them bent down to scrutinize.\nSoon, Lin Li’s two unofficial daughters looked up with serious expressions, smiling with voices squeezing through their teeth:\n\"Mr. Lin Li, care to explain why you bought two of our ugly photos?\"\n\"Each of you transfer me five hundred, or I’ll post these in the class group chat. Right now, immediately.\" Lin Li held out both hands.\nDing Sihan, Qu Wanqiu: \"?\"\nYou damn well are making money this way!",

      "content": "Chapter 121: Chapter 113: Growth Always Takes Away Things We Want to Keep\nLin Li really has a knack for making money.\nHe could have actually made money from it; Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu would have a hard time accepting these two photos being circulated around the class.\nThe only problem was that Lin Li made a fatal mistake.\n— When using photos to extort someone, he shouldn’t have handed the photos to the victim first, at least he should’ve kept a backup.\nGreat, now.\nThe ten bucks are gone, the two photos were snatched away, he almost got kicked in the butt twice, and he was exiled by Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu.\nDon’t even think about being their father; now they don’t even see him as a man.\nIn the eyes of his brothers, he was already a beast, and in the eyes of the girls, he’s still a beast, then wouldn’t he really become a beast?\nSuch a failure.\nLuckily, Chen Yu Ying treated him to an ice cream, soothing his wounded soul.\nThe class president is nice, Qu Wanqiu is bad, and Ding Sihan is even worse, like a festering wound.\n\"It’s already ten-thirty, let’s queue for one more ride and then go eat, if we go early there won’t be a crowd.\" Chen Yu Ying was nibbling her ice cream cone in small bites, looking at the time on her phone, then raised her head and said.\n\"Class president, what are you going to play next? Let me see if it’s on my way.\" Lin Li ate much more aggressively, and was almost finished in just a few bites, and asked upon hearing this.\n\"What do you want to play?\" Chen Yu Ying countered.\n\"I want to get the Warrior badge, there are four more I haven’t tried yet, and the closest one from here is the Skydive, I’m planning to try this one.\" Lin Li glanced at the electronic map on his phone and showed it to Chen Yu Ying.\nChen Yu Ying looked at Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu, the three exchanged a glance and nodded.\n\"We haven’t tried this one either, let’s go for it.\"\n...\nAs they approached the Skydive, Lin Li silently sighed in his heart.\nThis thing looks pretty terrifying up close, seems to be at least over thirty meters high.\nIn the amusement park, it definitely stands out.\nRiding this is pretty much like jumping off a building, no, there is still a difference; jumping off a building kills you instantly, but with this, you linger between life and death.\nLin Li circled the drop tower a bit and then breathed a sigh of relief.\nThere were no Red Bull logos in sight, which means this facility is still human-friendly, there’s hope.\nIf he saw a Red Bull logo, he’d just run, forget any missions.\nRed Bull, your death form, beyond imagination!\n\"Lin Li, are you scared?\" Ding Sihan noticed Lin Li’s expression and teased him.\n\"Yes.\"\nJust as Ding Sihan was about to continue teasing.\n\"But some things outweigh others.\"\nPlainly narrated, Lin Li gave Ding Sihan a deep smile and then walked towards the queue.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nWhy do you act like you are sacrificing yourself for something very meaningful!?\nWhat value are you upholding exactly?\nYou’re being proud now, right? What are you even proud of?\nAt this moment, Ding Sihan wanted to stick the ice cream cone she was holding onto Lin Li’s head.\n\"But it is indeed quite scary, didn’t expect it to be so high, and the descent speed is so fast, I am a bit scared too.\"\nUnlike the two crazies, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu, clearly, Chen Yu Ying, such a fragrant and soft girl, is still quite normal.\nHaving a proper concept of fear—anything bolder than Lin Li is abnormal.\n\"Ying Bao, don’t be afraid, passion!\" Ding Sihan consoled.\n\"Yu Ying, don’t be afraid, it’s actually going to be fun.\" Qu Wanqiu reassured.\n\"Class president, don’t be afraid, the brave enjoy paradise first.\" Lin Li comforted.\n\"Thank you... Wait? Is it enjoy paradise?\" Chen Yu Ying was taken aback.\n\"It’s enjoy the world! Lin Li, stop talking nonsense!\" Ding Sihan glared with hands on her hips at Lin Li for scaring Chen Yu Ying.\n\"OK, the brave first enjoy the afterworld.\" As the queue got closer, standing under the drop tower, Lin Li found he could even feel the wind stirred up by the fall, and gave a thumbs up.\n...\nThe queue reached its end.\nThe four of them then sat in their respective execution seats.\nStart.\nThe scariest part of the drop tower isn’t actually the moment when the machine falls; that’s too quick, no time to be scared, it’s over. It’s the slow lift of the machine.\nWhen Lin Li saw the other tourists below him grow smaller and smaller, he realized this saying was spot on.\nBetter to shift focus a bit.\nFor example, Chen Yu Ying beside him, looking even a bit shy from fear.\nWith lightly glossed lips tightly pressed, her little face slightly red.\nIsn’t this much better than the view from the ground?\n\"Class president, if you’re scared, you can hold my hand, I’ll give you strength!\" Lin Li said to Chen Yu Ying, who was gripping the safety bar for dear life on his left.\n\"No, no, it’s alright, still bearable.\" Chen Yu Ying was already a bit afraid to look at the ground, responding with closed eyes, her pretty eyelashes slightly trembling.\n\"Bearable huh.\" Lin Li smacked his lips, somewhat disappointed.\n\"Then if I’m scared, can I hold your hand?\" Lin Li pondered and realized there’s always a way.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"Your voice doesn’t sound scared at all, no way!\"\n\"Then I, I’m scared now... can I, can I hold your hand?\" Lin Li repeated, this time in a shaky, stammering version.\nChen Yu Ying trusted even less, giving a slight hum.\nEven with eyes closed, she turned her head away, clearly not wanting to look at Lin Li.\n\"Lin Li, if you’re scared, you can hold my hand!\" The crazy Ding Sihan was even more excited as the drop tower climbed, extending her hand to Lin Li at this moment.",

I’m not afraid anymore,\" Lin Li’s voice returned to normal instantly, \"If I survive this field trip, I’ll definitely give you a banner!\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nThat stinky dog, Lin Li.\n\"Click!\"\nWith the sound of a machine vibrating, it stopped ascending, having reached the highest point.\nThe wind up high was really cold. Lin Li thought of calling Xue Jian to tell him this, and then hang up immediately.\nHe looked down at the ground again, then quickly looked up, chastising himself for his curiosity.\nOne more look, and he’d explode.\nTaking a deep breath, Lin Li opened his mouth and said, \"Class president, do you have any cool and dashing lines to recommend for later? Something like seizing the moon and stars, unparalleled in the world?\"\nHe still didn’t know how he’d embarrass himself this time.\n\"What you’re referring to might be adapted from a poem by Lu Jiuyuan, right? The original one is: ’Head high, climb the southern dipper, turn and lean on the northern star. Looking beyond the heavens, none like me exists,’\" Chen Yu Ying responded slowly upon hearing this.\n\"You’re so cultured, class president. I’ll say that this time!\" Lin Li acknowledged.\n\"Three.\"\nThe countdown had started on the loudspeaker at the top, which made Chen Yu Ying, who was about to speak, shut her mouth and shrink, ready to face the judgment.\n\"Two.\"\nLin Li took a deep breath; he still had something important to do.\n\"Ding Sihan!\" Lin Li shouted for his divine doctor.\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"One.\"\n\"I just saw two screws fall from under your foot, and besides, your seatbelt seems to be buckled wrong.\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Wha—\"\n\"Whoosh—\"\nThe machine plummeted at light speed.\nThe four had different reactions.\nLin Li: \"Head high, climb the southern dipper, turn and lean on the northern star!\"\nChen Yu Ying: ~(>_<~)\nQu Wanqiu: \"Oh ho! Hahahahaha!!\"\nDing Sihan: \"Ahhh the screws ahhhh my screws!!!\"\nThe whole drop took just about a second, but Lin Li felt his ears ringing.\nNot just ringing, it was severe enough to hallucinate too.\n\"Lin Li, you dog! Damn you, ’beep—’! It wasn’t wrong at all! You were scaring me!\"\nOtherwise, why would he hear things about his mom while in an amusement park?\n...\nThere was a shoe print on his butt, but Lin Li was magnanimous and didn’t hold the culprit accountable.\nIt was worth it!\nAs planned, after finishing this ride, the four headed to one of the restaurants inside the amusement park.\nThe price was a bit high, but still within an acceptable range.\nAfter ordering and getting a number, they found a spot to sit.\nEveryone was looking at their phones individually.\nLin Li wasn’t planning on studying right now. That would be too impressive, so he checked WeChat.\nThe neighborhood group Zhang Fang had added him to had an all-group message, and out of curiosity, Lin Li clicked on it.\nWhy was it silenced for everyone?\nLin Li found the @ message.\n\"4-501 Zhang Zhengzhi: @everyone. Friends, September 13th, 10:50:32. Seven pounds, six ounces.\"\n\"2-202AAA Egg Wholesale King (Looking for Fishing Friends): Bro, that’s amazing, where did you catch this?\"\n\"Zhang Zhengzhi: Haha, no, it’s my son ’covering mouth and laughing’.\"\n\"Egg King: Wow, young man, that’s awesome. Could you help me ask where your son caught it?\"\n\"Zhang Zhengzhi: My wife just had a son ’sweating bean’.\"\n\"Egg King: Congrats, double the joy! ’thumbs up’ ’thumbs up’ ’rose’ ’rose’.\"\n\"Egg King: So could you tell me where the fish was caught? It’s okay if it’s inconvenient ’smile’.\"\n\"Zhang Zhengzhi: I f*ck you.\"\nThen an argument started, so the group chat was silenced. Grandma Zhang probably went to mediate again.\nYou fishing folks are really (pointing fingers).\nHe shared the chat record with Chen Yu Ying, and she laughed too.\n\"Look at this... wow, such a touching secret crush... I don’t even dare to finish reading...\" At this moment, Ding Sihan, sitting opposite, rubbed her eyes and handed over her phone, wanting to share too.\n\"Things change and life becomes empty, wanting to speak, tears first flow.\"\n\"Dear Deng, this is the fifth year we’ve known each other, but I don’t know if you know me, because I never...\nLin Li stopped reading after seeing this beginning.\nDing Sihan noticed this, rubbing her eyes and asking, \"Lin Li, aren’t you going to read any more?\"\n\"I’ve lost the patience to read so much text,\" Lin Li shook his head, his expression deep.\n\"Maybe it’s because this is the fast-food era, and the world is pushing us, leaving us no time and patience,\" Qu Wanqiu sighed, philosophizing.\n\"No,\" Lin Li shook his head, that wasn’t the reason for him.\nHe sighed and fell into memory:\n\"I was once patient and even shed tears, but in the end, the heroine on her deathbed smiled at the devoted hero and said the last words... damn it, it was KFC Crazy Thursday, V her fifty.\"\nInitially stunned, Ding Sihan quickly grabbed her phone back, scrolling furiously to the bottom of the long text:\n\"Damn, this one is also V her fifty!\"\n\"Damn! This article was posted on Thursday, too!\"\n\"Damn! My tears!\"\nYou see, anxious again.\nNow there were three more people in the world without the patience to read long essays, especially on damn Thursdays.\nCan’t really blame the fast-food era.\n\"I think our food is ready.\" Lin Li glanced at the number on the food pickup stand and checked his own number, then got up to speak.\nDing Sihan handed over her number card: \"Pick mine up for me, please.\"\n\"Me too.\" Qu Wanqiu followed quickly.\n\"Humans don’t have three hands,\" Lin Li smiled.\n\"I’ll go with you.\" Chen Yu Ying stood up smiling, \"Two each.\"\n\"See, these two are so lazy, only because you’re spoiling them, class president,\" Lin Li sighed.\n\"I don’t get why people hate lazy folks. Clearly, we do nothing, never mind, too lazy to think about it,\" Qu Wanqiu said, feeling a bit sad.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nIt’s such a sound argument that he had no way to refute it.\n\"Lazy people usually have a rich inner world, active minds, always thinking, making them smarter than usual people. They don’t want to work because they don’t want to be controlled. So they may be lazy in action, but in fact, they’re not lazy,\" Ding Sihan emphasized.\n\"Too lazy to argue,\" Lin Li sighed.\nChen Yu Ying looked at him with amusement.\nLin Li then realized: \"Class president, you’re amazing for not turning lazy despite spending so much time with them.\"\n...\n\"Class president, what are you planning to do after lunch? Still going for more rides? I’m thinking of trying these three, want to join?\"\nHe still had three rides left on his task list, Lin Li asked while shoving in the omurice that looked nothing like the picture.\n\"We’ve already done these two in the morning. We haven’t tried the Tianshan Hospital haunted house yet, but we plan to go there later. For now, we might lean towards just taking photos in the amusement park. I heard there’s a parade at 1 PM.\"\nFinally, we plan to take a ferris wheel ride during sunset; it should be pretty for photos,\" Chen Yu Ying slowly explained their plan.\n\"Okay, so you can call me for the haunted house, or not, either way. After eating, I’ll start with these two rides first,\" Lin Li nodded upon hearing this.\nHe wasn’t very interested in photo-taking or parades, focusing instead on completing his task.\n\"Alright, or join us after you finish those two rides,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"Okay.\"\nOnce the plan was set, Lin Li looked down and continued inhaling his food.\n\"So hungry, so hungry, so hungry, so hungry, so hungry—\"\nBy the time Lin Li almost finished eating, he glanced up to see Ding Sihan grimacing while browsing her phone anxiously.\nHer stomach seemed to be growling too.\n\"Aren’t you hungry, girl? Your lunch is right in front of you, why aren’t you eating and keep saying you’re hungry?\" Lin Li was shocked.\n\"With my phone in front of me, I can’t eat until I find a suitable video to go with my meal! Without a suitable video, I’d rather starve!\" Ding Sihan declared forcefully.\nLin Li: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 123: Chapter 114: Do you think it’s fun, Lin Li!\nWhen Lin Li eats alone, she also likes to watch some mealtime videos, but she’s not as dedicated as Ding Sihan.\nMoreover, for Lin Li, mealtime videos are like turning on the TV on New Year’s Eve — purely there to create an atmosphere, to make it less quiet, and she doesn’t necessarily pay much attention to them.\nHonestly, if you eat fast, it’s less than ten minutes, and you might start focusing on the food itself. Like Ding Sihan, who might spend more time looking for a video than actually watching it.\n\"Class president, can I go play some rides first? See you later.\" Lin Li said, seeing that Ding Sihan hadn’t started eating yet.\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Get me a cup of water from the dispenser, please. Thanks.\" Ding Sihan pointed to the distant water dispenser, with a bossy attitude.\n\"Okay.\" Lin Li sighed.\nMight as well spoil your daughter.\nSpeaking of which, shouldn’t the water dispenser be called a water spitter? Humans are the real water drinkers.\nAfter getting the water, Lin Li left.\nYep, left.\nWatching Lin Li leave the cafeteria directly after filling the cup, Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nThe phone chimed with a message.\n「Ding Sihan: Where are you?」\n「Lin Li: Left.」\n「Ding Sihan: Where’s the water?」\n「Lin Li: 「Picture」 It’s in my hand.」\n「Ding Sihan: ?」\n「Lin Li: Oh, right, Ding Sihan, you never told me what to do after I got the water. So what am I supposed to do now?」\n「Ding Sihan: Lin Li, I hate you!!!」\nBeing misunderstood by family is a father’s fate.\nWith the map in hand, Lin Li headed to the Hammer of the Gods ride.\nIt’s basically a giant swing, with an arm holding a circular seating area that rotates while the arm accelerates until it swings 360 degrees.\nFrom below, it doesn’t seem fast, not very scary, but once you’re on it, it’s a different story — no one stays silent.\nIt’s a paragon of dizziness, weightlessness, and excitement, and one of the most famous attractions at Pingjiang Amusement Park.\nPrimarily, the ride lasts a long time, almost three minutes, a long-term torture.\nBut for Lin Li, it’s not a big deal, given the previous experiences with the rotating chairs and big spinning wheels — Lin Li is quite confident about these dizzying rides.\nLin Li now believes her stamina is comparable to that of a pilot.\nAfter all those flights she took in the past three years, her perseverance is paying off.\nThere’s no singles line for continuous circle seats. Lin Li wanted to go through the fast track right away, but unexpectedly saw an old acquaintance in the regular line — his good buddy — so he had to go say hi.\nIt was lunchtime, so there weren’t many people, and the regular line wasn’t long. Lin Li went over.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, why are you playing this ride alone?\" Lin Li inquired.\n— It’s noon now, and of course, Wang Yuezhi is his good buddy.\n\"Not in a good mood, looking for something unpleasant to make myself feel better.\"\nHearing the question, Wang Yuezhi instinctively responded in a gloomy voice, looking up at the swinging hammer, listening to the screams of people on it.\nLater, I’ll see if I can go without fastening the seatbelt, maybe getting thrown off will leave me bruised all over.\nMaybe then I can forget today’s inner hurt.\n\"Oh, sorry to bother you then, I better go. I’m in a good mood, can’t let you bring me down.\" Lin Li nodded and prepared to leave before hearing more negativity.\n— Not to target Wang Yuezhi, Lin Li treats all his buddies this way.\nWang Yuezhi: \"...\"\nHe then realized the voice was indeed familiar, turned his head, and sure enough, it was Lin Li — only he could say something like that.\nWang Yuezhi glanced fixedly at Lin Li’s surroundings, suddenly brightened up, and even grabbed Lin Li’s arm as he was about to leave, asking in surprise, \"Lin Li, are you here alone?\"\nDidn’t you come with four people just now?\nNot joining up?\n\"Our relationship might be moving a bit fast, I might need to think about it.\" Lin Li pried Wang Yuezhi’s hand off his arm, \"But I can see you’re lonely, alright, I won’t go, I can accompany you on this ride.\"\nFor a buddy, he’s willing to sacrifice a bit of himself.\nSure enough, his suggestion was salvation for Wang Yuezhi, visibly improving his mood.\n\"I actually have a show, no, I have something to do. I have to go now, Lin Li, enjoy the ride, good luck.\" Leaving this message, Wang Yuezhi walked away.\nLeaving behind a slightly bewildered Lin Li.\nA show? What show? Haven’t heard of a circus performance tonight?\nSlightly puzzled, Lin Li shrugged his shoulders and continued to queue.\n\"Lin Li?\"\nWithin a few seconds, his name was called.\nLin Li turned and saw it wasn’t a classmate, but the homeroom teacher from class 17, whom he had met only once — probably named Wang Ziyan.\n\"Hello, Teacher Yan, how did you know my name?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"The name is Wang Ziyan,\" Wang Ziyan smiled.\n\"Then I’ll call myself Princess Lin?\"\nSince it wasn’t his own teacher and seemed friendly, and now was off-campus, Lin Li pretended not to understand.\n\"You are indeed as Teacher Xue said, quite the talent,\" Wang Ziyan, who was about Lin Li’s height, patted his shoulder with a helpless expression.\nApparently, Xue Jian had been bragging about him to other teachers as a proud example of an outstanding student.\nIt made him feel slightly embarrassed.\n\"I’m not that outstanding, but I will keep working hard, Teacher Yan,\" Lin Li said politely.\n\"So Lin Li, after you finish enjoying the amusement park, would you help Teacher Yan with a favor?\" Wang Ziyan asked.",

That’s too boring.\nBut you, kid, have got some guts, coming to try this ride all by yourself.\"\nWhen Wang Ziyan said this, he seemed quite proud and even patted his own chest.\n\"Teacher, what you really want to praise is your own bravery, right?\" So Lin Li understood the meaning.\n\"That’s not it, but if you insist on mentioning it—\" Wang Ziyan chuckled softly, ready to recount his glorious achievements of the day.\n\"Teacher, I wasn’t insisting. We can change the topic.\"\n\"You can bring it up.\"\nThe spellcasting Wang Ziyan, interrupted, stared straight at Lin Li.\n\"Teacher, what subject do you teach? Let me first see if there’s a chance you’ll be my subject teacher after the class separation before I consider accepting this threat.\" Lin Li was quite pragmatic.\nWang Ziyan: \"...\"\nThis darn kid.\nNo wonder Teacher Xue gets out of breath when he mentions him. Now, it seems understandable.\nBut.\nIf Xue Jian knew Wang Ziyan’s thoughts, he’d probably say, \"You still don’t get it.\"\n...\nSoon, the two were seated in their places.\nWang Ziyan seemed genuinely fearless, he even asked the staff if he could wear a lanyard to secure his phone around his neck, but unfortunately, it was declined.\n\"Teacher, you’re really not afraid at all?\" Lin Li was genuinely impressed now; even though he had undergone systematic training, he was a bit nervous.\n\"Not afraid. The so-called thrilling rides today always feel short and not exciting enough, Pingjiang Amusement Park doesn’t seem as scary as the rumors.\" Wang Ziyan nodded.\nLin Li gave a thumbs up.\n\"Life is like a giant swing, with highs and lows, but remember, let’s swing together!\" After the cheer, corny to the extreme, the machine started operating.\nScreaming began the moment it started; clearly, there wasn’t much speed yet, but a girl on Lin Li’s left was already yelling loudly.\nHowever, Wang Ziyan was excitedly going ’Oh hoo.’\nMaybe he was a biology teacher and had mastered the trick of returning to ancestral roots.\nAs the swing’s amplitude increased, the thrill gradually escalated.\nScreams came from both the left and right, one excited, the other fearful, mixed with the intense sound of the wind. The extreme stereo made Lin Li’s eardrums ache a bit.\n\"Ahhhhhh!!\"\n\"Oh oh hoo!!\"\nThis left Lin Li not knowing how to be dashing for a moment.\n\"Is it fun, Lin Li?\" Wang Ziyan asked Lin Li with some leisure.\n\"Easy peasy!\" Lin Li replied.\n\"That’s right, that’s the feeling, awesome!\" Wang Ziyan shouted even louder, \"Oh oh oh—\"\nThe swing’s amplitude gradually approached 180 degrees, with both the sense of weightlessness and swing speed greatly increasing.\nThe torment in Lin Li’s ears also increased significantly.\n\"Ahhhhhh!!\"\n\"Oh oh hoo!—\"\nThe fearful left channel was still yelling, but suddenly the excited right channel stopped.\nLin Li instinctively turned his head, and then he saw a shocking scene: Wang Ziyan’s limbs were limp, his head tilted to the side, eyes rolled back, and mouth slightly open.\n\"Teacher, hello, no sleeping allowed here.\"\nNo response.\nHuh? Did he faint? So suddenly?\nEven Bai Bufan didn’t faint while riding a roller coaster, didn’t Teacher Wang say he was very brave?\n\"Teacher, wake up! Teacher Wang! Teacher Yan! Your lesson plan isn’t prepared!\"\nWang Ziyan gave no response, continuing to be unconscious.\nShould he ask the staff to stop urgently? Would they be able to hear him now?\nHe couldn’t wake him, his hands were also bound, unable to touch, Lin Li didn’t know what to do for a moment.\nThe giant swing was now high in the air, starting to decelerate, preparing for reverse descent.\nThe screams on the left subsided a bit, Lin Li was deeply pondering.\n\"Is it fun, Lin Li!\"\nHearing this familiar voice, Lin Li: \"?\"\nHe turned his head, only to see Wang Ziyan looking at him excitedly, asking.\n\"Do you think it’s fun, Lin Li?\" Wang Ziyan asked again, thinking Lin Li hadn’t heard.\n\"E-easy peasy.\"\n\"That’s right, that’s the feeling, awesome!\" Wang Ziyan shouted even louder, \"Oh oh oh—\"\nAt this moment, Lin Li was a bit dazed.\nWho’s the mighty one messing with me, making me fall into a time loop?\nBefore he could continue pondering who was causing this, the giant swing had already plummeted to the lowest point, where the sense of weightlessness and dizziness was strongest. Only hearing the left side yelling even louder, while the right side went quiet again.\nMaking sure his right ear wasn’t broken, Lin Li turned to look at Wang Ziyan.\nSleeping like a baby, peacefully.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis time, Lin Li didn’t look away.\nWhen the giant swing reached the highest point on the other side, the speed slowed down again.\n\"Oh oh oh—\" Wang Ziyan’s mouth got excited before his eyes even opened.\n\"Is it fun? Lin Li!\" He raised his hands high, seeing Lin Li looking at him after opening his eyes, he asked excitedly.\n\"...Easy peasy.\"\n\"That’s right, that’s the feeling, awesome!\" Wang Ziyan shouted even louder, \"Oh—\"\nStop shouting, let me think.\nWhat kind of bizarre situation is this?\nHow can he sleep and wake intermittently?\nCould this be Wang Ziyan’s brain’s self-protection mechanism?\nOnce the body determines that the stimulus exceeds the threshold, it can’t handle it, simply shutting down? Then restart once the stimulus drops below the threshold?\nWang Ziyan himself seemed completely unaware of this matter.\nHumans, amazing isn’t it!\nRight side went quiet again.\nLin Li didn’t even have to turn his head, ah, to be young, falling asleep just like that.\n\"Think it’s fun? Lin Li!\" When Wang Ziyan opened his eyes and saw Lin Li again, he immediately asked excitedly.\n\"Damn!\" Asked three times, Lin Li couldn’t hold back and laughed.\n\"Right! It’s fun, isn’t it? I feel like laughing too!\" Wang Ziyan triumphantly, \"Looks like you’re as brave as me! Oh oh oh—\"\nAnd so—\nSleeping.\n\"Think it’s fun? Lin Li!\"\nSleeping.\n\"Think it’s fun? Lin Li!\"\nSleeping.\nAs the amplitudes increased, Wang Ziyan’s shutdown frequency got quicker and quicker.\nConstantly switching between fainting and excited consciousness.\nMoreover, he discovered the left channel’s volume acted like a signal; when it grew louder, it meant Wang Ziyan was about to shut down, when it got softer, it meant he was about to reboot.\nAs the on-off cycle sped up, when the amplitude exceeded 360 degrees and started going in circles, Wang Ziyan couldn’t even finish his reboot words; however, his sleep became sounder.\n\"Think it’s fun, Lin—\"\n\"Think—\"\n\"Th—\"\n\"!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 125: Chapter 115: You Say (chew, chew, chew) Who Invented This Thing (chew, chew, chew)\nLin Li was laughing so hard in mid-air that he started twitching.\n[With fearless elegance, cleared 8 challenges of the Pingjiang Secret Realm (5/8)]\nWhen the large pendulum segment ended, the task progress didn’t update, probably because he was too busy laughing.\nBut being able to witness this scene, Lin Li felt that dying would be worth the ticket price.\nThe task could be continued later, but this scene wasn’t one you could watch just anytime you wanted.\n\"Wow—it ended so quickly, was it really three minutes? It felt like less than a minute, it ended just in the time it took to say a few words to you.\" As the safety bar lifted, Wang Ziyan chewed on his gum, feeling somewhat unfulfilled.\nTeacher, is there a chance that you slept the whole two minutes, and it wasn’t just a few words we exchanged?\nBut how was it that I was entirely unconscious, how are these memories connected?\nLin Li was really curious.\n\"Teacher, did you also feel that the other thrilling rides today ended quickly?\" Lin Li’s face was still flushed with laughter, but he still asked.\n\"How did you know? They were all too quick, really unsatisfying, especially the ones reaching the clouds, it felt like they ended in half a second, kind of boring, next time we should play something even taller.\"\nWang Ziyan got up from the seat, chewing the gum in his mouth, nodding, then suddenly looked confused:\n\"What’s wrong, Lin Li, why are you laughing so much?\"\nDammit, don’t laugh out loud at this moment.\n\"Have you ever gone to an amusement park with friends before?\" Lin Li continued to ask.\n\"Never, why do you ask?\" Wang Ziyan shook his head.\nUnderstood.\n\"Oh, nothing, Teacher, just truly amazed by your bravery.\"\n\"Just average, not particularly brave, I never knew I was this courageous before, opening up a new world, but unfortunately, I’m no longer in my glorious youth like you.\" Wang Ziyan was slightly embarrassed by the compliment.\nHe blew a huge bubble, until it popped and he chewed it back into his mouth.\nThen he looked at the giant pendulum behind him and eagerly asked Lin Li: \"Lin Li, want to go again? Teacher plans to ride it once more, just wasn’t satisfying enough just now.\"\n\"...I’d love to.\" Lin Li nodded.\nThis time, I won’t just focus on laughing, I must be dashing!\n\"Looks like we are really destined to be partners, come on, let’s queue up!\" Wang Ziyan was very excited.\nSo the two walked towards the end of the line.\nThe footsteps became lighter.\nLin Li suddenly noticed the silhouette beside him disappeared.\nHe turned and saw Wang Ziyan no longer moving forward, stopping in place, staring blankly, chewing bubblegum but slowing down.\n\"What’s wrong, Teacher Wang?\" Lin Li curiously asked.\n\"Something’s wrong.\" Wang Ziyan looked up, eyes somewhat vacant, staring at Lin Li.\n\"What’s wrong?\"\nCould it be that Wang Ziyan was actually conscious, just a bit slower in reaction?\nThe scene on the giant pendulum, Lin Li thought it might be better to tell Wang Ziyan.\nJust as Lin Li was about to speak, Wang Ziyan spoke first.\nHe spat the gum into his hand, with fear in his eyes, trembling, he asked Lin Li: \"Lin, Lin Li, when I went up, was I chewing gum?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li was stunned by the question.\nThen his expression also became somewhat dazed.\nLin Li’s memory was already a thing of the past, he silently stepped back a bit, looked at Wang Ziyan with some sorrow, pressing his lips together, slowly shook his head: \"Teacher, I think...no.\"\n\"Really not, could it be that both you and I remembered wrong, maybe I really had it?\" Wang Ziyan couldn’t believe it.\n~Dare not open my eyes, hope it’s my hallucination~\nLin Li hallucinated a song.\nBut Lin Li took a step back again, shaking his head: \"Teacher, truly no.\"\nWang Ziyan looked at the gum in his palm, face grimacing more than crying:\n\"Then this gum with no taste at all...\"\n\"Ugh—\"\n\"Ugh—\"\n...\nWould it have taste? The sweetness was already all used up in someone else’s mouth.\nWang Ziyan didn’t accompany Lin Li to play again.\nAfter Wang Ziyan ran to the trash can to puke, he left weakly, stating he would never play on the giant pendulum for the rest of his life.\nLin Li didn’t immediately go for the second time either, but ran to the flume ride first, took a raincoat then returned.\nWho would have thought that there would be sneak attacks from the sky, and you could open a food mystery box.\nLet’s just say this bubblegum synchronized well with Wang Ziyan’s dizziness, otherwise normal people would have reacted when it entered the mouth.\n[With fearless elegance, cleared 8 challenges of the Pingjiang Secret Realm (7/8)]\nAfter the giant pendulum, Lin Li went to play on the pirate ship.\nLin Li didn’t understand why the pirate ship was also on the thrill list.\nSome people even cried while playing this, what happened, did they really meet pirates?\nOnly one haunted house left, Lin Li didn’t forget the promise with Chen Yu Ying.\n「Lin Li: Monitor, I’ve done both the projects here, when are you planning to go to the haunted house」\n「Chen Yu Ying: So fast, we’re still watching the float parade, do you want to come over first, we can go after watching it?」\n「Lin Li: Okay.」\n「Chen Yu Ying: \"Location\"」\nThe approximate location was actually quite easy to find.\nAfter all, the float parade is a long convoy.\nBoth sides of the float parade route were fenced to prevent re-entry, with visitors standing on both sides.\nAfter finding the nearest float road, Lin Li followed the crowd to the location Chen Yu Ying sent him.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, what a coincidence, running into you again.\" Lin Li immediately spotted his buddy in the crowd.\nWang Yuezhi turned his head and saw Lin Li, his face immediately darkened.\n\"By the way, did you know—\"\nLin Li was about to ask if he had seen the monitor when he suddenly stopped, looked at his phone.\n2:12 in the afternoon.\nAt Nansang Middle School, the first class in the afternoon had already started for twelve minutes.\nIt’s not lunchtime.\nWang Yuezhi was no longer his good brother.\nNo longer familiar.\n\"Never mind, don’t want to talk to you, I’m leaving.\" Lin Li threw that out there and walked away without looking back.\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\nWhy such a drastic change in attitude? Why?\n\"Lin Li, over here!\"\n\"Coming!\"\nBut before Wang Yuezhi could ponder on Lin Li’s abrupt shift in temperament, he saw Chen Yu Ying greeting Lin Li not far away, and Lin Li running over to her.\nNot amused at all.\nThe initially entertaining float suddenly became boring.\nDidn’t want to watch anymore, Wang Yuezhi suddenly felt like playing on the giant pendulum.\n\"Bigu Bibi—\" In the float parade, a cute chibi clown was dancing adorably along with the music, handing out little gifts to the visitors just like other mascots.\nPerhaps drawn by a kindred spirit, it noticed Wang Yuezhi right away, blowing a giant toy blow dragon—a plastic extender that stretches when blown and retracts when the air is released—approached Wang Yuezhi with a comical clown strut.\nIt reached into its chest pocket, rummaged around, and finally pulled out a red nose, not giving it to the surrounding eagerly wanting tourists, but firmly pressing it onto Wang Yuezhi’s obviously unhappy nose.\nNice!\nThe clown was very satisfied with its masterpiece!\n\"Bigu Bibi—Wish you happiness! Be happy every day!\" A mechanical voice came from inside the clown, probably a recording controlled by a button.\nThen the adorable clown left with the music.\nWhen Wang Yuezhi regained his composure, he was silent.\nWhat difference is there between me and this clown?\nAnswer: I’m not as cute as it is.\nDamn it.\nAfter realizing this, Wang Yuezhi was even more broken-hearted.\nHe decided to go on the giant pendulum a hundred times! One! Hundred! Times!\nForget it, it doesn’t mean anything anyway, still end up exhausted—\nHe planned to hang himself at the entrance of Pingjiang Amusement Park!!\nIn anger, Wang Yuezhi decided to leave.\n\"Hey student, your clown nose fell off!\" A girl from another school saw the rolling clown nose on the ground and quickly shouted to the departing owner.\nThe voice was sweet.\n\"Damn—!!!\"\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.

      "content": "Chapter 126: Chapter 116: Nikon guy’s WeChat got flooded with friend requests\nLin Li snapped his head around.\nWho was the uncivilized person who just yelled \"grass\"?\nGave himself a scare.\nLin Li felt that in a place with many children, it’s best to mind one’s behavior on the surface. Really lacking in manners.\nLin Li came to the side of Chen Yu Ying and the three others.\n\"Great, Lin Li, you’re finally here.\" Upon seeing Lin Li, Ding Sihan was somewhat excited and took a step forward.\nBut Lin Li immediately took a step back.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nThe half-step retreat, are you serious? Such a small move has a surprisingly big impact.\n\"What do you mean?\" Ding Sihan inquired.\n\"Your mood affects my mood. If you think something good is happening, then I believe nothing good is happening.\" Lin Li said honestly and sincerely.\n\"You’re driving me crazy, I’m not talking to you anymore.\" Ding Sihan stomped her foot forcefully.\nChen Yu Ying chuckled and also took a step towards Lin Li.\nLin Li stepped forward: \"Need any help, class monitor?\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nYou’re not even willing to stay in one spot.\n\"Could you help us three take a picture with the flower float? Didn’t bring a selfie stick, and it’s hard to capture it fully holding it by hand, not very satisfying.\" Chen Yu Ying handed her phone to Lin Li.\n\"Of course, no problem.\" Lin Li nodded and took Chen Yu Ying’s phone.\nThe phone was on the camera interface, and a selfie of Chen Yu Ying was visible in the bottom left corner.\nReally tempted to click into it and have a look.\nIf it were Bai Bufan’s phone, Lin Li would have clicked in and analyzed frame by frame long ago, but looking at a girl’s photo album without permission is an extreme offense, so Lin Li only stayed at the thought stage.\n\"Wait before taking the picture,\" Ding Sihan said with a serious face.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"I stomped my foot when you drove me crazy, now my foot is numb.\" Ding Sihan’s face looked pitiful.\n\"Serves you right.\" Lin Li laughed out loud.\n...\n\"Okay, stand a little to the left, yes, that position. If there’s any movement, feel free to pose.\" During the gap in the flower float march, Lin Li clicked the shutter furiously.\n\"Alright, you guys take a look at the results first.\"\nThree heads came together, and Lin Li displayed the phone for them to see.\nNot bad, the liveliness of the mascots and the delicacy of the flower float were well captured.\nThe three looked up at Lin Li.\n\"How about the lighting and composition? I think it’s superb!\" Lin Li chuckled as he asked.\n\"Why do I only have one head?\" Chen Yu Ying pursed her lips, her cheeks slightly puffed, as if glaring at Lin Li.\nKind of cute.\n\"Class monitor, if you had more than one head, this phone would be jinxed. Let me educate you; normal people only have one head. You’re not Tomie, right? Hey? Just saying, looks are fine, charm is fine. Damn, could you really be...\"\nLin Li wasn’t scared by the cute ghost but seriously analyzed.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"I! Mean! Why does the picture only have my head left in the corner!\" Watching Lin Li start analyzing the possibility of her being Tomie, Chen Yu Ying spoke angrily, word by word.\n\"Ying Bao, you’re doing fine. Did you see me? There’s only a quarter of my face visible.\" Ding Sihan sneered, gritting her teeth.\n\"Qu Wanqiu, stop pulling my clothes. My clothes cost eighteen hundred, eighteen hundred! They’re going to stretch!\" Lin Li warned the culprit as he was pulled to the side while thinking.\nQu Wanqiu immediately let go.\n\"When I kicked his butt in the morning, he said his pants cost eight thousand and one. Wanqiu, don’t believe him, keep pulling!\" Ding Sihan revealed the secret with one sentence.\nQu Wanqiu obediently complied, not only pulling more forcefully, she picked up Chen Yu Ying’s phone and almost shoved it up to Lin Li’s face: \"Lin Li, answer me this! Where am I in this photo?! Where am I?!\"\n\"How could I have missed you? See that strand of hair next to a quarter of Ding Sihan? That’s you.\" Lin Li held the phone, enlarged the image tenfold, and spoke seriously.\nDing Sihan, Qu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nThere is murderous intent.\nDanger.\n\"Alright, won’t tease you anymore; this one’s on purpose. Flip to the next ones, they’re all shot normally.\" Lin Li explained with a grin only visible to the naked eye from their discontent, \"I’m not a Nikon guy.\"\nThe Canon guys have their WeChat blowing up with girls adding them, while a Nikon guy climbs out of the reeds saying the bird was awesome earlier.\nNikon for human shots, specializing in razor-sharp backgrounds, with the subject melting like cream — completely wrong focus.\nChen Yu Ying’s puffed-up cheeks finally eased as she started flipping through the later pictures.\nIn the later pictures, the main subjects had become the three of them, capturing full upper bodies and even full-body shots.\nLin Li stood blocking the sunlight to allow Chen Yu Ying a clearer view while asking, \"How’s this?\"\nThis is truly my actual skill.\n\"Eh, not so great...\" Ding Sihan commented.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Feels like the pictures are distorted.\" Qu Wanqiu added.\nLin Li: \"Ah...\"\nLin Li glanced at Chen Yu Ying, the last straw, cautiously asking, \"Class monitor, I immediately realized these two petty-minded folks are deliberately slandering my magnificent creations. You won’t tell me they’re not that bad, will you?\"\nThe last one was a joke, but the previous ones I took seriously! Am I really not good at photographing? This is too discouraging!\n\"...hmm, not bad.\" Chen Yu Ying blinked her bright eyes several times before replying.\nHer tone sounded as if she were reassuring Lin Li that three seconds was impressive enough, and next time maybe five seconds without medication could be achieved.\n\"My heart now feels like a peeled potato.\" Lin Li’s expression was dejected.\n\"What’s this analogy?\" Chen Yu Ying didn’t catch it for a moment.\n\"From POTATO to OTATO.\" After explaining, Lin Li took Chen Yu Ying’s phone back, gesturing sadly for them to stand back again: \"Alright, let’s try again. You guys guide me a bit...\"\nAll his previous swagger was gone.\nAlready obedient.\nTurns out neither intentionally nor unintentionally works...\nChen Yu Ying and the trio burst out laughing together.\n...\nUnder the guidance of the three and Lin Li’s rapid-fire technique of winning with quantity, finally, photos that satisfied all three were captured.\nLin Li’s photography skills attained remarkable finesse — personally praised by Chen Yu Ying.\nAfter the flower float parade ended, the trio went towards the ghost house named Tianshan Hospital in Pingjiang Amusement Park.\nThe three walked hand in hand ahead, while Lin Li followed behind with hands on the back of his head.\nGirls just love walking hand in hand, when they form a four-person line at school, it’s instantly a mega roadblock.\nThis behavior is truly annoying, unless they add me in.\nSadly, they don’t seem willing.\n\"Class monitor, are you afraid of ghosts?\" Lin Li sped up to walk alongside the three, asking.\n\"I’m not that afraid of creepy scenes, but I’m scared of jump scares.\" Chen Yu Ying replied upon hearing, \"When watching horror movies, I need the subtitles to warn me of upcoming big scares before I dare to watch.\"\nThis method doesn’t work well now because some videos have ’upcoming big scare’ written all over, terrified for some time, only to hear ’Hi everyone, I’m a trainee who’s practiced for two and a half years, big scare.’\nLin Li looked at the project info on his phone, then nodded: \"There are real NPCs, seems there might be jump scares, that’s great. Oh wait, that’s terrible.\"\n\"I heard that!\" Chen Yu Ying glared at Lin Li again, \"Not good at all!\"\n\"Yes yes, not good. I’m definitely not hoping you’ll be scared and then cling to me or grab my hand,\" Lin Li laughed, \"Don’t worry, with me around, if we encounter danger, I’ll definitely push you forward while extending my hand for you to grab.\"\nLin Li began to narrate his criminal plan.\n\"Who puts people forward to protect them!\" Chen Yu Ying raised her fist and punched Lin Li’s arm lightly.\nNot even a bit of force.\nLin Li felt he could withstand another hundred punches! One! Hundred! Punches!\n\"Heh, Ying Bao, you just follow me carefree. Some shady, despicable ideas of little people, I absolutely won’t let them materialize.\" Ding Sihan sneered and spoke.\n\"Exactly, there’s me too!\" Qu Wanqiu nodded, \"We’ve already decided to strip this little person of his ZZ rights for life!\"\nThese two daughters really brought a burst of laughter.\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.

      "content": "Chapter 127: Chapter 117: Is a Gentle Person Gentle to Everyone?\nArriving at the world’s highest city, Tianshan Hospital.\nAll four of them had fast passes for this attraction, so there was hardly any waiting time before it was their turn.\n\"This attraction requires groups of eight to ten people to enter together. Do you four want to find others yourselves, or join with other tourists?\" After scanning their fast passes, the staff member asked.\nIt would be too slow and unnecessary to gather people themselves. After exchanging glances, Chen Yu Ying told the staff to choose the latter.\n\"Alright, you can go inside and wait in the waiting area for a bit.\" The staff nodded.\nThe four of them walked inside.\n\"Hey, isn’t that Chen Tianming?\" Chen Yu Ying pointed forward with her hand.\nLin Li looked over, and it really was Chen Tianming. He was with two girls, and the one with short hair was likely Yao Qiaoqiao.\nChen Tianming seemed to notice Lin Li as well, but instead of greeting him right away, he looked at his phone.\nLin Li understood and took out his own phone.\n\"Chen Tianming: From now on, let’s call each other what we like; I’ll call you dad, and you call me brother. Please, dad.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"What a coincidence, Tianming.\" Lin Li chuckled to himself and waved.\n\"Hey, Lin Li?\" Chen Tianming looked ’surprised’ at Lin Li, then came over to fist bump him.\n\"Thanks, dad.\" Chen Tianming whispered.\nEven standing nearby, Chen Yu Ying heard it. She blinked and tilted her head in confusion.\nSuch a complicated relationship.\n\"No need to call me dad. I don’t know what you’re up to, but I’ll go along with it as long as you treat Bufan and Bao Wei to breakfast next week.\" Lin Li replied succinctly.\n\"Deal.\" Even though he didn’t know why he had to buy them breakfast, Chen Tianming agreed.\nYao Qiaoqiao’s attention was drawn by their voices and actions.\nUpon seeing Lin Li, she came over, crossing her arms and tilting her head slightly, asking, \"Lin Li, why haven’t you accepted my WeChat request?\"\nShe wore makeup today too, but still didn’t look as good as Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Oh, sorry about that. Tianming reminded me, but I didn’t notice at first, and then I just forgot. My bad.\" Lin Li wasn’t lying; he really did forget.\n\"No worries, I don’t blame you. I’ll send the request again, and it should go through this time, right?\" Yao Qiaoqiao tapped her phone with her nail, producing a crisp sound, and asked in a gentle voice.\n\"Sure, and sorry again.\" Lin Li took out his phone and accepted \"Hazelle’s\" friend request.\nEven though his vocabulary had reached H, Lin Li still didn’t know what this English word meant.\n\"I’m Yao Qiaoqiao, remember? I’ve always remembered your name.\" Yao Qiaoqiao spoke again.\n\"Of course, Tianming mentions you often, how could I forget?\" Lin Li smiled.\nHe ignored the grateful look from Chen Tianming next to him.\nThis was something he should do.\n\"Thanks for remembering my name. You guys are here for the haunted house too? You still need more people, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Why don’t we go together? There are three of us still waiting too. Oh, this is my classmate, Fan Rou.\"\n\"First of all, nice to meet you, classmate,\" Lin Li gestured to the three standing beside him: \"Secondly, ask them. My decision-making rights have been permanently revoked. I’m no longer a complete person with rights.\"\nYao Qiaoqiao: \"?\"\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu playfully punched Lin Li from behind.\nSolid punches.\nRubbing his sore waist, Lin Li shrugged, \"See, I’m just a punching bag now.\"\n\"Let’s go together.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nThere wasn’t really a need to ask; according to the staff’s arrangement, they would clearly be going together.\nBut Chen Yu Ying thought for a moment and figured if Lin Li agreed without asking them, or only asked after accepting, it might indeed make people uncomfortable.\n\"There’s a locker over there, let’s put our bags there first,\" suggested Ding Sihan.\n\"It’s rare for you not to be lazy for once, help me put my bag too, thanks.\" Lin Li handed his almost empty bag to Ding Sihan.\n\"Your backpack can stay or go, but you have to come.\" Ding Sihan didn’t grab Lin Li’s bag but grabbed his hand, speaking through a smiling grin.\nThus, Lin Li was pulled over.\nThe four of them reached the locker area.\n\"What’s going on, who’s that? Is there drama here? Does Chen Tianming like her? So curious!\" Ding Sihan licked her lips, eager to ask.\nIt seemed her inquisitive nature had exploded.\nSo cute, makes one want to sit on her.\n\"Since you saw it, there’s no harm in telling you. But it’s still in the early stages, so it’s best not to spread it...\" With that preface, Lin Li shared the general situation with them.\n\"I see, so does Yao Qiaoqiao like Chen Tianming?\" Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu suddenly understood.\n\"I don’t know today’s progress, but it doesn’t look like it. After all, Yao Qiaoqiao brought her classmate along; if it were a real date, she wouldn’t bring a third wheel.\" Lin Li analyzed.\nWhat Lin Li didn’t mention was that, based on his impression of Chen Tianming, he strongly suspected this guy forced himself between the two girls as the third wheel.\nChen Yu Ying frowned slightly and, after hesitating for a moment, softly said, \"Though it’s not good to talk about others behind their backs, this girl seems a bit, hmm... strange? But I can’t quite put my finger on what’s weird about her.\"\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!",

She’s far from being as naturally cute and easygoing as you, class monitor. She seems like she’s planned every move.\nAlthough judging someone negatively based on just a few looks and words is indeed irresponsible, I believe in my boyish sixth sense and your girlish sixth sense, class monitor. If there’s a mistake, it would be your fault.\" Lin Li said with a smile.\n\"Flattering only to undermine me, not happy about it,\" Chen Yu Ying heard the latter part and playfully punched Lin Li’s arm: \"Also, it’s your opinion, if it’s wrong, that’s your issue.\"\nThe punch had a bit of force.\nOnly 99 more to go.\n\"Really? How come I didn’t feel that?\" Ding Sihan scratched her head.\nLin Li glanced at her, sighed, but said nothing.\n\"What do you mean!\"\n\"Huh? I didn’t say anything?\"\n...\nWhen the four of them returned after dropping off their bags, they acquired two more people, looking like a couple, not students.\nThe staff saw the four returning and signaled everyone to come over.\n\"...So everyone just needs to find three keys in various rooms of the hospital within the given time, get the password, and you can open the door to leave the hospital, escaping to safety.\" The staff narrated the backstory.\nThen they collected the phones, gave everyone mini flashlights that seemed like they were bought for three bucks from a street stall, and let everyone set off.\n\"Tianming, being the bravest and smartest among us, I’m a bit scared, so I’ll leave the task of leading to you.\" Lin Li praised.\n\"Overly praised, overly praised, not worthy, but no problem, I’ll take the lead.\" Chen Tianming waved his hand, indicating it’s a trivial matter.\nThose in the know, Chen Yu Ying and the others, heard this formal way of speaking and just turned their heads away in amusement.\nSo Lin Li walked in the middle, followed by Chen Yu Ying and the others behind him.\n\"Baby, we’ll walk at the back. I’ll definitely protect you well.\" The boyfriend said to his girlfriend.\nAs the staff closed the entrance door, the lights instantly dimmed, the haunted house filled with creepy rustling sounds, instantly setting up the atmosphere.\nIf it weren’t for the crowd, Lin Li really wanted to bow to Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu.\n\"Ying Bao, don’t grab me, I’m scared.\"\n\"Yu Ying, don’t grab me either, I’m scared too.\"\nSee, these two pretend to be tough. They told Chen Yu Ying they’d protect her going in, but changed as soon as they entered.\nChanging is good.\n\"Class monitor, you grab me, I’m not scared.\" Lin Li said, holding back his laughter.\n\"You two...\" In the darkness, Chen Yu Ying’s eyes reflected brightly in the flashlight’s beam.\nFinally, she stood behind Lin Li, gingerly holding onto the hem of his supposedly expensive $1800 coat.\n\"We’ve reached the intersection, nothing’s spooked us on the way. It feels like something’s about to happen now, everyone be careful.\" Leading the way, Chen Tianming walked on calmly, while turning his head to caution everyone.\n\"Why don’t you treat me—!! Why!\"\nRight as he spoke, a sharp, raspy female scream suddenly came from the right wall, and a bloody fake head popped out, with only the eyes emitting a creepy red light.\nThough warned by Chen Tianming, it was still a sudden scene, even Lin Li felt his heart tighten, instinctively tensing his body.\nAnd the girl behind was even more distressed, letting out a scream, her hand briefly loosened, but then changed to using both hands gripping the lower part of his back, pressing her arms against him.\nThose annoying arms.\nForget it, there’s no part of the class monitor that’s annoying.\nSpit, spit, spit.\nThat previous thought doesn’t count, taking it back.\nThe annoying part was his own $1800 coat bought for $32.90.\nLin Li turned back, preparing to comfort Chen Yu Ying:\n\"Class monitor, don’t... Ding Sihan!? Damn! Why the heck is it you!!!\"\nDamn, the suddenly popping fake head didn’t scare him, but seeing it was Ding Sihan holding his coat did.\nHe wanted to die.\nThis was a real haunted house!\nHe swept the flashlight across behind him.\nAt this moment, Chen Yu Ying was covering the lower part of her face with her fists, leaning against the wall. Hearing Lin Li call her name, she shuddered due to the volume, then raised her head with slightly panicked eyes to look at him.\nSo cute, he wanted to pet her a hundred times.\n\"Hahaha!! I saw Ying Bao being scared and crouching against the wall, so I came up. After all, I’m scared too~\" Lin Li’s \"seeing ghosts\" expression made Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu burst into laughter.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nI’m afraid of ghosts; they don’t harm me at all. I’m not afraid of people, yet they hurt me all over.\nThough he forgot who once shared this with him, Lin Li completely understood now.\nThose annoying arms.\nThere’s no part of Ding Sihan that’s not annoying.\n\"You guys... being behind me is too dangerous, everyone in front of me now.\"\nCovered in black lines, Lin Li stepped back a few paces, moving to the front of the couple, behind Chen Yu Ying and the others.\nNever expose your back to someone you don’t trust.\nThe truth.\n\"Yu Ying is way too rational in the face of danger, no choice, hahaha, Wanqiu, did you see Lin Li’s expression just now? Not having a phone to record it is such a pity. He looked like he saw something dirty, hahaha—\"",

Always hate you... Always...\" Ding Xiaogui found himself at home in the haunted house.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nI’m the one scared, I’m also the one hated, is this reasonable?\nThe haunted house continued forward, similar fright devices were constantly triggered.\nLin Li from behind could see clearly, Chen Yu Ying, once scared, would clench her fists tightly crossed in front of her to hold herself, then lean against the wall to relieve her fear.\nShe wouldn’t act like the stereotype Lin Li had of girls, randomly hugging anything in fear.\nDamn it, this allowed Ding Sihan to take advantage of the situation.\n\"Dada Dada Dada!!\" Suddenly, the sound of rattling started behind them.\n\"Got you all! Stay here for me!\" Everyone turned around and saw a figure holding a chainsaw slowly appear, then start running towards them.\n\"The chase is on, everyone run!\" Chen Tianming wisely concluded and shouted immediately.\nEveryone started screaming and running.\nThe couple at the very back became the first targets.\n\"Husband save me! Husband!\" The girl seemed too scared to move, squatted directly on the ground, holding her head, trembling as she called for her boyfriend.\nLin Li paused his steps, hesitated for a moment, then couldn’t help but say: \"Sis, your husband already ran away.\"\nAs soon as Chain Saw Man appeared, he was gone in a flash, even Lin Li, a cultivator, nearly couldn’t catch his figure.\nThe woman: \"?\"\nThe woman opened her eyes, looked around, confirmed this, then her fear instantly melted away, leaving just an expressionless look.\nShe stood up, reached out to Chain Saw Man already waving his chainsaw in front of her to scare her, and said coldly: \"Give me the chainsaw.\"\nChain Saw Man: \"?\"\n\"Hurry up!\"\nMaybe her presence was too strong, Chain Saw Man blankly handed her his prop.\nThe woman tied her hair up with the scrunchie on her wrist, then asked Lin Li: \"Do you know which way he ran?\"\nLin Li pointed in a direction.\nThe woman stomped off with the chainsaw, walking in high heels.\n\"Liu Zhipeng! Wait for me!\"\nR.I.P.\nAlthough he didn’t know what was going to happen, Lin Li mourned for that guy.\nThen Lin Li headed toward the direction where the class leader and the other three girls ran according to his memory.\nAfter taking two steps, Lin Li stopped.\nTime seemed to rewind, Lin Li walked backwards, looking at Chain Saw Man without a chainsaw, sincerely asked: \"Buddy, since you don’t have your chainsaw, can you lend me your hood and clothes?\"\nThe opportunity for revenge against Ding Sihan had arrived!\nChain Saw Man: \"???\"\n\"Not cool buddy, aren’t you all being a bit too rude?!\" Chain Saw Man was really angry, this was too disrespectful to ghosts, even making the ghost speak plainly.\nLooks like his presence isn’t as strong as that woman’s.\n\"Lin Li? Lin Li!\"\nLin Li was just about to reason with Chain Saw Man when he heard Chen Yu Ying calling his name inside the haunted house.\n\"Hey! What’s up, class leader? I’m here!\" Chain Saw Man wasn’t as important as Chen Yu Ying, so Lin Li responded and headed towards the source of the voice.\nTurning the corner, under the dimly flickering light source, Lin Li saw Chen Yu Ying, as well as Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu beside her.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Lin Li asked warmly.\n\"Our Ying Bao noticed you weren’t following, worried that you might be scared or in some trouble, insisted on coming back to find you.\nWanqiu and I said we didn’t want to find you, this annoying guy, let her look alone if she wants, but Ying Bao insisted on coming, so we could only follow along, sigh, tsk tsk tsk.\"\nDing Sihan by the side spoke sarcastically.\nQu Wanqiu also smirked and nodded.\nEven if the words couldn’t be said earnestly, seeing Chen Yu Ying insist, they were definitely going to accompany her.\nYou can’t really let a fearful sister act alone in a haunted house, what kind of friend would that be?\n\"Can’t just leave Lin Li alone...\" Chen Yu Ying said softly.\nThe flashlight slightly swayed, the girl’s cheeks flickered in the light.\nHer eyes were always shining, like gems.\nLin Li paused for half a second, or a second, couldn’t count, then nodded with a smile:\n\"Thanks, class leader.\"\nHe began calling Xiaojing’s name over and over again in his heart.",

      "content": "Chapter 130: Chapter 118: Hello, changing size is not allowed here\nGentle girls are actually gentle to everyone. Don’t mistakenly think they are only gentle to you, then get smug and forget yourself, only to end up in an unhappy breakup, hurting both sides.\nThe mentor and Xiaojing alternated in their minds, stabilizing Lin Li’s wavering Dao heart once again.\nFor a cultivator to come this far is truly not easy, as the path is fraught with difficulties and obstacles.\n\"I didn’t have anything happen, I didn’t catch up because I was watching the show. I’ll tell you...\" Lin Li didn’t dwell on this matter but shared his recent experiences with the three.\nSome things are best kept mysterious and beautiful, there’s no need to dig too deep.\n\"So, what do you want the ghost head cover and clothes for?\" Ding Sihan squinted upon hearing the end.\n\"Of course, just to take a look and return it. What else? You think I’d wear it to purposely target you, Ding Sihan, chase you around while laughing maniacally, and then plan to kick your butt for revenge? No way, I wouldn’t do such a thing.\"\nLin Li stated his original plan for mischief.\n\"Where did that sister go earlier?\" Ding Sihan took a deep breath and asked with a smile.\n\"What do you want to do?\" Lin Li asked in return.\n\"Ask her if she’s finished with the chainsaw. If she is, then I need it to chop someone up too.\"\n\"Speaking of which, I think our priority should be to rejoin the main group.\" Lin Li analyzed rationally.\n...\nFound Chen Tianming and the three.\n\"Lin Li, are you okay?\" Yao Qiaoqiao asked with concern when she saw the four return.\n\"I’m fine.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Good you’re fine; I thought something happened to you.\" Yao Qiaoqiao also nodded.\nWith Chen Yu Ying shining brightly before them, Lin Li felt nothing and just smiled, saying thank you.\nOriginally, this wasn’t a dedicated escape room project, and the ghost house process wasn’t long. Shortly thereafter, under Chen Tianming’s lead, everyone escaped successfully within the prescribed time and saw the light again.\nThe young couple didn’t manage to escape; they’re probably stuck inside.\nWe mourn them again.\n[With fearless and carefree style, passed the eight challenges of the Pingjiang Secret Realm (8/8)]\n[Task five completed.]\n[You have earned rewards: Physical Improvement: Limb control ability increased by 100%; Random capability *1; System currency *100.]\nThe moment the reward appeared, Lin Li felt a sense of ’ease.’\nHis body felt more like his own; whether it’s waving hands or turning legs, he could strike poses more aligned with his intentions than before.\nThis so-called limb control ability, perhaps it’s body coordination ability?\nNow he could really dance more seductively than Xiaojing.\n[You have gained passive ability: Wall of the Soul]\n[Wall of the Soul: All attacks or manipulation intents aimed at your Divine Sense, or soul, will be blocked and weakened by 99%.]\nTask completed, rewards initiated, this time it’s a passive ability.\nIn the Cultivation Realm, this ability is indeed powerful, but unfortunately, in the modern age, this ability seems to be a useless appendage.\nLet it just enhance the richness of my resume.\nAfter grabbing the bag, some people needed to use the restroom, and Lin Li had this worldly desire too, so the group headed to the bathroom.\nJust as Lin Li walked into the restroom with Chen Tianming, he was pinned against the wall by Chen Tianming in a wall-thud style.\n\"Practice restraint, don’t mess around.\" After checking each stall to make sure no one was inside, Lin Li said with a face of ’shyness.’\nChen Tianming: \"...\"\nJesus.\nHow nauseating.\nThen, suppressing his speechlessness, Chen Tianming became excited and shared with Lin Li: \"We held hands! We held hands! In the ghost house, I held hands with Yao Qiaoqiao! Roughly estimating, we held hands for at least 0.65 seconds!\"\nYou are indeed rough in your estimates.\n\"Wow, so it turns out holding a girl’s hand is such a magical feeling; at that moment, I felt electrified. Lin Li, do you understand? Between us holding hands... Whoa!\" Chen Tianming said while pulling Lin Li’s hand, then suddenly let go.\n\"Why do I also feel electrified when I hold your hand? Do I like you too? Ah... this... no, right? Not good at all~\"\nThis time it was Chen Tianming’s turn to feel a bit shy.\nJesus.\nHow nauseating.\nShould’ve known better than to shock him.\n\"Forget it, it’s not important. Lin Li, I tell you, it’s not just holding hands. After Qiaoqiao got scared once, she directly clutched my clothes and hid behind me. It was such a romantic moment, Lin Li, do you understand? I nearly fainted back then...\"\nChen Tianming’s face turned red as he spoke, increasingly excited.\nLin Li heard this and sneered. He should’ve understood initially, but now, he doesn’t get it at all.\nDamn Ding Sihan, return this romance to me.\n\"Also, did you hear the sound Qiaoqiao made when she got scared? It’s way too cute...\"\n\"The bridge effect is really useful, my heart is pounding now. I wonder if Qiaoqiao feels the same as me; I feel like she probably does.\nLin Li, did you notice every time she got scared and I looked at her, she’d shyly turn her head away or directly hide in Fan Rou’s embrace? Who understands this level of cuteness... Too adorable...\nPlaying through the ghost house in advance to familiarize myself with the process is definitely the best decision I made today!\"\nIt’s clear that Chen Tianming is indeed extremely excited right now, chattering endlessly.\nAs for what Chen Tianming was talking about, Lin Li didn’t pay attention at all; he was too busy bantering with Chen Yu Ying and the others and eavesdropping on the quarrel between the young couple.\nHowever, Lin Li understood why Chen Tianming could navigate the ghost house effortlessly; he had scouted it out in advance.\nThat’s indeed clever.\n\"... Lin Li, what do you think is the best thing I should do next?\" Chen Tianming finally finished speaking, excitedly rubbing his hands together, prepared to listen for suggestions and iterate his approach.\nLin Li indeed had a suggestion:\n\"Let’s pee first.\" He said.\nChen Tianming: \"...\"\nIt’s true, but—\n\"Don’t say such a buzzkill thing at this time!\" Chen Tianming complained loudly.\n\"Fine, you big shot, if you don’t want to pee, don’t. I need to.\" Lin Li, who had been up against the wall for a long time, released Chen Tianming’s hand and walked to the urinal.\n\"I’ll pee too, I’ll pee too.\"\nLin Li habitually headed to the urinal in the farthest corner.\nThen he stared at Chen Tianming, who followed closely to stand beside him.\nThe unspoken rule of men’s restrooms is that when there’s plenty of room, everyone should keep a urinal in between. Chen Tianming’s behavior seriously invaded Lin Li’s airspace.\n\"C’mon buddy, there’s no need to be shy, I haven’t finished sharing my thoughts with you!\" Apparently, Chen Tianming intended to keep yammering.\n\"Whatever, just don’t get insecure about it later.\" Lin Li chuckled, pulling down his pants.\n\"Qiaoqiao, she...\" Chen Tianming suddenly fell silent, stopped unbuckling his belt, and quietly moved to the urinal closest to the door, starting to pee in silence.\nAfter a moment of silence, Chen Tianming turned his head reluctantly to Lin Li: \"Lin Li, did any of your ancestors work as an agricultural tool? Do you feel an ancestral bloodline suppression when you see a whip?\"\nLin Li responded with a snicker.\nDamn it.\n\"Hahaha, damn—\"\nAlready feeling resentful, Chen Tianming heard Lin Li’s surprised laughter, turned his head, flushed, and argued: \"Lin Li, don’t get cocky. You’re already seventeen, almost eighteen, an old geezer, stuck like that, but I’m only fifteen, with infinite possibilities! It’s your time now, but the future is mine!!\"\n\"The first part is true, but how are you fifteen? Are you using Doraemon’s self-deceiving ruler?\" Lin Li turned his head, still laughing.\n\"I was talking about age, damn it!\"\nBut actually, Lin Li wasn’t laughing at that.\nPeople laugh when they’re speechless, and Lin Li found that he had gained a little more control over his body than he intended.\nHello, you’re not allowed to randomly change things here.\nThough not yet able to do it on command, there’s a tendency for improvement. The negative effects of the increased yang energy are finally somewhat alleviated.\nThis system is still far too comprehensive.\nAfter finishing in the restroom, the two went to the sink to wash their hands.\nAfter washing his hands, Lin Li patted Chen Tianming’s shoulder: \"Tianming, you’re right, the future might indeed be yours, I believe in you.\"\nChen Tianming sighed, looking at Lin Li, who after patting his shoulder with one hand, switched to the other hand, and then used his fingers. He asked in confusion:\n\"Lin Li, isn’t there paper on the wall? Why are you wiping your hands on my clothes?\"\n\"Saving paper is everyone’s responsibility.\"\nChen Tianming: \"...\"\n\"But since you’ve figured out my intentions, I won’t lie. The future is yours? Ridiculous! No matter how much a little earthworm grows, it won’t become a python. Between the two of us, there’s reproductive isolation!\" Lin Li laughed wickedly.\nChen Tianming wiped his hands on Lin Li’s clothes with a dark expression.\n...\n\"Why do you boys take longer in the restroom than girls?\" When Lin Li and Chen Tianming came out, Ding Sihan questioned with hands on hips.\n\"Because I’m a delicate piggy boy, just did a round of health care in the restroom.\" Lin Li said without any remorse.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nThen Ding Sihan pinched her nose and stepped back: \"Your skincare products are indeed special. By the way, keep your distance from me from now on.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nDamn.\nThis round I lost, left a huge hole, need to be careful next time.\nAnd on the side, Chen Tianming, apparently not as shameless as Lin Li, quickly apologized shyly to Yao Qiaoqiao and Fan Rou: \"Sorry for making you wait, I apologize.\"\nDing Sihan’s gaze swept to Lin Li: Look at him.\n\"It’s alright.\" Yao Qiaoqiao immediately said.\nLin Li’s gaze swept to Ding Sihan: Look at her.\n\"What’s there to apologize for such a small thing.\"\nLin Li swept another glance at Ding Sihan: Look again.\n\"You’ve been waiting for me all day, it’s good to have a chance to wait for you now.\"\nLin Li kept sweeping his gaze at Ding Sihan, his eyes almost sparking: Look more!\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nHow audacious!\nShe suddenly somewhat believed Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying’s sixth sense—Yao Qiaoqiao is not a good person! Such a gentle girl shouldn’t exist in this world!\n\"Lin Li, what are you planning to play next?\" Yao Qiaoqiao suddenly asked Lin Li.\n\"We might need to find our classmates first.\" This time Lin Li didn’t ask Chen Yu Ying and the others, but answered himself.\n\"Oh, then I guess we can’t play together.\" Yao Qiaoqiao nodded.\nThus, the two groups parted ways in front of Tianshan Hospital.\n\"Who are we going to find?\" Qu Wanqiu asked blankly.\n\"Little bird, your emotional intelligence isn’t great. This is my preemptive excuse to stop her from joining us.\" Lin Li laughed, \"You three probably don’t want to join them, and Tianming definitely doesn’t want one lightbulb to turn into five.\"\n\"Class monitor, what do you say? The time is about right. Want to ride the Ferris wheel? I’ll go with you no matter what. Just remind me to get a small badge before the park closes.\" Lin Li looked at Chen Yu Ying.\nThe task is complete, the remaining time can be spent having fun, though there’s not much left.\nChen Yu Ying nodded at his words: \"Let’s go to the Ferris wheel.\"",

Will it make her think less of you?\"\nThe class leader really pays attention to details, considering even this angle.\nLin Li waved his hand dismissively, \"It doesn’t matter. If we do run into them and she asks, I’ll just say it’s to let Tianming get along with them. Besides, her opinion of me isn’t that important.\"\n\"Whose opinion is more important to you then?\" Qu Wanqiu chimed in with a mischievous smile.\n\"The Party and the State and the People!\"\nNow that Lin Li was not just part of the masses but also the youth league, he stood upright, clenched his right fist and thumped his left chest, and declared loudly.\nLoyalty! Faith!\nQu Wanqiu: \"???\"\n\"Eh? Yikes? Ha? Uh... Ah! Oh?\"\nAll were interjections; Qu Wanqiu said nothing yet seemed to say everything.\nWow.\nCan you really answer like that?\nThat’s not what I wanted to hear, was it?\nOn the side, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan were momentarily stunned by this response.\nThen, looking at Lin Li who stood upright like a model soldier, and the dumbfounded Qu Wanqiu, especially Qu Wanqiu’s expression of disbelief, the contrast was too great, and their laughter burst out quickly.\n\"Pfft hahaha——\"\nGradually, they laughed so hard they were bending over.\n\"You, you...\" Qu Wanqiu pointed at him.\n\"What’s wrong with me?\"\n\"You’re... amazing! You’re amazing!\" Finally regaining a bit of her ability to speak, Qu Wanqiu gave Lin Li a big thumbs up.\nShe acknowledged his level.\nLin Li then put away his chest-thumping gesture and smiled at the three.\nThinking they could stump me with this kind of question is too naive.\n\"Alright, stop laughing!\" Qu Wanqiu looked at Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying, who were already squatting on the ground, and stomped her foot in annoyance.\n\"I’m sorry, but Wanqiu, your expression just now was really funny, especially when Lin Li was thumping his chest all serious in front of you.\" Ding Sihan was already sitting on the ground, and as she spoke, she repeated and laughed even louder.\n\"My stomach hurts from laughing a bit, can you pull me up? I can’t get up.\" Chen Yu Ying’s eyes glistened with tears of laughter, clutching her stomach as she spoke.\nLin Li extended his hand.\nQu Wanqiu retracted her hand.\n\"Let’s go, seriously, no more laughing! We’re going to the Ferris wheel!\" Qu Wanqiu crossed her arms, glaring at Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Okay, okay, we’re coming.\"\nThe two barely held back their laughter, came to Qu Wanqiu’s side, and took her arms again, forming a super obstacle.\nLin Li was blocked behind by this super obstacle.\nFollowing the slow pace of the three, Lin Li walked calmly, pressing his left hand on his nape and alternately tapping with his fingers, glancing at his right hand.\n\"Did it feel like electric shocks?\"\nForget it, it’s not important.\n...\nThe Ferris wheel is quite popular, the queue is longer than for the famous thrill rides.\nBut it’s reasonable when you think about it, since it’s a ride suitable for all ages.\nMoreover, this ride doesn’t have a single rider’s lane; although each cabin can seat six people at most, even if only two come, they won’t forcibly fill the cabin with four others, allowing the two to enjoy the whole cabin.\nSo the efficiency isn’t very high, plus the speed of one round is slow, and the ’turnover rate’ is low.\nBut it’s just right to use the queue time to wait for the sunset to fill the sky with red.\n\"The setting sun cast an orange glow over the mountains.\"\nThe orange-red sunset shines on the mountains.\nHmm, consolidating the knowledge point, with such hard work, I will surely reach the top hundred in my grade at the next monthly exam.\n\"What are you babbling about?\" Ding Sihan heard and turned to ask.\nLin Li chuckled and shook his head, he and people like Ding Sihan have a regrettably thick barrier.\n\"It’s normal for someone like you not to understand, class leader, could you translate my English for this ignorant woman?\" Lin Li looked at Chen Yu Ying.\n\"You were speaking... English... just now?\" Chen Yu Ying turned her head, her doe-like eyes blinked.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nLin Li repeated in a very slow pace.\n\"Oh——\"\nThe three suddenly understood, now they got it.\n\"It’s fine, it was my speaking issue, Ding Sihan, I apologize for the hundred times I mocked you in my mind just now.\" Lin Li said, somewhat defeated.\n\"That’s too quick to mock! Luckily I’ve already cursed you ten thousand times in my heart!\" Ding Sihan rolled her eyes.\nAfter spending a whole half hour, it finally was the four’s turn.\nAfter going up, the three naturally sat in line, and Lin Li naturally took over Chen Yu Ying’s phone, preparing to take photos of the three of them.\nSometimes a tool person needs to have this kind of awareness.\n\"Wait until we’re a bit higher to take them, the background feels off for now.\" Chen Yu Ying looked at the photos Lin Li just took and said.\nThen she first began taking pictures of the gradually rising view outside the window with her phone.\nLin Li heard and leisurely lay on his side, comfortably occupying one side, resting his head, looking at the sky through the other side.\nQuite cozy.\nBut wealth can’t show off, he was barely comfortable for a few seconds before this scoundrel Ding Sihan targeted him.\n\"Move, move, let me lie down too!\" Ding Sihan nudged the side of Lin Li’s shoe with the tip of her own, urging him.\nNext time, you should put on an uncomfortable face.\nLin Li sat on the other side, looking at the scenery outside through the transparent cabin wall.\nThe sunset really made for a beautiful view.\n\"It’s actually quite comfortable. If only there was a pillow, it’d be perfect,\" remarked Ding Sihan, who was lying back comfortably due to being much shorter than Lin Li.\n\"Ding Sihan, do you know the most comfortable way to position your tongue?\" Lin Li suddenly asked.\n\"Huh? Tongue? How to position it?\" Ding Sihan was a bit curious.\n\"When you’re not aware of it, any way is comfortable,\" Lin Li said with a smile.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nOh no!\nUpon realizing her tongue was in her mouth, Ding Sihan suddenly felt like no position was right!\n\"Oh, and remember to breathe,\" Lin Li cheerily added.\nOnce you’re aware of your breathing, it switches from automatic to manual.\nDing Sihan shot up to a sitting position, now feeling like ants were crawling all over her!\n\"Lin Li, I’m going to kill you!\"\n\"Class Rep, save me!\" Lin Li called out to Chen Yu Ying for help.\n\"No saving...\"\nChen Yu Ying and Qu Wanqiu not only distanced themselves from Lin Li to help Ding Sihan get him, but also gave him accusing looks.\nOh, I forgot, Chen Yu Ying and Qu Wanqiu also have tongues and need to breathe.\nI inadvertently caused area-of-effect damage, and they were collateral damage.\nIt took thirty seconds of ads before Lin Li could respawn.\nBy now, the slowly rotating Ferris wheel had reached its highest point, and Lin Li resumed his role as the group’s handyman.\nNow and then, he joined in, leaving traces on his phone.\nAfter taking photos, the four of them each guarded a corner of the window, watching the outside world.\n\"This is the sightseeing train meant for kids, it’s so cute,\" Chen Yu Ying said to everyone while taking pictures.\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu came over following her words. After expressing their admiration and discovering that the little train was restricted to children aged 3-12, they gave up the idea of riding it later.\n\"Class Rep, trolley problem: Lin Li ties five innocent kids to the trolley tracks, and an out-of-control sightseeing train is heading towards them, about to run them over any second.\nFortunately, you can pull a lever to switch the trolley to another track, but the problem is, Lin Li has tied one child to the other track. In this scenario, would you pull the lever?\"\nLin Li’s thoughts differed slightly from the girls, so he asked.\n\"Lin Li is too wicked!\" Ding Sihan commented upon hearing it.\nChen Yu Ying thought for a moment and softly said, \"I used to think about it, and I figured I wouldn’t do anything.\"\n\"Same as my choice,\" Lin Li nodded, then looked at Ding Sihan.\n\"I would pull...\"\n\"That’s not what I wanted to ask,\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"Then what are you asking?\" Ding Sihan was somewhat wary.\n\"Ding Sihan, trolley problem: right now, no one is on the tracks, would you be willing to lay down and be the observer?\" Lin Li inquired.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Why does it suddenly become this kind of question for me? I’m not willing at all!\" Ding Sihan kicked Lin Li’s leg.\nLin Li nodded and then turned to the even more cautious Qu Wanqiu:\n\"Qu Wanqiu, trolley problem: Lin Li ties five Ding Sihans to one trolley track, and on another track, there’s only one Qu Wanqiu. An out-of-control little train comes, and you have a remote that can make the train accelerate, super accelerate, or invincibly accelerate, what would you do?\"\nQu Wanqiu: \"?\"\n\"Why am I always the one lying there! Where did these five of me come from? And why aren’t there any options where I survive? Lin Li, I’m angry! I’m going to push you off right now!\" Ding Sihan was extremely furious!\nThis was blatant targeting!\nQu Wanqiu seriously thought about it and sincerely asked, \"If I press all three buttons, does it become super invincible acceleration?\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Of course!\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\n\"Then I’ll press them all! A hundred times! One! Hundred! Times!\" Qu Wanqiu, who clearly had a hearty meal, said with assertiveness.\nDing Sihan: \"!\"\n\"Wanqiu! You can go free fall too!\"\nChen Yu Ying watched this scene with a laugh.\nShe was silently grateful that once the Ferris wheel started, the interior couldn’t be opened, or she would witness two murders.\n...\nFifteen minutes flew by in the blink of an eye.\nThose below the Ferris wheel hated how slowly it turned, while those on it felt it spun too fast.\nThe setting sun stretched the shadows of the four.\nNo one was lining up for the Ferris wheel anymore.\nIn Pingjiang Amusement Park, a melodious tune began to play, reminding everyone that the park was closing and no more projects would accept queues.\n\"Let’s go back to the bus,\" said Lin Li, reviving after a sixty-second ad, leisurely walking toward the exit with his hands behind his head.\n\"Yeah, okay,\" Chen Yu Ying followed behind, nodding.\nShe then looked back at the gradually stopping rides, feeling a bit sentimental: \"I wonder when we’ll be this happy again like today.\"\n\"Tomorrow,\" Lin Li continued walking, casually replying.\nThe afternoon breeze blew by, pressing a few strands of ink-black hair against the girl’s cheek.\nChen Yu Ying paused for a moment at Lin Li’s words, looked at his back, then smiled brightly:\n\"Yeah, tomorrow.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 132: Chapter 120: He’s Still a Child!!\n\"Oh no!\" Lin Li stopped in his tracks and turned around.\n\"Ah...\" Chen Yu Ying, walking behind him, did not anticipate the sudden stop and bumped into him, wobbling unsteadily.\nLin Li quickly held onto Chen Yu Ying’s shoulders to prevent her from falling.\n\"What’s wrong, Lin Li? Did you forget something?\" Chen Yu Ying stepped back to stabilize herself, rubbed her head, and asked with concern.\n\"Class monitor, it’s actually your fault; you didn’t remind me to get my Warrior Medal.\" Lin Li looked at Chen Yu Ying with a playful glint in his eyes.\n\"Ah!\" Chen Yu Ying pressed her finger against her lips, her face as red as the evening glow.\nOnly after Lin Li mentioned it did she remember the matter.\n\"I’m so sorry... I truly forgot...\" Chen Yu Ying said apologetically.\nNo matter the wait time for the Ferris wheel or the joy of ending with this attraction, it all exceeded her expectations, and thus Lin Li’s ’task’ slipped her mind.\n\"It’s okay, they haven’t closed the park yet anyway. Class monitor, could you please hold my backpack? I’ll run over and get it now.\" Lin Li’s blame was naturally in jest; he checked his phone for the office’s location and said to Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Okay, give it to me.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, took Lin Li’s backpack, and held it in her arms. \"Shall we wait for you here?\"\n\"There’s no need to get that, is there? I’ve seen pictures, and it’s not a delicate little gift—just a really ordinary medal, like the kind you get a bag of for ten bucks. If you forgot it, just leave it,\" Ding Sihan, standing beside them, said with crossed arms.\n\"Even if it only costs a few bucks, I still want to get it. It’s a symbol of my honor!\" Lin Li laughed confidently at Ding Sihan’s teasing, then turned to Chen Yu Ying. \"It’s fine, you guys can head back to the bus. I’ll run over and find you later.\"\nSince they were already here, they played, and it was a festive day, after all, Lin Li was still just a kid.\nThe bonus was all stacked; he had to get it.\n\"It’s alright, we’ll wait for you here. We can take a few more photos.\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head.\n\"Alright, I’ll be quick!\" Without his backpack holding him back, Lin Li memorized the route on his phone, waved to them, and sprinted towards the place to pick up the medal.\nThe wind danced at his feet, with the sunset as his backdrop.\n\"Lin Li is running really fast,\" Ding Sihan said in surprise as she watched Lin Li’s rapidly receding figure.\n\"He really is.\" Qu Wanqiu echoed in amazement.\nInstead of slowing down after a hundred meters, Lin Li seemed to be speeding up.\nDuring physical tests, both boys and girls were often in the same class, and to save time, they started running just seconds apart, sharing the same track.\nIn extreme cases, some slower boys in the latter half of the kilometer might experience the embarrassment of being overtaken by the fastest girls who still had energy left.\nUnfortunately, Lin Li was one of those boys who occasionally faced such situations.\nThe girls, naturally, also noticed this. Although no one openly joked about it, it was somewhat disgraceful and something that would be teased behind their backs.\n\"Lin Li exercises so diligently; it’s only natural that his physique has improved,\" Chen Yu Ying said happily, looking at where Lin Li disappeared around the corner.\n\"So he really gets up at five every day to exercise like today? That’s really... exaggerated. Why did he suddenly start doing that?\" Ding Sihan asked curiously.\n\"I think...\" Qu Wanqiu’s tone turned teasing, and she looked at Chen Yu Ying, \"he wants to be worthy of better people.\"\n\"Oh——\" Ding Sihan immediately began to jeer.\nChen Yu Ying bit her lower lip with her upper teeth, then slowly released it, explaining shyly and angrily for Lin Li, \"He’s doing it for the Party, the country, and the people!\"\nDing Sihan, Qu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nYou’ve learned too, haven’t you?\nHanging out with Lin Li really does turn you bad.\n...\n\"I’m back, let’s go!\" Lin Li shouted as he jogged back and saw Chen Yu Ying and the others from afar.\nHe was a bit out of breath and his steps were weary, but considering he ran the whole way, Lin Li felt quite accomplished.\nNow, in a fantasy novel, he’d at least be a half-step into the peak of the first level of being an athletic student.\n\"Did you get your medal?\" Chen Yu Ying asked as Lin Li got closer.\nLin Li patted his chest, revealing the medal already pinned there.\n\"So cheap-looking! And Lin Li, you look so proud, like a little kid,\" Ding Sihan laughed upon seeing it clearly.\nThe supposed cost of a few bucks each seemed a bit extravagant now; after seeing the real thing, Ding Sihan felt it must have cost only a few cents each.\nEven the Pingjiang Amusement Park logo on it was somewhat smeared, and the craftsmanship was quite rough.\n\"Ignorant woman, I won’t argue with you, but you’d better sleep with one eye open tonight, otherwise you might find yourself tied to the tracks with four other Ding Sihans tomorrow morning,\" Lin Li threatened with a cold laugh.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Is the train track incident still not over? And did you sneak into our room at night just to tie me up?\"\nDing Sihan picked up a small stone from the ground and threw it at Lin Li angrily.\n\"I didn’t say I’d only tie you up. Wouldn’t take the whole night for just that; the rest is a matter not to be heard without an adult’s company. You can ask me in two and a half years,\" Lin Li dodged Ding Sihan’s attack and then, while avoiding her wrathful assault, laughed and said to the class monitor, \"Class monitor, loudly tell them what kind of person I am!\"\n\"...A disciplined pervert,\" Chen Yu Ying said softly, caught off guard by being dragged into the conversation.\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu stared at the proud Lin Li: \"?\"\nWhat’s there to be proud of? So happy to be insulted, Lin Li, are you a masochist?\nChen Yu Ying handed Lin Li’s backpack back to him.\nLin Li took it without immediately putting it on; instead, he stroked and sniffed it crazily like a pet, chuckling, \"It smells so nice, this backpack will never be washed in its lifetime, hehe~\"\nThe \"hehe\" he learned from Bai Bufan was the finishing touch.\n\"Don’t do that!\" Chen Yu Ying’s face turned red again.\nThis is too perverted!\n\"Just a sniff, just a sniff!\"\nWatching the two fool around, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu exchanged a glance and nodded understandingly: \"Indeed, it is perverted.\"\n...\nBy the time they reached Pingjiang Amusement Park’s main entrance, the bus from Nansang Middle School was already waiting outside, and Xue Jian was walking around the bus, counting the students.\n\"Teacher Wangzi, you’ve worked hard.\" As Lin Li passed by the Class Seventeen bus, he greeted Wang Ziyan.\nSeeing that it was Lin Li, Wang Ziyan forced a smile: \"Lin Li, please don’t let me see you again; some things I just don’t want to be reminded of.\"\n\"Understood.\" Lin Li nodded sincerely.\nLin Li boarded the bus, and about two-thirds of the class was already seated. At that moment, Lin Li was like an old general on stage, walking boldly and pointing to the medal on his chest, challenging the world: \"Who else is a Pingjiang Warrior!\"\nNo one responded.\n\"It seems, apart from me, the whole class consists of cowards.\" But Lin Li was very pleased with this result.\nNo, someone is hiding their talents and achievements!\nLin Li’s sharp eyes immediately noticed another warrior. He saw a Pingjiang Warrior Medal tucked into the side of Wang Yuezhi’s backpack!\n\"So you’re a warrior too, Wang Yuezhi.\" Given that it wasn’t noon, Lin Li’s tone was relatively calm, \"In the world, the only heroes are you and me.\"\nWang Yuezhi gave Lin Li a bored look and continued gazing sadly at the seatback in front of him.\n\"Yuezhi rode the giant pendulum seven times this afternoon; he’s really brave.\" Zhuo Yongfei, sitting next to Wang Yuezhi, supplemented upon hearing this.\nWhat, seven times in a single afternoon? Considering the waiting time, wasn’t he just riding it the entire time? This is truly a master.\nNow, if Lin Li were asked to ride the giant pendulum again, he wouldn’t dare.\nThe shadow of the bubble gum was not only Wang Ziyan’s but also Lin Li’s.\n\"I guess I’m still too blind to others’ talents. I’ve learned my lesson, Wang Yuezhi.\" Always someone better, there’s always a higher sky, Lin Li returned to his humble nature and went back to his seat.\nWang Yuezhi simply closed his eyes in pain.\n\"Wang Yuezhi.\"\nIt wasn’t long before someone called Wang Yuezhi’s name again.\nBut Wang Yuezhi immediately opened his eyes in disbelief and confirmed with the person next to him.\nThe person calling his name was actually Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Wh-what’s up, class monitor?\" Wang Yuezhi suppressed his excitement and said.\n\"Is this clown nose yours? It fell next to your seat.\" Chen Yu Ying bent down, picked up the little red ball from the ground, and curiously asked Wang Yuezhi.\nWang Yuezhi: \"...\"\nA second chance.\nBut the person in front of him was Chen Yu Ying, not some unfamiliar girl.\nHe still wanted to chat with Chen Yu Ying.\nTherefore, Wang Yuezhi couldn’t swear and instead showed a smile more miserable than crying, nodding bitterly: \"Yes, class monitor, it’s mine!\"\n\"Oh, here you go. What a cute little nose.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, pinched the clown nose, and handed it to Wang Yuezhi.\n\"Thank you, Chen Yu Ying.\" Wang Yuezhi smiled and took the nose, saying.\n\"You’re welcome~\" Chen Yu Ying waved her hand and walked to the back of the bus with Ding Sihan.\nZhuo Yongfei looked at Wang Yuezhi beside him.\nHe saw him lower his head, staring at the clown nose in his hand, not knowing what he was thinking. Yet, he pulled up the corners of his mouth and even let out a low laugh.\nZhuo Yongfei swallowed a mouthful, a little scared.\nThen Wang Yuezhi slowly raised his hand, finally placing the little red ball on his nose, smirking foolishly. Then he turned his head to Zhuo Yongfei, pointed to his face or his nose, and asked expectantly:\n\"Yongfei, does this look really... cute?\"\nZhuo Yongfei: \"?\"\nDamn.\nNot my buddy.\nDamn.\nDamn, damn, damn.\n\"It’s pretty... fitting.\"\nFaced with a choice between yes or no, Zhuo Yongfei chose or.\nWhether or not it was cute was not up for comment, but at least it was appropriate, ensuring his words were at least sincere.\nZhuo Yongfei genuinely believed that once Wang Yuezhi fully digested the Seer potion, he’d be prepared to advance straight to Magician.\n\"You think so, too? That’s great.\" Upon hearing this, Wang Yuezhi nodded even more happily, then cautiously removed the nose, brushing off the nonexistent dust, and carefully placed it into his backpack.\nWatching this scene, Zhuo Yongfei maintained an awkward but polite smile.\nSo the two were both smiling.",

      "content": "Chapter 133: Chapter 121: Dare Not Open My Eyes, Hoping It’s My Illusion~\nOnce everyone was gathered, the bus slowly started moving, but instead of heading to the base, it went towards the restaurant where they’d eat today.\nFirst, Lin Li shared the perfect success of the day with Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei in the back, and after showing off his warrior medal, he settled into his seat.\nTurning his head, he found Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan had become members of the \"bowed head tribe,\" engrossed in their phones.\nLin Li looked carefully and noticed both of them were flipping through their photo albums, deleting most of the similar photos and keeping the one they liked best.\nNoticing Lin Li’s gaze, Chen Yu Ying spoke up, \"Lin Li, there are photos with you in them, do you need them?\"\n\"Sure, I could use them.\" Lin Li thought for a moment and nodded.\n\"Then I’ll start a group chat for the four of us, so the photos can be sent there. This way, they won’t get mixed up with the photos Xiao Yu and the others took in the dorm chat.\"\nChen Yu Ying nodded, and then set up a group chat on WeChat for the four of them, sending a \"1.\"\n\"Lin Li: 2\"\nChen Yu Ying turned helplessly and amusedly glanced at Lin Li.\n\"Ding Sihan: sb\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu: sb\"\n\"Lin Li: ?\"\n\"Ding Sihan: sb\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu: sb\"\nAll he did was send a 2 and a question mark, yet there was so much hostility. Frustrated, shivering, and cold, Lin Li wondered why the world was being so cruel to him.\nNo more playing abstract games; no one understands his humor, and they really think he’s stupid.\nBefore Lin Li could retaliate, the group chat got flooded with one picture after another.\n\"Today’s data usage has exceeded the set limit, your data service has been automatically shut down.\"\nThis notification made Lin Li cringe.\nHe reactivated his mobile data. Lin Li had a student plan with a 38-month rental allowing 40G of data, which was more than enough since he had Wi-Fi at home and rarely used his phone. Every month, he couldn’t even use up the carry-over data from the previous month.\nThe daily limit of 3G was automatically set on his phone, and he had never bothered to switch it off.\nLin Li also sent some of the photos he’d taken to the group chat.\n\"What are you guys up to now?\" Seeing Chen Yu Ying still fiddling with her photo album, Lin Li leaned over curiously.\n\"Photo editing,\" Chen Yu Ying had pulled out her tablet, deftly using her fingers to manipulate the screen.\nLin Li nodded in understanding.\nHe didn’t say anything about just posting the original photos, since girls always feel they can be even more perfect. He just mentioned, \"Then make sure to edit mine nicely too.\"\nLin Li then squinted in curiosity, \"Class rep, what are you editing now?\"\nSince Chen Yu Ying was using a tablet, Lin Li could clearly see the content on the screen; none of the faces belonged to any of the four of them.\n\"I’m editing out the passersby and trying to make the sunlight a bit warmer,\" Chen Yu Ying explained with focused attention, looking up as she spoke.\n\"You can make sunlight warmer through editing?\" Lin Li almost couldn’t understand the language.\n\"Yes, it’s simple. You just need to apply a shadow here, increase the intensity on this part, add some special light effects, and blur the texture a bit. See?\" Chen Yu Ying taught him as she demonstrated.\nWhen Chen Yu Ying showed the before and after comparison, Lin Li’s eyes widened in surprise.\nThe sunlight indeed became warmer.\n\"No wonder it’s one of Asia’s four great sorceries; truly magical!\" Lin Li marveled with genuine admiration.\nLet’s reinforce the knowledge: the four great sorceries: Thailand’s gender transformation, Korea’s plastic surgery, China’s Photoshop, Japan’s makeup.\nSeeing Lin Li’s eagerness to learn, Chen Yu Ying beamed, speaking softly, \"It’s actually quite simple. The software now is getting more sophisticated, easy to learn and use...\"\nThen, Chen Yu Ying launched into a whole lecture on photo editing knowledge.\nAt that moment, Lin Li felt like his head was about to overflow with all the information.\n\"I’ve grasped it, class rep. I’ll start practicing right away.\" With useful new knowledge gained, Lin Li decided to apply it immediately.\n\"Okay, I’m really looking forward to it.\" Chen Yu Ying smiled and nodded.\nSo, all three of them in the row focused intently on editing their photos.\nOne by one, the meticulously edited photos were sent to the group chat, and from time to time, someone would @ the others in the photos, asking if the edited versions could be posted on social media.\nFinally, Lin Li let out a long breath.\nHe had finally completed his creation, so Lin Li followed suit.\n\"Lin Li: \\\"Image\\\". @Ding Sihan, is it okay if I post it in my Moments?\"\nStill editing photos, Ding Sihan looked at Lin Li with a puzzled expression before opening the picture.\nIt was supposed to be a group photo of four people taken by a passerby, with the Ferris wheel at Pingjiang Amusement Park in the background.\nIt was supposed to be like that.\nDing Sihan took a deep breath.\nIn the picture, she saw a Ferris wheel growing out of her neck, and her head had become the background Ferris wheel, yes, with quite a radiant smile.\nA circle of small heads sprouted beside her big head, making it look more like a human-brain Ferris wheel.\nSo this is the editing style, huh.\n\"Does anyone have a knife? I’ve got something urgent.\" Ding Sihan leaned towards the aisle, looking expectantly at each classmate.\nUnfortunately, it seemed no one had a knife.\nBut that’s okay, you can kill without a knife.\n\"Calm down! Let’s talk it out, no fighting! No fighting! If you lose, you end up in the hospital; if you win, you end up in jail!\" Seeing Ding Sihan suddenly on the verge of exploding, Lin Li, feeling pitiful, weak, and helpless, pressed tightly against the window, holding onto Chen Yu Ying’s shoulders to make her his shield.\nChen Yu Ying, who was being swayed back and forth, helplessly hugged her tablet, then glanced at the picture Lin Li posted on it and chuckled secretly.\n\"Lin Li! I’m going to kill you! Why do you always target me! If you dare to post this photo on your Moments, you’re dead meat!\" Ding Sihan, holding a pen, was ready to stab the little villain Lin Li.\nBut Lin Li had something to say.\n\"Wait a minute! There’s a misunderstanding!\" Lin Li made a pause gesture, then released Chen Yu Ying’s shoulder and took out his phone.\nDing Sihan didn’t sit down; she wanted to see what other excuse Lin Li could come up with.\n\"Lin Li: ’Picture’, ’Picture’, ’Picture’.\"\n\"Ding Sihan, look at the group. I edited everyone, including myself.\" Lin Li looked at Ding Sihan sincerely and gave a thumbs up, \"So don’t worry, I wasn’t targeting you.\"\nDing Sihan looked at her phone.\nThe four heads took turns being Ferris wheels, including Lin Li himself.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nIs this supposed to be reassuring?\nBut,\nYou know what, it actually balanced things for Ding Sihan.\nUnfortunately, someone else was unbalanced.\n\"Lin Li!\" From the front of the front of the front row, someone suddenly called out his name through gritted teeth. No one knew who it was.\nChen Yu Ying, who was just secretly laughing, stopped giggling immediately and, realizing she was also involved, turned her head to glare angrily at Lin Li.\nShe started to regret teaching Lin Li how to edit photos.\nWho knew what boys would do with photo editing skills!\n\"Looks like everyone is dissatisfied with these pictures, so I can only try harder. I have a lot more ideas!\" Lin Li sighed but then perked up again.\nLin Li clicked into the group chat, ready to select some more pictures to work on.\n\"You have been removed from this group chat.\"\n\"You cannot send messages in a group chat you’ve left.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Class president! That damned Ding Sihan actually stole your phone and kicked me out! Pull me back!\" Lin Li turned to complain.\n\"I kicked you out myself.\" Chen Yu Ying was still angry.\n\"Oh.\" Lin Li nodded, thought for a moment, and continued to complain: \"Class president! That damned Ding Sihan actually bewitched you to kick me out! Wake up!\"\n\"No matter what, I’m the one to blame, right! Ying Bao, kicking him out was the smartest decision you’ve made recently!\" gritted Ding Sihan from the side.\n...\nLin Li eventually managed to rejoin the group.\nThe price was sealing his talent in photo editing, preventing him from becoming the GOAT of the editing world and banning those human Ferris wheel photos from any public venues.\nLin Li, who hardly posts Moments, could only accept this unequal treaty.\nLin Li drew a conclusion from this incident.\nFirstly, the world is always too envious of talented people; secondly, the weak have no diplomacy, so it’s better to form your own group.\nThe pictures of Chen Yu Ying and the others weren’t fully edited when the bus already arrived at the restaurant for dinner.\nEveryone got off the bus and headed to the restaurant.\nGuided by a waiter to one of the halls on the first floor, the seats were already arranged, and plates of cold dishes covered with cling film were on the table.\nHowever, there weren’t many, and the assortment of cold dishes was quite limited.\nAs the saying goes, with a budget of 340 bucks for two days and two nights, even boxed meals would be normal, so Lin Li thought having such a meal was a big win.\nIt’s not like Lin Li would sit with Chen Yu Ying and her group, adding a guy would just make the girls uneasy, so no hard-to-eat and image-damaging things like crabs would be eaten.\n— Though, there were no crabs in tonight’s meal anyway.\n\"Xue Jian will also join us later, and he’ll surely sit with the guys, hurry up, let’s find a table and occupy all the seats, leaving the hassle to others.\"\nThere were places where Lin Li’s brain turned especially fast, and he immediately spotted the potential danger at this dinner, and sternly told Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan widened his eyes upon hearing that.\nIt makes sense!\nAfter giving a thumbs up, he immediately called people over to find a spot inside the hall and sat down.\nOK, the table was now full.\nXue Jian negotiated with the restaurant staff for a while, then they started serving the dishes.\nJust as Lin Li had expected, Xue Jian indeed was going to eat here.\nXue Jian went to another table with the guys and found a vacant seat.\nLin Li crossed his hands under his nose and tossled his head handsomely.\nAnd the buddies nearby all gave a thumbs up and exchanged smiles.\nLin Li maintained his cool until he saw Xue Jian carrying his chair towards them.\n\"Bufan, Lin Li, shift over a bit, give the teacher a seat.\"\nLin Li dared not open his eyes, hoping it was a hallucination.\nHe finally understood why Ding Sihan was so angry on the bus.\nTurns out being targeted doesn’t feel good at all...\nor2",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Chapter 122: Adaxi, you know the methods of Lin Li\nIf you can’t fit into a circle, don’t force it.\nOf course, if you have to squeeze yourself in, well, tough luck; even a garlic clove can blend into an orange.\nXue Jian is like a great chasm, keeping Lin Li and Bai Bufan separated as if by life and death, making father and son part ways.\nAs to who is the father and who is the son, each has their own answer in mind.\n\"Teacher, why don’t you sit in my seat? Just now Yongfei needed to talk to me about something, so I’ll go chat with him,\" Zhou Baowei said, standing up.\nEveryone at the table widened their eyes.\nThis guy’s about to abandon them to survive on his own!\nAfter the surprise came regret, why didn’t they think of it themselves? Alas, there’s room for only one crab-eater.\nNow that Xue Jian is right there, all they can do is clench their fists to express their anger, not daring to say a word to stop him.\nBut this time, they really misunderstood Zhou Baowei.\nHe simply feared that with Xue Jian joining their table, there wouldn’t be enough food.\nCalculating it out, the students at the next table seem to have smaller appetites, and fewer people means more food to eat!\nThis is purely the cunning of a foodie.\n\"Alright, everyone, let’s start eating,\" Xue Jian accepted Bao Wei’s suggestion, sat down, and glanced over the most dangerous students at the table, nodding in satisfaction.\nHe felt reassured gazing at this group.\nThus.\nAlthough they occupy the same space, the joys and sorrows of people do not connect.\n\"Damn, today was... so damn fun...\"\n\"Awesome, by the way, XXX, fill up your dad’s drink...\"\n\"What are your plans for tonight?\"\n\"Whatever.\"\nThese were the conversations from the other tables, and Lin Li just found them noisy.\nOld Kong had said, speaking during meals is impolite, and this group of people had no manners.\nUnlike his table, which was quite quiet, the occasional conversations were quite refined:\n\"Bufan, could you pass me the napkins, please?\"\n\"Of course, I’d be delighted.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"No problem, it’s my pleasure.\"\nJust look at how Xue Jian has driven everyone to this point.\nThose words they’re speaking, are they even human?\nIt can only be said that Xue Jian, this stern, middle-aged Old Deng, exerts too much pressure; only Lin Li, who was used to being scolded, had brushed off most of his fear.\nThe atmosphere at the table was increasingly unbearable for Lin Li, so his face turned cold as he decided to take revenge on Xue Jian.\nBeing a Cultivator, Lin Li had plenty of tactics up his sleeve.\n...\nXue Jian’s chopsticks were suspended in mid-air before retracting.\nWas it his imagination?\nWhy was it that every time he wanted to pick up a dish, someone would turn the table?\n...\n\"When the leader picks up a dish, I turn the table; when the leader opens the door, I get in the car; when the leader toasts, I don’t drink; when the leader walks, I sit in a car.\"\n\"When the leader talks, I chat; when the leader’s lover appears, I fool around; when the leader drinks water, I brake; when the leader grabs the mic, I change the song.\"\nHumming the Song of Promotion Skills, Lin Li was in a good mood, priding himself as a promotion master, holding the most powerful tool for climbing up the ladder.\nLin Li’s methods were indeed effective, and they would have been more so if Bai Bufan hadn’t carelessly said, ’Lin Li, why are you so sneakily turning the table?’ and if Xue Jian hadn’t overheard it.\nAn act of punishment is akin to love, and scolding is a form of affection.\nXue Jian’s love ran deep, and Lin Li later repaid Bai Bufan with a round of affectionate revenge.\nLin Li stood at the entrance of the restaurant, leaning against the wall, observing the passersby.\nHe ate rather quickly, and since dining with Xue Jian wasn’t comfortable, he finished quickly and came out first. Most people were still dining leisurely.\nThe evening plan was to head to a bustling commercial area in Pingjiang City for everyone to roam around freely.\nThough not out of the province, it was still a seven or eight-hour round trip tour, and surely some would want to buy something.\nMoreover, checking out the commercial areas in the big city was rather nice.\nThese are things one wouldn’t see in Xiling Town.\n\"Class president, why are you getting off the bus now?\" Lin Li curiously asked upon noticing Chen Yu Ying alighting the bus.\n\"Forgot my lip gloss; I need to reapply after eating,\" Chen Yu Ying explained, waving the lip gloss in her hand.\n\"I see—\" Lin Li started to continue the chat but suddenly, his expression changed, turning serious in an instant.\nEmergency situation! Critical event! Must act quickly!\nHe picked up his phone and started typing furiously; if Bai Bufan didn’t reply within three seconds, Lin Li would call.\nFortunately, Bai Bufan promptly replied with a ’1.’\nLin Li resumed his concentration, poised to prevent any unexpected incidents.\n\"What happened?\" Chen Yu Ying asked, puzzled and somewhat tense.\n\"Look over there, class president,\" Lin Li prompted.\nChen Yu Ying glanced over, but there seemed to be nothing noteworthy.\nBy this point, hurried footsteps approached behind them.\nLin Li turned around, noticing most from his table were rushing out, and upon seeing Lin Li, Bai Bufan urgently whispered, \"Where?!\"\n\"Ten o’clock direction, pretend to chat, don’t overdo it!\"\n\"The sun is really nice tonight.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, the sunset looks great too.\"\nThe target of Lin Li and his friends’ surveillance noticed the sudden crowd of students at the restaurant entrance but didn’t think much of it, continuing to walk forward after a glance.\nAnd as she passed the restaurant entrance, turning her back to everyone.\nEveryone stood straighter than during military training, standing at attention and turning right, beginning a silent salute.\nNobody even blinked until the target turned the corner and completely disappeared from sight.\n\"Salute over.\"\nAfter Lin Li gave the command, everyone relaxed their posture slightly and expressed their admiration:\n\"What legs, could admire for years.\"\n\"Indeed, want to lick them.\"\n\"Worth the trip.\"\n\"The big city lives up to its name; those legs are truly city-level.\"\n\"Today’s grudge of you hitting me is forgotten,\" Bai Bufan rubbed his dry eyes, happily patting Lin Li on the shoulder.\nLin Li had just sent Bai Bufan a six-character message without punctuation — \"Legs at the door, come quick.\"\nAs for why the whole group came, that’s how it is among buddies; news spreads quickly.\n\"I haven’t finished eating, going back to continue. Lin Li, you keep watch, let us know if anything happens,\" Wang Ze said, oil stains still on the corner of his mouth, as he turned to walk back to the restaurant.\n\"No problem, it’s my duty,\" Lin Li nodded.\nAmong brothers, good things are shared.\n\"What are you guys doing?\"\nAt this moment, Xue Jian walked to the door, finally arriving late, with a wary expression.\nJust when I looked down to take a bite, half the table disappeared, almost giving me a fright.\n\"Admiring the beautiful scenery of the big city of Pingjiang,\" Lin Li explained.\n\"Exactly, exactly,\" everyone nodded.\nXue Jian frowned with confusion. This is just the doorway of a restaurant; all you can see are other shops, what scenery is there to watch?\nLuckily, the most trustworthy Chen Yu Ying was here as well.\n\"Yu Ying, what were they doing just now?\" Xue Jian asked.\nUnder Lin Li’s signaling glance, Chen Yu Ying nodded with pursed lips: \"They were really watching the scenery.\"\nXue Jian had no choice but to believe it.\nAfter everyone dispersed, Lin Li alone faced Chen Yu Ying’s disdainful gaze.\n\"You boys really...\" Chen Yu Ying didn’t know how to evaluate them for a moment.\n\"It’s not lustful; it’s just that I came when the flowers were in full bloom. Not appreciating it would make me seem insensitive,\" Lin Li explained earnestly, while eyeing Chen Yu Ying’s legs.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nSo now, are you also being sensitive?\nAs they were going to the amusement park today, for convenience and looks, the girl wore loose straight jeans, hiding her beautiful leg curves, making Lin Li feel a bit regretful, while Chen Yu Ying was relieved to have dodged a bullet.\nIf she had worn high heels and a short skirt like the woman who just passed by, the class president would definitely look even better.\n\"Class president, regarding legs, I have a few...\" Lin Li thought and decided to share his insight.\n\"Pervert!\"\nChen Yu Ying blushed and scolded softly, then ran back with her lip gloss before Lin Li could ask for a rename.\nThe class president abandoned a road to greatness.\nNo worries, I’ll persuade her more in the future; there’s still a chance.\nWith only himself left at the doorway, Lin Li continued to efficiently use his eyes that were adept at finding beauty in life.\n[Task Two is now complete.]\n[You have received a reward: Title: Light of Xiling; Random Ability*1; Low Grade Spirit Stone*5; System Currency*200.]\nLin Li, who had been lazily watching the people on the road, became serious again upon seeing the message suddenly pop up before him.\nHis task two was to assist the Demon Suppression Bureau in clearing out three chicken farms.\nWithout the prerequisite of entering the situation himself, obtaining and providing accurate chicken farm information to the Demon Suppression Bureau also counted as deep cooperation, and now that the task is complete, it means the Xiling Demon Suppression Bureau has successfully initiated and carried out another demon elimination operation.\n...\nXiling Three Bridges.\n\"Finally, finished another file. How are those three places on your end?\" It was five o’clock on Friday, but visibly, it would be impossible to get off work before ten. After sorting the documents, Yangliang stood up, rubbed his waist, and paced back and forth in the office, asking colleagues around his workstation.\n\"There’s still a ton to review and question. Too many arrested,\" the colleague sighed and then noticed Yangliang’s phone lighting up, reminding, \"Yangliang, someone sent you a message.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"The note says Lin Li, parenthesis poor kid, parenthesis bad company. It says, Uncle, hard work,\" the colleague glanced and read aloud.\nYangliang: \"?\"\nIt’s over, it’s over, it’s all over.\nYangliang had a bad feeling that he might have to sleep over at the office today.\n...\n\"Yangliang: ?\"\n\"Yangliang: Xiaolin, didn’t you go to the Pingjiang City District? You didn’t make new friends again, did you?\"\n\"Yangliang: I can’t help with that area, I don’t even know anyone there, this time Uncle can’t help you.\"\nYangliang replied quickly this time and seemed to have developed Lin Li PTSD.\nProbably should be considered an occupational injury.\n\"Lin Li: No, no, no, I’m being very well-behaved in Pingjiang. Just found that the Xiling chicken farm map from last time was incomplete when sorting through phone files earlier, missed two; here’s a supplement. [File].\"\nThis was last time’s backup intelligence for just-in-case scenarios.\nNow that the task is complete, it’s no longer needed and can be provided to the Demon Suppression Bureau.\nIt took a long time to receive a reply this time.\n\"Yangliang: Thank you.\"\nAnd then after a very long time.\n\"Yangliang: Any new ones, why not send them all at once?\"\nAnd then after a very, very long time.\n\"Yangliang: Really, really, really no more? Uncle’s heart isn’t very good; sometimes he can’t handle the shock.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Chapter 123: Damn it! Don’t taint the purity of money with dirty brotherly feelings!\nThis is something I should do.\nAfter finishing the conversation with Yangliang, Lin Li started checking the rewards for completing the task.\n[You have acquired an active ability: Healing.]\n[Healing: Upon activation, your hand will gain healing abilities for one minute. It will heal injuries to a certain extent within ten seconds, based on your current power and skills, limited to one area at a time. You cannot heal the same injury multiple times during a single use.\nThis ability enters a 24-hour cooldown after use.]\nHealing ability, huh? It seems quite impressive.\nIn modern conditions, it’s definitely much better than the Wall of the Soul.\nLin Li rolled up his pant leg, and the knee and surrounding area showed several new or old bruises.\nIf asked how he got these injuries, Lin Li himself wouldn’t know.\nA taller person sometimes leaves a bruise just by bouncing their leg in the classroom.\nThis is not an accumulative ability; it shows that I can use it right now, so Lin Li decided to experiment immediately.\nHe took a photo of the original injury, then used [Charge] and placed his right hand over the knee bruise to use [Healing].\nNo abnormality appeared on the hand, not even a green glow, but a cool and refreshing sensation spread through his knee.\nThe ten-second duration passed quickly, and Lin Li immediately removed his hand to continue healing another area, comparing with the photo on his left hand mobile.\nThe bruise faded quite a bit, but that was all; it didn’t even disappear.\nAnd this was using [Charge], resulting in double the healing effect.\nLin Li wasn’t surprised or disappointed with this result, as the ability description stated that the healing result depends on individual power and ability.\nLin Li even considered the worst-case scenario—that his power and ability wouldn’t achieve any healing at all.\nNow that actual healing occurred, Lin Li was quite pleased.\nThe minute quickly elapsed, and after moving his right hand to various ’positions,’ both of Lin Li’s knees were significantly better off than before; areas that were already starting to clear up completely restored to their original skin color.\nIf only it were possible to heal one spot six times in one minute, that would be better.\nHe finished testing the ability and looked at the additional title he acquired.\n[Light of Xiling: When equipped, you will emit an aura of righteousness, enhancing cultivation speed by 50% when practicing proper techniques, reducing speed by 50% when practicing improper techniques, and inspiring subconscious fear in evil beings.]\nEquipping it didn’t produce any immediate feeling, as its effects are only visible during practice.\nHis Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique and Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique should both count as proper cultivation techniques, right?\nIf the cultivation speed can be increased by 50%, it would still be very useful.\nWait, it’s not without changes.\nLin Li squinted.\nHe walked to the corner of the restaurant entrance.\n\"Damn!\"\n\"The light of righteousness should be a concept term, not actual light!\"\nLin Li found that after equipping this title, his whole body was emitting righteous light—physically speaking.\nLike he’s drunk too much nuclear waste water.\nNow it’s clear, the debuff of this title isn’t that cultivation speed for improper techniques decreases by 50%, but instead, the body emits light while worn.\nBut thankfully, the light is quite faint, like a glow stick used for a while, and in anything other than a pitch-black environment, the naked eye can’t immediately discern it.\nLin Li confirmed this only when he reached the corner; in daylight, it would be even less noticeable.\nFor safety reasons, Lin Li still switched the title to [Blood Crow Assassin]—there were mosquitoes outside the restaurant.\nGot seven Spirit Stones in the pocket, the wealthiest he’s ever been.\nAfter the autumn trip, he can afford to be a bit ’extravagant.’\n[System Currency: 950 (1050)]\nAfter the 200 system currency reward for this task arrived, the accumulated system currency Lin Li received exceeded a thousand.\n[Shop] unlocked a new product slot.\nHe clicked open the shop.\n[Random Quality Spirit Stone: 20 system currency (Limited to 1 per day) (Sold Out Today)]\n[Breakthrough Talisman: 50 system currency (Limited to 1 per day)]\n[Unlock Refreshable Product Slot 3 requires 1500 accumulated system currency (1050/1500)]\n[Unlock Refreshable Product Slot 4 requires 2100 accumulated system currency (1050/2100)]\n\"Breakthrough Talisman?\"\nLin Li checked the product description.\n[Breakthrough Talisman: Use by blood drop and attachment to the body, it breaks physical limitations in all aspects and performances far beyond normal within ten minutes, followed by ten to twenty minutes of extreme fatigue.\nThis talisman cannot be used simultaneously with another; using it within a three-day interval may cause additional damage and burden to the body.]\nJust as the name suggests, upon use, the talisman allows breakthroughs beyond the physical limits in all aspects.\nIn the short term, it seems there isn’t any need for such a thing, using it to boost potential during exams? That would be too wasteful.\nNonetheless, Lin Li purchased one.\nHe manifested it—a brown talisman paper with incomprehensible markings, overall smaller than a palm.\nBuy two or three to keep as spares; those damn limited supply words always have their charm.\nHowever, what left Lin Li a bit disappointed was that, like slot 1, the [Free Refresh] button for slot 2 was also dimmed.\nAre the free refresh chances from the system update shared among all slots?\nThat’s just too stingy.\nSpending 100 system currency to refresh once, Lin Li really couldn’t bring himself to do it.\nLet’s wait until Monday and see, Lin Li thought that his system might update on Monday again.\nAfter settling the rewards, Lin Li continued to look around, squinting his eyes, and sent a message to Bai Bufan again.\n\"We’ve got milk, come quick!\"\n\"Where, where, where?\" Bai Bufan and the gang quickly rushed over.\n\"Over there.\"\nBai Bufan squinted his eyes, then rubbed them, and finally widened them, staring straight at Lin Li: \"This milk... is it the grandma’s milk?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nSo everyone stared at Lin Li.\n\"You’re really spending our trust like this, Lin Li, haven’t you heard the story of the boy who cried wolf?\" Wang Ze questioned.\n\"Let’s go, that grandma has too many things, she’s been standing there for a long time without crossing the street, let’s go help.\" Lin Li chose to ignore it and walked over first, \"We should do more good deeds, that way we can tell more hell jokes.\"\nBai Bufan and the others gave Lin Li’s back the finger, then followed.\n\"Oh, right, Bai Bufan, don’t start with old stuff in zero frames again later...\"\n\"Let bygones be bygones!\"\nWithout the always-late Xue Jian this time, when they reached the restaurant entrance, he unexpectedly saw his students helping the elderly.\nTears welled up and he heaved a sigh of relief.\nAfter all, when he saw the old lady put her hand on Lin Li’s hand, Xue Jian instinctively thought Lin Li’s next move would be to flip onto the old lady.\nGuess he had too many stereotypes.\n...\nAfter dinner, the bus dropped everyone off at the downtown area of Pingjiang City.\n\"Next is your free activity time, you have about two hours, we’ll meet back here at nine-thirty to return to the hotel. You can shop here, stroll around, whatever you want.\nBut no one is allowed to act alone, you must pair up, if your phone runs out of battery, the teacher has a power bank, you can borrow it to charge.\"\nUpon reaching their destination, Xue Jian emphasized to everyone.\n\"Sigh, I can only hang out with you two again, how unlucky.\" After getting off the bus, Lin Li looked at Zhou Baowei and Bai Bufan beside him and sighed deeply.\n\"You can’t even keep that to yourself, huh?\" Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei rolled their eyes, \"You go ahead, go find the class monitor, the two of us can get along just fine without you.\"\n\"Just kidding. Brothers are always my priority.\" Lin Li said sincerely.\nChen Yu Ying and her dorm planned to go shopping in Pingjiang with all six of them, Lin Li naturally would not join.\nIt would be awkward and he might accidentally become the bag holder.\nHad to reluctantly stick with Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei.\nBai Bufan chuckled after hearing that: \"Alright, Lin Li, let me ask you, suppose you just won two million in the lottery, but your good brother Zhou Baowei needs a hundred thousand for treatment because of a serious illness... Actually, a hundred thousand is too easy, let’s make it needing a hundred for treatment, what would you have left?\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nLin Li chuckled too, and retorted to Bai Bufan: \"Before I answer, tell me your answer.\"\n\"I’d have one million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and fifty left, and a lavish funeral costing fifty.\" Bai Bufan scratched his head.\n\"You’d rather spend fifty on my funeral than spend a hundred on my treatment, right! Bai Bufan!\" Zhou Baowei’s fists clenched.\n\"Fifty is really the limit, bro, I just can’t spare more.\" Bai Bufan expressed his helplessness.\n\"Change it back to needing a hundred thousand, give me some face.\" Zhou Baowei sighed deeply.\n\"Alright, so Baowei has a little illness costing a hundred thousand, now Lin Li! Tell me your answer.\" Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li.\nBut actually, Bai Bufan already knew the answer in his heart, who would hesitate at that?\nA true brother shouldn’t fall ill at times like these.\nGetting sick at such a time without discussing it with anyone, not considering others, how can they even call themselves a brother?\n\"Let me calculate.\" Lin Li started fiddling with his fingers.\n\"You need to calculate this?\" Bai Bufan was a bit puzzled.\n\"Probably about four million left and a corpse without organs that had a ghost marriage for good luck, you remember to lend me the fifty-buck coffin you bought, so I don’t need to buy one.\" Lin Li calculated and came to a conclusion, \"So, more or less this number.\"\nBai Bufan’s face froze, his opened mouth couldn’t closed.\nSorry.\nHe shouldn’t have assumed he knew what Lin Li’s answer would be.\nHe was ridiculously off.\nSatan should really tattoo Lin Li on his back.\n\"You’re really getting all the use out of me, huh! Even squeezing out every bit of value left in my body, a ghost marriage, you can even think of making money from that! Are you still human?\" The involved Zhou Baowei grabbed Lin Li’s collar and started shaking him crazily.\nThe two of them got into a playful scuffle, becoming life-and-death buddies — trying to slit each other’s throat.\n\"Damn, just lost two million.\" On the side, Bai Bufan watched, patting his leg in frustration.",

How come holding onto that guy makes him look handsome,\" Bai Bufan pointed at a little couple not far away, commenting softly seeing the woman was middle-aged but her boyfriend young and handsome.\n\"The language of steel wool is patience and wealth,\" Zhou Baowei sighed after taking a glance.\n\"Anyway, I wouldn’t humble myself like that for money,\" Bai Bufan smirked, \"not even for two million.\"\n\"What if the sugar mama tops up your Genshin monthly card every month?\" Lin Li added.\n\"Reject the infantilization aesthetic, starting with you and me. You don’t understand my old baby charm,\" Bai Bufan said, immediately serious and sincere, \"If it were for a Genshin month card, I’d do anything.\"\nPrimos are worth dollars; Bai Bufan’s logic is understandable.\nThe three of them continued to conjecture pessimistically and mock random people on the street without much maturity.\nAfter entering the comprehensive shopping center, they started searching for interesting stores to browse.\n\"A big city is a big city; the prices are big city-sized too.\" The three came out of a gift shop empty-handed.\nThe prices were all over budget.\nFeels like Pinduoduo would’ve been better.\n\"Let’s just say I want to spend money on sharp edges, only to find life is full of them,\" Lin Li sighed as well.\nAs a cultivator, still constrained by worldly gold and silver, it’s really pitiful.\nThe sensible system should be rewarding me with gold coins right now.\nBut the system isn’t considerate yet.\n\"Does the big city have coke blind boxes now? This I can afford,\" Bai Bufan stopped when they passed a vending machine.\nA machine displayed no drinks, only question marks. For three bucks, one could purchase once, getting a random Coke product. In an era where 500ml already sells for four bucks, it seemed cost-effective, though the machine noted that the drinks were nearing expiration but never expired.\nA Coke fanatic, Bai Bufan excitedly went up to scan the code.\nA Pepsi fan, Zhou Baowei, held his nose as if seeing a portable potty.\nThey often attacked each other on this point, with one saying Pepsi was toilet cleaner and the other saying Coke was fermented urine.\nAs for whether Lin Li was a Coke or Pepsi fan, it depended on who between Bufan and Bao Wei had a Coke closer to him.\n\"Lin Li, are you drinking?\" Bai Bufan turned his head to inquire while scanning the code.\nLin Li nodded: \"Sure.\"\n\"What’s Pepsi?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"Toilet cleaner!\"\nFolks, Lin Li is a Coke fan.\n\"Good, then I’ll buy two bottles.\" Bai Bufan was quite pleased.\nWith a thump, two chilled drinks fell out.\nBai Bufan giggled as he picked them out.\nPure Joy.\nSuggested retail price two bucks.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nHe squinted at the machine, so it’s a product of the Coca-Cola Company, not a Coca-Cola product?\nNo matter, small loss isn’t really a loss, there’s one more bottle.\nIce Dew.\nSuggested retail price one buck, Bottle Cap Cannon King.\n\"Bao Wei, you’re right, Coke is fermented urine,\" Bai Bufan picked up the drinks, handing Ice Dew to Lin Li while expressionlessly addressing Zhou Baowei.\nThe century-old truce between Coke and Pepsi fandom owes much to the blind box machine.\n\"Let’s go, there’s a Lego flagship store over there, let’s have a look for some eye candy.\" After buying drinks, the three kept strolling through the shopping center.\n[The Pingjiang Secret Realm is broken, and at a time of assimilating gains and losses, unexpectedly encounters a reclusive master of the thunder path incarnate in the mundane world to preach and impart knowledge.\nHaving acquired this opportunity, why not go forth immediately and receive it?]\n[Limited-time mission triggered!]\n[Mission Two: Within one hour, engage in a friendly spar with the thunder path master nearby, demonstrating your resilience and indomitable spirit, never conceding defeat, and bravely passing their trial.]\n[Mission Reward: Physical Improvement: Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body effect increased by 100%; System Currency*50.]\n\"Hold on a moment.\"\nLeisurely walking down the street, Lin Li suddenly stopped in his tracks and called out to Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei.\n\"What’s wrong?\" The two turned around upon hearing, asking with some confusion.\nThunder Master, who?\nHasn’t Brother Xin already gone in?\nLin Li turned his head, looking at the spot where he had just triggered the task.\nIt was a maternity store.\nBut Lin Li’s eyes were fixed on the ad board at the entrance.\n\"Now offering labor pain experience! Just collect 18 likes to experience it for free! Complete experience also comes with coupons and physical rewards!\"\nThrough the transparent glass behind the ad board, a middle-aged man could be seen sitting next to a labor pain experience machine at this moment, quietly waiting for fate to bring someone.\nᓖ뮤.\nYou damn well call this a practice of Thunder technique.\nThough the experience does use electricity for simulation.\nBut isn’t it just me getting shocked?\nHowever, labor pain, even though Lin Li had never experienced it, he had heard that it ranks at level ten in terms of pain scale, knowing that severe fracture or major burns only count as level nine!\nAm I to heroically pass the trial?\nWill I win? It’s a death guarantee.\nApologies, for not letting the labor pain experience machine gentleman unleash its full power.\nBut the rewards were nice, and the improvement of the Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body effect brought visible changes in the Thunder technique, which is my only means to become immortal presently.\nMoreover, since the task is here, not trying it out is impossible for Lin Li.\n\"Why aren’t you talking?\" Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei came up beside Lin Li, scrutinizing the ad board with him.\nThe Thunder Master behind the glass seems to have noticed the three as well, already standing up, sporting a smile like he’s waiting for fate to bring someone.\n\"It’s free, we can afford it, what do you say?\" Lin Li asked the two.\nStill, when it comes to him wanting to die, Lin Li plans on dragging his brothers along to die together.\n\"Are you seeking pain here, though I’ve never tried it, but it must hurt a lot, right? I’m afraid of pain, I don’t want to do it.\" Bai Bufan first cowardly backed out.\n\"It’s not ten levels at the start, it slowly goes up from level one. If you can’t take it anymore, you can surrender, it’s just for fun anyway.\" Lin Li said.\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan found it reasonable, not like park gigs where the bow shot can retract, hence developed some interest.\n\"If you try first, I can follow along, but this thing requires sharing on social media to get likes, pretty troublesome.\" Zhou Baowei said.\n\"Eighteen is fine, just let Wang Ze and them give us a like and be done.\" Lin Li had already started scanning and posting on social media.\nFirst, he blocked his mom and some relatives who would definitely ask all sorts of questions, along with Old Jian, and after sending, he posted in the boys’ group, the gaming group, and the four-people group he just joined today, asking them to like it.\n\"Ding Sihan:?\"\n\"Ding Sihan: I’m going to check now; you better follow through, don’t post those photoshopped pictures, or this will be your last message in this group.\"\nSeveral seconds later.\n\"Ding Sihan:???????\"\n\"Ding Sihan: Already started buying maternity and baby supplies? Have you figured out the baby stuff? What’s going on with you, is it still 2024? @Chen Yu Ying.\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu: Have you picked out a tomb site yet?\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying:?\"\nBecause the post shared was actually an ad of this maternity store, Ding Sihan had such doubts.\nLin Li explained a bit, and conveniently asked them to call the other three roommates to like it for him as well.\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Done. Why did you suddenly want to try this?\"\n\"Lin Li: Because I’ve heard that childbirth is very painful for women, but the difficulties of ten months of pregnancy and childbirth’s hardships can’t be truly understood just by hearing it a thousand times, so now there’s a chance to try, I want to, so that I can better understand the difficulties of girls and do better in understanding and empathy.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: ’Bear nodding GIF’.\"\n\"Ugh—\"\n\"Ugh—\"\nStanding beside him, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei involuntarily started gagging upon witnessing Lin Li typing such nauseating words.\n\"Lin Li, you sure know how to say the right thing to the right audience, anyone else, and they’ll think you’re full of crap.\" After vomiting, Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li contemptuously.\nFacing Bai Bufan’s disdain, Lin Li snickered while looking at him: \"Woof woof woof.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Crap!!\"\nLin Li then turned to look at Zhou Baowei, who began laughing wildly and slapping his thighs: \"Chuckle chuckle chuckle!\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Crap!!\"\nlikes aren’t much, especially for students yet to enter society, it’s even simpler. With the help of the guys and Chen Yu Ying’s dorm’s six girls, it came quickly.\nA pig and a dog by his side agreed to join the experience too, but only after Lin Li goes first, they wanted to see the feedback before deciding.\nThe three exchanged looks and nodded, walking toward the maternity store entrance.\n\"Come on, I’ve been waiting for you guys for a long time.\"\nWithout even showing his screenshots of collected likes, the Thunder Master who had been watching them through the glass walked forward expectantly.\nLin Li, hearing this, also walked forward suavely.\nHaving smoothly passed the eight tasks of Pingjiang, today, I’ll face off with you in Thunder technique!\nOld thing, unleash the lightning!",

Lin Li never wants to experience the torture of getting wisdom teeth pulled again.\n\"Lift your shirt and reveal your belly.\" The Thunder Dao expert sat nearby, moved the chair to Lin Li’s side, and said to him.\nLin Li obediently complied.\nZhou Baowei looked at Lin Li’s abs, feeling disgusted and nauseous.\nThis is not Lin Li at all.\nThe Thunder Dao expert slowly attached four machine connectors to Lin Li’s belly while kindly saying, \"Young man, now think of a safe word and confirm it with me.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nSafe word? Thunder method senior, are you playing SM here by yourself? Safe word?\nPerhaps seeing Lin Li’s confusion, the Thunder Dao expert explained, \"Because many people instinctively start saying rejection words when experiencing pain, having a safe word lets me know if you really intend to quit.\"\n\"Alright.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"It’s best not to choose one that’s too long because I’m afraid you won’t be able to say it completely.\" The Thunder Dao expert added.\nThis suggestion was indeed sincere.\nHowever, Lin Li’s goal was to bravely endure the trial, so saying the safe word was out of question.\n\"Then the safe word will be ’QQ Bah Bah tasty Bah Bah tea’.\" Lin Li said.\n\"You sure it’s QQ Bah...\" The Thunder Dao expert stopped midway.\n\"Say it.\" Lin Li looked expectant.\n\"I’ve remembered it now, young man, this is what you chose yourself, don’t blame me if you can’t say it later.\" The Thunder Dao expert coughed twice, then confirmed with Lin Li.\nLin Li nodded.\nIt seems he wasn’t leaving himself a way out.\n\"Alright, you can pull your shirt back down, here’s a pillow for you. When the pain comes, gripping it can help relieve some. Now, I’m going to start from level one gradually to level ten.\" The four connectors were all attached, the Thunder Dao expert said.\n\"Hmm.\" Lin Li took the pillow and nodded.\n\"Now it’s level 1, mild pain, like a mosquito bite.\" The Thunder Dao expert pressed the machine, turned his head to look at Lin Li, \"No problem, right?\"\n\"No feeling at all.\" Lin Li showed heroic disdain.\nThe Thunder Dao expert’s expression didn’t change, if it hurt they’d be wrong, so his smile was still kind, and he immediately increased the level, \"Now it’s level two, slightly painful, like the numbness after anesthesia wears off.\"\n\"Like kids playing house.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Now it’s level three, starting to really hurt, like the sharp pain when paper slices your fingertip.\"\n\"No feeling.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nHe’s really feeling nothing.\nWith Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Dao Body, so far, Lin Li not only had no negative feelings, but even felt quite comfortable.\nSeeing Lin Li’s expression unchanged, the Thunder Dao expert was a bit surprised, then continued to increase, \"Level four, stubbing your big toe on a table corner.\"\n\"Ow, pain!\"\nThe Thunder Dao expert finally heard the sound he wanted to hear, turned his head ready to speak, only to find it was Zhou Baowei who made the sound.\nThunder Dao expert: \"...\"\n\"Why does it hurt for you!\" he asked, confused.\nZhou Baowei scratched his head, \"Master, you described it too vividly, my phantom limb seemed to hit it.\"\nThunder Dao expert: \"...\"\nWhen he looked at protagonist Lin Li, he found that although Lin Li was no longer so at ease, his expression was still calm, which was unexpected.\nThis level of pain shouldn’t be unbearable, but it shouldn’t be as if everything was okay.\n\"Level five, persistent pain, like the continuous pain after twisting your ankle.\" He had no choice but to keep increasing the level.\nHowever, Lin Li’s facial features remained calm.\n\"Master, did you electrify it?\" asked Bai Bufan.\nNot pal, he didn’t come here to watch this, he wanted to see Lin Li yelling in pain, then laughing mockingly at Lin Li while standing with hands on hips.\n\"The machine’s fine, I just used it.\" Being questioned like this, the Thunder Dao expert also felt a bit insecure.\nBai Bufan simply lifted Lin Li’s shirt, looked for a while, then said, \"They’re all tightly attached, Master, can I take one off and try it on myself?\"\nWith permission granted, Bai Bufan directly removed one connector and attached it to his own belly.\n\"How’s it?\" The Thunder Dao expert asked.\n\"There’s a bit of feeling, but just a bit, doesn’t hurt. Bao Wei, do you want to try?\" Bai Bufan’s expression had only puzzled frowning, completely okay, nodded at Zhou Baowei.\nThe Thunder Dao expert was now completely in self-doubt.\n\"Is it really so weak? I distinctly remember being in constant pain after spraining last time.\" Hearing this, Zhou Baowei was a bit interested too, he pulled off a connector and attached it to his belly.\n\"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, ahhhhh!!!!\" The moment it attached, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei screamed simultaneously.\nBoth hurriedly tore off the connectors, faces showing dread and fear.\nAfter the dread and fear subsided, Zhou Baowei’s emotion changed to anger.\n— He grabbed Bai Bufan’s collar: \"Damn you Bai Bufan! You deliberately held it in just to wait for me to put it on too!\"\nThis kid actually kept enduring without shout, just waiting for himself to also put it on.\nSuch damn brotherly camaraderie.\nThe Thunder Dao expert let out a long sigh of relief.",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Chapter 125: Lin Li shouted, \"For my husband, for my son,\" and charged forward_2\nThankfully Zhou Baowei didn’t hold back his screams, otherwise he might have been tempted to try it himself.\nBut now it’s confirmed that the machine is functioning properly.\nAfter repositioning the electrodes on Lin Li’s body, he gave Lin Li an appreciative yet amused look — so it turns out he’s a true strongman.\nThe battle spirit of the Thunder Technique Master ignited fiercely as well.\n\"Very good, young man, you are the calmest person we’ve had since the start of this event. It’s now level six, quite painful, equivalent to a nail piercing your finger.\"\nLin Li did a swift sit-up like a carp leaping, but then lay back down again.\nAlthough the Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body was enhanced by 100%, it was still only moderately successful. The endurance had limited improvement and by the time it reached level five, Lin Li was already feeling uncomfortable, which was why he hadn’t said anything all along.\nLevel six truly lives up to its name, very painful.\nSeeing Lin Li’s carp-like sit-up, the Thunder Technique Master smiled reassuringly: \"How about it, young man, does it hurt?\"\n\"Absolutely no sensation,\" Lin Li only said these four words.\n\"Alright, now it’s level seven, extremely painful, equivalent to falling off a bike, sliding a bit across the ground, causing large abrasions and contusions.\" The Thunder Technique Master greatly admired Lin Li but didn’t show any mercy as he increased it by another level.\n\"Inhale—exhale—\"\n\"Inhale—exhale—\"\nLin Li was now sitting upright, his entire body tensed, and started breathing audibly.\n\"Still, no, feel, ing.\" Lin Li didn’t wait for him to ask and spoke up on his own.\n\"Hang in there, honey! I’m right here with you. You must give our family a little brother or sister for Bao Wei!\" Bai Bufan, at this moment, clenched his fist and cheered Lin Li on.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nDid I speak too late? Am I stuck playing the son in this role play?\nBut—\n\"Mom, hang in there!\" Zhou Baowei clenched his fists and cheered.\n\"Next, level eight, intense pain, equivalent to the pain of a gallstone attack that can make someone writhe on the bed,\" said the Thunder Technique Master as he increased it again.\n\"Ah dammit!!\" At the moment of increase, Lin Li finally let out a sound.\nHis stretched fingers had squished the cushion into a massive deformation, and his upper body swayed uneasily back and forth.\n\"Young man, how are you feeling now? Is it getting uncomfortable? Do you need to say the safe word?\" The Thunder Technique Master was in a good mood, feeling that this was the proper response, and softly asked.\n\"How could it be! Ah! No power! Ah ah ah! No sensation at all! Master! Is this machine—ah ah ah—is it out of power?!\" Surrendering was impossible, Lin Li was determined not to admit defeat, discovering that shouting indeed alleviated the pain, he cried out helplessly.\nThe Thunder Technique Master: \"...\"\nCan you still challenge me?\n\"Then we’re about to move on to level nine, explosive pain, bone fracture level of pain where some people might black out from the agony in reality,\" the Thunder Technique Master placed his finger on the machine and gently pressed it.\n\"Dammit dammit dammit! Feels great!! Ah ah! Feels amazing!! Ah ah! Dammit!! Feels so damn good! Master! Did you not eat? The shock, it—it doesn’t feel as powerful as an Apple charger! Needs charging!! No power!! No strength!!\"\nAt this moment, Lin Li, on the reclining chair, was writhing like a maggot, his expression contorted, but the words coming out of his mouth were incredibly carefree.\nIn that sentence, only the words \"I\", \"die\", \"ah\" were probably true.\nThe Thunder Technique Master chose to remain silent and then lowered his head to hold back his laughter.\nIsn’t it clear whether it hurts or not?\nWhile Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei beside him were already laughing and rolling on the ground.\nBeing able to see Lin Li like this was worth it!\n\"Dammit, I dare say, Thanos snaps and Lin Li is gone but his mouth would still be saying ’That’s it, Thanos, that’s it?’ Hahahahaha!\" Zhou Baowei sat on the ground, slapping his thigh.\n\"Hang in there honey! Hahaha! You must hang in there for the sake of our child!\" Bai Bufan watched his beloved wife undergoing such torment and painfully laughed out loud.\nWhen people are extremely saddened, they will laugh, and Bai Bufan believed this was the situation he was in now.\n\"Sweetie! What do you mean, bear with it? This is goddamn enjoyment! It’s enjoyment! I’m feeling—I’m feeling relaxed!\" Lin Li’s body trembled as he turned around and gave Bai Bufan a thumbs up.\n\"Alright, young man, next is level ten labor pain. If you endure this pain for ten minutes, you can win four coupons worth a discount of five off one hundred at our store and some maternity and baby products. No one has won yet, maybe you can be the first, hang in there!\"\nThe Thunder Technique Master was also moved by Lin Li’s spirit, applauding while mercilessly upgrading.\n——Ding——\n——Buzz Buzz Buzz——\nThe current frantically surged into Lin Li’s body, already far exceeding the Purity and Righteous Thunder-Controlling Body limit.\nIt was as if his ears were ringing, and every sound and scene in the world seemed to drift away from him.\nHe wanted to die.\nAnd to hold on for ten minutes?\nImpossible.\nThis was Lin Li’s thought now, dazed, even a bit blurred, wondering if he was screaming.\nOh, seemed like he was screaming all along, feeling tired, wanting to sleep.\nMight as well go have a sip of QQ Mie Mie Delicious Meipucha...\nThe thought of giving up became irrepressible after it surfaced.\n\"Q, Q, Mie, Mie...\" Lin Li’s mouth had already started instinctively wanting to say the safe word, his voice was low, but he was indeed speaking.\n\"Mom! Hold on! Don’t faint! You can do it!\" Zhou Baowei, with tears in his eyes, started wildly laughing and encouraging.\nMother’s love! Mother’s love!\nA mother’s love truly is the greatest power in this world, and Zhou Baowei’s voice renewed Lin Li’s spirit as a new mother once again!\nHe couldn’t give up just yet!\nHis child, his husband, they’re all waiting for him!\nYelling words like familial bond and ties, Lin Li sat straight up on the recliner again.\n\"Honey, when it’s painful, just hold my hand, let me give you strength,\" Bai Bufan also teared up, laughing wildly as he reached his helping hand to Lin Li.\nLin Li didn’t refuse, and even had light in his eyes, the light of love. He immediately held Bai Bufan’s hands tightly.\nThen.\nQingzheng Thunder Control Technique, activate!\nDamn it, I’m electrifying electrifying electrifying electrifying electrifying!\n\"Aaaaaa!!!!\" Bai Bufan suddenly began screaming, which scared Zhou Baowei and the Thunder Technique Master quite a lot.\n\"What’s the matter, Dad, did Mom grab you really hard?\" Zhou Baowei asked, surprised.\n\"No, no! The electricity is passing through to me, damn it!!\" Bai Bufan’s voice trembled, half-kneeling on the ground, struggling to pull his hand back.\n\"Young man, don’t joke around,\" the Thunder Technique Master replied laughingly waving it off, \"the current of this machine doesn’t transmit that way to others.\"\n\"No, there’s really electricity! Master! The machine is leaking electricity! Master! Ah!! Stop it! Quickly turn off the machine! QQ Mie Mie Delicious Meipucha, QQ Mie Mie Delicious...\" Bai Bufan continued to scream.\nThe Thunder Technique Master shook his head helplessly yet amusedly.\nA safe word is meaningless unless spoken by the person themselves, he naturally wouldn’t end the challenge.\nIt’s just that these kids.\nOne was electrocuted to death but insisted there was no electricity.\nThe other wasn’t electrocuted at all, but claimed he was being electrocuted to death.\nYou guys are really [finger-pointing].",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Chapter 126: Asking for 18 likes, thank you all\n\"Let go! Lin Li, let go! I can’t take it anymore!\" Seeing that the Thunder Way expert didn’t believe him, Bai Bufan could only frantically try to break free. However, Lin Li’s grip was just too strong, and all his struggles were in vain.\nWhen I get back, I must abstain from desire. Otherwise, I really can’t handle Lin Li.\n\"I need you, my baby daddy!\" Lin Li couldn’t possibly let go.\nWith a stable channel to release the accumulated electricity from within, Lin Li himself had a greater tolerance for the electricity.\nBesides, Bai Bufan’s screams sounded like celestial music to him. Hearing his brother so miserable now made most of his pain just fly away.\nIt’s a miracle cure, Dr. Bai.\n\"Get lost! I don’t need you! Divorce! Let’s get a divorce right now! It’s killing me!\" Bai Bufan’s whole body twitched as he used his free left hand to madly pound on Lin Li’s grip.\nThen his left hand was grabbed by Lin Li’s right hand again.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nSuper! Extra! Strength!\nBai Bufan: \"!!!\"\n\"Ah!!!\"\n\"No divorce, I don’t accept it!\" Lin Li rejected Bai Bufan’s request for a divorce.\n\"Ah!!! Who cares if you accept it or not! Quick, give me a divorce!\"\n\"According to the law, unless it’s a non-litigious divorce, separation for over two years, or a major fault, you can’t get a unilateral divorce! So you have to let me accept it!\" Lin Li’s grip tightened even more.\n\"I beg you, bro, let’s get a divorce, you can have all the property, and Bao Wei is yours too, I’ll leave with nothing, I’ll even pay you alimony! Divorce!!\" Bai Bufan was still struggling, but after realizing that even while being electrocuted, Lin Li’s brute strength surpassed his own, his tone turned pleading.\n\"I don’t want anything, I just want you!\" Lin Li demonstrated what it meant to be deeply in love.\n\"But there’s a kind of love that’s called letting go!\" But Bai Bufan was such a scoundrel.\n\"That’s not my way of endurance!\"\n\"Damn it, I’m breaking down, I’m really breaking down—Lin Li, my guts and shit are going to get shocked out of me!!\"\n\"It’s okay, don’t forget what kind of store this is, the people here have plenty of experience handling guts and shit!\"\n\"Damn!!\"\nThis beast Lin Li put up an unbeatable defense that broke Bai Bufan’s mental barrier.\nThere was already a significant irreparable rift in their relationship.\nWhen parents fight, it’s always the children who get hurt the most.\nAt this moment, the poor child Zhou Baowei, having witnessed the breakdown in his parents’ relationship, was scared into shaking on the ground, making a noise that was a cross between laughing and crying.\nAfter laughing with little energy left, Zhou Baowei got up from the ground, weakly trying to mediate, \"Please stop fighting, don’t fight, you won’t die from fighting like this.\"\n\"Right! Bao Wei, there’s still Bao Wei! Lin Li, grab the child, the child can give you more power, Bao Wei, come over and grab your mom’s hand!\" Bai Bufan noticed Zhou Baowei and immediately shouted as if seeing a savior.\n\"I won’t.\" Zhou Baowei cautiously stepped back upon hearing that.\nEven though he knew that Bai Bufan was exaggerating now and wasn’t really being electrocuted, going over to let Lin Li grab him would still hurt, so there was no reason to do it.\nIf Bai Bufan knew what Zhou Baowei was thinking right now, he would definitely curse, \"Exaggerating, my ass, exaggerating!!\"\nSo, Zhou Baowei just watched as Bai Bufan’s life force dwindled bit by bit.\nAlmost dead, he finally had a pang of conscience and advised, \"Bufan, if it doesn’t work, let’s just confess.\"\n\"Damn you, just ask, I’ll confess anything!\" Bai Bufan, who had given up struggling and was bound to Lin Li’s side, said weakly.\nHis body still occasionally twitched from the shocks, and he would occasionally let out a scream.\n\"No, Bufan, don’t confess, hold on, maybe later there will be a beautiful opportunity—\" Lin Li, pale-faced, encouraged from the side.\n\"Then I won’t confess yet.\" What Lin Li said made sense, so Bai Bufan grit his teeth again.\nTime passed bit by bit.\nThe expression in the Thunder Way expert’s eyes grew increasingly surprised.\nYou see, the most important customers in a maternity shop are the mothers. If fathers endure the pain of childbirth, they might think it’s just okay and potentially leave the crucial mother group dissatisfied, thinking it was completely off-target.\nMoreover, after the full experience of this event, large discounts and gifts are offered, so there wasn’t any intention of letting people pass.\nThus, the current flowing from the machine was within safe limits but more painful than natural childbirth, maintaining a strong intensity at all times. Even Wu Jing would utter some cultural phrases if he came.\nBut although the kid in front of him screamed hard at first and is visibly still in agony, he seems to have truly endured?\nThe younger generation is indeed formidable; this is the true legendary Electric Endurance King.\nAt this moment, Lin Li, with eyes tightly closed, even though Bai Bufan had given up escaping, still held his hand with unwavering strength.\nThe Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique continued to operate, absorbing the current and then transmitting it to Bai Bufan.\nHowever, the power output was far less than the absorbed amount; otherwise, Bai Bufan would have run with severed arms if he had to.\nThe main stinging pain still coursed through his own body.\nCultivation, this is cultivation! Lin Li comforted himself with such thoughts in his mind.\nDamn it, when ordinary people encounter a cultivation between life and death, shouldn’t they experience a phoenix rebirth with a great opportunity, like the Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body reaching Great Perfection in one step? Why is it just pure electrocution when it comes to him, and after all this time, there’s no improvement in the Thunder Body?\nIt must be because there’s no Spiritual Qi flowing. In hindsight, he should have kept two Spirit Stones in his crotch at all times.",

Father, Mother, I’m proud of you!\" Zhou Baowei checks the time on the machine and replies.\n\"It’s nothing difficult, I, I suddenly feel invigorated, haha, it’s just, like this.\"\n\"It’s the light of a dying flash, the light of a dying flash! Looks like you’re about to die soon!\" Zhou Baowei cheerfully says.\n\"Great, I’m finally about to die.\"\nBai Bufan is equally happy, he’s been seeing his great-grandmother waving at him for a while now, and he can finally embrace her.\n...\nThe extremely painful electric current finally comes to a slow halt.\nTurns out, plain and simple happiness is this blissful?\n\"Congratulations! Young man, you’re the first customer to fully experience the pain of childbirth since our store’s event started! Congratulations!\" The Thunder Road expert, who turned off the machine, says with immense satisfaction.\nThere is enthusiastic applause from around.\n\"Bufan, we’re the champions.\" Lin Li finally releases Bai Bufan’s two hands and collapses onto a recliner, opening his eyes weakly and sighing lightly.\nA hand beside him falls helplessly after he lets go, and Bai Bufan doesn’t respond either.\nProbably dead.\nBut it doesn’t matter.\nLin Li sincerely prays in his heart for a while before activating the system.\n[Task two completed.]\n[You have received rewards: Physical Improvement: Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body’s effectiveness increased by 100%; System Currency *50.]\nLin Li then takes a long breath of relief.\nEven though he didn’t cry out for mercy or in pain the whole time, Lin Li was still worried the system would think he wasn’t brave enough.\nIf he had to endure another electric shock, this isn’t an amusement park ride, he can’t handle it.\n\"Damn, why are there so many people? How did you all end up here?\" Fully relaxed with cold sweat all over, Lin Li sits up and looks around, startled.\nA whole crowd surrounds him.\nThis store’s employees, Wang Ze and other male classmates, and some strangers.\nNo wonder there was so much applause, Zhou Baowei hasn’t gone crazy for several minutes either.\n\"We were at the game store entrance across the street and heard Bufan’s screams and Baowei’s laughter from afar, so we came over,\" Wang Ze explains while giving a thumbs-up, \"Awesome, Lin Li, you endured level ten pain for ten minutes!\"\n\"It’s fine, didn’t feel much, I feel like I could be reborn ten times,\" Lin Li shrugs.\n\"Indeed, just like playing house, I handled it with ease,\" Bai Bufan, still lying on the ground, nods as well.\n\"Hello sir, these are your discount coupons, and here’s a pack of baby wipes...\" At this point, the store clerk brings over the rewards for the complete experience and then asks, \"Would you like help packing it up?\"\n\"No need, I’ve already packed it.\"\nLin Li chuckles, stands up, and then stumbles from weak knees.\nFortunately, his limb control is strong. After a few steps, he steadies himself completely and smiles at the store clerk, \"You guys are too kind, offering perks for such a simple activity.\"\nThe store clerk: \"...\"\nNothing to say, this indeed is a show-off.\nBut sir, maybe wipe the cold sweat off your forehead first.\nWhen Lin Li gets his prizes, he’s at a loss, holding these baby products and coupons, he has no use for them.\nAlthough some baby shower gels and powders are perfectly fine for adults, it doesn’t seem necessary for Lin Li to buy these just for the vouchers.\n\"Bao Wei, do you like it?\" Lin Li shakes a rattle at the 1.8-meter-tall Zhou Baowei and hands over a pacifier, \"These are the toys mom won for you, if you like them, take them.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Get lost.\"\nLin Li has a brainwave and asks the store clerk, \"Are these coupons only usable by me once bound?\"\n\"Probably not, but the coupon is limited to one per day,\" the store clerk hesitates before replying.\n\"Okay, thanks, everyone! Look over here! I’m selling discount bundles cheap, with these little gifts too, anyone interested?\" Lin Li cheerfully thanks him before calling out to the shop customers and passersby.\nThe store clerk doesn’t stop him.\nTheoretically, the right to use coupons belongs to the store, and there are points of contention and prohibition in transferring them, but he isn’t the store manager, just earning a dead salary.\n—Wearing a store clerk’s clothes, don’t worry about store manager’s problems.\nLao Da slept eight hours a day wearing the No. 8 jersey, and 24 hours a day wearing the No. 24 jersey, this is the experience of the older artists, and it verified the theory.\nDon’t go beyond what’s necessary because arguing with customers won’t benefit my mood and might result in being on bad terms within the store, not worth it.\nThere’s still a market for these coupons, especially customers planning to spend here anyway, in the end, Lin Li sells a bag of stuff plus coupons for 150 bucks, a win-win, he gladly accepts the offer, because after all, it was a free gain.\nEveryone’s happy, half a Spring Breeze Elf (Lu Zhishen mold) in the bag.\n\"You can earn so much? I’d like to try it, I’m a sports student, having a baby should be a breeze? Shoot this and forward this post, is that right?\"\nWang Ze and his friends see Lin Li making a profit and are instantly interested, eagerly snapping photos and sharing posts.\n...\nCommercial district parking lot.\nOn the bus, the well-traveled Xue Jian has no interest in shopping in the commercial district, so he stays on the bus.\n\"There are three methods to help misguided students find the right path—\"\nXue Jian attentively listens to the experience shared by other key teachers.\nBut halfway in, his brows furrow, feeling none of it is applicable.\nLin Li isn’t any common mischief.\nAfter thinking for a while, Xue Jian clicks on another video:\n\"How to maintain a positive mindset dealing with mischievous students, there are three methods—\"\nThis is more like it.\nThis is what I should be learning.\nXue Jian’s expression relaxes, and he nods affirmatively.\nAfter finishing the video, feeling enlightened, Xue Jian decides to scroll through his social feed.\n「Zhang Haoyang: Need eighteen likes, quickly. 「Link: Pingjiang Baoshu Baby Products Store is having a promotion! Spend over...」」\nXue Jian gives it a like, guessing it’s for family shopping and requires sharing.\n「Qin Zeyu: Need eighteen likes. 「Link: Pingjiang Baoshu Baby...」」\nYou have kids too?\nXue Jian gives another like.\n「Zhou Baowei: Need eighteen likes. 「Link: Pingjiang Baoshu...」」\n「Ding Sihan: Need eighteen likes, thanks. 「Link: Pingjiang Baoshu...」」\n「Wang Yuezhi: Everyone, please help by giving a like↓⇓↓⇓↓.」\n「Chen Yu Ying: Give a like, thank you all. 「Link: Pingjiang Baoshu...」」\n「Zhuo Yongfei: Asking for eighteen likes. 「Link: Pingjiang Baoshu...」」\n「...」\nA whole screen of uniform social media posts, all asking for likes, except for Wang Yuezhi, lacking any link, unclear what they’re doing.\nBut this doesn’t stop Xue Jian from having a face full of question marks: \"???\"\nBu Hao!\nIt’s impossible for everyone to have children!\nSomething is again suspiciously wrong!\n\"Driver, open the door! Let me out! Quickly!\" Xue Jian shouts to the driver wearing a hat, napping next to him.",

Have they already left?\" Xue Jian asked the people present.\nAmong those present, Lin Li was not there, and no matter how much Xue Jian scrolled through his friends’ circle, he couldn’t see Lin Li sharing this post.\nBut Xue Jian firmly believed that in situations like this, Lin Li would have definitely participated and was very likely the mastermind.\nHe just knew Lin Li too well.\nThe reason he couldn’t see the repost was probably because he was blocked.\nBeing blocked as a teacher is very normal, Xue Jian wasn’t going to be mad about it, surely not just Lin Li, he couldn’t see Wang Ze’s posts either, who was screaming on the spot after being shocked.\nStay calm.\nXue Jian updated the notes of each student present whose posts he couldn’t see, just marked them simply.\nFocus on them later on.\nHa, Xue Jian never blocked a teacher’s QQ or WeChat when he was in school.\n—Although back then there wasn’t QQ or WeChat.\n\"Just left, probably went to the restroom.\" Zhang Haoyang replied upon hearing.\nSure enough, this kid would never miss out on something like this.\n\"Alright, you guys can have fun, but remember not to affect their business.\"\nXue Jian nodded, aware that his presence made everyone uncomfortable, advised them not to disturb others, and then left.\n...\n\"Big city is big city, even the restrooms have an artistic vibe.\" Arriving at the restroom, Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\nTingyu Pavilion, Waterfall Pavilion.\nWould it kill them to simply write male or female?\nAnd some restrooms only use W and M to differentiate the men’s and women’s, sure it’s easy for those who’ve learned simple English, but for older or less educated people, it’s no different from not writing anything?\nOne can only say that some of these designers have some issues, all about art, without considering practicality.\n\"Brothers, trust me, Tingyu Pavilion is the men’s room, didn’t you see there’s a male sign here?\" Bai Bufan was very confident, pointing at the men’s room sign to explain.\n\"You’re right, but dude, go to Waterfall, you go to Tingyu.\" Lin Li and Zhou Baowei didn’t bother with this.\n\"No no no–\"\nDone with business there.\nThe three had paper but didn’t use it, instead used each other’s clothes to wipe their hands.\n\"So what’s the plan, now that we’ve got money, where should we go spend it?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"You’re planning to share the money with us?\" Zhou Baowei, upon hearing, was somewhat surprised.\n\"I absolutely deserve a share, I was shocked alongside him for quite a while!\" Bai Bufan looked righteous.\nThis hundred fifty has his sweat and effort!\nJust now the great-grandma invited him to dinner several times, Bai Bufan finally managed to refuse.\n\"As the saying goes, all who see it have a share, we’re all brothers here, let’s not fuss over electric shocks or not, Bao Wei even played the role of son, fifty per person, hurry up, show me your mobile payment code.\" Lin Li didn’t want to fuss over these unexpected earnings, waved it off generously.\n\"Thanks, mom!\" Suddenly, Zhou Baowei’s smile turned flattering, looking at Lin Li like he was a big spender, using his own clothes to help Lin Li wipe his hands.\n\"This is rightly mine.\" Bai Bufan, thick-skinned, displayed his QR code.\nLin Li scanned the code, transferred fifty to each.\nThe two gradually fell silent in their joy.\nUpon clearly seeing the amount, Zhou Baowei tiptoed and pressed his forehead against Lin Li’s, glaring fiercely: \"Is my fifty fifty cents?\"\nHe received 0.50.\nBai Bufan was initially about to get angry, but upon hearing he laughed, hey! Look at this! His was fifty cents, a solid ten times Bao Wei’s.\nHaha, nice!\nAs long as he wasn’t the worst off.\n\"Mainly fifty cents feels a bit stingy.\"\nFifty cents is five jiao.\n\"Should I be thanking you then!\" Zhou Baowei gritted his teeth, Lin Li even brought out the jiao unit.\n\"I only said fifty per person, I didn’t specify the unit.\" Lin Li feigned innocence, spreading his hands as he walked ahead: \"Come on, now that the money’s in hand, it’s time for us to indulge in luxury spending.\"\n\"With a whopping fifty cents in hand, now it feels like everyone I see is after my fortune.\" Following behind, Zhou Baowei said in a sarcastic tone.\n\"Getting rich feels like that, I got four hundred fifty in cows’ heads, even more anxious.\" Bai Bufan, too, acted sneaky, with a sense of mischief.\n\"Tsk, just joking, let’s go, for today, any spending under a hundred forty is on me.\" Lin Li really didn’t care much about this unexpected windfall, said with a smile, but quickly added sternly: \"A hundred forty yuan.\"\nUnits matter a lot.\nLook at Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei, their eyes bright before sank to dim after his correction.\nBai Bufan’s plan to buy out this shopping center was dashed.\n...\n\"Thank you for your contributions to the welfare cause.\"\nSeeing the words on the lottery machine, Lin Li looked at the two: \"Quit gambling.\"\nThe three each bought a ten-dollar scratch card, none won, unwilling to accept defeat, they checked a second time with the machine before accepting the result.\nNot even a single break-even ten bucks given.\n\"I quit too.\" Bai Bufan sighed.\n\"Hey, Bufan, what do you think about us making a bet? Let’s see which one of us can quit gambling for longer this time?\" Lin Li, always the idea guy in a trio, suddenly excitedly turned around and said.\n\"Sure, how much are we betting? My resolve to quit gambling is unbreakable!\" Great idea, Bai Bufan’s fighting spirit was ignited.\n\"Damn! Are you guys quitting some dam or something over there?\" Zhou Baowei, nearby, laughed and cursed upon hearing this.\nOne in every four car accidents is caused by playing with a phone while driving.\nLin Li: Can’t be me.\nOut of every 302,575,350 people playing the lottery, one person wins the jackpot.\nLin Li: You never know.\nAnyway, it’s not like they’d waste all one hundred and fifty; about thirty went to charity donations, and the three of them then headed to the snack street in the basement of the shopping center.\nLet the body enjoy it too; the body worked hard today, a little bite for today, and a real pampering after getting home tomorrow night.\n...\n\"Lin Li, how did you manage to last? I didn’t even make it to level ten; I couldn’t take it at level nine.\" On the bus return to base, Wang Ze turned to look at Lin Li, who was eating a fruit salad, a bit confused.\n\"This is how we sports students are. I know what you’re going to say, but I’m at the pinnacle of the half-step sports student first level Great Perfection, while you’re just at the beginner stage of the walking sports student first level small perfection.\" Lin Li said casually.\nWang Ze: \"... But at least I have the Euro step.\"\nReverse against the Big Dipper.\nWhat a hierarchical alliance system.\nWang Ze wasn’t embarrassed; in fact, half the boys were curious and tried it, but other than Lin Li, no one could completely endure it. Lasting till level nine was already rare.\nThey all suspected the shop deliberately adjusted the difficulty.\n\"You’re really awesome, I need to look up to you.\" Although being jabbed at, Wang Ze not only tolerated it but also praised him.\n\"Eat it if you want, the rest is yours, don’t gross me out.\" Lin Li handed over the fruit salad, a bit disgusted.\n\"You know me well.\" Wang Ze unceremoniously took it, inhaled it like a storm, then spat out some bitten watermelon seeds, and frowned: \"Why are there seeds? I’m very displeased; I don’t like spitting watermelon seeds. Lin Li, watch it next time.\"\n\"I can’t do this, no seedless version.\"\nWang Ze, the annoying outsider who came to beg, gave a thumbs-up and mumbled something after which he turned his head back to enjoy the fruit salad.\n\"Class rep, how did you manage to buy so many things in just two hours?\" Lin Li asked curiously, stretching and looking at Chen Yu Ying, who now had several more shopping bags and packages compared to when they came.\n\"Just kept buying and buying, and it piled up,\" Chen Yu Ying smiled apologetically, \"Is it squeezing you? Sorry.\"\n\"If one day I can shop like Ying Bao without looking at the prices, that’d be great,\" Ding Sihan said with envy in her eyes upon hearing.\n\"Just open a buy now, pay later account,\" Lin Li leaned over and gave a practical suggestion.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"I even got you a gift, Lin Li, I’m not giving it to you now!\" Ding Sihan said angrily.\n\"What?\"\nLin Li turned his head, eyes widening to look at Ding Sihan.\nChen Yu Ying also turned, surprised, to look at Ding Sihan.\nDing Sihan’s eyes were so captivating, they even... even, even had eyeballs!\n\"Oh, my fairy, I spoke a bit too loudly just now, scared you, I’m really sorry.\" A true man can humble himself. In front of a fairy, adopting a humble demeanor isn’t out of the question, so Lin Li said humbly: \"Please, I really need it, the biggest wish of my life is to receive a gift.\"\nPerhaps due to Lin Li’s decent attitude, Ding Sihan soon forgave him.\n\"Wait a moment, I’ll get it for you.\"\nDing Sihan took out a gift box from beside her, opened it; it was a crystal ball.\n\"Such a beautiful crystal ball, I love it~\" Lin Li started praising it even before getting a clear look, because in such moments, emotional value is a must.\nOnce got, he’ll just post on second-hand trading platforms as a student-used 99% new item, hehe.\nKidding, the gift should still be treasured.\n\"It looks nice, doesn’t it? I liked it a lot too, that’s why I bought it.\" Getting acknowledgment, Ding Sihan nodded, looked at it wistfully again.\nThen she took out the bubble wrap that covered the crystal ball, placed it in Lin Li’s outstretched hand, and after admiring the crystal ball one last time, happily placed it back in the box, then into her bag.\n\"...\"\nWait a minute.\n\"So my gift... was this?\" Lin Li squinted at the bubble wrap in his hand, questioning.\n\"What did you think?\"\nDing Sihan’s face was a grotesque mix of fake confusion and extreme ugliness.\n\"To be honest, that crystal ball was super ugly, I just can’t understand who’d buy such a thing, it’s like an intelligence tax, the buyer really has no taste, you think I liked it for real? If I received it, the first thing I’d do is toss it in the trash; it’s disgustingly awful.\"\nLin Li clutched the bubble wrap, full of disdain.\n\"So sour, who’s eating pickled cucumbers? Can you add it to my fruit salad?\" Wang Ze, still eating the fruit salad, pinched his nose and turned to ask, but halfway through, got pressed back by Lin Li’s hand.\nHearing Lin Li say that, Ding Sihan didn’t get mad, instead, she laughed even more happily, \"Ying Bao bought one too, just that small box by your feet.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Really?\" Lin Li turned to confirm.\nChen Yu Ying innocently nodded.\n\"Speaking of which——\"\n\"How should we bring it back?\" Ding Sihan’s face was full of anticipation.\nAfter thinking for a long time, Lin Li burst into laughter. What he said earlier was indeed too much, he gave Ding Sihan a thumbs up:\n\"Damn, you won.\"\nDing Sihan was so wicked, she wasn’t like this just a week ago; which beast in the trenches spoiled her?",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Chapter 128: Wang Yuezhi Wins Every Battle, Such Is the True Man\nThe bus returned near the base, and we walked back.\nAs usual, after arriving, Chen Tianming dashed off alone, as if he had fallen into the Love River having held hands for 0.65 seconds.\nBai Bufan and Zhou Baowei lay limp on the bed, unable to match Chen Tianming’s excitement and energy.\nPlaying all day is actually quite tiring, wandering around everywhere.\n\"Bao Wei, why does it feel like something’s poking my butt?\" Lying on the bed with eyes closed, Bai Bufan frowned, sensing something amiss.\n\"It’s the remote control.\" Zhou Baowei moved comfortably behind Bai Bufan, \"I’m behind you, what’s there to be afraid of.\"\n\"It’s precisely because you are behi— huh? It really is the remote control.\" Bai Bufan sat up, holding the remote in disinterest.\n\"You’re just sitting there disappointed in your dam, I’m going to shower first.\" Lin Li laughed and cursed.\nThe sweatiest part today was when going against the master Lei Dao, and now there’s still some discomfort on him.\nAfter showering, Bai Bufan was brushing his teeth.\n\"Lin Li, why do you think the water around the toothpaste gets repelled?\" Bai Bufan questioned as he stared at the sink while brushing his teeth.\n\"Heard of surface tension?\" Lin Li responded upon hearing him.\n\"Your second uncle?\" Bai Bufan disdainfully turned his head towards Lin Li.\nHaving surfed the internet too much, it’s hard to fool him, but this time he was met with Lin Li’s sneer:\n\"Actually no, there’s a component in toothpaste that reduces water tension, thinning the liquid film between the toothpaste and water, which gets pulled away by the surrounding water to form a repellent effect. Besides, volatile substances causing pressure also play a role, and then there are the components of foaming agents in toothpaste...\"\nFoam fell from his mouth as Bai Bufan stared blankly at Lin Li who was speaking eloquently.\nLin Li was rambling about something; he wasn’t taking the opportunity to curse him, was he?\nThe Lin Li in front of him seemed both unfamiliar and disgusting to Bai Bufan.\n\"Oh right, ever heard of ’extending the horizon’?\" As he wrapped up, Lin Li inquired.\n\"Never heard of it.\" Feeling as if he were attending a lecture, Bai Bufan shook his head, in a daze.\n\"Well, that’s actually my second uncle.\"\n\"Damn!!\"\nThe map of Yan Kingdom is so long, but even with all the surfing, I still fell for the trap!\nHowever, one should not casually curse, especially with a mouth full of foam, Lin Li’s face was now full of frustration.\n\"So you were just babbling nonsense earlier?\" Bai Bufan asked after rinsing his mouth.\n\"No, everything before was true, I was curious before and looked it up, then remembered it.\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"If you didn’t understand, forget it, it’s normal for dead wood not to be carved.\" Seeing Bai Bufan’s confusion, Lin Li patted his shoulder, laughing.\nSo this is how it feels for a smart person to look down on a fool? How delightful.\nReturning to the room, Zhou Baowei was also gone, probably having agreed with Bai Bufan to shower first, then went next door to play cards.\nIt’s about time for me to... no, I can’t!\nI can’t repeat yesterday’s card-playing disaster.\nAbsolutely not.\nBesides, [strong memory] can only accumulate three times at most, it would be wasted if not used, so Lin Li activated his ability and began studying on his phone.\nNot long after, Bai Bufan came out after showering and saw Lin Li still in the dormitory frowning at his phone, he squinted his eyes sharply: \"Lin Li, not studying again, are you? Why not go next door and hang out?\"\n\"Not studying, don’t feel like going out after showering, just watching some short videos for entertainment.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nBai Bufan immediately approached quickly, and after seeing Lin Li really watching entertainment-oriented short videos, he exhaled in relief.\nThen, as Bai Bufan was about to put on pants to go next door, he paused at the doorway and suddenly came over to Lin Li’s side.\nSeeing Lin Li, still watching the same short video now, he asked coldly: \"Why are you still watching this one?\"\n\"Classics are meant to be revisited repeatedly, just like a good manga, would you only rush through it once?\"\n\"Let me see your history.\"\nLin Li laughed.\nThen shook his head:\n\"I have my privacy.\"\nHis right to privacy was violated as his phone was snatched by Bai Bufan, and immediately, the first thing discovered in the history was the \"Compulsory Historical Points for Three Subjects\" page.\n\"A brother feels heart-to-heart with you, yet you’re playing mind games with him, Lin Li oh Lin Li, you even used a sleight of hand?\" Bai Bufan’s heart was truly pained at this moment.\n\"If I don’t do this, how can I get into the top 100, or do you want to watch me call Wang Yuezhi ’dad’?\" Lin Li questioned.\n\"Hmm.\"\nFaced with Lin Li’s rising emotions, Bai Bufan merely nodded calmly again:\n\"Go ahead.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"My dignity isn’t that cheap!\"\n\"Should I go over and call him for you in advance? Will you stop studying then?\" Bai Bufan changed his strategy.\n\"... That won’t do either.\"\n\"Lin Li, study at home, I can’t control that, but when I’m playing, please don’t study within a kilometer of me!\" Bai Bufan sincerely pleaded.\nFor a student who got into Nansang, a top high school, not studying is almost unheard of, Bai Bufan’s grades were similar to Lin Li’s before, decent but not very diligent.\nAmbitious, but not excessively so.\nThis kind, most would play for a class during night study, experiencing a strong sense of guilt at the end of the class.\nBut such guilt would greatly diminish upon realizing his buddies didn’t study much either.\nReading a novel until the climax during half a class + looking up to find friends sleeping = contentedly continuing to read the novel.\nReading a novel until the climax during half a class + looking up to find friends studying seriously = guilt-ridden continuing to read the novel.\nSince Lin Li got taken over last week, Bai Bufan doesn’t need to turn his head under such circumstances now, as Lin Li is definitely studying.",

      "content": "Chapter 143: Chapter 128: Wang Yuezhi Wins Every Battle, Such Is the True Man_2\nBecause of this, Bai Bufan, overwhelmed by guilt, has been more diligent in class and during evening self-study these past two weeks than last semester.\nExcept for English class—English class is the one where Lin Li behaves most like a human.\nNo more sleeping in class or during evening self-study, damn it, with Lin Li’s page flipping right next to him, who the hell could fall asleep?\nFriends’ game sounds, or even Bao Wei’s tractor engine, are like lullabies, allowing Bai Bufan to sleep peacefully, but the soft rustle of page flipping is deafening, enough to keep him tossing and turning.\nIt’s not just Bai Bufan, the guys in the back row are also affected by this contagious phenomenon and have been more studious recently.\nDamn, it’s a rat race now.\nThis internal competition was caused by a beast like Lin Li.\n\"Sorry, I’ll start gaming now! timi!\" Lin Li finally realized his mistake, took off his headphones, and turned his phone sideways.\nBai Bufan leaned over to check.\nThe suspended screen of \"Must-Know History Points III\" hadn’t been closed.\n\"You’ve got wings now, I can’t control you alone anymore.\" Bai Bufan said with a cold face, leaving the room without putting on his pants.\nLin Li’s face changed dramatically, hurriedly putting on his pants to flee.\n...\n\"Yongfei, close the door, what are they yelling about so late at night? That group really acts like lunatics, there’s no need to bring them on an autumn outing, your decision and Chen Yu Ying’s was truly a mistake.\"\nHearing the screams and pleas coming from the hallway, Wang Yuezhi, who was looking at \"A Hundred Little Details to Make Girls Like You,\" felt annoyed.\nEspecially since those screams and pleas were from Lin Li, which made him even more annoyed.\nZhuo Yongfei closed the door without making any further comment.\nAfter finishing the video, Wang Yuezhi remembered something and opened his social media feed.\n\"Wang Yuezhi: Everyone, please help me like this ↓⇓↓⇓↓.\"\nHe deleted the post.\nThis post was hidden from Chen Yu Ying.\nThat way, if she hears about it from other classmates, she’ll be even more touched, right?\nHaha, just the thought of it makes him emotional.\nHis phone suddenly vibrated, and a message popped up.\n\"Your starred friend ’Chen Yu Ying’ has posted a new update in her moments, hurry and check it out.\"\nHe quickly and clumsily exited his personal page and refreshed his social media feed.\nChen Yu Ying posted a grid of dozens of photos—a few slots were completely occupied by single photos, while the rest opened up to long stitched-together images.\nWang Yuezhi had actually clicked on three dots, but hesitated over \"like.\"\nBecause he saw that in the center of the grid was a big group photo of four people at an amusement park, with Lin Li’s face in the front making a silly face.\nUtterly hideous.\nKinda didn’t want to like it now...\nNo, no, Chen Yu Ying would surely notice if he suddenly didn’t like it this time since he was always the first to like her posts, she might worry and overthink, he couldn’t let that happen to her.\nIt’s Lin Li’s fault, not a reason for him not to like it.\nGot it now.\nLike!\n\"ᰔChen Yu Ying, Zhuo Yongfei, Rainy Days\"\nHe glanced angrily at Zhuo Yongfei beside him.\nIs it you who made it impossible for me to be with Chen Yu Ying in the like area? Damn it!\nWang Yuezhi knew that Chen Yu Ying always showed him care by liking his posts first, so he strived hard to be the first.\n\"What’s up?\" Zhuo Yongfei, who was about to grab the air conditioner remote, was startled by the look.\n\"...Nothing.\"\nForget it.\nHe must’ve been checking social media too, no worries, not an enemy.\nThen, Wang Yuezhi began appreciating each photo earnestly, because Chen Yu Ying’s social media was only visible for three months and would disappear after that, he would save every nice portrait photo.\nUpon seeing some photos with Lin Li, he was troubled again.\nForget it, better save them and mosaic out the unsightly bits later.\nWang Yuezhi suddenly chuckled.\nHe saw a photo of Chen Yu Ying with the clown toy he saw today in the background.\nMaybe... when Chen Yu Ying sees this picture, she’ll think of me too?\nWang Yuezhi smiled sweetly.\nIsn’t this mutual affection? He and Chen Yu Ying really do hit it off well, people who don’t understand are in trouble.\nHe spent over ten minutes viewing the grid, then clicked the three dots again, chose to comment, typed, deleted, typed, deleted several large paragraphs, and finally entered two words: Looks great.\nYeah, succinct, funny without being ingratiating.\nSend.\nAfterwards, Wang Yuezhi was a little nervous and excited as he refreshed his social media, more tense than waiting for exam results.\nEvery time a \"1\" appears in his feed, it’s a test.\nWeChat, can’t you disable the mutual friend like notification? It’s so annoying!\nWang Yuezhi even waited for Lin Li’s like and comment.\nAnd that disgusting humanoid commented, \"That guy is really handsome, class rep can you get his WeChat for me, thanks ❤❤\"\nDisgusting, isn’t it?\nGreasy, narcissistic weirdo.\nStill no response, Wang Yuezhi felt restless, just tension left without excitement.\nFortunately, Chen Yu Ying hadn’t responded to Lin Li either, so it seemed she hadn’t seen the comments on her post.\n\"A notification\"\nFinally! It was a notification from Chen Yu Ying’s profile picture.\nTaking a deep breath, Wang Yuezhi opened it:\n\"Thank you!\"\nEven more enthusiastic than previous responses! Maybe this is a sign of progress in their relationship!\nScreenshot, save.\n\"Yeah—!!\" Wang Yuezhi cheered excitedly.\nZhuo Yongfei was startled by Wang Yuezhi who suddenly clenched his fist to encourage himself, what’s with this kid, jumping around like crazy, did he just succeed in an Olympic bid?\nWang Yuezhi calmed down, realizing he hadn’t won completely yet.\nHe kept refreshing his feed, and after three whole minutes, watched Chen Yu Ying respond to comments one by one, finally confirming one thing—she hadn’t responded to Lin Li’s nasty comment!\nNot only didn’t she respond, but Ding Sihan, as her best friend, even cursed Lin Li as \"disgustingly nauseating\" in the comments section.\nDefinitely Wang Yuezhi’s victory lap.\nwinwinwin!\nChen Yu Ying responded to Wang Yuezhi’s message but not Lin Li’s, that’s a win.\nWang Yuezhi one, Lin Li zero, that’s two wins.\nWang Yuezhi two, Lin Li zero, that’s three wins.\n\"...\"\nWang Yuezhi ninety-nine, Lin Li zero, that’s a hundred wins.\nA hundred victories, let alone a hundred wins? Unending victories, self-sustaining, infinite success.\nWhat does Lin Li have to compare with me? Wang Yuezhi felt like the First Emperor touching a power line—winning big time.\n...\n\"Chen Yu Ying: ’Business card sharing’\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: @Lin Li, hey, here’s the handsome guy’s WeChat you wanted.\"\n\"Lin Li: Thanks, class rep, but why can’t I add him?\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: I don’t know~ 😛\"\n\"Lin Li: I understand, kings don’t meet kings, two overly excellent people can only exist on their own timelines and cannot intersect, he and I are fated but not destined to meet, but I really envy you all for making such good friends.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: ’Little bear Thomas spinning kick’\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Hmph.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: I often see dogs biting their tails and spinning around back home, so you can intersect too, try harder. @Lin Li\"\n\"Lin Li: Ding Sihan, don’t go too far, I’ve endured you for a long time.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: So what?\"\n\"Lin Li: Adachi, friend, don’t overdo it, my prowess is well-known, you know my methods the best.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: What methods do you have?\"\n\"Lin Li: Hang myself at your doorway.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: 6\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu: ’Likes’ ’Likes’ ’Likes’ you really have a method.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: Go like both of our posts. @Lin Li.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Chapter 129: One Brother, A Lifetime Brother\nThis is an unprecedented victory since the start of this semester, after discovering the opponent Lin Li.\nWang Yuezhi, in great spirits, started scrolling through others’ WeChat moments.\nWith a quick refresh, he saw that Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu had also posted.\nWhether others liked it or not didn’t matter, but Ding Sihan, who helped him vent against Lin Li, absolutely deserved a like.\nAfter liking her post, Wang Yuezhi planned to study whether he could see a different version of Chen Yu Ying from their WeChat moments, but his eyes squinted.\nBoth Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu’s moments featured a nine-photo grid. The surrounding photos were different, but the middle image was the same for both.\nA group photo of three girls with a flower car.\nBut the problem was, the front of the flower car and the roadside doll’s head had been edited to show Lin Li’s face with a playful expression from his makeup at that time, and a big red ball was drawn on his nose in each one.\nEverything else was fine, but that red ball...\nDeeply stimulated Wang Yuezhi.\nThe image of Chen Yu Ying handing him a nose earlier that afternoon was still fresh in his mind.\nThe red nose... should belong exclusively to the bond between him and Chen Yu Ying.\nWhen he saw the red nose in his backpack, he would think of Chen Yu Ying.\nSo when Chen Yu Ying saw the red nose, she would think of him too.\nBut this edited image by Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu challenged the authority of his red nose.\nWhat should he do if Chen Yu Ying sees it later and thinks not only of him but also of Lin Li?\nThe crisis loomed over him. Never complacent in victory nor discouraged in defeat; now was not the time to open champagne.\nWang Yuezhi opened the comments but for a moment didn’t know what to type, his thoughtful brain quickly took charge:\n\"Rainy Day: Such malicious editing is not very nice.\"\n...\nAt this moment, Lin Li was standing in punishment in a corner of his room, surrounded by a dense crowd, and it was incredibly noisy.\nEveryone else was raising their glasses, laughing and chatting, some playing board games, others playing video games, and some eating.\nYet, he alone stood shaking against the hot ninety-degree corner—seriously, it was hot.\nJust as he ran to the door, Bai Bufan had already arrived with Wang Ze and others.\nTwo fists were no match for eighteen hands; he couldn’t win.\nThis group of brutes, in order to prevent him from studying, not only physically humiliated him, but almost took defeat CG shots.\nFortunately, he managed to hold onto some integrity.\nDespite that, to keep close watch, they shifted their fun to his room and wouldn’t let him leave, trapping him in the corner. Guards would occasionally check his phone screen.\nFirst confirming he wasn’t studying, then spitting on him.\nPoet’s grip.\nReally wish lightning could strike and kill this bunch of bastards.\nNow there’s truly no way to study, though luckily the [Strong Memory] ability had been used once already, and he had learned a lot of new knowledge today.\nThe core purpose of Lin Li’s insistence on studying is to ensure the cooldown of [Strong Memory] is always active.\nAfter all, the learning and memory efficiency during the 20-minute period of [Strong Memory] is over ten times normal, and wasting it would be such a shame.\nTomorrow morning when this group is asleep, finding twenty minutes to use it again, then he can wait to study when back home.\nAfter scrolling through moments, Lin Li chuckled.\n\"Lin Li: Don’t do to others what you don’t want done to yourself. Have you forgotten the teachings of the Master?\"\n\"Ding Sihan: You have a good relationship with Wang Yuezhi? How come you haven’t reacted, yet he’s so anxious? \"Image\"\"\nHuh?\nLin Li clicked again on Ding Sihan’s avatar, refreshed, and saw Wang Yuezhi’s comment.\nHonestly, Lin Li hadn’t expected Wang Yuezhi to actually speak up for him.\nCould it be that he really sees him as a buddy?\nWang Yuezhi’s magnanimity made Lin Li feel ashamed of himself.\nWang Yuezhi wasn’t just more courageous than him, he far surpassed him in temperament as well, and now his grades were better too. It’s like he’s Chen Rui eating peppercorns—completely lost.\nLin Li decided to extend the time of considering Wang Yuezhi a good brother.\nThe comments in the moments updated.\n\"Ding Sihan replied to Wang Yuezhi: I asked him, he didn’t mind.\"\n\"Bai Bufan replied to Wang Yuezhi: I was on-site, Lin Li really didn’t mind.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"You’re on your dam site, Bai Bufan, back then I didn’t see any dog poop by the roadside.\" Lin Li raised his head, expressing himself directly.\n\"I was right there, in your butt.\" Bai Bufan smiled.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis is like a self-destructive truck, harming the enemy eight hundred, harming oneself a thousand.\nCompared to Bai Bufan, Wang Yuezhi really is a good buddy.\n\"Lin Li replied to Ding Sihan: I have an issue.\"\n\"Comment has been deleted\"\n\"Lin Li replied to Bai Bufan: I have an issue!\"\n\"Comment has been deleted\"\n\"Lin Li replied to Wang Yuezhi: I have no issues.\"\n\"Ding Sihan liked your comment.\"\nDamn.\nTextual imprisonment is terrifying. People really can’t be without power.\nThinking of being kicked out of the group chat tonight too, Lin Li decided he must seize the power himself.\nCreate a new chat!\n\"Lin Li: 1\"\n\"Lin Li: Chatting in that group makes it hard to scroll through the photos taken today, let’s chat in this group.\"\n\"Ding Sihan has left the group chat.\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu has left the group chat.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: ...Still chatting?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Lin Li: Feels like private chat is better.\"\nWhat’s the point of a group chat with only two people?\nAnswer: When playing mini-program games that require sharing to group chats, you can post here.\nLin Li relied on pulling Bai Bufan in and then having him leave the chat, creating two groups that were just his own. Besides sharing purposes, they could serve as a memo.\nLin Li didn’t disband the chat, keeping it. The little chat with just him and the class leader was rather interesting and might come in handy one day.\nThe original group chat with Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu had already started barking at him.\nPeople who don’t gain public favor will quickly be overthrown even with brief power—Lin Li felt his political grade might improve.\nIsolated by the guys on one side, discriminated by the girls on the other side.\nWhy is life so difficult?\nOnly Wang Yuezhi seemed to offer a touch of genuine human kindness to him.\n\"Wang Yuezhi—\"\n...\n\"Lin Li—\"\nPerhaps it’s telepathy.\nWhen Lin Li called Wang Yuezhi’s name, Wang Yuezhi was doing the same, though his emotions were different:\n\"I am irreconcilable with you!!!\"\nUpon seeing Lin Li reply that he had no issues, Wang Yuezhi completely lost reason to intervene, snarling bitterly in hatred.\nZhuo Yongfei: \"?\"\nCollecting goods again?\n...\nThe next day.\n[For a month continuously before 5:00 AM, diligently practicing Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, accumulating at least half an hour before 7:00 AM (8/30)]\nLin Li still concluded his exercise at the usual place.\nThe Xiling Glow title was very useful, truly increasing his training efficiency by 50%.\nAnd in broad daylight, the righteous light was completely covered, not needing much caution.\nBecause he got up earlier today than yesterday, after waving to the freshly awakened Chen Yu Ying near the window, Lin Li returned to his dorm for a shower.\nAt this hour, breakfast was probably still steaming; Lin Li decided to use [Strong Memory] for studying first.\nLet’s defeat a hundred words first.\nOpening the study app, he put on his Bluetooth headphones and Lin Li immediately got into the zone.\ntadpole, noun, tadpole.\nHmm.\ntad (套) po (破) le (了),套破了,蝌蚪跑出来了.\ntadpole, tadpole.\nRemembered it.\nheritage, noun, heritage.\nHmm.\nhe (他) ri (日) ta (他) ge (哥), 为了争夺遗产, 他日了他哥.\nheritage, heritage.\nRemembered it.\n\"heritage~\"\nThis memory method completely missed the pronunciation. When Lin Li opened to hear it, he suddenly realized his Bluetooth wasn’t connected and frantically pressed the volume down button.\nHis actions were just like furtively playing with a phone during evening study when sound is made.\nTaking a deep breath, Lin Li turned his head.\nThe three who slept like dead pigs last night, including Chen Tianming, now raised their upper bodies, their previously sleepy eyes now glaring at Lin Li.\nThe [Strong Memory] was already active, allowing no rest.\n\"I’ll go help you get breakfast.\" Lin Li said calmly.\n\"Stop right there!\"\nAvoiding Bai Bufan who rushed forward intending to hug him, Lin Li dashed out the door.\nBai Bufan: \"Damn it, at least leave the door open! It’s cold so early!\"",

Luckily, after scanning the area, he didn’t notice any so-called pervert, even Wang Yuezhi was behaving.\nIt seemed that the alleged pervert was the class president’s imagination, a bit of paranoia, huh, turns out she’s also a little fairy.\nChen Yu Ying hadn’t fallen asleep either during the trip.\nWith such an arrogant pervert staring, how could she possibly sleep?\nWhen she saw Lin Li pretending to hold back laughter while looking around for a pervert, she almost slapped Lin Li in the face, but hesitated and refrained.\nIt’s not that she couldn’t bear to, but Chen Yu Ying feared Lin Li would enjoy it more.\n...\n\"Alright, everyone follow me, let’s take the cable car from this side up the mountain.\" After everyone got off the bus, Xue Jian led the way.\nThe plan for today’s autumn outing was to take the cable car up to Yunliu Mountain in Pingjiang in the morning, visit the geological museum on Yunliu Mountain in the morning, have a barbecue picnic at the outdoor base on the mountain for lunch, and start heading down around two or three in the afternoon. After coming down, they would pick up their luggage from the base and directly embark on the journey back to Xiling.\nThis way, they’d be back at school by around seven or eight, whether taking public transport home or being picked up by family, both options were viable through convenient scheduling.\n\"You get what you pay for, don’t you think the gate this morning was rather weak?\" Lin Li remarked casually, walking behind Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei.\nThe two of them shot him a cold glance.\nLin Li’s routine of getting up early to recite English deeply hurt them.\nIf he hadn’t switched to just playing on his phone after twenty minutes, and brought breakfast, the three of them might have had a falling out.\n\"Standard cable car cabins can seat ten people each, while the transparent bottom cabins can only seat six people, but they aren’t included in your package; it requires an additional payment of 20 yuan per person.\nThe whole trip takes about thirty minutes and will pause periodically, which is normal as long as it’s under a minute. No reason to panic, it’s actually a great opportunity for photos...\" After liaising with Xue Jian, the cable car staff began to explain to everyone.\n\"So what if it falls?\" Zhou Baowei asked, rubbing his chin as he watched the cables lifting the cable car upwards.\n\"A grand ceremony, budget a hundred—we’re willing to chip in fifty each,\" Lin Li immediately replied.\n\"Don’t presume to represent others. Last night, I said fifty on the premise I’d win two million. Now that I didn’t, I’ll only spare five bucks,\" Bai Bufan was immediately displeased.\n\"If you’re putting in five, then I’m only giving five too,\" Lin Li wasn’t willing to be shortchanged.\n\"Then I’m in for four.\"\n\"Three.\"\n\"...\"\nThe two started haggling.\nAnd it once again devolved into discussing ways to use their bodies, laying ground from yesterday.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nHe could finally see that Lin and Bai weren’t their real surnames; one should be Qiu and the other Gao, thoroughly pissed off.\n[The path to the summit, protected by predecessors’ arrays, brings no growth. Atop Yunliu’s peak, only a journey on solid ground can truly test. Should one aspire high, shortcuts are unnecessary.\nIf intending to reach the highest peak, why fear hardship? Today, why not tread the path yourself!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Two: Rely on yourself to reach the top of Yunliu.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption rate increased by 100%; Spirit Beast Affinity increased by 50%; System Currency*50.]\nJust as Lin Li followed the group to the cable car queue, the system popped up a new task.\nAs expected from you, little system, never making things easy.\nThe task was clear enough, just climb the mountain yourself.\nLin Li immediately took out his phone to look up some information, then let out a sigh of relief.\n──Yunliu Mountain is very low. For those who love mountain climbing, Yunliu doesn’t even count as a mountain; compared to the Five Great Mountains, it’s like their skin flake.\nThe ascent predominantly has gentle slopes, and most sections can even be driven upon, far from rugged.\nEasy to climb.\nAcceptable.\nOnce that was confirmed, the next urgent issue was.\nLin Li hooked his left arm around Bai Bufan’s neck and his right around Zhou Baowei’s, pulling their heads in front of him, then earnestly said:\n\"Baowei, Bufan, are you interested in skipping the cable car and walking up?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nZhou Baowei: \"Are you an idiot?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThe scolding was fast and crisp, clearly done without any thought, instinctively treating such a suggestion as idiotic.\n\"Are you an idiot?\" Zhou Baowei asked again, this time after giving it some thought.\nSecond trial upholds the original verdict.\nBaowei made a good point, but this was his task, Lin Li had no choice but to comply, so he persuaded:",

      "content": "Chapter 146: Chapter 130: Talk About Something Unknown_2\n\"Climbing... is a part of youth. Riding the cable car up the mountain is superficial, is restless. Only by putting our feet on the ground can we find true joy, and I’ve already checked; this mountain isn’t tall and easy to climb.\"\nLin Li indeed must bring along some others.\nIt’s not that brothers must suffer with him this time.\nIt’s because his actions clearly show he’s planning to act alone, which Zhou Baowei emphasized many times is strictly prohibited.\nIf only he himself told Zhou Baowei he planned to climb the mountain alone, there’s no need to think about it; Zhou Baowei would firmly refuse. Bringing someone along might earn his approval.\nIf a Cultivator gets a major demerit, how embarrassing would that be?\nCurrently, I don’t have the power to destroy the school. I need to endure.\nWait for the day when I can take down a school with a single slap; Nansang Middle School, just wait!\n\"Youth, what’s your password? Besides, the cable car fare is already included in the trip cost, and now we’re supposed to walk? Lin Li, listen to me, stop studying; you’re like this because all you think about is studying...\"\nZhou Baowei began to earnestly advise.\nGo against the heavens.\n\"Bao Wei, don’t you always say no one cares about you, everyone bullies you, and you’re so pitiful? Just follow us up the mountain, and I guarantee you’ll feel pain all over!\" Lin Li continued persuading.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Pain like this doesn’t interest me, I’m not going.\" Zhou Baowei shook his head, breaking free from Lin Li’s hand.\nHis eyes were determined, his mind made up.\nBao Wei was indeed a bit lazy. Otherwise, the density wouldn’t be so high, so Lin Li looked towards Bai Bufan.\n\"What Bao Wei said is exactly what I wanted to say.\" Bai Bufan nodded with a smile.\n\"Bufan, I originally planned to do twenty sets of exam papers on the way back, but if you go with me, I won’t do them.\" Lin Li took a deep breath and said.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn.\nIs this kind of threat?\n\"From now on, during any outings, you’re not allowed to study in front of me, and you’re responsible for carrying my backpack during the trip.\" After a moment of thought, Bai Bufan squinted and said slowly.\n\"Alright,\" Lin Li clenched his teeth and nodded.\nThe two exchanged a glance, reaching out their right hands instinctively, but unfortunately, they didn’t trigger a perfect black flash handshake.\n\"Trust me with your life, Bufan!\"\n\"Please take care in the future!\"\n...\n\"No way.\"\nThe bride and groom were ready, but a third party appeared.\nAfter hearing Lin Li’s plan, Zhou Baowei shook his head decisively.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nJust as Zhou Baowei called him an idiot for wanting to climb, Zhou Baowei refused him without a second’s hesitation.\nIs it already a subconscious judgment?\n\"Teacher, I’m not alone...\"\n\"I know about this.\" Zhou Baowei nodded.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"No, teacher, what I mean is, I’m not planning to climb alone; I’m bringing Bai...\"\n\"Even worse.\"\nBefore he finished saying the name, he was refused again, and it even came with an extra emphasis.\nSo Bai Bufan is still a penalty point?\nThis useless thing.\nSh*t, I should have asked him, should have asked Wang Ze and the others.\nBut Lin Li somewhat understood why Zhou Baowei had such an attitude, so he immediately explained, \"Teacher, I’ve checked; there’s no massage parlor or foot spa on the mountain. We really won’t go to those kinds of places this time. I just want to feel my youth! The weather is so nice today...\"\n\"No.\" Zhou Baowei remained expressionless.\nLin Li really checked this information?!\nThat makes it more impossible to let him and Bai Bufan act together.\nZhou Baowei is actually not worried about Lin Li and Bai Bufan getting into trouble; he’s more concerned about these two derivative beings causing trouble.\nThey won’t shame themselves, but they’ll bring shame upon themselves.\n\"It seems no choice left, let’s take the cable car, but this is due to resistance, and our agreement still stands.\" Bai Bufan was quite happy, speaking cheerfully, without anger upon hearing this.\nLin Li sighed.\nIf today’s task isn’t completed, he’ll have to climb Yunliu Mountain alone in Pingjiang in the future, which would be too troublesome.\nNo choice but this... Lin Li immediately used Thunder Technique.\n——Not the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, but using his phone to summon someone.\n\"Lin Li: @Chen Yu Ying Class leader class leader urgent urgent urgent——\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: What’s up?\"\n\"Lin Li: Don’t take the cable car, I’m coming to talk to you about something!\"\nLin Li soon arrived in front of Chen Yu Ying, who was about to board the cable car.\n\"Class leader, one cannot have both youth and the appreciation for youth at the same time. We absolutely cannot waste our youth now!\"\nLin Li instinctively wanted to place his hand on Chen Yu Ying’s shoulder, but because it was a one-shoulder, completely exposing her shoulder, with only two transparent thin straps, placing his hand seemed inappropriate, so after hesitating, he switched to grabbing her arm.\nIn a corner, Wang Yuezhi’s myocardial infarction cleared then clogged again and again; Lin Li clutched not Chen Yu Ying’s arm, but his coronary artery.\n\"Speak human words, please.\" Ding Sihan impatiently spoke from the side.\nYou mouthy thing.\nLin Li glared at Ding Sihan, then began to explain to Chen Yu Ying:\n\"The human words are this: The scenery of Yunliu Mountain is indeed good, but not only at the top. Riding the cable car feels lacking, so Bai Bufan and I decided to walk up. But our characters, in Old Jian’s eyes, have just a tiny bit of misunderstanding.\nIn short, he’s unwilling to trust us, so I sincerely invite the class leader to climb with us. With you, Old Jian will definitely be reassured and let us go.\nHow about it, don’t worry, you won’t get tired. Unnecessary stuff can be carried by other classmates using the cable car. I’ll handle the water and other essentials we need to carry on the way; the mountain isn’t high, the trail isn’t steep. This is the real autumn outing!\"\n\"Uh...\" Hearing such a request, it’s almost impossible to give a quick response. Before answering, Chen Yu Ying asked curiously, \"Lin Li, when asked before, didn’t you say that even this mountain is quite boring to climb?\"\nWhen formulating the autumn outing plan, Chen Yu Ying often asked Lin Li’s opinion at noon.\n\"... I was really acting cool before.\" Lin Li could only smile awkwardly.\nHis master hadn’t given tasks before; what could he do?\n\"Then I’ll consider it...\" Chen Yu Ying pursed her lips, showing a thoughtful expression.\n\"Class leader, please. If you agree, I’ll never act openly perverted again; I’ll be as discreet as possible when looking at your legs!\" Seeing her hesitation, Lin Li promptly upped the ante.\nThen he cherished the open time, took a few more looks.\nIf he doesn’t look now, he’ll have to sneak peeks in the future.\nThen he sneakily took another glance, getting ahead.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"Thanks, but you can stay open.\"\n\"So did you agree?\" Lin Li asked eagerly.\n\"Not yet...\"\n\"Class leader, if you don’t agree, I’ll have to beg you!\" Lin Li, hearing this, resorted to his trump card.\nChen Yu Ying retreated a step, interlocking her hands behind, holding her dress tightly to prevent Lin Li from pulling her hem ’begging’ like at noon.\n\"Si Han, Wanqiu, are you going?\" Facing Lin Li’s ’aggressive approach,’ Chen Yu Ying turned to her two friends beside her.\nFor herself, it’s actually fine, but if it’s only her alone, Chen Yu Ying would feel embarrassed and it might spread more bizarre versions of the story.\nSo she wanted to bring along companions.\n\"I’m not going; climbing is the most annoying.\" Qu Wanqiu stuck to the path of a lazy person, refusing firmly.\n\"Me? Tsk tsk, Lin Li, why don’t you call me mom?\" Ding Sihan was smug.\n\"Mom! Please!\"\nCalling mom and that’s it. How hard can it be? Lin Li didn’t hesitate; if Ding Sihan wanted, he’d call her great-grandma.\n\"Hey~\"\n\"Yu Ying, let’s go. He’ll carry our stuff, and the geological museum sounds boring. Why not take pictures along the way?\"\nDing Sihan, satisfied, nodded at Chen Yu Ying.\nArigato, Nanny Goat-san.\nIf there weren’t so many people now, Lin Li would really want to kneel to Ding Sihan.\n\"Okay, let’s talk to Teacher Xue about it.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.",

As soon as Lin Li pulled Chen Yu Ying over, he immediately put on a much gentler smile.\n\"Yes, Teacher,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, \"Lin Li just calculated that even if we walk very slowly, we’ll definitely reach the outdoor base before noon, so we can meet up with you all by then. We’ll only miss the museum.\nIn fact, I considered hiking up the mountain earlier while planning, but everyone might not have accepted it, so I planned for the cable car instead.\"\n\"Alright. But you must ensure safety; just focus on the hike and don’t let any other incidents happen, like visiting other attractions on the way.\nIf we don’t see you by noon, you both will have to handwrite at least a 2000-word review. If it’s serious, I won’t show mercy—I’ll report it to the school for a demerit.\"\nXue Jian was addressing Chen Yu Ying at first, but the last sentence immediately turned towards Lin Li.\nThe smiling face turned serious at lightning speed.\nThinking about it makes one laugh.\nBut Lin Li nodded honestly.\n\"Okay, Yu Ying, you have the teacher’s number anyway, so keep your ringtone on. If the two of them cause any trouble, just call me.\"\n\"Okay, thank you, Teacher, for the trouble.\"\n\"It’s nothing. Hiking is good; it’s indeed more meaningful than taking the cable car. I loved hiking when I was younger. If it weren’t for needing to lead everyone at the museum, I might have joined you,\" Xue Jian waved his hand.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan stood to the side, looking at their noses and hearts, obediently standing in punishment.\nThat’s not what he had just said to the two of them.\nThough they wanted to complain, they knew speaking up now would mean getting scolded, so they chose to stay silent.\n\"Lin Li, I’m suddenly kind of supporting you to study harder. When can you also enjoy such privileges so I can bask in some glory?\"\nAfter Xue Jian left, Bai Bufan clicked his tongue and said.\n\"Like the class leader treatment? Then I’d need the class leader’s face and her voice. Didn’t you see Xue Jian’s gaze? Like looking at his own daughter. Looking at us, it’s like looking at rebellious kids, not even his biological ones,\" Lin Li showed a lot of self-awareness.\n\"Indeed, Xue Jian is like our stepfather—big and fierce.\" Bai Bufan nodded in agreement.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDamn.\nAlthough Bai Bufan did it on purpose, Lin Li now deeply understood why stepmom is called stepmom, and not stepmother.\nAfter all, it’s really not fair for stepfathers.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan handed some things that wouldn’t be needed on the hike to Qu Wanqiu, for her to take up by cable car. Lin Li and Bai Bufan hadn’t brought much originally.\nHowever, Lin Li gave his power bank to Zhou Baowei, deciding to use Bai Bufan’s if needed on the way.\nLighter by one brick at least.\n\"Let’s go, let’s hike,\" Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan soon returned.\n\"Give me the bag.\" Lin Li honored his agreement, reaching out to the two.\n\"It’s okay, I can carry it myself.\" Chen Yu Ying remained very gentle and considerate.\nDing Sihan was equivalent to one-tenth of a Bai Bufan, unceremoniously taking off her sling bag and handing it to Lin Li, while persuading Chen Yu Ying, \"Ying Bao, no need to be polite. It’s what a servant like him should do. Xiaolinzi, catch this.\"\n\"Got it—Ding Sihan might be shameless, but she’s not wrong this time.\" Lin Li smiled as he took Ding Sihan’s sling bag, \"Class leader, give it to me. If you sweat later, I’ll feel guilty. This weight is nothing to me.\"\nGirls do tend to bring a bit more, and with most carrying power banks and water, the backpack can’t possibly be lightweight.\nNo matter how cool a summer morning is, it’s still summer.\n\"Alright~ thank you then.\" Chen Yu Ying, not overly formal, smiled and handed her bag to him after seeing Lin Li insist.\n\"Lin Li, mine—take it,\" Bai Bufan, who was squatting by the roadside, got up and said in a commanding tone.\nThis useless one even dared to act arrogantly.\nHowever, considering he had indeed promised, Lin Li still reached out and took it.\n\"Damn, what the hell did you pack? Why is it so heavy?\" Because the actual weight was way off from expected, Lin Li almost got toppled by the swaying backpack.\nNo wonder Bai Bufan handed it over with both hands.\n\"Nothing much, just essentials for the road.\" Bai Bufan seemed a bit innocent.\nLin Li wouldn’t rummage through a girl’s bag, but Bai Bufan didn’t have much human rights here.\nLin Li directly opened Bai Bufan’s backpack.\nAnd then he laughed in frustration.\nDamn it.\nThe backpack was loaded with pebble stones.\nLin Li glanced at the roadside spot where Bai Bufan had been squatting. A part of the stone pile was missing, likely the ones he had just picked up.\n\"Bai Bufan, explain to me, what’s with this Patrick Star behavior? How are these stones road essentials?\" Lin Li said with a cold smile.\n\"Lin Li, didn’t you have a childhood? Haven’t you heard of the fairy tale ’Hansel and Gretel’? The brother and sister threw stones on the road to find their way back after being abandoned. So if we drop stones along the way, we can find our way home in case we get lost, preventing Old Jian from worrying.\nIsn’t this method more reliable than those unreliable maps? And I heard there’s a delicacy called ’ledge stones,’ so this becomes a precious ingredient. If we don’t get lost, I’ll make it for you at the barbecue later!\"\nBai Bufan spoke with such conviction—offering not just one but multiple reasons.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nAfter a moment of silence, Lin Li laughed heartily.\nEveryone, now you know why Lin Li could only call Ding Sihan one-tenth of a Bai Bufan for her shameless antics, right?\nThere’s a chasm between the two.\n\"Lin Li, return my bag for a moment, I forgot to put something in.\" Lin Li turned, only to see Ding Sihan holding a big stone, seriously asking him.\nDamn it.\nUnderestimated Ding Sihan.\nAt least half a Bai Bufan.\nAnd with much room for growth.\n\"Damn!!\"\nSomeone roared while others laughed.\nThe joy of the three was built on Lin Li’s misery.\n\"Haven’t seen Lin Li so anxious in a long time, feels great!\" Bai Bufan was the happiest he’d ever been.\nBeside him, Ding Sihan raised her hand toward Bai Bufan.\nAs they were about to high-five, Bai Bufan suddenly pulled his hand back, causing Ding Sihan to stumble.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nBoys who get along well with Lin Li are indeed no good either.\nFaced with Ding Sihan’s resentful gaze, Bai Bufan awkwardly explained, \"Sorry, I don’t stammer when speaking anymore, but I still have some fear of interacting with girls my age...\"\nThen Bai Bufan sighed.\n\"Bufan, are you fantasizing a bit?\" Lin Li suddenly laughed as he looked at Bai Bufan.\n\"Huh? Just for a high-five, you’re already naming the kid and planning their education?\" Ding Sihan asked warily.\nBai Bufan got nervous, \"Don’t slander me! I’m not fantasizing.\"\n\"Really not fantasizing?\" Lin Li’s smile became even more mischievous.\n\"I just...\" Bai Bufan hesitated for a moment.\nWas Lin Li talking about fantasizing... or about fantasizing about Feifei?\n\"Maybe... maybe a bit of fantasizing?\" As a follower of the Fei Sect, Bai Bufan couldn’t hold it back, scratching his head awkwardly and finally smiling.\nIf Dr. Fei continued the therapy, maybe he wouldn’t be so fearful of interacting with girls his age?\nThank you Lin Li, for affirming the creed of the Fei Sect.\nTo enter the Fei Sect, one must fantasize!\n\"Human nature,\" Lin Li also smiled and nodded.\nDing Sihan looked at the two boys whose smiles were becoming strange, full of question marks.\nWhat was going on?",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Chapter 132: It is the Holy Sword, the baton, and it can also be the magic wand\nAs a trendsetter on the fashion forefront, Lin Li offered Bai Bufan some valuable advice about his outfit:\nThe pebbles in the bag are quite fitting in style to pair with Bai Bufan’s head. Add a touch of fresh blood, and Bai Bufan could become the fashion god of the new era.\nAfter listening to Lin Li’s advice, Bai Bufan finally gave up on carrying pebbles in his bag.\nThe four of them walked up the mountain path, the slope wasn’t tiring at all.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan walked in front, while Lin Li and Bai Bufan followed behind.\nWalking behind made it convenient for Lin Li to openly stare at the four legs of the two girls.\nChen Yu Ying’s legs were long and fair, with the hem of her light blue skirt gently fluttering with her steps, highlighting the smooth and soft lines. Her brisk and lively steps brought vibrancy to the road.\nDing Sihan, too, had two legs.\nAs the breeze brushed by, the girl’s skirt danced — specifically referring to Chen Yu Ying.\nLin Li immediately covered Bai Bufan’s eyes, the fact that Bai Bufan nearly stumbled wasn’t important.\nPerfectly fair thighs, not so perfect light-colored safety shorts.\nNo wonder Chen Yu Ying stayed so calm when the wind blew, he’d thought there might be a chance to see the class monitor pull a classic Marilyn Monroe move.\nBut it’s just as well; without the safety shorts, Lin Li would have been troubled instead.\n\"I almost fell to my death, Lin Li!\" After steadying himself, he struggled free of Lin Li’s hand. If there weren’t girls present, Bai Bufan would have started a virtual family tree of Lin Li to roast him.\n\"Well, you were really careless.\" Lin Li replied nonchalantly, his gaze focused.\nIf not for the crowd, Lin Li would have loved to bow to the heavens, asking for the morning wind to blow even stronger.\n\"The stronger the wind, the wilder my heart~~\" Lin Li sang with emotion.\nLin Li realized that when Su Yunying wrote \"Wild Child,\" she must have been secretly watching other girls’ legs too. Tsk tsk, so this is the kind of person you are, Lao Su.\n\"Class monitor, I report! Lin Li is secretly watching your legs,\" Bai Bufan loudly announced to the front.\n\"He’s slandering me; I’m doing it openly,\" Lin Li naturally defended himself.\nChen Yu Ying heard this, turned her head while walking, and matched Lin Li’s innocent gaze, then glared at him when she saw he was still singing about the stronger wind.\nThey kept walking.\nIt’s over.\nBai Bufan widened his eyes, turned to Lin Li: \"Why no reaction?\"\n\"Didn’t she just glare at me? Isn’t that a reaction?\"\n\"That’s a reward, isn’t it! How many times have you watched the class monitor’s legs for her to be this indifferent?\"\nLin Li didn’t answer but made a strange gesture towards Bai Bufan with his hand.\nIt looked like a rock’s metal sign, but with the ring finger and thumb also extended — only the middle finger was pressed down.\n\"What does this mean?\" Bai Bufan failed at reading comprehension.\n\"I’ve never given someone the middle finger, always.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nNo wonder Chen Yu Ying was too numb to bother saying anything about Lin Li.\n\"The class monitor has gotten used to someone like you, losing sensitivity and caution towards perverts. It’s not a good thing,\" Bai Bufan said sorrowfully.\n\"This world doesn’t belong to the post-2000s, nor the post-2010s, but to those of us with thick skin!\" Lin Li was proud, raising both hands ’loudly whispering’.\n\"Can’t argue, you’re really something. At this age you’ve become the second-in-command in both math and English,\" Bai Bufan genuinely gave a thumbs-up.\n\"Hey— you kid, starting to envy the excellent me now... wait a minute, are you calling me a 2B?\" Lin Li began smugly but swiftly turned his tone into a rapid statement, forehead leaning against Bai Bufan’s.\nThe two girls ahead heard the conversation behind them, first astonished, then both laughed.\nLin Li didn’t even have to say anything for them to realize.\nSecond-in-command in math and English combined turns out to be a 2B.\nBoys’ attacks are stronger, Ding Sihan straight-up said she learned something.\n\"Forget about 2B for now, Bufan, emergency situation! Look quickly!\" Yu Guang picked up key information, Lin Li suddenly lowered his voice and said.\n\"What?\" Bai Bufan immediately went on alert.\n\"Look over there!\"\n\"Oh crap! Go go go, hurry over!\" Bai Bufan noticed too, and the two of them started jogging over.\nSeeing the two boys suddenly rush in front of them, Ding Sihan looked confused.\n\"What are they doing?\"\n\"Probably saw another beauty,\"\nThe night before at the restaurant entrance, having experienced what boys termed an emergency, Chen Yu Ying said somewhat helplessly.\nAt that moment, there indeed was a woman walking down from the mountain ahead.\n\"I know they do this kind of thing, Wang Ze often acts up like this, but this time they didn’t even pay attention to that woman, why are they climbing up the mountain?\" Ding Sihan denied.\nChen Yu Ying: \"Huh?\"\nFollowing Ding Sihan’s gaze, she saw Lin Li and Bai Bufan hadn’t glanced at the woman once, and had already climbed off the vehicle path onto the mountain rocks.\n\"Lin Li, what are you doing, be careful.\" Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan approached them, Chen Yu Ying spoke with some confusion and concern.\n\"Got it! Bufan, retreat!\"\nLin Li and Bai Bufan finally climbed down from the rocks, reaching Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying’s side. Their clothes were stained with some dust from their antics, and their spoils were one stick each.",

      "content": "Chapter 149: Chapter 132: It is the Holy Sword, the baton, and it can also be the magic wand_2\nAll this just for this?\nLin Li ran his finger along the stick and shared with Chen Yu Ying, \"Class Rep, check out my Holy Sword, isn’t it cool?\"\nClearly, that’s exactly what it was for.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Your Holy Sword isn’t as long as mine! Inferior quality!\" Bai Bufan sneered before Chen Yu Ying could respond.\n\"Nonsense, your cheap stick isn’t even straight. Now that’s truly inferior! Straightness is the real essence!\"\n\"Arguing is meaningless, let’s duel!\"\n\"Ha!\"\n\"So, what’s the point of this?\" Ding Sihan asked, echoing Chen Yu Ying’s confusion.\n\"You can duel with it.\" Lin Li, already sparring with Bai Bufan, explained.\n\"...Childish. You two don’t still buy plastic toy swords at the convenience store, do you?\" Ding Sihan quipped after confirming the simplicity of it.\n\"No, no, no, you’re missing the point. Man-made ones are worthless, but naturally formed ones are worthy of a second glance.\"\nLin Li spun the stick in a flair, explaining with a master’s air.\nThen he got ambushed by Bai Bufan’s stick on his rear.\nA master can’t beat a trickster.\n\"If any guy sees it and doesn’t pick it up, he must have kicked the habit.\" After retaliating, Lin Li continued explaining.\n\"It’s just that I’m older now. If I found one before I turned ten, not a single wildflower or grass by the roadside on the way home would remain unscathed; they’d all meet their doom!\"\nActually, Lin Li had another small goal: to see if he could trigger a system task. Maybe the system would regard it as some kind of treasure.\nBut his rare initiative led to an utter defeat, damn it!\n—Not a single reaction.\n\"More important than legs?\" Ding Sihan inquired.\n\"First, are we talking about the Class Rep’s legs? Secondly, if it’s not her legs, then what are they like? Are they as straight as the Holy Sword? Long? White...\"\nIt was a serious matter, not to be answered impulsively, and Lin Li immediately verified cautiously.\nAs he pondered, Lin Li grew slightly wistful and softly mused:\n\"Sigh, my pre-ten-year-old self probably wouldn’t hesitate on this issue and would stand firmly by the Holy Sword, right?\"\n\"Growing up really is a sad affair...\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"Don’t get all sentimental over something so absurd!? It’s not about growing up, it’s your problem!\"\n...\nNo answer was reached between the Holy Sword and the legs.\nThe four of them continued to walk, but occasionally, the sound of sticks cutting through the air would come from behind Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan.\nAnd they started to believe Lin Li, because every now and then, the boys, young men, and men coming up and down the mountain would glance back at them, and even a man in his early twenties asked Lin Li where he found it, as he wanted to find one too.\nOne could only say that the thinking of boys was incomprehensible to them.\n\"TGA is such a silly award show.\" Suddenly, the stick stopped and Bai Bufan, looking at his phone, said, \"It’s hilarious.\"\n\"How so? What’s so funny about it?\" Lin Li turned curiously, not having followed such things.\n\"The annual award went to a little robot.\"\n\"Which little robot?\" Lin Li was even more confused.\nBai Bufan approvingly nodded, \"That’s the joke.\"\nLin Li thought for a moment and then understood, \"SEER got an award without a sound; this guy is really inconspicuous.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nThen Bai Bufan explained to Lin Li.\n\"CS2 is highly likely to be the Shooter of the Year\"\n\"Valorant also has a chance\"\n\"Could it be Delta?\"\n\"Wow, Forbidden Comic Heaven!\"\nLin Li now truly understood.\nSuspecting he had wilder ideas than Bai Bufan regarding history.\n\"There’s a temple here too.\" While both critiquing, Lin Li noticed a fork in the road leading to a temple entrance, prompting his comment.\n\"Yeah, I heard it’s quite famous and spiritually significant. Initially, there were thoughts of including it in our route since it wouldn’t take much time. But Teacher Xue said it involves feudal superstition, and official school trips should avoid contentious sites, so it was excluded.\" Chen Yu Ying explained.\n\"I remember there’s a viewing platform here... There it is, you get a fantastic view of Yunliu Mountain from there.\" Chen Yu Ying pointed out the platform with reinforced railings in the distance.\n\"Quite a big platform.\" Ding Sihan glanced at it and sighed.\nLin Li looked at the two and then smiled, \"Come on, let’s go see. Since there’s a viewing platform, I’d like to take some photos.\"\n\"But we promised the teacher...\" Chen Yu Ying hesitated upon hearing this.\nLin Li immediately interrupted her, \"It’s not a scenic spot, and we’re just taking photos for a few minutes. Think of it as resting since we’re tired, wouldn’t that be reasonable? Don’t worry, if the sky collapses, we’ll offer up Bai Bufan. He’s behind it all.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nNever mind, no use arguing with Lin Li.\nBai Bufan figured his image in Xue Jian’s eyes should be better than Lin Li’s. Once offered up, Lin Li wouldn’t get away.\n\"Lin Li makes sense. When it comes to writing reflections, it’ll be the two of them handling that anyway. Ying Bao, let’s take a few photos; I brought a Polaroid, too. Perfect opportunity.\" Ding Sihan eagerly suggested.\n\"...Alright.\" Chen Yu Ying checked the time on her phone, considered for a moment, then smiled and nodded.\nAt that time, the observation deck wasn’t crowded.\n\"Lin Li, hand me my phone.\" Chen Yu Ying reached out to Lin Li.\nPretty dresses rarely come with pockets, so Chen Yu Ying’s phone was kept in Lin Li’s bag, which might be one of the downsides of dressing nicely.\nLin Li opened Chen Yu Ying’s bag and handed her the phone.\nUpon a quick peek, there weren’t many items—water, mirror, lip glaze, earphones, portable charger, USB cable, tissues, and a pack of sanitary pads.\nBut she probably wasn’t on her period, otherwise, this attire wouldn’t be fitting—most likely a precautionary measure to keep them handy.\nSeeming to only realize her personal items’ presence, Chen Yu Ying blushed a little.\nWith the phone acquired.\nThey photographed the landscape and themselves, while Lin Li watched the scenery and them.\n\"Didn’t you say you wanted to take pictures? Why aren’t you taking any yourself? Just taking photos of them?\"\nBai Bufan nudged Lin Li’s behind with his knee, curious, while holding his phone.\nLin Li hardly took any pictures.\n\"I’m not someone who posts on social media, don’t have much attachment to photos. It’s just that I noticed those two wanted to take some but felt it wasn’t right to say it. So, I proposed it, giving them an excuse.\" Lin Li chuckled as he replied, ensuring that the two weren’t paying attention to him.\nBai Bufan widened his eyes at this.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"No way, you’re so sensitive?\"\n\"If you channeled this level of detail into our matches, our win rate would go up ten percent!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Even without you supporting me, my win rate could go up ten percent.\" Lin Li calmly replied.\nDetails are mine and not ours.\nThat’s also part of the detail.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"No, Lin Li, you’re really getting way too considerate, like after me now?\" Bai Bufan teased Lin Li, but the more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became, and in a yin-yang change of tone he said, \"Damn it, I give you so many hints and signals, how come you never pick up on those?\"\n\"I do pick up on them, just can’t be bothered.\" Lin Li casually answered, \"Like how you actually want me to take some pictures of you now, I noticed, but I acted oblivious.\"\nBai Bufan was taken aback.\n\"You, you, you... damn it!!\"\nPointing at Lin Li and finding himself at a loss for words, Bai Bufan resorted to joking with a \"damn\", expressing all his feelings.\nToo sincere, this critical hit to Bai Bufan was extremely powerful.\nDefense shattered, rage triggered.\n\"Alright, alright, I’ll take your photo.\" Noticing the piercing gaze of Bai Bufan, Lin Li amusingly took his phone.\n\"Fine, can’t hold this against you. Thanks! As long as you take my photo, Bao Wei will do anything.\" Bai Bufan instantly lightened up, readying himself, then asked, \"Where’s the best spot for a photo?\"\nHaving observed Lin Li’s photo-taking with Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, Bai Bufan had faith in Lin Li’s skills.\nStanding firm, Lin Li professionally assessed the lighting and composition, then directed:\n\"Step back a bit, um, better lighting there, move a bit to the left, yes, yes.\nHit the back railing, huh? Climb over it, stand on the outside, and then let go and lean back. Yes, yes, keep going, huh? Bufan, flip over. Come on, I’m ready to shoot.\"\nBai Bufan, with one foot raised: \"...\"\nYou damn...",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Chapter 133: This little fish cares, this little fish also cares\n\"Are you damn directing me to take photos or to commit suicide?\" Bai Bufan gritted his teeth.\nIf I die like this, even Conan couldn’t find the killer. Who says there’s no perfect crime?\n\"You’re just being clueless. I fake play with monitor Ding Sihan and the others, so the photos are all fake, just tourist snaps with zero artistic sense.\nBut what relationship do we have? I’m planning to take you a ’Flying Bai Bufan’, something to submit for this year’s Pulitzer Prize. Trust me, buddy, jump over, come on, would I ever harm you?\"\nLin Li frowned, not liking this feeling of distrust, and then added:\n\"By the way, your mobile payment password hasn’t changed, right? If it has, let me know, it’s quite important.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Bro, pretend play with me too, I want tourist photos, no art.\" Bai Bufan pleaded.\nSo vulgar, no aspiration.\nLin Li was disappointed that his desk mate and brother was such a person, but since Bai Bufan insisted, he had to give up.\nBai Bufan didn’t really care much for the photos; he just wanted a record and figured he wouldn’t post them on social media.\nIn no time, the four of them took a final group photo, then picked up the Holy Sword and resumed climbing.\nThey hadn’t walked far when Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan gasped lightly and moved to the roadside.\nTurns out there was an orange cat, a super fat one, semi-trailer level, not sure if it had full insurance.\nCompletely unafraid of strangers, it meowed twice when it saw the two approaching.\nDead clip, not as nice-sounding as their own purring — Lin Li.\nThe orange cat had a collar, probably free-range from the temple, fattened up by passing tourists.\nAt present, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan were discussing whether to buy a hot dog from a nearby shop while taking photos.\nSuggested a thorough investigation of the orange cat, suspected ties with the shop’s madam, maybe interests collusion.\nSeeing such a fat orange cat, Lin Li somewhat regretted Zhou Baowei not being here; otherwise, he could have had eighteen ways to tease him.\nHe turned to look at Bai Bufan, who coincidentally also looked at him.\n\"Missing Baowei.\" they spoke in unison.\nThen the two of them laughed warmly.\n...\nZhou Baowei, already at the mountaintop museum, sneezed, suspecting some idiot was cursing him.\nHe glanced down and found \"Miss you\" messages from both Lin Li and Bai Bufan, smirked coldly.\n\"It’s these two bastards, of course.\"\nSo he replied with straight-up swearing.\n...\n\"Lin Li, could you help buy a hot dog? I’ll transfer the money to you later,\" Chen Yu Ying asked, looking up.\n\"Of course.\" Lin Li had no objection, bought one and handed it to her, then stood aside to watch them feed the cat.\nAfter feeding, they petted the cat for a while before reluctantly leaving.\n\"Sorry for keeping you both waiting,\" Chen Yu Ying said.\nNot bad, the monitor didn’t apologize this time, progress made.\n\"No problem, Bai Bufan and I also love small animals,\" Lin Li waved it off casually.\n\"Yeah, every meal has to have one. Last time I saw a super cute rabbit, saved half a kilo right away,\" Bai Bufan nodded and interjected even before Chen Yu Ying could ask.\n\"Only half a kilo? You call that loving small animals? I at least save half a rabbit,\" Lin Li expressed disdain.\n\"Too expensive, a kilo is 500 grams in our place, can’t save more,\" Bai Bufan shook his head.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nTheir conversation made 1.3 billion small animals cry.\nIt also blocked all that Chen Yu Ying was about to say.\nYou guys...\n\"I forbid you from calling this loving small animals!\" Ding Sihan huffed in anger.\n\"Xiaodingding, only when you eat them do you keep them close to your heart. Your love is superficial, ours is heartfelt, so ours is the real love, real ’love’!\" Lin Li argued justifiably.\n\"You, you—\"\nUnable to win against Lin Li, Ding Sihan tried to snatch the Holy Sword from his hand, seemingly wanting to use Lin Li’s weapon to kill him.\nBut how can a warrior lose their gun? Lin Li not only held it steadily, but also drew it backhand and playfully hit Ding Sihan, though he did pull back.\nDing Sihan is really an M, pursuing him after just a bit of teasing; seems she really loves small animals, extending it to a love for boys who love small animals too.\nBut Lin Li thought he wasn’t a frivolous person, wouldn’t agree just because any girl chases him.\nNeed to test Ding Sihan’s sincerity properly.\nLook, just 30 seconds into the chase, Ding Sihan stopped.\nLin Li later planned to post a Zhihu question, \"Why do some girls stop chasing midway, is love so fragile?\"\n\"Lin Li, you stop right there!\" Ding Sihan panted heavily.\n\"Ding Sihan, keep at it, catch me and I’ll give you a ’caught you’ party!\" At that moment, Lin Li ran while laughing wickedly.\nDing Sihan gritted her teeth and gave up the chase.\nNo longer the weak chicken Lin Li from last semester, really couldn’t catch up at all.\nSo Ding Sihan used her gaze as a knife, ’killed’ Lin Li a hundred times.\n\"Just don’t come back if you dare!\"\nLin Li, naturally, wasn’t so bored to keep distance from the three of them, he leisurely returned to the group and let Ding Sihan hit him once.\nLin Li explained again: \"It was just a joke.\"\n\"Hehe, exactly, small animals are so...\" Ding Sihan is quite easy to amuse, and hearing this, he showed a smile.\n\"At the end of the month, Bufan and I are firm vegetarians, without any small animals at every meal. Saying there’s something at every meal is purely to decorate the Xiaomian, and pretend a bit. Sorry.\" Before Ding Sihan could finish, Lin Li apologized.\nHearing this, Bai Bufan nodded solemnly, bowed at ninety degrees apologetically, looking just like a Shiba Inu.\nThe half-smiling Ding Sihan: \"...\"\n\"I’m not allowing—\"\nSeeing that Ding Sihan wanted to use his stick on himself again, Lin Li coldly laughed: \"Later, don’t eat, Ding Sihan. I’ll be watching you at lunch, you’d better not covet the small animals!\"\nThe stick quickly behaved itself in his hand.\n\"... What’s done is done.\"\nThe four continued to leisurely walk up the mountain, and without realizing it, they had covered most of the way. The sun was gradually moving towards the center of the sky.\nHiking wasn’t all that tiring, even though Lin Li was carrying the weight for four people. He thought to himself.\nOf course, maybe it had something to do with who he was hiking with.\nPretty girls, steadfast brothers, people.\nThis setup is just perfect.\n\"Lin Li, we have a situation!\" Bai Bufan spoke up once more.\n\"What’s the situation!\" Lin Li immediately became alert.\n\"Persimmon tree, what do you say?\" Bai Bufan pointed ahead. They saw a wild persimmon tree that seemed to be growing by the mountainside, hanging with many orange persimmons, the color quite enticing.\n\"Let’s go!\"\nAfter a brief exchange, the two jogged over.\nAfter confirming it indeed was a wild persimmon tree and not a planted one, the two started jumping around under the tree with their Holy Sword, while Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan watched from the side.\n\"Too high, you guys won’t reach them.\" Chen Yu Ying laughed and said.\nAlthough the persimmon tree was on the mountainside, it was still too high off the ground. Lin Li could only hit the lowest branch when he jumped up, far from reaching the fruits higher up.\nBai Bufan couldn’t do any better.\nClimbing the tree was too dangerous, but Lin Li always had his ways.\n\"It’s time for the persimmon tree to feel our boiling blood combo move.\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan.\n\"OK, you want to go up, or should I?\" Bai Bufan immediately understood.\n\"I’ll do it; my physique is better than yours now. Plus, the class monitor said I’m a good person.\" Lin Li crouched down.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t quite get why Lin Li suddenly mentioned her saying he was a good person and tilted her head in confusion.\nBai Bufan, however, got it right away.\n—Because good people are the ones who ought to be targeted.\nSo, he held back his laughter and surreptitiously pulled up his underwear before sitting up.\nLin Li slowly stood up: \"Class monitor, Ding Sihan, when Bufan and I knock down the fruits, try to catch them. I’m a bit inconvenienced.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nThe persimmons on the tree witnessed Lin Li and Bai Bufan shouting about friendship and bonds and came rushing with sticks, thus starting to fall.\nFour fruits, not too many nor too few, washed briefly at the roadside waterspout. A bit thirsty, Lin Li tore off the surface and took a bite.\n\"Not bad, although it’s not as sweet as store-bought fruits, it’s pretty tasty, not as bitter or astringent as imagined.\" Lin Li savored the taste, nodded, and took another bite, giving his approval.\nThe three heard this and also put the persimmons into their mouths.\nThree seconds later, all four of them started spitting.\n\"Spit, spit, it’s stringy, sour, not ’tree’, not good at all.\"\nChen Yu Ying scrunched her face up and looked up, seeing Lin Li, who was also spitting but had a face of triumphant mischief.\nShe initially wanted to glare at Lin Li but ended up laughing.\n\"Lin Li, you bastard, you’re not human!\" Bai Bufan angrily exclaimed while spitting.\nYesterday, he tricked Zhou Baowei like this, so he should have been wary, but Lin Li gave the persimmon to Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying too. This action made Bai Bufan completely relax and let his guard down—he thought Lin Li wouldn’t trick girls.\nIt turns out he underestimated Lin Li’s scoundrel level.\nThis dog even tricks girls! Tricked Chen Yu Ying too! Doesn’t he look inhuman?\n\"Lin Li!!\"\nThe furious one wasn’t just Bai Bufan, Ding Sihan picked up the stick and started swinging.\n\"Becoming dark-skinned was an accident too, every sign-in gives free spins.\" Lin Li leisurely took the hits, all while speaking.\nThrowing the four persimmons into the roadside trash can, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan prepared to continue the last part of the climb, only to find Lin Li and Bai Bufan returning to the persimmon tree, reuniting.\nThis time, it was Lin Li’s turn to be on top.\n\"Class monitor, Ding Sihan, please help us catch them again!\" Lin Li shouted at them.\n\"If it’s not tasty, why pick them again?\" Chen Yu Ying walked over, curiously asked.\nLin Li swung the wooden stick in his hand.\n\"This one’s for Bao Wei!\"\n\"This one’s for Wang Ze!\"\n\"This one’s for Tian Ming!\"\n\"This one’s for...\"\nHow could he not think of the guys when there’s good stuff?\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan silently caught the fruits.\nBoys, you really are...",

How about I help you carry some?\"\nNoticing Lin Li made an almost ’eh’ sound of relief when he stood up, Chen Yu Ying reached to support his bag.\n\"Class president, I’m not someone who puts up a front of being strong. If I’m really tired, I’ll just ride on Bai Bufan, don’t worry,\" Lin Li waved his hand dismissively.\nThey had been walking for two hours now, and since it was all uphill, they were bound to feel slightly tired. But they walked at a slow pace, and taking photos and picking persimmons served as breaks, so Lin Li wasn’t overexerting himself at all.\n\"...A kind person is bullied, and a good horse is ridden to level 7.\" However, Bai Bufan nodded toward Chen Yu Ying, \"What Lin Li said is true, he would indeed willingly climb onto me.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nYou two...\n\"Class president, besides, if I were really tired, you shouldn’t help me carry things, you should help me wipe my sweat,\" Lin Li suggested thoughtfully. \"I think that’s far more useful than helping me carry stuff.\"\n\"Lin Li is right about that. If Ying Bao wipes his sweat, Lin Li might just take off,\" Ding Sihan remarked teasingly.\nChen Yu Ying, not having mastered the art of receiving such jests with ease, pursed her lips slightly and glared at Ding Sihan, who was adding fuel to the fire.\nWhy did her reward end up with Ding Sihan?\nLin Li felt indignant.\nBut Chen Yu Ying’s blushing face was truly the most enticing persimmon, wasn’t it?\nThe texture seemed crisp, sweet, and a bit colorful.\n\"You don’t even have any sweat, what am I supposed to wipe? Besides, your hands are free; you can wipe it yourself,\" after glaring at Ding Sihan, Chen Yu Ying said to Lin Li.\n\"Bufan, in case of emergency, I’ll cut off my arms myself, and you’ll make sure I break a sweat!\" Lin Li promptly issued an order with a serious tone.\n\"Understood! Lin Li, give me your phone, I’ll show them your TikTok search and browser history!\" Bai Bufan came up with a plan right away.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nGod damn.\nHe was indeed slightly sweating profusely now.\n\"Hey? I heard it’s really scandalous, let me see,\" Ding Sihan’s voice suddenly rose by eight degrees.\nChen Yu Ying was equally interested in such matters; she might even be more intrigued than Ding Sihan, her eyes dazzling.\n\"I browse in incognito mode,\" Lin Li replied, then elbowed Bai Bufan: \"Not this way.\"\n\"Got it, Plan B initiated, ah—\" Bai Bufan slightly tilted his head back, making a phlegmy noise in his throat, with his gaze seemingly targeting Lin Li’s forehead.\n\"?\"\n\"I asked for sweat, who the hell told you to spit!\" Lin Li responded with a Leo Flying Kick.\nBai Bufan was kicked onto the ground, uttering a classic Northerner’s sound of impact, ’iwc.’\nLin Li decided to ride on Bai Bufan ahead of time.\n\"Let’s go, we’re almost at the summit.\" While the two were horsing around, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, who had walked ahead, turned back to call out.\nEven turning into a dual-sculpted Yang Guo wouldn’t get Chen Yu Ying to help wipe sweat for him, Lin Li had no choice but to get up and wave: \"Coming.\"\n\"Give me a hand.\" Bai Bufan extended his hand from behind.\nLin Li returned and kicked him again.\n...\n[Task 2 Completed]\n[You have been rewarded: Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption speed increased by 100%; Ling Beast affability increased by 50%; system currency *50.]\nThe task was completed more easily than Lin Li had expected.\nHe had thought the system would be pedantic and require him to reach the absolute summit of Cloud Peak Mountain, but as they continued upward, the task showed as completed.\nHowever, upon seeing the nearby cables, Lin Li roughly understood that the task probably just required him to surpass the height that the cable car could reach.\nThe physical improvements didn’t bring about too much tangible sensation. Would small animals like him more now?\nThere weren’t any animals around, so Lin Li wasn’t in a hurry to verify.\n\"The teacher said they still have about twenty minutes before finishing the tour, so we should go to the base to wait for everyone. He’s already informed the base owner, and they’ll let us in,\" Chen Yu Ying called back.\nIt was only just eleven o’clock now. They had climbed for less than three hours, and this was considering the four of them weren’t focusing solely on climbing, so the main group hadn’t finished their original plan yet.\n\"Alright, let’s head over.\" Without the task, Lin Li was full of leisure.\nSo, under Chen Yu Ying’s guidance, the four of them successfully entered the outdoor base.\nThe base actually had many projects, not just barbecues. There were kites, inflatable balls, frisbees... There was even real-person CS, but the only activity included in the autumn trip fee was the barbecue; the other activities required extra payment to participate.\nWith less than twenty minutes to spare, the four of them just looked over the project introductions without any interest in purchasing the services.\nUpon reaching the artificial turf, still green and soft in September, they selected a spot under a tree with shade and sat down.",

Meanwhile, Chen Yu Ying took out a picnic mat from her bag, spread it open, and sat down.\nDing Sihan sat in a standard posture, her legs bent in front of her, resting her chin on her knees, browsing her phone swiftly.\nChen Yu Ying, perhaps because she was wearing a skirt, had her legs stretched out flat like in yoga practice, straight and long, accentuating her good body proportions.\n\"There are still small bugs in the grass. You guys should come sit on this,\" Chen Yu Ying said, moving a bit to the left and patting the empty spot on her right, particularly addressing Lin Li, who was lying on the grass.\n\"Well, in that case, I won’t be polite,\" Bai Bufan was about to decline, but Lin Li had already shamelessly moved his head over.\nNow, the best pillows in the world, or perhaps just one, were right beside Lin Li, less than ten centimeters away, covered by a blue skirt. Lin Li could even smell the faint fragrance emanating from the pillow, reminding him of spring.\nUnfortunately, he could only rest his head on the ground.\nPainful, so painful.\nDirectly above Lin Li’s line of sight was the tree shade in September, showing traces of yellow amidst the green, and a bit of sunlight through the gaps forming a visible beam due to the weak Tyndall effect.\nTo the right, Yu Guang could catch Bai Bufan’s dogshit figure that had followed over, but thankfully to the left, there was the sight of Chen Yu Ying sitting upright without any back support. This maintained a lovely visual balance worthy of remembering.\nSpeaking of which, could the dogshit move aside?\nThe dogshit not only didn’t move aside, but Bai Bufan’s upper body leaned closer to Lin Li, meeting his gaze.\nGreat, the only view of Chen Yu Ying left to Yu Guang is ruined. Lin Li frustratedly closed his eyes, then said leisurely:\n\"Bai Bufan, I was supposed to spend these twenty minutes studying. It’s all your fault, now I have nothing to do.\"\n\"Are you sick?\"\n\"Are you sick?\"\nDing Sihan and Bai Bufan both cursed Lin Li at once.\nIt seemed he had stirred up public anger, making Lin Li smirk without daring to say anything, feeling sullen, but it was alright, he could secretly review in his mind.\nRandom checks, tore it up with his brother, what does that mean?\nTadpole, heritage, inheritance.\nVery good.\nIf I work this hard, there’s no reason not to be in the top hundred of the grade.\n\"Lin Li, come on, twenty minutes is just enough for us to farm some land.\" Feeling a few taps on his waist, Bai Bufan’s voice quickly followed.\nZhou Baowei’s painful experience was still fresh in memory, so Lin Li refused to have any death wish, not even bothering to open his eyes, and said, \"Actually, I’m a herding dog, a spiritual American. As Americans, we absolutely wouldn’t play such unfair games like Honor of Kings.\"\n\"You’d get killed with ten attack power? No farming alliance, no progress today, no alliance, no end to the years, raise the farming small, farm the big, don’t discriminate against games anymore.\" Bai Bufan earnestly preached.\n\"No, what I mean is, starting with two fewer towers, how can we play?\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDeadpan, can’t laugh, or else the merits from helping an old lady across the street with Lin Li last night wouldn’t even warm up before they’re used up.\n\"Then let’s play CF, you’re better at shooting games, right?\"\nLooks like there was no way to refuse.\n...\nto 60, a bittersweet loss after a close chase, yet exhilarating, feeling defeated yet honored.\nThe raucous noise from the entrance of the base could be heard from afar, and Wang Ze’s barking was recognizable from a distance, indicating that Xue Jian and the others had arrived.\n\"Class president, should we pack up the picnic mat, or can I just leave my stuff here?\" Lin Li asked Chen Yu Ying, who was sitting beside him as he got up.\n\"Sure, you guys can leave it here,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nThe four of them returned to their class queue, waiting for Xue Jian to negotiate with the base manager.\nThe manager must have been prepared in advance, as the six barbecue racks were quickly moved out one by one by staff, placed on the concrete next to the grass, and someone had already started putting small pieces of charcoal into them.\nGreat, it’s charcoal grilling, Lin Li thought charcoal grilling tastes far better than electric grilling or other methods.\n\"These six racks belong to our class. Everyone should distribute themselves accordingly, don’t let a few people hog one, nor a bunch of people squeeze on one,\" Xue Jian explained beside them.\nAlthough there were only six barbecue racks, each one was quite large, easily accommodating seven or eight people’s barbecue needs.\n\"The box next to the barbecue racks contains ingredients and seasonings, and those are limited,\" Xue Jian pointed to the unsealed cardboard box next to each barbecue rack.\n\"Bao Wei, we’re breaking up,\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan turned away.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"But don’t worry about not having enough to eat. If you walk inside, you’ll find the service freezer of the base, where all the vegetarian items and some meat are unlimited self-service. They also provide free plain water and soups. Just go inside to get them if needed.\"\n\"Bao Wei, we’ll make up in half an hour,\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan turned away again.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"But remember, no wastage is allowed. There will be someone checking here, and if the self-service items exceed a certain weight in waste, the excess will be charged at a high price. I won’t bother to monitor who’s responsible. If it happens, the cost will be evenly split, so you should all be cautious,\" Xue Jian reiterated.\n\"Bao Wei, let’s make up right now, we can’t do without you,\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan turned away again.",

Throwing stuff at me instead of wasting it, right?\"\nIf you don’t explode in silence, you’ll perish in it; third time’s the charm, Zhou Baowei strikes fiercely.\n\"Classmates with great cooking skills, now’s the time not to hide them. Show us your barbecue skills,\" Xue Jian said to everyone with a smile after the introduction.\n\"Teacher, I think the best barbecue skills in the world belong to you,\" Lin Li loudly flattered, \"you never burn anything.\"\nXue Jian was about to tell Lin Li not to flatter him, but seeing everyone laughing, he realized he misunderstood; that kid wasn’t flattering him at all!\n\"What hasn’t the teacher taught you? Every knowledge point has been broken down and fed to you, yet you don’t know how to adapt. The same figure, change a letter, and you don’t recognize it, just like the semester’s opening exam...\"\nAs Xue Jian began his endless rant, people stopped laughing and gazed at Lin Li with both resentment and hate, making Lin Li feel like he was on pins and needles.\nOh no, he’s the sinner now.\nWill he be the first to end up on the grill later?\nLin Li coughed frantically, almost going into an asthma attack, finally restoring Xue Jian’s sense.\nXue Jian cleared his throat and waved his hand, \"The charcoal isn’t hot yet, so everyone should separate the ingredients. They might not all be defrosted. You can check and sort them first.\"\nLin Li, with Zhou Baowei and Bai Bufan, quickly occupied a grill, opened a box, and said, \"Attention candidates, this test site contains a lot of scallions and cilantro.\"\nThough you can’t easily add cilantro to skewers, it’s perfect for foil grilling.\nZhang Haoyang stopped, adjusted his glasses, scoffed at Lin Li, and chose another grill.\nLin Li sneered and shook his head; one day, everyone in the world will control cilantro, and by then, those who don’t eat cilantro will be banished to Siberia to grow it.\nTaking out the ingredients from the box one by one, some still had unfrozen ice chunks. With the plastic bags, they simply set them on the ground to defrost.\n\"Holy cow, this vinegar’s gone sour, expired, right?\" Lin Li shouted upon opening a tiny vinegar bottle and sniffing it.\nBai Bufan cooperatively held up an imaginary item and shouted, \"Whoa, this durian smells rotten, gone bad, right?\"\n\"Neither expired nor spoiled, actually I just let out a sour, rancid fart,\" Zhou Baowei raised his hand and said.\nSometimes, when playing tricks, the cost varies.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan were fine, but Zhou Baowei was already figuratively beaten to death and left by the roadside.\nThe ingredients and spices were sorted, but the charcoal wasn’t completely hot, leaving the group rather idle as they waited.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged a look and nodded.\nSomething can happen.\nThe two sneaked away, not realizing the vigilant group followed them.\nLin Li pulled out a bag from his pack to share with Bai Bufan.\n\"Where did those persimmons come from! Let me see!\" The trailing group was furious when they saw Lin Li and Bai Bufan intending to sneakily eat persimmons, and they tried to snatch them.\n\"Bought on the hike, this bag costs 20 bucks, no way!\"\nLin Li held the bag high, and seeing the group attempting to snatch it, he tossed it to Bai Bufan.\n\"Don’t you dare snatch! Leave us some! There are only a few left!\" But Bai Bufan was too weak, and the bag got intercepted by Wang Ze, leaving Bai Bufan crying in anguish.\n\"Thank you for the persimmons, they’re ours now.\"\nUltra-athletic Wang Ze laughed triumphantly, ready to enjoy his prize.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan finally let themselves chuckle.\n...\nAlso waiting for the charcoal to fully heat up, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan were sharing the photos they took along the way with their roommates.\nNoises came from behind them.\nThe two turned their heads, only to see Lin Li and Bai Bufan having done something and seemingly angered everyone, now sprinting across the lawn.\nAnd behind them was a throng of angry boys led by Wang Ze, they saw Wang Ze shouting:\n\"Lin Li! Bai Bufan! Stop right there! Have the guts not to run!\"\nIf Lin Li and Bai Bufan had proactively shared, they would have been on guard, but seeing them treasure it, why would Wang Ze and the others suspect a trick was involved?\n\"Feign submission only to seize later! Using tactics on us! You guys are beasts!\" The angrier Wang Ze got, the more he thought.\nOh, seeing the persimmon juice not yet wiped off the corners of people’s mouths and their painful faces, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan understood.",

It’s the last lesson your mom taught you!\" Ding Sihan laughed, not at all ladylike, rubbing her belly as she pointed at Lin Li and mocked.\nSeeing this, Chen Yu Ying also changed her approach and handed tissues from her shoulder bag to Lin Li.\nLin Li very much wanted to teach Ding Sihan a lesson, but he didn’t have much time—the group wasn’t far and was chasing again.\nActually, most of the people had run out of breath, but the problem was that the sacrificed Bai Bufan was now assimilated and running faster than a physical test, appearing like he’s the one who hates him most.\nTaking the tissue and wiping his mouth, Lin Li continued his escape.\n...\nThe net of heaven and earth is large but not loose, Lin Li couldn’t escape death.\nAfter watching the ads for resurrection, the charcoal was already hot, water droplets would sizzle intensely inside, they could start the barbecue.\n\"Who’s going to barbecue?\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei.\nThe three of them basically had no experience in this area, nor anyone passionate about barbecuing.\nSo there was silence.\n\"Bao Wei, you do the barbecue, consider it an exercise for losing weight.\"\nLin Li and Bai Bufan mentally agreed to make Zhou Baowei do the tough work.\n\"Whose lose weight through barbecuing? I have my own weight loss plan, barbecuing is a part I must evaluate, so you guys do it.\" Zhou Baowei clasped his hands behind his back and shook his head.\n\"What weight loss plan requires evaluating barbecue?\" Bai Bufan frowned.\n\"Military style body management, can only eat military hot pot, veteran barbecue, handgun drumstick, colonel nugget, battleship sushi.\" Zhou Baowei said loudly.\n\"Picking up chopsticks makes a soldier; is the aim to develop a general’s belly?\" Lin Li agreed, whether process or result, it all seemed quite military.\n\"Exactly, Lin Li, I, Grand General Zhou, appoint you as the tea serving soldier, now go to the self-service area and serve tea to your general.\" Zhou Baowei nodded heavily.\n\"What kind of general are you, are you pretending to be the sun?\" Bai Bufan scoffed.\n\"I see you want to eat seaweed soup without ingredients, flowers, nor more soup, Bai Bufan, I now order you to split troops and attack the enemy food store by yourself.\" Zhou Baowei ordered arrogantly.\nThen General Zhou got beaten.\nFinally, the three decided to settle this by rock-paper-scissors to determine who would barbecue.\n\"Rock-paper-scissors!\"\nZhou Baowei put out paper, Bai Bufan and Lin Li both put out rock.\n\"Congratulations winner, you’ve won the privilege of barbecuing!\" Before Zhou Baowei could laugh, Lin Li and Bai Bufan spoke in unison.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Who wins, who barbecues?\" he questioned.\n\"Otherwise?\"\n\"Scram! Let’s get the rules straight this time.\" Zhou Baowei couldn’t accept it.\n\"Then still, whoever wins barbeques.\"\n\"Fine.\"\nAgreed, the second round started.\n\"Rock-paper-scissors.\"\nSecond round, Zhou Baowei put out paper, Bai Bufan did a vertical gesture of six, Lin Li raised his foot.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nDamn it.\nThese two are even worse this time.\n\"What the hell are you two doing this time? Huh?\" Zhou Baowei questioned.\n\"Haven’t you watched ’Ultraman R/B’? This is the joy gesture, I’m a peace-loving person who dislikes disputes, I hope rock-paper-scissors can coexist peacefully, so among us, it’s a draw, I can’t win, so one of you definitely has to barbecue.\" Bai Bufan said kindly with hands together, looking like he’s been petted like a pure kid by Nangong Wen Ya.\n\"You avoid the sandstorm?\" Zhou Baowei waved his hand, full of resentment, then looked at Lin Li, who raised his foot, sneering and questioning, \"What’s this foot of yours, joy foot?\"\n\"I lost, to both of you, you two work it out, call me when the barbecue is ready.\" Lin Li dealt with it calmly.\n\"You lost and where’s your currency for passwords?\" Zhou Baowei’s eyes widened.\nLin Li sighed, looking at the ignorant Zhou Baowei: \"Bao Wei, if hands and feet fought, who would win?\"\n\"How do we even compare? Who says that feet have to lose? The power of a flying kick is way stronger than a flying punch, so I probably lost!\" Zhou Baowei analyzed for a while.\n\"No, when hands and feet fight, you’ll definitely want hands to win and end up hitting feet,\" Lin Li calmly said.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nDamn.\nHad no choice but to support hands winning.\nNo denying it, the feet really lost.\n...\nBut since no one could convince the others, the three of them decided to take turns grilling.\n\"Come and see, come and see, authentic Xinjiang lamb skewers~~\" Lin Li was the first, smearing oil on the meat skewers and rolling them on the grill, loudly shouting with an accent.\nGrilling skewers is quite fun—at least at first, it is.\n\"Lin Li!\"\n\"Eh! What’s up? Ding Sihan, do you want to be my first customer?\" Hearing Ding Sihan’s voice, Lin Li turned his head to look at her as she approached and asked.\nHe saw Ding Sihan holding a skewer, handing it to Lin Li: \"This is Ying Bao’s skewer, she’s too shy to give it to you herself, so she asked me to bring it for you to taste.\"\nLin Li snickered.\nRecently got fooled by Nakano Kaki’s trick due to being thirsty and not expecting Ding Sihan to have evolved so quickly. Such an obvious trap this time, how could he fall for it?\n\"Monitor, did you grill this?\" Lin Li directly shouted over to Chen Yu Ying to confirm.\nAs expected, Chen Yu Ying shook her head.\n\"Damn it.\" Caught in Lin Li’s provocative gaze, Ding Sihan stomped her foot angrily.\n\"Here to find someone to test for poison, huh?\" Lin Li snickered.\n\"Without someone testing it, I’m too scared to eat it myself, I don’t even know if it’s cooked, blah blah blah.\" Ding Sihan stuck her tongue out at Lin Li.\n\"For poison testing, you should ask Bai Bufan, he’s professional.\" Lin Li continued his actions, nodding towards Bai Bufan, who was cutting aluminum foil on the side.\n\"Huh?\" Ding Sihan didn’t understand.\n\"Bufan once said that his family is a eunuch family, with ancestors frequently serving as eunuchs, always aligning themselves with Wei Zhongxian, so poison testing should be their inherent family skill; if he’s not professional, who is?\" Lin Li shrugged and explained.\n\"Really... a eunuch family?\" Ding Sihan exclaimed, amazed.\nCan a eunuch have a family? In the dramas she watched, didn’t all those major eunuchs only have adopted sons?\nSo impressive.\n\"Really, I saved the chat records. Ah Ding, if I’m lying to you, I’ll lose my Xiaodingding.\" Lin Li nodded.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nBut now she had to believe it.\nSeeing Ding Sihan’s sneaky glances towards him, Bai Bufan gritted his teeth and said with some embarrassment and anger:\n\"Lin Li, how long are you going to keep reminding me of a slip of the tongue? I meant to say my family is an official family! The Bai family tree often had people become officials! Accidentally typed it as ’eunuch’ instead!\nAnd it’s generational loyalty, not mother**king generations of Wei Zhongxian!\"\nWho knew there was such a big difference between an official family and a eunuch family?\nThe most disgusting thing is, Lin Li clearly realized my slip of the tongue instantly but chose to save and forward the chat record before notifying me about it, he’s not human at all.\nIt was then that Ding Sihan finally understood the situation and could barely hold back her laughter.\n\"Try it, Lin Li.\" After laughing, she still felt more familiar with Lin Li and pleaded.\n\"I don’t want to die.\" Lin Li refused, keeping his mouth tightly shut.\n\"Just a bite, just a bite.\" Ding Sihan tugged at Lin Li’s sleeve, acting cute.\nThe gap between Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying is as ridiculously big as the gap between Bai Bufan and others.\n\"Stop acting cute, I’ll eat it right away.\" Sighing, Lin Li took the skewer with a resolve to face death.\nJust as he was about to put it in his mouth, he saw Zhou Baowei coming back from the bathroom, so Lin Li handed the skewer over: \"Here, it’s cooked, give it a try.\"\n\"Thanks.\" Zhou Baowei nodded, took a bite, and frowned, \"Seems like it’s not cooked.\"\n\"You heard him, it’s not cooked, go back and increase the grilling time,\" Lin Li said to Ding Sihan.\n\"Thank you!\" Ding Sihan nodded and ran back.\nLin Li resumed grilling.\nHaving come to his senses, Zhou Baowei glared darkly at Lin Li.\n\"It’s one thing to have me test for poison, but why did she thank you, Lin Li...?\"\nLin Li laughed, and Zhou Baowei sensed something was wrong, but before he could stop him, he heard Lin Li shout: \"Ding Sihan, come over for a moment!\"\n\"What?\" Ding Sihan jogged over again.\n\"Say thanks to Baowei, he tried the skewer for you, but you thanked me, he’s not happy,\" Lin Li said earnestly.\n\"Oh, okay, thank you, Zhou Baowei!\" Ding Sihan thanked Zhou Baowei.\nZhou Baowei felt no joy, only a lifeless awkwardness: \"I was joking...\"\n\"Oh, it’s no big deal.\" Ding Sihan nodded and ran back again.\nAfter Ding Sihan went back, Zhou Baowei’s lifelessness transformed into tangible murderous intent.\nLin Li’s health bar started flashing.\n\"Our skewers are cooked, really cooked, let’s eat first.\" Lin Li turned and said, trying to salvage his own life.\nZhou Baowei nodded.\nLet’s eat first.\nKill later.\n\"Hold on, I’ll plate it up.\" But Lin Li stopped the two from taking the skewers, then used tongs to take a piece of meat the size of a fingernail, placed it on foil, and poured a splash of vinegar, gracefully stirring with a spoon before placing two cilantro leaves beside it.\n\"This dish is called—Dragon Flying Phoenix Dancing!\" Lin Li finished with a sprinkle of salt, concluding perfectly.\nBai Bufan approvingly nodded: \"Gets the Michelin three-star vibe, this dish feels like it’s at least worth 198.\"\n\"Didn’t see any dragon, didn’t see any phoenix, only saw a single dance.\" Zhou Baowei disliked Michelin, especially French cuisine.\nThose portions, even if he ate them for a month, wouldn’t yield two Maltesers.\nThinking of that, Zhou Baowei turned to see Wang Ze eating Maltesers nearby and shook his head in disgust.\nWang Ze, popping two Maltesers into his mouth: \"?\"\nWhat’s going on?",

You’re slandering your brothers here.\" The two acted hurt, somewhat regretfully, \"You do it, you do it.\"\nSo Zhou Baowei began distributing: \"One for Lin Li, one for me, one for Bufan, one for me, one for me again, one for me, another one for Lin Li, another for me...\"\nLin Li, Bai Bufan: \"...\"\nPretty fair, but just a tad unfair.\n\"Bufan, quick, call Xiaoxi, tell it we’ve found endless energy, get the Star Ship back—Bao Wei’s turned into lard, energy crisis solved instantly.\" Lin Li turned to Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan covered his eyes: \"I can’t, Lin Li, I can’t do it, I’m a Muslim’s son-in-law, I can’t witness this lucky symbol, get Bao Wei out of my sight!\"\nThe two were smoothly keeping up their banter.\nBut this time, Bao Wei was keeping up with his banter as well.\nLet them curse, let them curse.\nI’ll just eat eat eat eat eat!\nI’ll just munch munch munch munch munch!\nHowever, Lin Li and Bai Bufan didn’t really mind; since Bao Wei was eating fast, they just let him eat more. If the kid wants to eat, let him eat. If it’s not enough, they’ll just grab something else to eat.\nTasting his own barbecue, to be honest, barbecue is something that tastes better with great skill, but as long as you’re not completely hopeless, it won’t taste bad.\nIt was alright, passable.\nThe so-called feeling that one’s own labor is the sweetest, Lin Li didn’t quite notice.\nWhen it was Bai Bufan’s turn to grill, he spread foil over the barbecue rack, applied oil, and started grilling enoki mushrooms, eggplants...\nLin Li had drunk half of his water while climbing, and now it was finished. He looked at the water the two had brought; there was some left, but the bottle mouths were probably greasy, not something he could drink.\nAfter mentioning it to them, he was appointed as the team’s tea soldier, and headed to the base’s self-service area.\nAs Xue Jian had said, there was a self-service water dispenser, along with two large containers. Upon opening one was filled with sour plum juice, and the other with a pale pink mush that resembled iced jelly, likely lotus root starch soup.\nSince it was summer, except for the room-temperature white water from the dispenser, everything else was chilled.\nThe sour plum soup seemed to be made from a sour plum concentrate, probably could be made for a yuan per bucket, taste was a bit odd, but the lotus root soup was unexpectedly delicious and refreshing.\nMight as well bring back a cup for Bufan and Bao Wei too.\n\"Lin Li, you’re here for water too?\"\n\"Yeah, class president.\" Lin Li didn’t turn around, Chen Yu Ying’s crisp voice was really distinctive, like a 10K Blu-ray panoramic surround of 192kHz beauty.\n\"Which one tastes good here?\" The light blue figure stood beside Lin Li, elegant and poised, she asked.\n\"This grave ash soup is not bad, do you want some, class president? I’ll get you a cup too?\" Lin Li said, swinging the long-handled ladle in his hand.\nChen Yu Ying was stunned for a moment, then took a step back, half hiding behind Lin Li, with hands clasped over her lips, a hint of surprise and panic in her voice: \"Grave, grave ash soup?\"\nIs this base trying to scare people?\n\"Yeah, this lotus root soup, lotus root is just Nezha’s ashes, isn’t it?\" Lin Li nodded sincerely.\nThe air went silent for a moment, so quiet that you could imagine hearing the sound of the young girl’s long eyelashes trembling.\nChen Yu Ying stared at the lotus root soup for a while, then put her clasped hands on Lin Li’s back and gave two light punches, a bit annoyed, she said:\n\"How can you call lotus root powder grave ash? Why don’t you say the ground beneath us is mixed with Sun Wukong’s ashes?\"\n\"Not surprising, class president, your capability for learning is impressive, indeed. That is the truth, and besides, if the Great Saint got pregnant and wanted an abortion, he’d probably choose laser lithotripsy.\" Lin Li nodded in agreement.\n\"Is this the best tasting?\" Annoyed but then couldn’t help laughing, Chen Yu Ying stepped forward again to stand parallel to Lin Li, and asked for confirmation.\n\"Yes, I haven’t drunk this cup yet, try it. There are disposable spoons and straws here.\"\nLin Li handed the cup to Chen Yu Ying, but when her hand reached over, he suddenly raised the cup of lotus root powder.\nCaught off guard, Chen Yu Ying raised her hand, but missed again. With the height difference present, after missing a few times, Chen Yu Ying chose to stare into Lin Li’s eyes.\nGhost Cultivator from Nansang Sect +1.\nLin Li held back his laughter and handed the lotus root soup to a place where Chen Yu Ying could reach it again.\nChen Yu Ying had just moved her hand when Lin Li’s hand moved too.\nThis is the power of a Cultivator.\nWhy did Lin Li cultivate?\nApart from helping acquaintances and Bai Bufan fly, curing Yangliang’s stubborn illness, and making at least three thousand a month, isn’t it for moments like these?\n\"Hmph.\" The mortal got angry, ignoring Lin Li, deciding to pour herself a cup.\n\"Really, here you go, really here you go.\" Lin Li laughed and handed it over again.\nChen Yu Ying refused to accept it.\n\"Ahem ahem.\" Lin Li thought he needed to come up with an excuse, \"Class president, I’m not teasing you, I was just thinking, do you have any sanitary pads in your bag, are you on your period, this lotus root soup is cold, I’m worried you might not be able to drink it.\"\nLittle red cherry tomatoes appeared once again, looking nice, fun.\nLove to see it, love to play.\n\"I’m not on my period, we all carry a spare, and it’s chilly here, just standing here you know it’s cold, I already reached out, doesn’t that mean I can drink it! Besides, you didn’t ask earlier, you were just teasing, no excuses!\"\nNewbies who poke your stomach all the time, Chen Yu Ying saw through Lin Li’s pathetic lie at once.\n\"I was afraid asking would make you awkward.\"\nBut just like Lin Li said, the world is for the thick-skinned, even after being exposed, his face was not red, and his heart was still beating fine.\n\"Are you saying I’m not awkward now!?\" Chen Yu Ying looked down, seeing that Lin Li’s shoes were white, snorted, and put her slightly raised foot back on the ground.\nHe should have worn black shoes.\nLin Li handed over the lotus root flour cup again, and this time Chen Yu Ying didn’t refuse. She took it and had a spoonful, nodding with satisfaction: \"Hmm, pretty good.\"\n\"Class rep, are you drinking it yourself, or do you need a few more cups?\" Lin Li asked again.\n\"Make four more cups, I’ll bring one for each of them. I’m going to get a cup of room temperature water, Shuyang is on her period.\" Chen Yu Ying said.\n\"What period? It’s just a period, sweeping away hunger and being yourself.\"\nChen Yu Ying shivered: \"So cold.\"\n\"I got the hint! Class rep, wait, I’m going to take off my clothes and drape them over you.\" Lin Li had read a hundred high EQ posts from marketing accounts, and the warmth tips he learned could definitely keep Chen Yu Ying warm for a hundred years.\n\"Pervert!\"\nThe only problem was that Lin Li was only wearing a T-shirt, so when he put down his spoon and crossed his arms to grab his shirt hem, Chen Yu Ying covered her eyes.\nUnlike Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu who weren’t really covering their eyes, Chen Yu Ying was covering her eyes tightly.\nLin Li, of course, wasn’t really going to take off his shirt—why bother if she wasn’t looking.\nMade six cups in total.\n\"I’ll help you carry them back.\"\n\"Alright, thanks.\"\nThey were long cups like the ones used for bubble tea, so Lin Li could hold two with one hand, and Chen Yu Ying could hold the remaining three with both hands just right.\nBefore they reached the girls’ barbecue side, Lin Li heard Ding Sihan’s exclamation, and the girls who had gathered spread out to some distance.\nLin Li walked over to see what was happening and found out the charcoal had caught fire, and Ding Sihan was about to pour the water she brought over it.\nLin Li quickly placed his cups on the ground temporarily, went over and stopped Ding Sihan by pressing down on her cup.\nThen he picked up the tongs, moved the grill aside, and stirred the burning charcoal a bit until the flames gradually died down.\n\"When you’re grilling, switch spots more often, don’t just roast in one place.\" After putting the grill back, Lin Li calmly said.\n\"Oh.\" Ding Sihan nodded blankly.\nLin Li he...\n\"How was it?\" Lin Li’s face instantly turned playful as he eagerly asked: \"Wasn’t my silent, calm, cool, problem-solving behavior followed by a lofty speech super handsome?\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nDamn it.\nAlthough it was a bit unfamiliar just now, his actions were indeed quite cool.\nAlmost wanted to praise him.\nBut now, seeing Lin Li’s playful face, that familiar feeling came rushing back.\nBut—\n\"You think you’re still handsome after saying that? You just seem so insufferable!\" Ding Sihan exclaimed loudly.\n\"Alright, I’ll keep a straight face longer next time.\" Humility leads to progress, Lin Li realized his shortcoming and nodded.\n\"Lin Li, try this skewer, don’t worry, it’s not a test poison this time; if humans can eat it, so can you.\" After her disdain, Ding Sihan handed over a mushroom skewer.\nBeing kicked out of humanity is something Lin Li has gotten used to, he finished eating in a few bites and nodded: \"Not bad.\"\n\"Then eat this green pepper skewer too, and this mutton skewer which has a nice brownish scorch, and this... ouch!\" Ding Sihan’s head was knocked.\nLooking up, the culprit sneered at him: \"Am I a trash bin to you?\"\nNever thought he’d one day share the same fate as Bao Wei, utterly pathetic.\n\"Daddy, I’m begging you.\" Ding Sihan clasped her hands pleadingly.\n\"I’ll eat it.\"\nLin Li sighed, resigned to the fatherly duty he couldn’t escape.\n...\n\"Class rep, is there any of yours here? I want to eat something fit for human consumption.\"\nAfter fulfilling his trash bin duty, and throwing the skewers into the actual trash bin, Lin Li looked up and asked.\n\"There’s none here, but I can make one for you now.\" Chen Yu Ying replied upon hearing.\n\"I won’t be polite, then. Thanks.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Wait a minute, I’ll first put on an apron.\" Chen Yu Ying picked up a clear plastic apron from the grass nearby, put it on, and tied her loose hair with the hair tie around her wrist.\nThe snow-white neck hidden by her black hair was revealed and shone even more under the sunlight.\nThe pure and innocent girl, at this moment, seemed to have gained a hint of a homely wife vibe.\nThe apron was indeed necessary; Lin Li didn’t want this awesome dress to get stained with oil or dirt.\nHis thoughts wandering, Lin Li quickly turned to look at Yu Yu, then nodded.\nAs someone who, if a stain were to fall from her mouth, was the most likely to get it on herself, she had indeed worn the same kind of disposable apron, protecting herself well.\nAnd as expected, there were already some stains in that huge risk area on her apron. No way around it, high-risk area.\nLin Li then looked at Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu, Ding Sihan had a bit, Qu Wanqiu had none at all.\n—Lin Li wasn’t talking about stains this time.\n\"Lin Li, what the heck are you smiling about? It’s so creepy!\" Qu Wanqiu recoiled in horror upon noticing Lin Li smiling at her.\nWhat he was going to say next was not suitable for unfamiliar ears, so Lin Li jogged over next to Qu Wanqiu and asked seriously, but softly, \"I have a very serious question I want to ask you, Little Qiuqiu, if you didn’t have legs, would you still wear shoes?\"\nDing Sihan leaned over, hearing this with a face full of confusion.\n\"What do you plan to do to my legs?\" Qu Wanqiu, hearing this, defensively pressed her legs.\n\"Nothing.\"\nQu Wanqiu: \"?\"\nWhat on earth.\n\"Whether I want to or not is irrelevant. Just answer me, if you didn’t have legs, would you wear shoes?\" Qu Wanqiu’s legs had no allure to him, Lin Li continued in a low voice.\n\"No, I wouldn’t.\" Qu Wanqiu frowned and shook her head.\n\"Then why do you wear a bra?\" Lin Li earnestly asked.\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 156: Chapter 137: My Laughter Passes Through Your Black Hair in Youth\n\"Here’s the skewer for you, Wanqiu, I fully support you stabbing him!\" Being the only one besides Lin Li and Qu Wanqiu who heard the conversation, Ding Sihan handed the skewer to Qu Wanqiu while stifling a laugh, deliberately picking a metal one to ensure Lin Li had no chance of survival.\n\"You... Second Sister, let’s not tease Big Sister.\" Upon hearing this, Lin Li glanced up and down before letting out a snort.\nDing Sihan didn’t laugh and immediately launched into cooperative hunting mode.\n...\nThis time, Lin Li’s 1800 yuan clothes really got two punctures, but in making jokes like these, as long as his head didn’t actually fall off, it was a huge victory!\nWin!\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu weren’t actually angry. Firstly, everyone knew each other quite well, and secondly, Lin Li’s teasing was done privately.\n\"Yes, yes, you both are young and promising, and here I am, an old-timer, who doesn’t get it.\"\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu brought up the Chen Tianming’s Hope Theory, leaving the soon-to-be eighteen-year-old \"old-timer\" Lin Li no choice but to agree.\nBy the time they got back, Chen Yu Ying had finished her work and handed a steaming skewer to Lin Li.\n\"Your hands are greasy, and there’s sweat on your forehead! Do you need me to wipe your sweat, Captain?\" Lin Li said with a smile as he took it.\n\"No need.\" For Lin Li, who was persistent about wiping sweat, Chen Yu Ying only found it amusing.\n\"Lin Li, if you want a girl to wipe your sweat so much, I can do it for you,\" said Ding Sihan.\nLin Li turned his head ready to say that people are different, only to notice Ding Sihan holding a steel wool ball.\nPeople and anthropomorphized objects are indeed different.\n\"Thanks, but no thanks.\" Still not ready for that kind of self-torture, Lin Li calmly declined.\nHe put the barbecue into his mouth.\nWho says that food you labor over with your own hands doesn’t taste particularly good? Lin Li wanted to refute this notion.\n\"Delicious!\" With a hopeful look in Chen Yu Ying’s eyes, Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\n\"Tch—insincere!\" Emperor Chen wasn’t anxious, but Eunuch Ding, holding the steel wool, was.\n\"I swear in my next life, when I become a monkey in a zoo, if I have the chance, even if it means getting a hundred big smacks from the keeper, I would snatch it from the tourists and eat heartily.\" So Lin Li rephrased.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nThe scene was vivid, and indeed more sincere now.\nAfter eating, Lin Li returned to his barbecue grill.\nIt was now Zhou Baowei’s turn to grill; whatever Bai Bufan had cooked earlier had probably been divided between the two of them.\nSighing at their disloyalty and unfaithfulness, Lin Li stood to the side sipping bone soup through a straw.\n\"Damn!\" Zhou Baowei suddenly roared.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan both laughed.\nHow was Zhou Baowei always standing downwind of the barbecue smoke?\nIf he stood on the left, the wind blew left; if he moved to the right, the wind blew right.\n\"Oh right, where’s ours, Bao Wei and me?\"\nAfter Bai Bufan finished laughing, seeing Lin Li drinking lotus powder, he extended his hand.\nOh, it seemed they had wanted him to bring some for them too?\nAs Lin Li was persistently sipping, making intermittent sounds of air through the straw, it took a while before he turned to Bai Bufan with a gentle and sincere smile:\n\"I swear on my lucky charm, at the start, I was really planning to bring a cup for both of you, I even prepared one for you.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"That was the plan at the start, what about the middle and the end?\" He smiled and asked.\n\"Forgot in the middle, forgot at the end.\"\n...\nWith barbecue, it’s quite hard to determine if you’re full while grilling, but with drinks, it’s easier to feel satiated from the drinks.\nOver an hour passed, and everyone gradually left the barbecue area.\nUntil only Zhou Baowei was left battling alone at the barbecue area, with him there, Class Four truly didn’t need to worry about food being wasted.\nSome people chose to pay for activities at the base, while others opted to sit on the lawn sharing snacks and chatting.\nAfter all, it was summer, with the midday sun blazing, and Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan weren’t particularly interested in outdoor activities. After taking group and individual photos, they reapplied a layer of sunscreen and returned to the mats under the shade.\n\"Shall I play some music?\" Qu Wanqiu asked.\nNo one objected.\nQu Wanqiu took out a palm-sized mini speaker, and after a bit of fiddling with her phone, music that couldn’t be called high-quality flowed out of the speaker.\nBut quality wasn’t the point; it was about the atmosphere it brought.\nIn the distance, noise louder than the music could be heard.\nIt was Lin Li’s group.\nThey weren’t engaging in any paid activities, nor were they resting.\nNow, a bunch of them were chasing Lin Li and Bai Bufan—not over persimmons this time, but eyeing the sticks in their hands.\nLin Li hadn’t lied to them; these sticks truly held such terrifying allure for these boys that they would drop everything to chase after them—excluding the barbecue-eating Zhou Baowei.\nBut it seemed they made some agreement soon after, and they began playing \"Rooster Fighting\" on the lawn—hopping on one leg while using the knee of the other leg to bump each other.\nIt looked fun, and if they were closer, cheering them on wouldn’t be out of the question.\nThe boys seemed to be using this method to determine the ownership of the sticks, with Lin Li and Wang Ze appearing to be the leaders of these roosters, each arrogantly holding a stick.\nNone of the others seemed dissatisfied—excluding Bai Bufan.\nLin Li walked to the shade, picked up his bag, opened a newly refilled water bottle, and drank large gulps, his Adam’s apple moving up and down clearly with each swallow.",

He’s so annoying.\" After singing a line, Lin Li complained disdainfully.\nChen Yu Ying found his shamelessness rather expected.\n\"You want to sing? I’ll play the accompaniment for you.\" Qu Wanqiu was quite interested after hearing this and nodded immediately.\n\"Might as well include mine,\" Lin Li said bluntly, becoming greedy.\nNoticing Lin Li was about to sing, Bai Bufan, Wang Ze, and others hurried over, spontaneously sitting or standing around Lin Li.\n\"Oh oh! Brother Lin Li! Ohni-chan! I’m crazy about you! Crazy for you! Banging my head against the wall for you!\" Bai Bufan instantly became a fan, albeit a slightly dim-witted one.\nWang Ze and the others joined in the clamoring, each making sounds reminiscent of gorillas.\nKeeping the beat, Lin Li swayed gently, and as the notes fell, he began to sing:\n\"Now, the orioles fly and the grass grows~ My beloved is on the road~\"\n\"I know he perseveres through storms~ Passing twilight without pausing~\"\nBai Bufan gradually became somber and serious.\nAs comrades who had sung together in numerous morning read-alongs, Bai Bufan was well aware of Lin Li’s singing skills: good, but definitely not this good.\nHad he practiced secretly? Attended other morning read-along sessions in secret?\nYou sneaky little thing.\nNoticing Bai Bufan’s gaze and his fly-eating-like expression, Lin Li felt secretly delighted.\nThe system had never been more useful.\nBai Bufan seemed to be the biggest victim of his acquisition of the system.\nAfter finishing \"The World’s Beauty Is Inextricably Linked With You,\" all the boys and girls applauded Lin Li.\nBut as Lin Li operated his phone, the accompaniment music continued almost without stopping; this time, more people instantly recognized the song as \"Old Boy.\"\n\"My day-night yearning deeply loving person——\"\nLin Li first sang half of it himself, then at the start of the second half, he suddenly swung his wooden stick, pointing at Bai Bufan.\n\"Me? What should I do to express it, will she accept me~\"\nBai Bufan didn’t react immediately, but he quickly got into the rhythm, singing the second line.\nBai Bufan’s singing was also quite good.\nThe two took turns singing, the surrounding young boys and girls swaying gently to the rhythm.\n\"Dreams are always out of reach——\" Lin Li swung the wooden stick in a circle, pointing at Wang Ze and the others.\n\"Should I!! Give up!\" Wang Ze and the others shouted loudly.\nWith so many people, the voices varied in pitch, and with Wang Ze’s being the loudest, a line went all over the place, sounding very chaotic and unpleasant.\nYou could tell they hadn’t put much effort into morning reads.\nBut Lin Li gave Wang Ze and the others a thumbs-up.\n\"Flowers bloom and fall, yet another season——\" This time, Lin Li’s wooden stick, like a conductor’s baton, swung sharply toward the girls under the shade.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t remember \"Old Boy\" very clearly, slightly opening her mouth hesitantly, but beside her, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu had already started singing.\n\"Spring, where are you!\"\n\"Awesome! Much better than me!\" During a short interlude, Wang Ze stood up applauding.\n\"If you praise them like that, they won’t be happy...\" Lin Li said disdainfully, \"Just like me saying you’re more handsome than Bai Bufan, would you be happy, Wang Ze?\"\n\"Heck! Indeed not! What a dirty example you’ve set.\" Wang Ze’s most understanding moment.\n\"Lin Li, your mom——\"\n\"Zhou Baowei!\" Lin Li suddenly shouted loudly toward the BBQ area.\n\"Huh?\" Zhou Baowei, still grilling skewers, turned his head.\nLin Li took a deep breath, waiting for the music’s rhythm, then——\n\"Youth is like a rushing river! Catch it!\"\nForcing the effort, this line cracked a bit.\n\"Gone! Forever! Not! Coming! Back! Too! Late! To! Say! Goodbye!\" But even with Lin Li’s cracked voice, compared to the power of Zhou Baowei’s was still too weak.\nOther than for defecating, what Zhou Baowei ate did have some other uses after all.\nBut though it had power, it was explosively unpleasant, and he didn’t seem to have finished chewing what was in his mouth.\n\"Good!\" But the crowd still burst into enthusiastic applause after he roared, and Zhou Baowei waved the barbecue skewer to acknowledge his fans.\nEveryone laughed.\n\"Let’s do it together next!\" Conductor Lin Li ordered again.\n\"Look at the fluttering blossoms in the sky, withering in their most beautiful moment...\"\nFinding the lyrics on her phone, Chen Yu Ying swayed with the surrounding voices, singing softly along.\n...\nXue Jian listened to his class’s students singing from afar, with a gentle smile on his face that Lin Li had never seen before.\nA song lamenting the passing of youth, yet they sang it with such vibrant enthusiasm.\nWell, that’s just it.\nThey are indeed living their youth.\n...\nAfter \"Old Boy,\" Lin Li switched to another song, this time to the even more familiar Phoenix Legend.\nHe straightforwardly divided the interested attendees into male and female voice sections, standing in the center pointing around (literally).\nPerhaps knowing some without the original vocals would be embarrassed to sing, Lin Li would always pitch in at the right times to guide.\nThe atmosphere on the lawn was gradually heating up.\nEven the shyest Yu Yu, Chen Yu Ying could hear her singing along with everyone else.\nAnd the dorm member who loved singing the most, Wen Shuyang, even volunteered to let Lin Li play a few songs for her to lead.\nOccasionally glancing at the lyrics on her phone, sometimes looking at Lin Li shining under the sun, Chen Yu Ying occasionally spotted a few drops of youthful vigor in his sweat falling.\nLin Li, bathed in the breeze, with a carefree demeanor, kept waving the baton in his hand, full of youthful spirit.\n...\nA new intro started playing.\nA slightly dazed Chen Yu Ying snapped back to reality, suddenly realizing it was the intro to Su Yunying’s \"Wild Child.\"\nAnd the first line of the song is...\nChen Yu Ying raised her head, and Lin Li also turned to look at her, the baton connecting their gazes.\n\"The stronger the wind, the more at ease my heart——\"\nThe heaven and earth seemed to respond to Lin Li’s will, the baton in his hand transformed into Harry Potter’s wand.\nIt became windy.\nA sudden gust of wind blew across everyone present, lifting the edges of picnic mats, blowing away someone’s hat, bringing someone’s exclamation.\nChen Yu Ying pressed down her skirt with both hands, to keep it from flying up.\nAs a result, her waterfall-like hair was untethered, swaying freely in the wind.\nMany strands of hair covered her face.\nBut Chen Yu Ying, through the gaps in them, could still catch glimpses of Lin Li’s radiant smile.\nCould Lin Li see her smile through them as well?\nThe wind kept picking up.\n\"The stronger the wind, the more at ease my heart——\"\n...\nThe stronger the wind, the more at ease my heart?",

I don’t know now.\" Lin Li responded, pressing the back of his hand against his nose, slightly embarrassed, \"I’m quite a procrastinator, can’t decide right now.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nIs that really what procrastination looks like?\n\"Just kidding, let’s take the cable car down the mountain.\" Thinking about it, the system probably wouldn’t issue a task like that, seeing Chen Yu Ying’s strange expression, Lin Li changed his words.\nIf a task was really issued, he’d just buy tickets and come back later.\n\"Okay.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nThe bark was rough, leaning against it was uncomfortable, so after the conversation ended, Lin Li lay on the ground and played with his phone vigorously.\n—By vigorously, it meant physically, Lin Li didn’t want to be smacked in the face by his phone.\nAfter the hustle and bustle, the lawn quieted down again, leaving only some people’s whispers.\nChen Yu Ying looked at her phone, enjoying this moment of tranquility.\n\"Hey, Lin Li, look...\" When she came across a fun video, Chen Yu Ying turned her head, just about to share it with Lin Li, and then immediately stopped herself.",

Hearing someone calling his name, Lin Li opened his eyes.\nUpon opening his eyes, he saw Bai Bufan’s overly large, human-like face, congratulating him with a smile: \"The surgery was successful, now you’re a girl, quickly go and try some wormwood.\"\n\"So disgusting,\" Lin Li murmured softly, and closed his eyes again.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYour mother.\nLin Li didn’t think that kind of talk was disgusting; clearly, he was commenting on his face with that statement.\nWhen a person just wakes up, their brain finds it hard to lie, especially when Lin Li murmurs softly, causing Bai Bufan to suffer real damage, bypassing all his defenses.\n\"Just die here, the balls cut off from the surgery I’ll feed to Bao Wei,\" Bai Bufan stood up, giving Lin Li’s calf a gentle kick.\nLin Li kicked back at the air.\n\"Lin Li, get up, time to group up and head down the mountain,\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice came from a distance on one side.\nThis time, he had to get up.\nLin Li sat up, rubbed his eyes, then lifted his head in mild surprise, is this tree shedding so badly?\nI shouldn’t have slept long, how come my belly is full of fallen leaves, even with little white flowers?\nBrushing off the leaves, stretching lazily, Chen Yu Ying and the others seemed to have just returned from the restroom, their hands still a bit damp.\nAt the moment of eye contact with Lin Li, Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying started laughing first.\n\"What is it?\" Lin Li looked puzzled.\n\"It’s nothing,\" Ding Sihan shook her head, stepped forward, and covered Chen Yu Ying’s mouth as she was about to speak.\nThere’s a prankster.\nLin Li sighed, \"Class president, lend me your mirror for a moment.\"\nJust below that, there’s another nonsensical arrow pointing to Lin Li’s mouth.\nOthers emit righteousness, Lin Li emits the character ’正.’\nAs for the suspect, the girls could probably be ruled out; Lin Li smiled towards the group of boys, \"Who did it?\"\n\"It was probably Sun Xiaochuan,\" Wang Ze said with a laugh.\n\"Anyway, that guy’s bound to get hemorrhoids and a perianal abscess tomorrow,\" Lin Li added with a cold smile.\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan frowned and advised, \"Lin Li, I think whether it was Sun Xiaochuan or not, he might just be joking around, no need to curse him so viciously.\"\nOnly criminals empathize with criminals.\nLin Li turned and chased, Bai Bufan turned and ran, but after just a few steps, he tripped over the lawn.\n\"Run, why aren’t you running now?\"\n\"Sorry, sorry, sorry...\" Bai Bufan apologized with a smile to Lin Li, who was close behind pinning him down.\n\"Sorry? Does sorry work? Kneel, lift your head, let me see your tongue coating!\" Lin Li stroked the ’正’ character on his face, revealing a vengeful smile.\n\"Then can I see Bufan’s perianal abscess? There’s an urgent matter, it’s you,\" Wang Ze asked as he came over.\n\"Can you guys watch something normal?\" Bai Bufan was genuinely scared this time, covering his mouth and butt, curling up in fear, weak and helpless.\n...\n\"Alright everyone, check to see if everyone’s here, if we’re all here, we’ll take the cable car down the mountain and go back,\" Xue Jian said loudly, clapping his hands for attention as he reached the entrance.\n\"Hey, where’s Bao Wei?\"\nWith Xue Jian’s reminder, Lin Li and Bai Bufan only then noticed that Zhou Baowei hadn’t caught up.\nThe two exchanged a glance, and then turned back in unison.\nAt the barbecue area, they saw a wisp of white smoke rising, and beside it, Zhou Baowei gazing devoutly at the skewers.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan finally understood why most self-service places strictly limit to two hours.\nZhou Baowei was really selfish, not considering the toilet’s feelings at all.\nLin Li didn’t even dare imagine what kind of challenge his home toilet would face tonight.\n\"Let’s go! Bao Wei! Stop eating, damn it!\" they shouted.\n\"Huh? Hmm? Oh!\" Zhou Baowei finally looked up, got up to follow, but hesitated after a few steps. Staring at the skewers that seemed undercooked, he gritted his teeth, grabbed them in one go, and stuffed them into his mouth swiftly chewing them clean, then mumbled to the two of them, \"Coming.\"\nLin Li, Bai Bufan: \"...\"\nToilet, you’re safe for now, at least you shouldn’t get clogged.\nAfter all, it’s probably going to be diarrhea.\n\"Were you guys playing a game? Why is there ’SB’ written on your face?\" Zhou Baowei asked curiously, pointing at the clear letters on Bai Bufan’s face as he ran over.\n\"It’s ’handsome bastard,’ don’t mind it,\" Bai Bufan waved it off, indicating it’s not important.\nBefore returning to base, he’s not allowed to wipe it off, that’s the price of stupidity.\n...\nHeading to the cable car entrance.\nThe system did not issue any more tasks to add new troubles for Lin Li. It finally matured, understanding things a bit better.\n\"Lin Li, check your phone,\" Ding Sihan shouted to Lin Li from behind.\nLin Li opened it, finding a new photo in the group chat.\nWhat appeared was a group photo of the three of them, but they only occupied the edges of the picture; none had their full upper body visible.",

      "content": "Chapter 160: Chapter 138: The Eastern Land Does Not Permit Sleeping Naked_3\nBecause in the middle of the picture, I’m lying there, the color adjusted to just black and white, with leaves all over my stomach and a white flower on my chest.\nAbove is a somber message in four black characters—Forever Remembered.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Ding Sihan, I’m really going to post on my Moments because of you. The photo-editing beast inside me is about to awaken.\" Lin Li turned to stare at Ding Sihan.\n\"Don’t be angry, I’ll send you a nice one.\" Ding Sihan immediately said.\nUpon hearing this, Lin Li immediately turned down the brightness of his phone, but then suddenly remembered that what Ding Sihan considered nice might not be what he thought.\nThere’s nothing else to do. The so-called ’good stuff’ that bros talk about isn’t something you can openly appreciate in public. I’ve gotten a bit of PTSD and reflex from it, so Lin Li turned the brightness back up.\nA message popped up in the group chat.\nThis time, Ding Sihan sent a video.\nLin Li clicked it open.\nIn the video, it’s Chen Yu Ying kneeling beside him, carefully placing leaf after leaf on him, trying to build a leaf tower on his stomach.\nShe pursed her lips, very serious, her eyes sparkling.\nTurns out, it wasn’t a big tree shedding its leaves.\nEvery time Chen Yu Ying placed a leaf, she’d cautiously glance at Lin Li, and once confirmed he hadn’t woken up, she’d smirk a little, then continue.\nIn the middle, for some unknown reason, she picked up a stone but hesitated and didn’t place it.\nThat was close, almost got smashed to death.\n「Lin Li: Quote 「Picture」, @Ding Sihan, if you’re not satisfied with this photo, just tell me how you’d like me to die, it’s totally doable.」\nLin Li forgave Ding Sihan. Let the kid photoshop however she likes, what’s wrong with a father indulging his child a bit?\nThe video wasn’t even fully watched before he heard sounds of commotion behind him.\n\"When did you record this!\"\n\"When Ying Bao pouted because her leaf tower got blown down by the wind, it was adorable.\"\nLin Li didn’t want to forgive Ding Sihan anymore, this scene wasn’t even captured, useless thing, I don’t have such a daughter.\n\"Ahhh!!! Si Han, give me the phone.\" Lin Li turned his head, only to see Chen Yu Ying, who had turned red in the face, trying to grab Ding Sihan’s phone.\nLin Li figured Chen Yu Ying wouldn’t borrow Ding Sihan’s phone to ask for 200,000, so he immediately became alert.\nSaved the video, forwarded the video to his small account, main account, and the group chat he uses as a memo.\nA wily rabbit has many burrows.\nAs expected, before long, the group chat of four people was left with only 「Ding Sihan retracted a message」.\nChen Yu Ying breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"Ahhh Ying Bao, why’d you delete my original too! Can’t I at least see it myself?\" Ding Sihan looked pained as she checked the recently deleted items on her phone, finding that Chen Yu Ying had checked even there.\n\"Lin Li, did you save it? Quick, send it to me!\" Ding Sihan hopefully looked at Lin Li, she had fought for so much time for him.\n\"No, didn’t get the chance.\" Upon hearing this bad news, Lin Li shook his head regretfully.\n\"Useless! You’re useless!\"\n\"Sorry!!\" Lin Li apologized hoarsely.\nChen Yu Ying let out a big sigh of relief.\nSaved.\nNext time doing something this childish and embarrassing, definitely gotta be more cautious.\nShe opened her phone.\nA group chat that had been buried by other messages popped up, it was the one from last night with only her and Lin Li left, the group chat named Memo 3.\nClicked it open.\nThe familiar video.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n「Chen Yu Ying: ?」\n「Lin Li retracted a message.」\n「Lin Li: Sorry, this group is also in my memo category, so I forwarded it by hand, class monitor just pretend you didn’t see it, thanks for cooperating.」",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Chapter 139: Super Judge, Super Case Handling\nChen Yu Ying stopped sending messages in the group, Lin Li turned his head, and when they made eye contact, she was the first to look away.\nNice.\nSeems like it’s acquiesced.\nAs for Chen Yu Ying’s indifferent hum earlier, it didn’t even matter at all.\nHaha, now Ding Sihan will have to beg me to watch this video.\nHeh heh heh.\nTaking the cable car down the mountain, Lin Li wanted to spend an extra twenty to sit in the transparent bottom cable car, but unfortunately Bai Bufan and others didn’t want to spend the money.\nSo, they had to take the regular cable car.\nScenery-wise, although it was pretty breathtaking at first glance, after the initial few minutes of excitement passed, it was just like that.\nLooks like not taking the transparent cabin was the right decision, neither Lin Li nor Bai Bufan who hadn’t taken the cable car earlier were now sitting down looking at their phones.\nAs today’s activities concluded, photos began popping up one by one in the group chat.\nMost of them were combinations of just the three of them, probably to differentiate from the ones in the dormitory group.\nThere were also some photos with Lin Li and Bai Bufan, apart from group photos, when Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan were hitting persimmons, they took quite a few of them together.\n\"Bufan, do you want the photos from this morning?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Ah? Whatever.\" Bai Bufan, who was looking at his phone, casually raised his head and said.\n\"It’s too much hassle to pull you into the small group, I’ll just pick them out and send them to you one by one, that’s simpler.\" Lin Li nodded.\nBai Bufan, who had just lowered his head, raised it again: \"...\"\nWhat Lin Li said didn’t sound like human language.\nBut Bai Bufan wore a teasing smile and pointed at Lin Li like Zhen Zidan did, pointing for half a day and only managed to say one word: \"~~Fine.\"\nHe and Zhou Baowei often peeked at Lin Li’s phone screen, he knew about that group.\n\"Pulling you into the group won’t show historical messages anyway, it’s more hassle to resend them, what’s the point?\" Lin Li said confidently in the face of Bai Bufan’s speech-within-a-speech gaze, \"Don’t think I have ulterior motives, how could I possibly, I’m just too bored right now.\"\n\"You’re still fond of confessing your guilt.\" Bai Bufan sneered.\nHe didn’t care about this at all.\nThe only woman in this world who could tug at his heartstrings was Feifei, who now has a stable job, thoughts flying! Thoughts for Feifei! Fei Sect!\nThere were just over ten photos, and after forwarding them, Lin Li had nothing else to do and instinctively peeked at Bai Bufan’s phone, only to find he had the brightness set really low.\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\"Something nice.\" Bai Bufan laughed cheekily and voluntarily showed it.\nTurned out it was a novel.\n\"My Fertile Greek Myth Adventure\"\nThe following is the table of contents.\n1. Travels through the Greek world, gaining the fertile system.\n2. Ecstasy! Encountering the matriarchal big sis!\n3. It’s Zeus.\n5. Don’t talk about why I can get pregnant, why does this satisfy system conditions?\n6. System kicks in, fleeing fast.\n7. Meet youthful little girl.\n12. Still Zeus transformed.\n18. Meeting a fragrant soft pretty boy.\n20. How is it still Zeus.\n49. Losing faith in humans, why not try a bull?\n50. Zeus!\nSometimes my reading speed is too fast, by the time I realized what I had just seen, it was too late.\n\"Unbelievable.\"\nBai Bufan indeed had to lower the brightness, this content even Lin Li, a pervert, thought was perverse.\nAfterwards, Lin Li covered his eyes ——this system had quite a déjà vu feel to it, dear, system, we don’t watch, we don’t learn.\n\"Not unbelievable, you don’t understand, Greek mythology is indeed like that, Zeus and his children, once he fell in love with a princess and transformed into a bull... then again fell for a princess and turned into lightning to impregnate her...\"\nBai Bufan had some knowledge about Greek mythology, so he wanted to explain a bit, but Lin Li didn’t want to hear it, covered his ears and turned away.\nOn the other side, Zhou Baowei was browsing videos.\nLin Li got up to see what others were doing.\nZhang Haoyang was still playing his gaming console, clattering away.\n\"Keep it down, you don’t care when it’s someone else’s wife you’re playing with huh.\" Lin Li said.\n\"Mm.\" Zhang Haoyang nodded.\nThe scoundrel, condemned.\nWang Ze was watching a ball game, repeatedly dragging the timeline to watch the cheerleader segment during halftime.\nTrue sports fan, condemned.\n\"Dude, why are you still a simp?\" Lin Li said with an exasperated face when he sat down next to Chen Tianming and saw this.\nAll over were green chat records, Chen Tianming was sharing bits and pieces from today’s events.\n\"Where am I being a simp, Qiaoqiao and I are mutually invested, we chatted way more these days than last weekend, do I look like a simp?\" Chen Tianming tried to argue.\nLin Li retreated in horror.\n\"Crap, encountered a person skin asking for affirmation.\"\nBefore the nation’s founding, when goblins were still allowed to attain enlightenment, the weasel, almost ascending, would ask humans if it looked human, if told it looked like a human, it would ascend.\nThis is called weasel asking for affirmation.\nNow, Chen Tianming asking if he looked like a simp, isn’t he asking for affirmation in person skin?\nNo good, I must think carefully, because affirming and saying he doesn’t look like it might cause resentment, saying he does could result in being haunted.\nPerson skin also isn’t to be messed with.\n\"Get lost, you don’t understand anything. When Qiaoqiao and I become official, Lin Li you’ll be stuck standing outside looking after the door.\" Chen Tianming rudely pushed Lin Li away.\nGoing against convention it seems.\n\"She won’t even reply to you.\"\n\"Firstly, she may be busy right now, secondly, if she’s not busy and doesn’t reply, it proves she’s shy, shyness means...\" Chen Tianming revealed a warm smile.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSeeing Chen Tianming reveling in it, not knowing what kind of person Yao Qiaoqiao actually is, Lin Li didn’t say much more, better to respect and wish:\n\"Tianming, maybe one day you’ll evolve from simp to alpha wolf, truly having the chance to have Yao Qiaoqiao under your thumb.\"\n\"Firstly I’m not a simp, secondly I would never have Qiaoqiao under my thumb.\" Chen Tianming said seriously.\n\"Lin Li, what’s more likely is that only toilet paper can be under Tianming’s thumb.\" Bai Bufan raised his head to mock upon hearing.\n\"Apologize to the term under thumb.\" Lin Li was stunned for a moment, then couldn’t help but laugh.\nAfter a round, he returned to his seat, then frowned and looked at Zhou Baowei: \"Baowei, why are you still watching this video?\"\nHe was watching it just now, still watching, and it was a short video less than ten seconds long.\nHe’s seen it several times already, and it’s not even a beauty video.\nBai Bufan suddenly raised his head: \"Quick look at Baowei’s back-end, don’t be sneaky studying like Lin Li you beast!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nIn this competitive world, Bai Bufan trusts no one.\nSeeing Lin Li not moving to act, he immediately went forward and snatched Zhou Baowei’s phone, yet Zhou Baowei had no response to this action.\n\"Clean, nothing on the back-end, he’s not studying.\" Bai Bufan breathed a sigh of relief, then in the next moment his face showed fear: \"Baowei, your complexion is so bad, are you sick?\"\nLin Li heard this, looked closely, and only then noticed Zhou Baowei’s pale face, his whole body trembling slightly, now using one hand to press the base of the other hand.\nHis phone had been snatched, and he hadn’t even raised his head.\n\"Baowei, are you okay?\" Everyone present noticed, quickly stepping forward to show concern.\n\"Humans... shouldn’t... eat... raw... food...\"\n\"I... want... to... poo...\"\n\"bu——\"\nAs Zhou Baowei struggled to say these words, and an overwhelming offensive odor began to permeate the cable car, the terrified pale face spread from Zhou Baowei’s face to everyone inside the cable car.\nThe cable car was silent for a moment.\nThen.\n\"Oh crap!!!\"\n\"Your mom!!!\"\n\"No way!!!\"",

Ranked first is lying in bed with a fully charged phone, and not wanting to use the bathroom at all, yet needing to escape to the outdoors where the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius.\nAnd ranked second is right now.\nLin Li is furious.\nHe’s angry at himself and Bai Bufan for not stopping this guy from stuffing everything into his mouth just now.\nIt turns out it’s not Baowei’s toilet that’s going to suffer, but themselves!\nDigests way too fast!\nLin Li regrets using [Healing] yesterday; otherwise, maybe touching Baowei’s butt now could alleviate his symptoms.\nUnfortunately, some things are lost once missed.\n\"Let me out, let me out!\" Wang Ze screams from the depths of his soul.\nLin Li opens the cable car window to let the smell disperse as much as possible and points to the window saying to Wang Ze, \"The space is enough for you to crawl out, go ahead.\"\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nYou son of a bitch.\nHe wants to get out, but not in that way.\n\"At a time like this, you’re still joking around! Is this really the time for jokes?\" Wang Ze shouts loudly.\n\"Why are you shouting so loudly? What if you scare the shit out of Baowei!\" Lin Li is not overwhelmed at all and shouts even louder.\nWang Ze promptly shuts up and carefully glances at Zhou Baowei, who is still pale.\nEveryone is actually quite rational. Despite the shouting, no one is moving around recklessly, knowing that such behavior on a cable car is dangerous.\n\"Cable car, damn cable car, hurry up! Speed up!\" Bai Bufan, face pale, clutches the leather seat tightly, with a hint of plea in his voice.\nCable car: \"...\"\nIn reality, there is an emergency button inside the cable car to call staff, but everyone knows, even though the situation may seem urgent now, it’s not truly urgent.\nBesides, pressing it might not solve the problem and could easily send Baowei completely off to another planet.\nThe calmest person in the cable car is Chen Tianming, who hasn’t been shouting the whole time.\nA role model for us all.\nLin Li was about to consider him as the backbone but upon checking, saw his phone screen glowing green, the conversation naturally with Yao Qiaoqiao, and the content:\n\"Chen Tianming: I’m doomed, I’m doomed, I’m doomed!\"\n\"Chen Tianming: I might die!!!\"\n\"Chen Tianming: ...\"\nSo far, Yao Qiaoqiao hasn’t replied.\nHumans can’t have a dog as a backbone, so Lin Li dismissively waves his hand. This kid Chen Tianming stinks worse than Baowei’s fart.\nLin Li returned to his original position, sliding towards Bai Bufan, then earnestly asked, \"Baowei, can you hold on? There’s about twenty minutes left.\"\nThe cable car hasn’t been on its way long.\n\"I, don’t, know.\" Zhou Baowei mutters with difficulty, pressing his hands on his stomach, \"But I feel like I’m on the brink of shitting.\"\n\"Your butt isn’t pointy now, is it? Don’t let it flow, we don’t need that!\" Bai Bufan says with a tearful face.\n\"Hold on! You have to hold on! I’m praying for you right now, you can do it.\" Zhang Haoyang, slightly religious, folds his hands and starts praying.\nBut what Lin Li hears sounds more like a chant of passing than praying.\n\"Yes, yes, Baowei, hang in there! Just twenty minutes, and you can finally let it all out!\" Wang Ze quickly chimes in, then adds, \"And remember, never believe any fart at this time. It’s all temptation, all traps! Be cautious about a potential explosion!\"\n\"Don’t, say, such words, don’t, don’t say, pull, that word!!\" Zhou Baowei screams like a suppressed beast.\nThe compartment falls silent for a moment.\n\"Slap!\" Wang Ze slaps his own face, desperately remorseful, saying, \"Sorry, sorry, sorry, please forgive me!!\"\nI really deserve to die.\n\"I declare the cabin has officially entered emergency lockdown! All of you, must speak carefully! Give Baowei the best environment to hold it in!\"\nGrand Commander Lin has to step up now, and strictly commands.\nEveryone immediately goes silent, hardly daring to breathe.\nEveryone is extremely tense, feeling like every second is dragging.\n\"bu——\"\nAt this time, a fart sounds remarkably clear.\nEveryone nervously looks at Zhou Baowei, but he shakes his head: \"Just, a fart.\"\nEveryone breathes a sigh of relief.\n\"But, but next time, I, can’t, guarantee.\" Zhou Baowei grits his teeth.\nEveryone’s hearts are up in their throats again.\nPeople try to look for solutions online, but realize it’s all useless fluff with no practicality.\nLooking at Zhou Baowei again, his expression has turned somewhat blank, his pupils gradually losing focus.\nFeeling that the carousel of life is flashing before his eyes, maybe he’s already been dead for a while.\n\"Hold on, just ten more minutes, and we’ll reach the shore.\" Lin Li says with a twisted, fearful face, as Baowei only lets out another fart.\n\"Ten minutes, I possibly... possibly...\" Zhou Baowei’s voice is extremely weak and doesn’t finish the sentence.\nWhen he lifts his head, showing an expression more blazing than a blazing fist, everything is understood without words.\nHe’s reached his limit.\nCan’t make it to the shore.\n\"Baowei, I have a bag here, black one.\" Bai Bufan rummages through his bag and finds a bag.\n\"Poop in this? We carry it down?\" Wang Ze asks for Zhou Baowei.\n\"No, when we get off the cable car, use it to cover your head, so no one knows it was you.\" Bai Bufan shakes his head.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nShould Bai Bufan be labeled a genius, or just a genius.\nZhou Baowei turns his head to glare at Bai Bufan.\nAlthough he doesn’t speak, his expression seems like he wants to plant his butt on Bai Bufan’s head.\nTime continued to pass.\nZhou Baowei’s forehead and neck were covered in sweat.\n\"What do I do? I really can’t hold on anymore...\" Zhou Baowei’s voice had a noticeable choke, his vision blurred, unsure if it was sweat or tears streaming down his forehead.\nAmong everyone present, speaking of despair, who could really be more despairing than him?\nEveryone feared he would really come out, but he was the one most afraid of really coming out himself.\nHe was in such agony that he was on the verge of a breakdown.\nOnce he lost control and the door failed to stay shut, even if everyone present promised not to speak of it, it would still become the nightmare of his life.\n\"It’s okay, don’t cry.\" At this moment, Lin Li’s voice was already faint in his ears.\nThen suddenly Zhou Baowei felt a sting in his arm, difficultly turning his head to see, only to find Lin Li holding his Pingjiang Warriors medal and pricking his fingertip with its pin.\n\"The pain might help you relieve a bit.\" Lin Li said.\nSeems like it might?\nNot sure.\n\"Then, keep, pricking.\" Zhou Baowei was willing to believe any method now, so he responded with difficulty.\nLin Li couldn’t bear to see his brother cry, and neither could everyone else.\nUpon noticing Zhou Baowei’s voice breaking into tears, the carriage fell completely silent, Chen Tianming had already put his phone down, and Bai Bufan was anxiously scratching his head, already using his hand to hold a black plastic bag, constantly making gestures, probably planning to deliver the baby already.\n\"It’ll be fine, Baowei, you think you’ve reached your limit, but humans can push beyond their limits.\" Lin Li continued to comfort him.\nSimultaneously, he smudged the blood from the pin onto the \"Limit Breaking Talisman\" hidden in his palm.\nSorry, \"Limit Breaking Talisman\", I didn’t expect your first use to be in this kind of situation, but there’s nothing else we can do now.\nSince it said it can break the limits in all aspects, then the sphincter contraction ability and endurance should be no problem, right?\nAlthough the effect lasts only ten minutes, it’s enough.\nAs for the fifty system currency, I still have over nine hundred in my pocket, I can afford this.\nIt’s a loss if a brother is played to death so early, at least wait until after the class division when he’s of no use before dying.\nThe moment the blood latched onto the \"Limit Breaking Talisman\", it absorbed it completely, slightly discoloring the talisman paper itself.\n\"Baowei! I just saw a massage technique that might help you relieve and assist you in overcoming your limits!\" After saying this, Lin Li got up and placed his hand firmly on Zhou Baowei’s neck, then his hands began to pretend to massage.\n\"Lin Li, are you crazy! You can’t stimulate him at a time like this!\" Bai Bufan was shattered, quickly stepping forward with the bag.\n\"Oh shit!\" Zhou Baowei shouted.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Lin Li was also a bit nervous, having never used the \"Limit Breaking Talisman\" himself, unsure of how it felt once applied.\n\"My body’s having a sudden resurgence!\"\n\"... Much better now, I felt it was peaking just now, but now it feels like it’s withdrawing.\"\nZhou Baowei’s complexion visibly showed more vitality compared to just now.\n\"Good, good! Hold on, hold on, it’s estimated just five or six minutes now, we can already see the foot of the mountain! Let your sphincter unleash its true potential!\" Lin Li breathed a sigh of relief and said passionately.\nLin Li was quite gratified.\nWhat is cultivation for if not to help the aunty’s kids you meet fly... if not for sealing Zhou Baowei’s rear?\n\"As long as my stomach doesn’t spasm again, I should be fine. I’ll try to hold on.\" Zhou Baowei nodded and, for the first time in a while, managed to smile again.\nThe feeling of being saved at such a critical moment was truly wonderful.\n\"Keep it up! Frequent contracter brother!\" Seeing this, Bai Bufan tearfully encouraged.\n\"Go sphincter!\"\n\"Go anus!\"\n\"Go large intestine!\"\nSeeing Zhou Baowei smile through his tears, everyone felt relieved and sent their blessings one after another.\n\"Hmm, I don’t know if it was Lin Li’s massage or if the stomach spasms have ended? Anyway, I really feel a lot better now.\" Zhou Baowei nodded, even having the leisure to wipe the sweat off his forehead with his arm.\nThe tense atmosphere gradually relaxed a bit, and the foot of the mountain was getting closer.\nThe dawn of victory was right before their eyes.\nLin Li also took the opportunity to observe the \"Limit Breaking Talisman\" during the massage interval.\nIt has been almost five minutes since it was applied, and the color seems to be fading slowly.\nDoes the blood completely bind usage to the original owner?\nLin Li curiously peeled it off and stuck it to his arm.\nNo sensation at all, but—\n\"It’s coming out, it’s coming out, my stomach’s acting up again, I’m going to lose control, sorry everyone!\" Zhou Baowei suddenly sat up straight with a sharp scream.\nEveryone was dumbfounded.\nThis suddenly? No warning signs?\nOh shit! Lin Li hurriedly reapplied the talisman.\n\"The bag, the bag! Turn your heads, Baowei, just let go!\" Bai Bufan already stepped forward too.\n\"It’s fine now, much better again, this shit seems to be joking with me.\" Zhou Baowei breathed a sigh of relief, waving towards Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Are you fucking playing with us, Baowei?\" Bai Bufan squinted his eyes.\nHe suspected that Zhou Baowei himself was the joke here.\nZhou Baowei: \"... I really wasn’t, bro, would a guy like me joke about soiling himself? I’m not Xiaohui Jun.\"\n\"You better not be.\" Bai Bufan’s mistrust had reached its peak at this point.\nBut Zhou Baowei also felt really wronged.\nHe didn’t know what happened with his body just now, one moment everything was breaking down, the next it was fully revived, able to hold tight again.\nThe human body is quite miraculous, isn’t it?\nLin Li stared at the talisman on Zhou Baowei’s back, blinking his eyes.\nI really want to rip it off again.\nSeems like fun.",

      "content": "Chapter 163: Chapter 141: The Concluding Banquet Will Open Again\nLin Li finally held back.\nAfter all, when the body is already relaxed, sudden shocks and repetition can easily break down defenses.\nThe main thing is, Lin Li is currently facing Zhou Baowei’s back.\nIf something burst through layers of obstacles and appeared in front of him, that sort of thing is definitely not wanted.\nJust now the experiment was indeed meaningful.\nBleeding is equivalent to binding the user, while the activation condition for the \"Propelling Limit Charm\" is that it must always adhere to the user’s body. As for whether the time it’s off counts within the ten minutes, that part is yet unclear.\nLin Li felt somewhat relieved.\nSince starting his cultivation, the biggest victim has been Bai Bufan, the greatest beneficiary Zhou Baowei.\nIndeed, it confirmed the old saying, when a man attains enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascend to Heaven.\nAs good brothers of his, these two have also ascended to Heaven—Bai Bufan went to the Western Heaven, Zhou Baowei went to the Western Heaven.\n...\n\"Bang.\"\nFinally, the gondola reached the station, and the staff prepared to open the door.\nZhou Baowei took a deep breath, intently staring at the nearby bathroom.\nThe \"Propelling Limit Charm\" breaks limits, but still has limitations. As time passed, Zhou Baowei lost the composure he just had. If not for the \"Propelling Limit Charm,\" he would likely have flooded the gondola long ago, and everyone would have cried and begged him, \"Uncle don’t unleash, I’m scared!\"\nAs soon as the door opened, the staff’s greeting wasn’t finished before they saw Zhou Baowei bolt out.\nYunliu Mountain counts as a tourist spot, so there would definitely be paper in the bathroom; hence, he didn’t even bother taking his bag.\n\"Huh? How can he run that fast? Surely faster than my fifty-meter sprint?\" Bai Bufan paused his movement, shocked by Zhou Baowei’s speed.\n\"Human potential is endless. Bao Wei runs at extreme speed when extremely wanting to relieve himself, isn’t that completely normal?\" Lin Li explained Zhou Baowei’s behavior.\nThe \"Propelling Limit Charm\" still deserved its fifty-system-currency price, the boost was very noticeable.\n\"Well, it makes sense.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\n\"Let’s go, check on Bao Wei.\" Lin Li asked Bai Bufan as he walked out of the gondola.\n\"I understand visiting prisoners, performers, patients. But visiting poop, what’s the point?\" Bai Bufan’s curiosity was piqued by Lin Li’s words.\n\"I have a hunch, Bao Wei is going to unleash something big this time.\"\n\"...He sure is about to release something big, fine, let’s wait at the entrance.\"\n...\nZhou Baowei leaned on Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s shoulders, virtually dragged forward.\n\"What’s wrong? What happened?\" Noticing the three, Xue Jian’s expression instantly turned worried, quickly approaching to ask, \"What’s going on with Bao Wei?\"\nBai Bufan: \"Pooping.\"\nLin Li: \"Using the toilet.\"\nFrom this answer, it’s clear Lin Li was much more elegant than Bai Bufan.\nZhou Baowei nodded too.\nXue Jian: \"?\"\nZhou Baowei could barely walk on his own, his lips pale, gasping heavily as if he’d drop at any moment.\nYet these kids insist it’s because of a poop?\nWho’s ever used the toilet ending up like this?\n\"Be honest! What exactly happened? Now’s not the time for jokes!\"\nXue Jian’s face grew stern, his tone was filled with anger, given the situation seemed grave but these mischievous kids were still playing tricks and lying.\nBai Bufan had been scolded by Xue Jian way less than Lin Li, and feared him already. Now an angry Xue Jian was even more terrifying, with just a shout, he trembled.\nHowever, he then felt somewhat aggrieved: \"No, teacher, Bao Wei really pooped to this state. I swear on my life, we’ve done nothing else, just Bao Wei ate...\"\nLin Li didn’t swear on his life, merely concurred: \"Teacher, really it’s not serious, Bao Wei will be fine after resting.\"\nKnowing this, Zhou Baowei was exhausted not due to using the toilet, but the aftermath of the expired \"Propelling Limit Charm\" in his pocket. Yet he couldn’t mention that.\nThen Xue Jian’s face turned even colder:\n\"If during this life someone simply eats something bad and ends up like this, I might as well have lived as a dog all my life.\"\n...\n\"He just ate something bad, and then pooped into exhaustion, but he’s fine now, an appropriate dose of Montmorillonite suspension and he’ll be all right.\" At Yunliu’s medical point, a doctor gently narrated to Xue Jian.\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nHe turned to see Zhou Baowei, who was no longer a fading sight of death, lively but appearing ashamed. Indeed, his heart did ease.\nHis worries were relieved, yet his heart was tired.\nHow should I regard this first half of my life?\nThinking about it, Xue Jian painfully pressed his palm on his forehead, realizing how speaking rashly in anger could complicate life.\nXue Jian turned toward Lin Li and Bai Bufan; both instantly touched their noses solemnly, expressionless.\nBut Xue Jian felt even more drained.\nWhy on earth in this world can using a toilet end up like this?\nThough Zhou Baowei has always hung out with Lin Bai’s ambiguous creatures, Xue Jian knew he was relatively well-behaved, yet unexpected this kid could cause him such worry.\nLin Li’s danger level +1.\n\"Sigh, it’s good that you’re fine now, Baowei. From now on, don’t eat raw things anymore, and remember to eat in moderation,\" Xue Jian said with a resigned tone on the way back to the bus with the three of them.\n\"Teacher, I swear I’ll never eat raw things again for the rest of my life,\" Zhou Baowei nodded heavily, making a heartfelt vow.\nToday’s experience was terrifying. It wasn’t thirty minutes, it felt like thirty years.\n\"What about sashimi?\" Lin Li asked upon hearing this.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nAfter thinking for a moment, Zhou Baowei changed his wording, \"Teacher, I’ll never eat things that should be cooked raw again in my life.\"\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nThis definitely wouldn’t be the last time, Xue Jian was sure.\n...\nSince they had to take Baowei to the medical station, they wasted quite a bit of time. After everyone got on the bus, it immediately headed for the base so that everyone could retrieve their luggage.\n\"Thanks to you both this time,\" Zhou Baowei finally found a moment while packing his things to thank Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\n\"We’re all buddies, why are you thanking me as if I’m your dad?\" Bai Bufan waved his hand dismissively.\n\"Exactly, haven’t you heard the saying? ’A father is the biggest danger in times of peace, but in times of danger, fathers like us are your greatest support,’\" Lin Li nodded in agreement.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nWhat a pair of bastards.\n\"Who can stand seeing their brother cry out loud? I really can’t bear it,\" Lin Li laughed, as the three of them walked arm in arm with their luggage towards the door of the bus.\nAt the doorway, Chen Tianming poked his head out, pointing to himself, \"It’s not just the three of you in this room, what about me? Is anyone going to pay attention to me?\"\n\"Hmph, I’ll share this grievance with Qiaoqiao, now there’s a new topic to talk about.\" Chen Tianming immediately became cheerful again.\n...\nLuggage stowed, everyone was seated, and with a hum, the engine’s roar made the bus vibrate.\nAnd so the scenery started moving backward.\n\"The autumn trip is over,\" Chen Yu Ying gazed out the window and sighed softly, \"It feels so fast, yet it feels so slow.\"\n\"Yeah, even though it was just two days and two nights, it felt like twenty-two days,\" Lin Li agreed with a nod and a smile.\n\"I’m already feeling a bit of withdrawal,\" Chen Yu Ying clutched her phone, her gaze following the receding base, but it seemed unfocused.\n\"Come on, class president, quitting is really hard, but I believe you can definitely succeed, you can do it!\" Lin Li turned his head to cheer up Chen Yu Ying.\nShe was motivating herself, how could she put herself down?\n\"It’s not that kind of withdrawal, it’s just that these past two days have been so much fun, like a dream, and now it’s all over, there’s a strong sense of loss, hmm... It’s like a grand banquet is over, after seeing off the guests, you return alone to face the mess, there’s that kind of gap,\"\nChen Yu Ying said despondently.\nLin Li certainly understood what Chen Yu Ying meant by withdrawal symptoms.\nLin Li also traveled often.\nEvery time he returned from \"traveling\" through Quark, UC, Thunder, Baidu, Manpin, etc., he would experience severe withdrawal symptoms.\nReturning to reality from carefree bliss.\nTurning around, seeing the disappointment still written in Chen Yu Ying’s eyes, Lin Li smiled and also looked out the window, \"Class rep, isn’t it just a matter of looking forward to the next banquet?\"\n\"But there won’t be a next time.\"\n\"The world doesn’t have a rule that only when the school organizes can we go out and have fun, right?\" Lin Li tapped the car window with the back of his hand, then turned back to look into Chen Yu Ying’s eyes.\n\"You can invite the girls; I can invite the guys. Although there’ll be fewer people than this time, I don’t think it’ll be any less fun. It might even be more fun because of the freedom.\"\n\"Short-term like the National Day or longer-term like winter vacation, there are so many opportunities.\"\n\"So, class president, let’s turn the disappointment into anticipation.\"\n\"The weak me is already dead, and now it’s an even weaker me, since the withdrawal symptoms beat me, then let’s not quit, let’s just continue to have fun!\" Lin Li raised his fist, his tone light-hearted yet passionate.\n\"You’re not allowed to say such weak things so boastfully,\" Chen Yu Ying had been listening intently, but burst out laughing at his last words.\n\"Xiaolinzi is right on this, Ying Bao, let’s just hang out again next time, we can catch up both before and after class separation, let’s not act like strangers after dividing classes.\" Ding Sihan leaned over and hugged Chen Yu Ying, rubbing her face against hers.\n\"So if I invite you to hang out next time, would you agree?\" Chen Yu Ying asked after finally pushing Ding Sihan away.\n\"Of course,\" Ding Sihan nodded.\n\"I’ll try,\" Lin Li also nodded.\nAs long as the master doesn’t assign me any tasks.\nGaze.\nLin Li withdrew his gaze from the window and met Chen Yu Ying’s eyes.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t speak, just stared at Lin Li.\n\"Alright, I was wrong, I mean, definitely will, not just try,\" Lin Li smiled and corrected himself.\nThe master can get lost; suddenly remembered that slavery was abolished after the founding of the nation, I’m already standing tall, so I can do whatever I want, nothing the system can control!\nOnly then did Chen Yu Ying withdraw her gaze.\nLin Li continued to look out the window; the scenery is really lovely.\n...\nChen Yu Ying looked at her phone, but the screen was off.\nIf the ground were a little lower, it would be nice.\nThat way, the little legs poking out from the hem of her pale blue dress would keep swinging back and forth in front of the seat.",

      "content": "Chapter 164: Chapter 142: Legs or Chest? I choose both.\nOn the return journey, the system didn’t trigger any new tasks.\nAlso, because Bai Bufan often peeks and spies on me, and even takes off my headphones to listen to what I’m listening to, Lin Li has no way to study at all.\nLin Li made a mental note of this grudge, and he will definitely get back at Bai Bufan tonight.\nHaving nothing much to do, Lin Li didn’t want to play games or read novels.\nThe main concern was whether he had enough self-control. Some entertainment activities, if not done for a while, seem like you’ve let them go and have no desire for them. But once you pick them up again, it’s easy to get hooked again.\nSo Lin Li simply chose to take a nap.\nHe woke up earlier today than usual, and barely slept at noon, feeling a bit sleepy.\nWhen he woke up with his head leaning against the glass window, he wasn’t leaning toward Chen Yu Ying like last time. Lin Li glanced at her round shoulder, exposed because of her off-shoulder top, unsure if he should feel fortunate or regretful.\n\"Where are we now?\" Rubbing his eyes, Lin Li glanced at his phone. It was already 6 PM, and his stomach was getting a bit hungry, so he asked softly.\n\"We’ll probably arrive at school in ten minutes; we’ve already left the highway,\" Chen Yu Ying replied.\n\"We’re already in Xiling, and the air here really stinks. I still miss the air in Pingjiang; Pingjiang’s air is so fresh and sweet, with a strange luxury to it.\"\nBai Bufan, who was regularly checking on Lin Li, also chimed in.\n\"Kid, they don’t issue green cards for Pingjiang here,\" Lin Li sneered as he looked back.\nHe pulled open the curtain to look outside; the sun had already set, but it wasn’t too dark yet.\n\"Ding Sihan, what are you looking at?\" Lin Li stretched lazily and then looked to his left.\nChen Yu Ying was still sorting her photo album, and Ding Sihan was looking at her phone. Curious about the screen’s content, Lin Li asked.\n\"Live streaming?\"\n\"Yeah, watching a recommendation stream. I’m waiting for a discount,\" Ding Sihan nodded and then asked, \"This blogger’s discounts during live streaming are quite good. Lin Li, Ying Bao doesn’t mind this little bit, but since you’re also broke, should I share it with you?\"\nYour words are so hurtful.\nLin Li didn’t have a good impression of live streaming sales that crazily call out to family, so he shook his head, \"No need, for shopping streamers, I only watch Emperor Qin Shi Huang.\"\n\"Emperor Qin Shi Huang? Are his deals really good? Is his nickname Emperor Qin Shi Huang? I’ve never heard of him, let me search.\" Hearing this, Ding Sihan was curious and exited the live stream interface, \"How many followers does he have? Which platform? I can’t find it.\"\n\"Of course, you can’t find him, Ying Zheng retired from the circle — he’s out of the biosphere.\"\n\"...You’re talking about the real Emperor Qin Shi Huang? What does he have to do with shopping streamers!\" Coming to her senses, Ding Sihan was speechless.\n\"So many books became popular because of him, and scholars who liked those books fell into the pit because of him. Isn’t Ying Zheng the top shopping streamer?\" Lin Li looked at Ding Sihan with a gaze like she was silly.\nChen Yu Ying, Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nDon’t even mention it, just don’t.\n\"My mom told me not to talk to foolish people.\" Ding Sihan shook her head.\n\"No wonder I’ve never seen Xiaoding talking to herself; now I understand,\" Lin Li realized.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Lin Li!!\"\nOnce again, Chen Yu Ying became the strongest shield.\nLin Li passed the remaining time by watching an episode of Family Guy.\nIt feels like instead of broadcasting the Spring Festival Gala this year, they should broadcast Family Guy. This cartoon has both dumplings and childbirth, and even dumplings giving birth. Doesn’t that meet the promotional needs well?\nThe scenery outside had become particularly familiar; it was the scene Lin Li saw every day while biking. Left turn, straight, right turn, and the gate of Nansang Middle School appeared in front of him.\nQuite a few private cars of parents were already parked here, waiting to pick up their children.\n\"Alright, we’re at school. Everyone, gather your things and get off the bus in an orderly manner. Students who need to go back to the classroom to get things can temporarily leave their luggage at the entrance and let security guard it for a while. Have fun these days, and when school starts, focus well. Don’t forget to do your holiday homework, and don’t be late for the evening self-study on Tuesday.\"\nAfter sitting for three to four hours, his body felt uncomfortable. After doing several stretching exercises and taking out the luggage for Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, Lin Li returned to the classroom himself.\nHe placed the specialty Holy Sword, baton, and magic wand brought back from Pingjiang on the windowsill and put a few textbooks into his backpack.\n\"Why are you still at the entrance?\" Lin Li asked, pushing his bike to the gate and noticing that Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan were still standing there.\n\"Today’s return time was later than expected, so the teacher notified the parents’ group, which made my parents depart later too. So, they got stuck in the holiday rush hour traffic,\" Chen Yu Ying explained.\n\"Same here,\" Ding Sihan nodded.\nZhou Baowei is fully responsible, suggesting execution by shooting, and Lin Li would vote in favor.\n\"What a pity, my bike can only take one person, otherwise I would surely give you guys a ride home,\" warm-hearted Lin Li said dramatically, patting his bicycle.\n\"Ah, I’m feeling a bit hungry,\" Ding Sihan said, rubbing her stomach and sighing.\n\"Ding Sihan, want some fried chicken?\" Lin Li asked upon hearing this.\n\"Yes!\" Ding Sihan reached out her hand.\n\"What good teeth you have, Ding Sihan, you eat it; no matter what you eat, I’ll cover the bill.\" Lin Li turned his head to point behind him.\nDing Sihan and Chen Yu Ying looked over their shoulder.\nLin Li was pointing to the security office, or more accurately, to the gate that requires swiping cards to enter the security office. The structure is made of steel, and indeed, it would require good teeth to eat it.",

If you go, I can take you there since it’s on my way home.\"\nThe two discussed for a bit, then nodded and temporarily stored their luggage with security.\nLin Li also chose to walk, pushing his bicycle beside the two.\n\"What a cute little girl.\" Chen Yu Ying exclaimed softly.\nThey saw a chubby little girl, who looked at most four or five years old, wearing a puffy dress, bouncing as she walked, very adorable, coming from the other side of the intersection.\nEven the corpses would feel warm watching her.\nAs they got closer, they saw she was clutching a fifty yuan note and mumbling, \"Mouth ulcer, mouth ulcer, mouth ulcer...\"\nShe was alone.\nAlthough public safety has improved these days, a child this age shouldn’t be alone.\nThe three looked back towards where she came from and saw a woman who, upon noticing Lin Li and the others, waved to them and gestured dismissively.\nProbably training the child to go to the pharmacy alone.\nOnly then did the three relax, and Lin Li smiled slightly before suddenly saying to Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan: \"Chewing gum, chewing gum, do you two want to eat super delicious chewing gum?\"\nChen Yu Ying was puzzled.\nDing Sihan was puzzled but reached out: \"Sure.\"\nHowever, Lin Li ignored Ding Sihan’s hand and looked at the little girl: \"Chewing gum, chewing gum, super delicious chewing gum.\"\nThe little girl was briefly attracted by Lin Li’s voice, but soon remembered her task, clutching her money tightly, her eyes set only on the pharmacy, mumbling her target: \"Mouth candy, chewing gum, chewing gum...\"\nLin Li watched with satisfaction as she walked into the pharmacy and loudly raised her money at the counter: \"Sister, my mom wants to eat super delicious chewing gum!\"\nCounter: \"?\"\nSighing in relief, Lin Li dusted off his clothes, finished and walked away, hiding his success and name.\nThe mother from afar seemed to express gratitude to the three for escorting her child.\nOnly after being stared at by Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying did he feel awkward and scratched his head: \"What’s up?\"\n\"Brute.\" Ding Sihan summed up concisely.\nThen continued to comment: \"I can’t tell if she would be more unlucky to encounter you or a trafficker. That little girl’s mom just waved to you, if she knew what you did, her hand would have been on your face.\"\nChen Yu Ying didn’t scold Lin Li, but nodded heavily, clearly agreeing with Ding Sihan’s words.\nYou’re really too bad, bad to the core!\n\"But you two were just laughing too, I heard you,\" Lin Li said innocently, then smiled wickedly: \"And this is bad? If her mom wasn’t behind, I would have done something even more wicked.\"\n\"Lin Li, would you really be that disgusting?\" Ding Sihan stopped walking, her features revealing disdain.\nThen Ding Sihan saw Lin Li pull out a mandatory math book from his backpack: \"I was just planning to force her to learn this.\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nLin Li’s malevolent thoughts are really too terrifying.\n\"Xunzi won, how did Mencius ever say ’At the beginning, humans are inherently good’.\" Ding Sihan shook her head in frustration.\n\"Hey, you’re wrong there, Old Meng was clever; he also said, ’Without the heart of compassion, one is not human; without the heart of shame, one is not human; without the heart of courtesy and modesty, one is not human; without the heart of distinguishing right from wrong, one is not human; so when Brother Meng sees me, he won’t treat me as human, he might treat me like a roadside wild Bai Bufan.’\"\nLin Li waved his finger, displaying his erudition.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nOnly Lin Li can be so proud of not being considered human.\n...\n\"We’re here, it’s this way, what do you want to eat? Too bad not many stalls are out at this hour. When I come back from self-study in the evenings, the street is full, smells amazing, I’ve given in a few times.\" At the snack street, Lin Li pointed to rows of snack stalls on the road.\nThe stalls are rather sparse now, incomparable to nighttime.\n\"I’ll have some marinated snacks.\" Ding Sihan directly headed to the nearest big stall, then looked at Chen Yu Ying and Lin Li: \"What do you guys want to eat? I’ll treat, other stalls are fine too.\"\n\"Then boss, I want this stall, name your price.\" Originally checking the price list, Lin Li suddenly said with grandeur.\n\"Lin Li, get lost! I’m not treating you!\" Ding Sihan wanted to kick Lin Li but could only kick his bike, and added fiercely: \"Don’t spend more than 20 yuan!\"\n\"Then boss, here’s the deal, give me 1.176 portions of cold shredded chicken, to-go.\" Lin Li had to change his tune, calculating for a moment before speaking.\nBoss: \"?\"\nWhat does 1.176 portions mean?\nDing Sihan fell silent looking at the seventeen-yuan-a-portion shredded chicken on the price list, then furiously explained: \"Boss, it’s just 20 yuan worth of cold shredded chicken.\"\nNot willing to spare even one yuan!\n\"Oh, oh.\" The boss understood.\n\"Ying Bao, what about you?\" Ding Sihan asked Chen Yu Ying.\n\"I’ll just have two pieces of marinated tofu.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, not refusing Ding Sihan’s treat, which showed their good relationship.\n\"Okay, all to-go, please wait a moment,\" After Ding Sihan also expressed her request, the boss nodded and began preparing marinated flavors and making dishes.\n\"Young man, do you prefer more leg or more breast meat?\" The boss asked while preparing to toss the shredded chicken.\n\"I value inner beauty more, prefer having a good personality, being kind to me.\" Discussing preferences with strangers isn’t great, especially with girls nearby, so Lin Li shook his head with a response against his true feelings.\n\"...\"\nThe boss stared at Lin Li.\nHis eyes scanned the knife used for cutting meat three times, wanting to chop but holding back.\nI was asking if you prefer more chicken leg meat or breast meat, and this is your answer?\nI’m selling marinated salads, not matchmaking!\nThe boss glared at Lin Li, who returned an innocent gaze, causing them both to freeze awkwardly.\nMeanwhile, being bystanders, laughter streamed consistently from Chen Yu Ying’s and Ding Sihan’s bent and trembling bodies.\n\"Boss, don’t secretly put chicken butt in my portion, okay?\" Lin Li, sharp-eyed, detected the boss’s dirty trick and immediately spoke.\nThe inner beauty of chicken butt is truly unappreciated by him.\n\"Don’t worry, it’s on the house,\" the boss’s smile lacked sincerity.\n\"No need.\"\nLin Li glanced at Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan and then decided to change his answer: \"Boss, I prefer more breast.\"\nThe boss sighed deeply, feeling that Lin Li still didn’t answer his question properly, but let it go, no need to ask again, regretting extra small talk, and began to toss the shredded chicken.\n\"Yo, Lin Li, why do you prefer more breast now, I feel like you mostly like legs?\" Ding Sihan joked.\n\"I actually like both, but mainly since you two have legs, I’m afraid you’d misunderstand if I said it.\" Lin Li sincerely told Ding Sihan.\nChen Yu Ying crossed her arms over her chest, covering herself, muttered ’pervert’ quietly, then turned her head, not letting Lin Li see her front.\nAs for Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nShe looked down and found five words on her toes—\"Lin Li must die.\"\nSeems like it’s Heaven’s will.\n\"Lin Li!!!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 166: Chapter 143: The Older Generation of Artists Are Also Uneasy\n\"Bye-bye, see you next week. Let us know in the group when you get home!\" Lin Li hung the cold chicken salad on the bike handle and waved goodbye to the two people heading back to the school gate as she continued cycling home.\n\"Yeah! Bye-bye!\"\n\"Damn Ding Sihan.\" Lin Li immediately changed her expression after getting on the bike.\nShe said she would treat us, but in the end, I paid for all three of us, and she still gritted her teeth at me, like a dog biting Lv Dongbin.\nHehe, women and girls, as expected, are evil and unreliable creatures!\nNo wonder when disasters happen, they usually let women and children escape first, because only that way can you quietly and effectively find a solution!\nThis weekend is a holiday, but Mom won’t be home until tomorrow morning or even noon, so Lin Li didn’t rush to eat dinner at the community cafeteria. Instead, she went home and downed all the cold chicken salad, then immediately sat down at her desk.\nShe set up her phone, adjusted the lighting, and lined up the textbooks on the desk, taking a deep breath.\n[Memory Boost], activate!\nAfter using it three times, an exhilarating sixty minutes of study came to an end.\nExhaling deeply, Lin Li liked the feeling of knowledge passing through her mind and actually leaving something behind.\nThen Lin Li connected the phone to the computer, edited, accelerated, and sent the video—done in one go.\nBai Bufan, hehe.\n...\nSince he didn’t live in Xiling, Bai Bufan had just arrived downstairs at home, looking for a parking spot.\nSeeing the phone notification that Lin Li had sent him a video, Bai Bufan immediately chuckled, dimmed the screen, and raised it up so that the back faced the driver’s seat where his father was. This way, even if he turned his head, he definitely wouldn’t see what Bai Bufan was watching.\nHe tapped open the ninety-second video after proper preparation.\nBai Bufan’s smile gradually faded, turning pale, lips began to quiver, and fear slowly swept over him.\nThe upper left corner displayed ’60x’, indicating this was a video at sixty times speed.\nDuring the whole sixty seconds, the sped-up Lin Li in the video was constantly focused on studying!!\nNot even a bathroom break!\nAfter sixty seconds, the video speed finally normalized, but in the frame, Lin Li stared at the camera, with a sinister grin, speaking in a slow and eerie tone:\n\"Bai... Bu... Fan... I didn’t break our agreement, I’m studying at home, so you can’t stop me now, right?\"\n\"I’m telling you! I’m going to study today, ·to·mor·row I’ll study, and ·the·day·after I’ll study, too.\"\n\"Every minute, every second, I’m going to study, no matter what you’re doing, remember, I! Am! Studying!\"\n\"Remember—\"\nThe screen grew darker, and the audio became intermittent:\n\"I... am... stu...dying...\"\nThe video abruptly stops at the word ’studying’, with Lin Li’s terrifying face still close up to the lens, glaring intensely.\nBai Bufan tossed the phone aside, trembling in fear, as if he had touched something extremely ominous.\nThis... is way too terrifying...\nWhat is Lin Li doing now? Could she still be studying?\n\"Come on, your mom finished cooking long ago and is just waiting for you to come back and eat.\" Father Bai finally found a parking spot, turned off the engine and closed the door, speaking to his son after getting out.\nOnly to see his son sitting in the back seat as if he’d lost his soul, like he’d seen a ghost, and immediately worriedly approached, \"Bufan, what’s wrong?\"\nBai Bufan snapped back to reality, fumbling several times before finally grabbing his phone, getting out of the car clumsily, even stumbling once, which scared Father Bai.\n\"Dad, I won’t eat dinner yet; I... I need to study first.\" Bai Bufan said weakly.\nFather Bai: \"?\"\nSlightly relieved, Father Bai took off his belt with a cold snort: \"Tell me, what exactly are you hiding? What trouble did you cause during the excursion?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n...\nAfter forwarding the video to the four-person group chat, Lin Li went downstairs for dinner.\nMinutes later, Bai Bufan sent Lin Li three sixty-second voice messages, which Lin Li didn’t open.\nSee, he’s anxious again.\nWhen Lin Li opened the group chat, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu were sending him question marks, while Chen Yu Ying was cheering him on.\nBut afterwards, they continued talking about the photos, discussing how to post them on their WeChat moments tonight.\nLin Li’s video didn’t cause a stir, but that was expected.\nJust like Zhuo Yongfei telling Lin Li he studied all vacation, Lin Li would just reply, ’You’re great.’\nThe only people Lin Li could influence were his few good buddies.\nSpeaking of which, should Lin Li send the video to Bao Wei as well?\nLin Li opened the chat with Bao Wei, but eventually exited.\nForget it, better not disgust him.\nBai Bufan mainly spent the entire excursion watching Lin Li, which was excessive, so this was a necessary punishment.\nBao Wei, count yourself lucky to evade this one.\n...\nAt eleven at night, having just spent fifteen minutes defeating the inner demon in his heart, Zhou Baowei lay comfortably on the bed, ready for sleep.\n\"Bai Bufan: ’Video’\"\nLooks like there’s something good again, but this jerk couldn’t send it earlier; he sends it after I finish fighting that demon.\nGuess I can only appreciate it with a pure artistic perspective.\nWatching the video, when Zhou Baowei saw what Lin Li did within a minute, his expression turned unpleasant.\nUpon seeing the back, it turned out to be disgusting Bai Bufan, and Zhou Baowei finally breathed a sigh of relief. He realized Bai Bufan was tagging him for a reason, preparing to join Bufan in snitching on Lin Li’s virtual family tree.\n\"Zhou Baowei: Finished watching, really disgusting.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: ’Video’\"\nHuh? There’s more?\nLin Li is truly a beast.\nZhou Baowei clicked on the second video.\nThe first 60 seconds were almost the same as the first video, except the lead was swapped to Bai Bufan. Although Bai didn’t appear as serious as Lin Li, he had indeed studied for a whole hour.\nThen came the terrifying curse segment without any fast-forward:\n\"Zhou... Bao... Wei...\"\n\"You called me to game just now~ I said I was booked~ Haha~ Actually I was lying to you~ I was studying~ Studying~ No, it should be—\"\n\"I’m... also... studying...\"\nThe creepy tone and pitch were exactly the same, the close-up shots were exact replicas.\n\"Ah!!!!\" The phone was smashed onto the pillow, Zhou Baowei gasped for air.\nSending horror videos in the middle of the night, two of them, Bai Bufan is just as inhumane!\nAfter a long time, his breathing finally calmed down.\n\"Two idiots, just study if you want, what’s it got to do with me, damn it!\"\nZhou Baowei wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead, but after this commotion, he no longer had the mood to play with his phone. He turned off the light, preparing to sleep.\n\"I’m... studying...\"\nA minute later, in the darkness, Zhou Baowei abruptly sat up on the bed.\nAs soon as he closed his eyes, Lin Li’s page-turning sounded in his left ear while Bai Bufan’s writing sounded in his right.\nThe two simultaneously uttered demonic whispers.\n\"I’m... studying...\"\nWho the hell can sleep like this!\n\"Dogs!! Dogs!!\" Zhou Baowei roared, then his gaze awkwardly locked onto the desk not far away.\nHe let out a bleak smile.\nThen got up.\nDamn you, Lin Li.\nDamn you, Bai Bufan.\n...\nFather Zhou got up at night to go to the bathroom and found the light in his son’s room was still on.\nHe sighed and went to push open the door: \"Why isn’t it...\"\nDamn, it’s a ghost in the middle of the night.\nHis own son secretly studying in the middle of the night.\nFather Zhou closed the door and opened it again.\nDamn! It’s real!\n\"Son, what’s going on? Why have you suddenly taken to studying?\" Father Zhou asked concernedly as he stepped forward.\n\"It’s nothing, Dad, just suddenly felt like studying, really nothing.\" Zhou Baowei waved his hand, his expression indifferent and emotionless.\n\"Ah... Umm... Then... shall I make you some midnight snacks?\" Father Zhou felt something stuck in his throat.\n\"... Okay.\" Zhou Baowei hesitated for a moment before nodding.\nFather Zhou’s heart skipped a beat.\nWhy did he hesitate?!\nIs this still Bao Wei?\n...\nAs a teacher, Xue Jian basically never turned off his phone notifications.\nNot fully asleep yet, he heard the notification sound and picked up the phone to check.\n\"Father Zhou: Teacher, did something happen during our kid’s autumn outing?\"\n\"Xue Jian: Bao Wei? Is he having another stomach problem? Or is he studying too?\"\n\"Father Zhou: Eh? How did you know that? Is nighttime studying actually a school requirement?\"\n\"Father Zhou: Then I think it’s unreasonable for the school to make such a demand...\"\nXue Jian sighed and scrolled down the chat.\nAround seven in the evening.\n\"Father Bai: Teacher, did something happen during our kid’s autumn outing?\"\n\"Father Bai: Why is he only thinking about studying?\"\n\"...\"\nXue Jian rubbed his temples with a headache, spent ten minutes chatting briefly with Father Zhou, and the other party finally felt a bit reassured.\nThen he looked at the contact list, found \"Lin Li’s Mom.\"\nNext, he reverently bowed three times.\n\"Please, dear parent, don’t send me any messages, I’m begging you.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 167: Chapter 144: There Are More Brothers in This World\nThe bed at home is always the most comfortable.\nOr maybe it’s because Bao Wei, the Tractor Force, isn’t buzzing incessantly in my ears anymore.\nGroggily, Lin Li turned off the phone alarm, reached for the mobile-controlled power source by the bedside, attached the positive clip to his left hand and the negative clip to his right hand, and turned it on.\n\"Hiss—\" As the current surged through his body, Lin Li gasped.\nHe remembered, the memories of being a mom all came flooding back to him from the day before yesterday, and he immediately felt wide awake.\nFeeling energized.\nDetaching the charging clips from his fingers, Lin Li nodded with satisfaction. Isn’t this more effective than rubbing your eyes and washing your face?\nHe opened the system marketplace to redeem today’s \"Random Spirit Stone\" and \"Limit-Breaking Talisman.\"\nUgh, why is it low-grade again? Do gamblers never get a house?\nHaven’t won even once up to now, even a medium-grade would be fine.\nAfter today’s spending, he still has 860 system currency left, and the inventory consists of four spirit stones and two limit-breaking talismans—originally supposed to be eight, but Lin Li used four spirit stones last night to improve his Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body.\nEffort does bring rewards. Lin Li glanced at his left hand, two fingers followed his thoughts and emitted arcs that connected together, though not very visible during the day, the faint electric popping could be heard.\nWith the Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body’s effect boosted by 200%, consuming four spirit stones, Lin Li made significant progress in tolerance, storage, and discharge of electricity.\nThe maximum distance the electric arc can attack has reached five to six centimeters.\nShort indeed, but quite cute.\nThe me of yesterday was a useless waste in the Cultivation Realm, but today is different from the past, today I would be a slightly useful waste in the Cultivation Realm.\nThat’s equivalent to evolving from non-recyclable trash to recyclable trash, a qualitative change.\nIf Lin Li were to have a child again, even without a husband’s hand transferring power, he should be able to manage it.\nUnknown big shot in Thunder Path, I’ll remember this debt, someday I’ll let you soar too.\nBefore freshening up and practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, noticing his phone’s breathing light was on, Lin Li opened it to see who sent a message.\nIt turned out to be an @all members from the class QQ group, clicked in:\n\"Xue Jian: @all members, during the holidays, remember to balance work and rest. Rest should be moderate, and learning should also be moderate. Too much of either is not good.\"\nSent at 0:56 AM.\nBelow are responses from those night owls who haven’t slept yet, saying \"received,\" despite not having worked before, they possess the soul of a laborer.\nLin Li actually didn’t want to reply.\nBut the \"+1\" in the QQ group was too tempting; not pressing +1 must be someone extraordinary, so Lin Li really couldn’t resist clicking it.\nAfter clicking, Lin Li started pondering, what’s the point of such @ messages in the dead of night?\nGuessing that the school’s teaching tasks were assigned again, prompting Xue Jian to remind everyone to study in the middle of the night.\nBut Xue Jian did remind him. Lin Li sat at his desk, took a posed photo of studying, and sent it to Bai Bufan:\n\"Lin Li: ’Picture’.\"\n\"Lin Li: Old Jian’s reminder was spot on.\"\n\"Lin Li: So I’ve already started lear...ning...already...\"\n\"Lin Li: Can’t continue studying, damn it, not studying anymore, plan to play games all day today, hehe, just kidding.\"\nWhen Bai Bufan wakes up, his phone screen on WeChat will only show the latest message he sent, but due to screen limitations, won’t display fully.\nSo when Bai Bufan opens WeChat, he can only see a red number 4 and in the chat bar \"Can’t continue studying, damn it, not studying anymore...\"\nLin Li could imagine how happy Bai Bufan would be upon seeing this sentence, joyously clicking in, only to leave red-faced.\nThis is what you call attention to detail, this is what you call clickbait, the UC News Department should really hire me.\n[Study the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique diligently before 5:00 AM for a consecutive month, accumulating at least half an hour before 7:00 AM (9/30)]\nToday’s one-hour practice was all about Spiritual Qi Chapters, so Lin Li did it in the living room and didn’t go downstairs, Xiaozhou, see you another day.\nSpiritual Qi Chapters aren’t tiring, Lin Li didn’t even break a sweat, and chose not to study but instead decided to go downstairs now, had breakfast and went to the entrance of the community.\nHis system currently only has three tasks.\nMonthly test ranking and early morning exercise, neither of these can be accelerated, even if trying hard on Mid-Autumn, can’t complete, so naturally Lin Li’s focus is on the Escort door task.\nHe squatted at the entrance of the community for half a day but didn’t see a single delivery rider.\n\"Damn, on holiday weekends in the morning, in this old community, those who order takeout won’t get up at this time, and those who wake up at this time won’t order takeout,\" Lin Li realized belatedly.\nRiding his bicycle, he headed for a slightly newer community nearby.\nSuch communities often have young people who sleep early, who might likely order breakfast delivery.\nOf course, when Lin Li says sleep early—he means they would finish breakfast and then sleep.\nAs expected, after squatting for less than half a minute, an Escort was spotted parking at the gate, holding takeout and jogging inside.\nHowever, Lin Li didn’t approach because this Escort looked a bit older, feeling it might be difficult to communicate, his target remained those younger, with less communication gap, easy-to-talk delivery riders.\n...\nTarget locked.\nWhen the person came out of the community without any takeout and was looking at their phone, Lin Li immediately stepped forward: \"Bro.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 168: Chapter 144: There Are More Brothers in This World_2\n\"Hmm?\" The other person turned their head and glanced at Lin Li, then frowned and asked, \"What’s up?\"\n\"Can I take up a bit of your time?\" Lin Li asked politely.\n\"I’m not buying insurance, renting a house, or joining a gym.\" On hearing this, the other person immediately shook their head and got ready to get on their electric scooter.\n\"It’s a misunderstanding, brother. I just have a proposal that could let you earn a bit more money,\" Lin Li stepped forward to block them, emphasizing his point.\nThe other person paused, turned to look at Lin Li, and took a few steps closer.\nLin Li smiled slightly, feeling confident in his judgment of people.\n\"Brother, have you been scammed? Is there someone watching you nearby? Do you need me to call the police?\" The other person leaned in and whispered, while cautiously scanning the surroundings.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nNot only does he have a strong sense of fraud-prevention, but also an overactive sense of altruism. Maybe my people-reading skills aren’t that sharp after all.\n\"It’s an even bigger misunderstanding, brother. You can think of it as me asking for your help, and I’ll pay you a certain amount of compensation so you can earn a bit more today,\" Lin Li thought it over and rephrased his request.\n\"What are you talking about?\" The other person was even more confused, but since Lin Li phrased it that way, he was slightly interested.\n\"Here’s the thing, I’m a student, and we have this project report for the holidays. My topic is about food delivery, and for some reasons, I really want to experience delivering food myself. But the problem is I’m not of legal age yet, and the platform doesn’t allow registration, so I wanted to ask if I could use your account to deliver food.\nFirst of all, I won’t withdraw the money earned from your account; it will all stay with you. Additionally, I will pay you extra compensation, since using your account means you won’t be able to deliver food yourself.\nRest assured, I definitely won’t do anything malicious. If my actions cause any loss to your account, like being reported, I’ll definitely cover the losses...\"\nLin Li articulated the pitch he had prepared from the night before.\nThe other person, naturally, was full of confusion.\nAfter all, the request sounded incredibly odd.\n\"Uh? You mean... you’d pay me to help you deliver food?\" The person’s expression was truly complex as they tried to summarize the situation.\nSpending money to work is a request that’s hard to imagine someone making.\nHe had only heard of college students interning for free or, in some fields like medicine, having to pay extra to intern at good hospitals.\nBut at least internships offer learning opportunities. What could this kid hope to gain from interning as a food delivery person? Learning how to argue with security guards, or sneak through residential areas?\nHas he already decided on his career path at such a young age?\nAlthough there’s great potential, it seems a bit off, right?\n\"Yes, you could see it that way,\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Ah, such nostalgia. A few years ago, when I was still a student, I was just as silly... just as pure and innocent, working hard for a single PPT,\" the other person reminisced about their own youth.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nBrother, you meant foolish, right?\nBut I understand.\n\"I’ve checked, and the delivery fee here in Xiling. Normally, you’d earn about fifty or sixty in the morning, right? I’m planning to pay you a hundred, plus the delivery income would be yours. Does that work for you?\" Lin Li continued to persuade.\n\"I don’t mind supporting your project report, and I trust you wouldn’t intentionally ruin my delivery account. You don’t look...\" the person paused: \"But the thing is, the platform requires account holders to be synchronous. If they find out someone else is using my account for deliveries, it could be severely penalized or banned.\"\nAfter speaking, the man shook his head and said, \"This is my livelihood; I can’t take that risk.\"\n\"How would they find out? As long as you scan my face for verification when logging in, it should be fine, right?\" Lin Li frowned upon hearing this.\n\"The platform sometimes randomly checks facial recognition upon order completion,\" the other person explained.\n\"...That’s a thing,\" Lin Li was momentarily taken aback but quickly came up with a more complete plan: \"How about this, brother? I’ll ride your scooter, use your account to deliver, and you sit behind me the entire time.\nThis way, you can handle any situation immediately, and you watch over me, feel assured, and I feel assured too.\nAnd because this might take up your entire morning, I’ll pay you an additional twenty bucks.\"\nThe other person pondered for a moment and, not finding any issues, nodded: \"This seems to have no risk, but are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\"Yes.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Let’s add each other on WeChat, then I can transfer the money to you now.\"\nLet’s try it out for one morning and see if I can complete the task; if not, I’ll change direction later.\n\"Okay.\" The other person nodded.\nThere’s no harm in accepting this. I just need to sit on the back and play on my phone all morning, give some guidance if a situation arises, and I’ll earn more than usual, all while helping someone. Why not?\nThey exchanged WeChat contacts, and the man took an extra look at Lin Li.\nBecause Lin Li’s nickname on his minor account had changed from \"Surprised by Mentor Checking My Thesis\" to \"Bad Grades Blame Teachers for Pushing Too Hard.\"\nBut it didn’t hinder anything.\n\"I’m Shen Kai, what’s your name?\" As soon as Lin Li added him, he immediately sent a red packet, so Shen Kai didn’t mind these details and asked.\n\"I’m Bai...\" Just as he was about to blurt it out, Lin Li caught himself and changed course: \"I’m Lin Li.\"\nShen Kai: \"...\"\n\"Are you really named Lin Li?\" Shen Kai suddenly felt uneasy. A guy who hesitates when stating his name surely has something up his sleeve, right?\nThis kid suddenly seems not-so-trustworthy.\n\"Brother, it’s really me. Here’s my ID card. ’Bai’ is a nickname I use at school, just a habit.\" Lin Li, realizing he had instinctively given a false name, quickly corrected himself since there’s nothing shady about delivering food, he decided to use his real name, swiftly adding an explanation.\n\"I see.\" Shen Kai relaxed a bit.\n\"Here, Lin Li, hang this phone around your neck. This is the order interface, and since you lack experience, I suggest you don’t take additional orders suggested by the system. Just focus on completing one at a time.\" Food delivery drivers usually have two phones. Shen Kai removed his work phone from its strap and hung it around Lin Li’s neck, giving his advice.\n\"Alright.\" Lin Li nodded and directly accepted a short-distance order, but the delivery income was just over four bucks.\n\"These types of orders we wouldn’t usually accept unless the system forces it on us, but it’s good practice for you. Here, the bike keys are for you, let’s go.\" Shen Kai got on the bike and instinctively moved to the back seat, patting the front.\n\"Alright.\"\nAfter Lin Li got on the bike, Shen Kai even took off his helmet and placed it on Lin Li’s head, reminding him, \"If you see any traffic police, let me know, and I’ll hop off.\"\nHelmet regulations in Xiling are perhaps a bit strict, but strictness is not likely.\n\"Got it.\"\nLin Li settled in and gripped the handlebars of the electric bike, ready to depart.\n\"You can start it; I’m ready.\"\nSeeing the bike still hadn’t started, Shen Kai reminded him.\n\"Brother Shen, the electric bike accelerates by pulling back, right? There’s no throttle or brake, correct? And I don’t need to pedal anywhere, do I?\" Lin Li’s voice came through, seeking confirmation.\nShen Kai: \"Of course... Hmm? Hmm. Hmm!!\"\n\"?\"\n\"Get off! Let me off!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Chapter 145: I don’t hang out with indecent people, 2B\nThis is not a food delivery vehicle headed to the shop, but a hearse heading to the crematorium.\nShen Kai flipped off the bike immediately, looking at Lin Li with a start: \"Lin Li, do you even know how to ride an e-bike!!\"\nIf you get into an accident for one hundred fifty bucks, it’s totally not worth it. After all, you can’t even buy a decent urn for that money.\n\"Brother Shen, I do know how, it’s just that the last time I rode one was years ago, I might have forgotten a bit.\" Lin Li quickly said.\nTo be precise, anyone who knows how to ride a bicycle can’t not know how to ride an e-bike.\nLin Li basically got the hang of the e-bike in a second, but since the school doesn’t allow students to use e-bikes to commute, his family never got one, so he really hadn’t ridden in a long time.\nIt’s fair to say he’s a bit rusty and drawn a blank for a moment.\nLin Li twisted the handlebars backward, rode a few circles around Shen Kai, and seeing Lin Li’s expression gradually turn confident and sure, Shen Kai finally relaxed a bit.\n\"Ride slowly, no rush, safety first, delivery second.\" Shen Kai sat back on Lin Li’s rear seat and took off the helmet he gave to Lin Li, putting it back on his own head: \"If the traffic police show up, warn me, and then you get off and walk for a section.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDamn.\nTaking the helmet back and putting it on your own head is just too real, bro.\nBut Lin Li truly found his groove, although he hadn’t ridden an e-bike in years, after just about one minute, he inexplicably began to feel quite skilled again.\nLooking at the mecha synchronization index of 40 on the [panel], Lin Li wondered if a coach bus could be considered a mecha, then could an e-bike be considered one too? And could his sense of familiarity come from this BUFF?\nBut if that’s accounted for, wouldn’t piloting a mecha himself for the first time trigger a task or something?\nUnderstanding the system logic is too difficult, suppressing these temporarily unanswerable questions, Lin Li still opted to proceed to the pickup point at a steady pace.\n...\n\"Lin Li, but we don’t really need to go this slow, even that bicycle just overtook us.\"\nBeing a time-is-of-the-essence delivery man, Shen Kai, who was riding at such a pace for the first time since discovering Lin Li was being overly cautious, felt incredibly restless and uncomfortable.\n\"Oh, okay, I’ll speed up a bit.\"\n\"Brother Shen, why does your map have notes on it too?\" Some streets were unfamiliar to Lin Li, so he was referring to the map, and unexpectedly found the software map had markings.\n\"Just giving one another a heads-up, helping each other out.\" Upon hearing this, Shen Kai replied.\nLin Li clicked to make the notes more prominent:\n\"This neighborhood has no elevator, be careful with high-floor deliveries and errands.\"\n\"Security is a little dumb, but there’s a small gate to the right of the north gate where you can get in, and usually no one manages it.\"\n\"The diner is slow in preparing the meals.\"\n\"If you take an order from someone named Liang for order 9644, be very, very careful, it’s a gay man! He asked me to hang the delivery on his human handle! Be extremely careful with his orders!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhat do they mean by human handle?\nMultitasking is inadvisable, so Lin Li focused on riding and soon arrived at the breakfast place called Xi Ying, then headed inside with Shen Kai.\n\"Is order 43 ready?\" Lin Li asked upon entering.\nAt Lin Li’s request, he handled all activities, while Shen Kai merely observed.\n\"Wait a bit, they’re steaming it fresh, it’ll be out soon.\" The owner hadn’t finished yet and waved their hand.\n\"Okay.\" The two sat in the shop on chairs, and Lin Li, out of boredom, glanced at the customer information. The name only showed the last name, the phone number was incomplete, but you could see the note, to which Lin Li was a bit surprised: \"The first order of the day is actually for a birthday.\"\nThe note read, \"It’s my birthday today, could you send a tea egg?\"\n\"Brother Shen, do you think if we wish them a happy birthday, we might get an extra good review?\" Lin Li asked, curious upon hearing it.\nHowever, before Shen Kai could answer, the owner chuckled: \"No need, this person’s had thirty birthdays this year alone.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nUnderstood.\n\"That’s how it is, some customers’ notes are just like the excuse notes of some web novel authors, no need to take them seriously.\" With experienced poise, Shen Kai nodded calmly upon hearing this.\nBut the fresh steaming was indeed quite slow.\nAfter waiting several minutes, Shen Kai’s work phone, which Lin Li held, vibrated.\n\"0223: Why have you stopped moving after arriving at the diner?\"\n\"Shen Kai: [Picture], hi, it’s being steamed fresh and isn’t ready yet.\"\n\"0223: But I’m so hungry.\"\n\"Shen Kai: Why not order a little something to tide you over?\"\n\"0223: ?\"\n\"0223: Guess what I’m doing right now?\"\n\"Shen Kai: Is there a prize for guessing right? My guess is chatting with me on an empty stomach.\"\n\"0223: ?\"\n\"If I get a bad review, remember to help pay my fine.\" Observing Lin Li’s replies, Shen Kai finally spoke after a long silence.\nDamn it.\nLin Li suddenly remembered that the task description required him to \"perfectly\" complete it and instinctively went on a tangent, Lin Li quickly tried hard to make amends:\n\"Shen Kai: Happy birthday, bro.\"\n\"0223: Thanks, bro, can you throw in an extra tea egg for me?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhat kind of tea egg immortal is this.\nIs eating a tea egg your life’s wish?\n\"You’re really going to deliver it? Are you doing charity work, Lin Li?\" Shen Kai was dumbfounded when he saw Lin Li reply, \"Sure, I’ll pay for an extra one from the shop.\"\n\"Consider it for Brother Shen’s good rating.\" Lin Li didn’t mind the extra couple of bucks; the main goal was to ensure the task was completed.\n\"It’s ready.\" After another five minutes, the owner finally finished packing and placed the package with a seal on the counter.\nLin Li went up and, after ensuring there would be no spills, carefully picked it up.\nBecause I’ve been caught in the rain, I want to hold an umbrella for others.\nAfter all, spilled takeout can really ruin your mood, especially when you’ve been waiting a long time.\nBecause it was just one delivery, Lin Li simply let Shen Kai carry it, and they headed towards the client’s community together.\n\"This community is quite remote, but I saw someone tag it—security is annoying, and there’s no elevator. This order is a real loss,\" Shen Kai commented as he got out of the car with Lin Li.\nThe tag was accurate: the security was indeed annoying. Upon seeing Lin Li and Shen Kai, the early morning shift guard seemed half awake, wagged his tail, rolled over, and continued sleeping. Such extraordinary skills.\n\"Bro, remember to give a good rating. I paid two bucks for that extra tea egg—five stars isn’t too much to ask, right?\" Lin Li said as he handed over the takeout after knocking on the door and waiting for it to open.\n\"You really did? I’ll give you a good rating right now, thank you so much. This tea egg will make my day,\" the customer said, touched, as they immediately took out their phone.\n[Perfectly completing thirty sect tasks issued by Meituan Escort Sect (1/30)]\nPlan succeeded.\nLooks like I don’t need my own delivery account.\nSo this task can be completed without waiting for me to turn adult.\n\"Let’s go, Brother Shen, let’s continue delivering!\" With that thought, everything today felt worthwhile and meaningful, Lin Li said with vigor.\nShen Kai, on the other hand, was wide-eyed, full of doubts as he looked at the enthusiastic Lin Li.\nSpent half an hour, earned 4.6 bucks, and still, that’s Shen Kai’s earnings, Lin Li himself ended up spending two bucks. How could he be so happy and joyful about it?\nIs he naturally born with a delivery physique?\n...\nLin Li gradually got the hang of it; delivering became more and more effortless. However, the only small issue was that after the breakfast rush, the orders were scarce.\nLin Li even picked up a running errand order because of it.\nThree big buckets, no elevator, sixth floor.\nThe rest, Lin Li didn’t want to talk about anymore; he was too exhausted to say a word.\nThe only solace was the voice of the customer, which was pleasant—it was worth the eye candy at least.\nBut when the door opened, it turned out the voice came from a voice box squeezed by fat.\nNo wonder a single woman dare open the door.\nLin Li was thoroughly exhausted, while Shen Kai wildly amused, since he didn’t have to do the lifting—Lin Li insisted on experiencing it solo, yet Shen Kai earned the money, especially with an extra twenty bucks tip from the customer.\nShen Kai even scorned Lin Li for being superficial.\n[Perfectly completing thirty sect tasks issued by Meituan Escort Sect (5/30)]\nBut whether it was because a good rating wasn’t given immediately or the customer wasn’t genuinely satisfied, even though seven orders were completed, the system only showed 5.\nDoesn’t really matter.\nLin Li was squatting in front of the screen, grabbing orders, when his own phone vibrated in his pocket.\nSomeone was calling him.\nMom.\n\"Hey, Sister Min, what’s up?\" Seeing the contact nickname, Lin Li asked carelessly.\nLin Li’s mother was called Wu Min; when Lin Li needed something from her, he called her dear mother, but if not, he’d randomly toggle between mom, mother, and Sister Min.\n\"I came home, but you’re not here.\"\nOn the other end came the sound of slippers tapping against the tiled floor.\n\"I’m outside playing with friends.\" It turned out Wu Min came home; saying I was delivering needed too much explaining, so Lin Li thought a simple lie would save trouble.\n\"Didn’t you just come back from an autumn outing yesterday? How come you’re out playing again? Among those you’re playing with, there aren’t any improper or troublesome people, are there?\" Wu Min asked with concern.\n\"Yes, there are.\" Lin Li thought for a moment and nodded.\nWu Min: \"?\"\nShe just asked casually, but there really are, when did this kid become so straightforward.\n\"Then why are you still hanging out with them? Get home immediately!\" Wu Min’s voice rose by eight octaves.\n\"There aren’t anymore.\"\n\"What do you mean by ’aren’t anymore’?\"\n\"Among the group I’m playing with, there are no improper or troublesome people anymore.\"\nWu Min: \"?\"",

So when do you plan to come home, do you want to have lunch here? I’m about to go to the supermarket to buy groceries.\" Wu Min asked after a brief silence, no longer urging him.\nThere’s actually a vegetable market near the neighborhood, but it’s better suited for early risers. If it’s late, it’s more convenient to buy ingredients at the supermarket.\n\"It’s rare to have a chance to eat Mom’s cooking, of course I want to come home for it, it’s so preci...\" Lin Li’s words were full of flattery.\n\"Alright, alright, Mom knows, hanging up.\"\nKnowing Lin Li’s attitude, Wu Min directly hung up the phone.\nNot even listening to what people say, so rude.\nNo wonder I’m also rude, found the culprit.\n\"Brother Shen, that’s it for this morning, I might have to head home first.\" After finishing the call, Lin Li returned to the electric bike and said to Shen Kai.\n\"You’re not delivering anymore? Okay, how are you going back? Want to take the electric bike?\" Shen Kai, who was looking at his phone, glanced up when he heard this.\n\"Even better, saves me some time.\" Lin Li nodded.\n...\n\"Brother Shen, we’ve added each other on WeChat. If I want to try delivering food again, I’ll contact you, okay?\" To avoid running into Mom at the doorstep and facing troublesome explanations, Lin Li got off the bike about 100 meters away from the neighborhood and spoke to Shen Kai.\n\"Are you still going to pay to deliver?\" Shen Kai was stunned upon hearing this.\n\"Maybe, it’s quite interesting, I haven’t had enough yet.\" Lin Li nodded.\nWith Wu Min back, Lin Li could first try using her identity information to register as a delivery rider, but he just informed Shen Kai as a backup plan, since Wu Min would probably be traveling again after the holidays.\nIf Biaomen has any derivative tasks, Shen Kai could still be useful.\n\"... Alright.\" Shen Kai hesitated for a moment before nodding.\nShen Kai watched Lin Li’s departing figure with complex emotions, feeling both admiration for a genius and disbelief at the impossible.\nWas Lin Li truly passionate about the food delivery business?\nMaybe one day, he could become the Xiling Delivery King.\nFeeling fired up, Shen Kai found himself motivated, alright, so today he planned to deliver fifty orders!!\nShen Kai yawned.\nSeemed like he was burnt out.\nForget it, you shouldn’t do things just based on adrenaline, you have to think it over:\nOne, can I not do it?\nTwo, can I do it tomorrow?\nThree, can I get someone else to do it?\nSo after considering it, Shen Kai thought that deciding to deliver fifty orders was too rash. He’s already made nearly two hundred from Lin Li today—one hundred and fifty plus his food delivery income. The income target had been met, so why not go back to the rental and sleep?\nThose fifty orders... better leave them to Lin Li to do tomorrow!\n...\nUsing the key to open the door, it was rare for someone to be using the kitchen, the aroma of food permeating through the sound of the exhaust fan. After all, on normal days, the kitchen’s only use was boiling water.\n\"I’m back.\" Changing into slippers, Lin Li walked to the kitchen, watching Wu Min cook.\n\"Lin...\" Wu Min turned to her son, but was stunned before she could finish saying his name.\nShe paused the stir-frying and frowned at Lin Li.\nOne hand pinching Lin Li’s arm, another pinching the flesh of his cheek.\nSeeing Wu Min beginning to tap his cheeks and even wanting to pull his hair, Lin Li helplessly retreated: \"What’re you doing, Mom? Am I your stress relief toy now?\"\n\"Haven’t seen you in three weeks, why have you changed so much? Are you still my son?\" Wu Min asked suspiciously.\nUpon hearing this, Lin Li proudly raised his head.\nThe changes brought by Spiritual Qi and training, along with a Buff that enhanced his charm, had indeed made him noticeably different from before.\nClassmates who saw him daily might find the change gradual and not too abrupt, but Wu Min hadn’t seen Lin Li in three weeks, so it was immediately noticeable.\n\"I’ve always told you, Sister Min, that my handsome foundation is strong, once bulked up it’s bound to look great, if I put on makeup, I’d be absolutely stunning.\" Lin Li said proudly.\nWu Min had long been accustomed to hearing such absurd words from Lin Li, regardless, seeing his current appearance she was quite happy: \"At least I won’t be accused of neglecting you anymore.\"\nIt’s well known that in the eyes of the older generation, Zhou Baowei’s kind of solid but not overweight physique can only be called \"how did you get so thin\".\nAnd Lin Li’s previous lanky physique was called \"does your mom never feed you\" by the old generation.\nThese words, like \"how did you grow so tall suddenly\" or \"do you still remember who I am\", were annual necessities at family gatherings. Often, they might even come from the same relative, so Lin Li had grown used to it.\n\"But where have you been playing? Why do you smell so strange coming back?\" Wu Min frowned and asked.\nLin Li heard and pointed next to Wu Min: \"Mom, could it be the food has burnt?\"\n...\nWu Min continued cooking lunch, while Lin Li, after checking the instructions, registered a rider using his mom’s information.\nLin Li had the ID and such on his phone, but registration required a facial verification step.\n\"Mom! Come over for a bit!\" Lin Li shouted towards the kitchen.\n\"Why? I’m cooking, how can I come?\" Wu Min shouted in response.\n\"Then just pause for a moment.\"\nWu Min: \"...\"\nWhy does this sound familiar?\nFeeling Wu Min’s silence, Lin Li felt comforted all over.\nSatisfying!\nHow many times during childhood did Sister Min call for him to pause the game?\nFinally avenged today, satisfying!\nBut knowing that if he took satisfaction too far he’d be scolded, Lin Li quickly ran over before Wu Min got angry, reached the kitchen, and aimed the phone at her: \"Mom, help me with the facial verification.\"\n\"What’s this thing?\"\nLike when someone’s on the phone and would take anything handed to them, Wu Min, while cooking, followed the phone’s instructions, turned her face and nodded, then questioned Lin Li.\nBecause in her heart, Lin Li was still the best and most capable kid, wouldn’t cause harm.\nAfter the facial recognition was completed, showing what seemed like a Meituan page, Wu Min slightly widened her eyes, puzzled: \"Mom’s already cooking, why did you still order delivery?\"\n\"Didn’t order delivery, Mom. This is Meituan Crowdsourcing, I’m helping you register as a rider.\" Lin Li quickly explained.\n\"Oh, so it’s just registering as a ride... huh!?\" Wu Min’s cooking hands trembled, almost flipping the pan. She stared at Lin Li: \"Why are you registering me as a rider?\"\n\"Afraid dear mother would be too idle at home during the Mid-Autumn Festival, giving you something to do, so I can soon become an affluent second generation, hoping mother turns into a phoenix.\"\nWu Min: \"?\"\nLin Li’s dodging skills were expertly honed, effortlessly evading Wu Min’s hand chop with a sidestep.\n\"Delivering food, huh, aiming to be affluent second generation, huh...\"\nSeeing Wu Min start removing her apron, ready to get serious, Lin Li mischievously explained: \"Just joking, Mom, after registering I plan to use your account to deliver.\"\n\"Huh?\" Wu Min was still puzzled, then concerned: \"Running out of money? Tell Mom if you need it, what happened this month?\"\n\"None of that, just bored during the holidays with nothing to do, decided to experience what it’s like to earn money hard. Surely better than playing games at home, wouldn’t you agree?\"\nWith Wu Min, using an excuse like schoolwork wasn’t suitable, it’d instantly be exposed, so Lin Li explained.\nWu Min’s brows were still furrowed, but knowing Lin Li always had his own opinions, and if he genuinely wanted to go deliver and experience life, it indeed was better than gaming at home. She still advised:\n\"Actually at this stage what’s most important is...\"\n\"Please watch the VCR.\" Having foreseen it, Lin Li directly pulled out his phone and displayed the study video recorded yesterday to Wu Min.\n\"...\"\nWu Min inspected Lin Li once again.\nA bit unfamiliar, really her son?\n...\n\"Lin Li’s Mom: Teacher, sorry to bother you, just want to ask, has Lin Li caused any trouble lately?\"\nWhen Xue Jian finally managed to sleep in during the holidays, waking up to see this message he felt both helpless and relieved.\nDamn it, knew it.",

      "content": "Chapter 171: Chapter 147: Lin Li Disappoints This World\nThe review process for this kind of crowdsourcing part-time job is quite fast; the results came out in the afternoon.\nDuring the novice period, there’s not even a need to pay a deposit or anything. No wonder people online say crowdsourcing is absolutely in charge, since the worst that can happen is getting banned.\nYour delivery rider is attacking your takeout.\nAlthough Lin Li’s home doesn’t have an electric scooter, there’s a rental place in the community. Monthly, it’s five hundred yuan with battery replacement included, but Lin Li plans to rent per day, which costs thirty yuan a day.\nIt seems some delivery workers do opt to rent electric scooters for deliveries, and there are even ones with thermal boxes and Meituan helmets; they are all complete sets.\nThis saves Lin Li quite a bit of trouble.\nRegarding the surprise review mentioned by Shen Kai, Lin Li also found a way to circumvent it online; just ensure that when settling a certain order, there are still other orders in progress, so the system won’t trigger this check that might affect delivery.\nThere’s a five-minute preparation time for the check; as long as you complete the last order downstairs, click delivered, and then during this time show it to mom for verification.\nIf something goes wrong, it’s okay, the worst that can happen is getting banned. If the appeal fails, ask Shen Kai, or wait until adulthood, there’ll always be a way.\n\"I’m riding my beloved sewing machine~~ It will never break the thread~~\" Singing along to this little tune, Lin Li spent the whole afternoon delivering orders using this method.\n[Perfectly completed Meituan Escort Sect’s thirty sect tasks (11/30)]\nBy the time the sun completely set on the horizon and the city’s streetlights were lit, the progress bar had reached eleven.\nIt’s not that Lin Li only delivered six orders all afternoon, but to control the number of orders, sometimes even after delivering, he couldn’t click delivered, which would cause the platform to default to overtime and give a bad review.\nAnd the system doesn’t recognize these orders, plus Lin Li is just a beginner, unfamiliar with addresses, resulting in many orders going to waste.\nSo the completion rate is even lower than in the morning, but there’s no way to avoid it.\nIt’s also thanks to timely treasure for dispersing wealth and accumulating virtue.\nEven at this efficiency, this task can surely be completed within this holiday, already meeting expectations.\nLin Li’s luck is not bad either; the current food delivery system is quite comprehensive and hasn’t encountered Aminos Property.\n\"Finish these two orders and call it a day.\" Arriving at the address, seeing his mom had already urged him to come home for dinner, Lin Li decided.\nAfter registering at the security, Lin Li walked into the community while dialing a number.\n\"Lin Li? Why are you calling me? Do you want to piss me off too, damn it?\" Just after Lin Li got through, he was scolded head-on.\nHuh?\nIs this Bao Wei’s voice?\nLin Li looked again at his order, and the customer’s surname was indeed Zhou.\nLin Li didn’t know it was Zhou Baowei when calling because the number he saw was encrypted, and the phone didn’t display notes.\n\"Nah, I just missed you.\" After greeting, Lin Li decisively hung up the phone.\nHis stomach did feel a bit empty.\nThank you, Bao Wei.\n...\n\"Knock, knock, knock.\"\nThe house door was knocked on; seems the takeout he ordered has arrived. After studying until midnight last night and eating lunch after waking up, Zhou Baowei, who forced himself to study again, immediately walked excitedly to the door.\nFood was his only salvation in this grotto’s intensive study world.\nZhou Baowei opened the door.\n\"Hello (chew, chew, chew) sir, your (chew, chew, chew) takeout (chew, chew, chew).\" The delivery rider with crumbs all over his mouth extended his hand, and thus a light takeout bag floated to Zhou Baowei’s feet.\nHis salvation seemed to have turned into someone else’s intestine form.\nSuch things are incurable.\n\"Boom——\"\nThe door slammed shut.\nZhou Baowei took a deep breath; damn it, studying truly must not be tainted, once tainted this life is truly over, he just saw Lin Li, the culprit himself.\nHe had become his delivery rider, meanwhile attacking his takeout.\nIt must be the way he’s opening it that’s wrong.\nTaking a deep breath, then Zhou Baowei reopened the door.\n\"Damn it! Lin Li! Why is it really you!\" After confirmation, Zhou Baowei roared.\n\"So boldly swearing, no family at home? No wonder you ordered takeout; let me come in for a while then.\" Lin Li continued chewing, keenly noticing this fact, and without courtesy, he took off his shoes, entered, and sat on the living room sofa, then spoke disdainfully:\n\"Bao Wei, it’s not that I’m saying this, is this chicken fillet a store issue or a taste issue? It’s way too salty; you didn’t even get a drink? Honestly, I’m a bit parched now; do you have any drinks at home? Remember, drinks, not plain water, hurry and bring one, preferably cold.\"\nWatching Lin Li chomping on the chicken fillet, hands groping for snacks on the living room coffee table to stash in his pocket, Zhou Baowei fell silent again.\nYour home?\nMay I ask, is this your home?\n\"How about when you leave, I shove two hundred yuan in your pocket?\" Zhou Baowei said through gritted teeth.\n\"That’s really embarrassing, but it’s hard to refuse kindness, thank you.\" Lin Li showed a shy smile and opened the pocket of his pants with his fingers: \"Do it now, I’m afraid you’ll forget when I leave.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nNot a clone, Lin Li is decidedly real, the password currency, Zhen Ji drawing the sword.",

This chicken cutlet is high in fat and calories, bad for your health. You really should slim down, Bao Wei. You know, I only know five heavy people, and you alone count as four of them. It’s just a few months until New Year’s; I don’t want to lose you at the spring festival, so you must slim down.\"\nRealizing he couldn’t snatch it, Lin Li earnestly persuaded.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nSh*t.\nYou know five heavy people, and I count as four?\nLin Li’s offensive language this time was so outrageous that even Zhou Baowei almost couldn’t help but laugh.\nIs this language even humanly conceivable?\n\"You’re sitting on my couch, eating my snacks, delivery, drinking my drinks, and yet you’re insulting me, do you think I’d give you a good rating? Hah, kneel and sing ’Conquer’.\" Zhou Baowei stood up and snickered.\n\"Just like that, I’m conquered~\"\nLin Li’s threshold is very flexible, he did not hesitate and knelt on one knee.\nZhou Baowei intended to continue sneering, but suddenly noticed a blind spot, his eyes brightened: \"Lin Li, aren’t you studying today?\"\n\"Nope, just delivering food all day. Why this sudden concern about my studies?\" Lin Li shook his head.\nBut soon he’ll have to study for an hour because the three cooldowns of [Strong Memory] are almost maxed out.\n\"No problem, no problem, hahahaha—\" Zhou Baowei laughed relievedly.\nAt this moment, he even felt a bit like crying.\nUp until this moment, he even thought Lin Li had been studying hard at home all day.\nThe toil of this is indescribable to outsiders.\nLin Li frowned.\nHe noticed Zhou Baowei’s gaze at him became inexplicably kind.\nWhat’s wrong?\n\"Is there enough to eat on the table? If not, I’ll go get some of my stash from my room.\" Zhou Baowei said kindly.\n\"Rate me well first.\" Lin Li unwaveringly asked.\n\"No problem, I’ll do it now, though it’s hard to rate you well, but still, let it all out, ahhh! Catch it all, Lin Li!! Open wide!!\" Zhou Baowei nodded vigorously, swiftly operating.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"You’re damn crazy!\"\nInferior Zhou Baowei.\n[Perfectly completed thirty sect missions published by Meituan Escort Sect (12/30)]\n\"But thanks, you rated me very satisfyingly.\" Luckily Lin Li was also inferior, upon seeing the system message, he cooperated well.\n\"How about it, wanna play some games? My parents are coming home late, we could do anything. My place has a console, you can kneel beside me watching me comfortably play this family-friendly game of the year, little robot.\" Zhou Baowei asked again.\n\"Spending four hundred on this, you sure have thumbs, calling a single-player game ’family-friendly’ must be Batman. I still have an order unfilled, gotta leave now, maybe next time.\" Lin Li checked his phone, smiling.\nThis order must be delivered before heading home to hit the ’delivered’ button, definitely exceeding the time limit, but being a delivery person, letting customers wait till overtime and deliberately clicking ’delivered’ after that is different.\n\"Alright then.\" Lin Li leaving was even better news, Zhou Baowei stood ready to see him off.\n\"I’ve memorized your home’s location, I’ll visit often later, just a pity it’s a bit far from mine, I love eating small tangerines, stock more later.\" Peeling a small tangerine and stuffing it into his mouth, Lin Li talked muffled while not leaving empty-handed.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nHow do I gently bring up moving homes with the family?\nAfter Zhou Baowei’s door closed, Lin Li didn’t rush to leave, he was still refreshing the order snatching interface in front of the door.\nHalf a minute passed, a muffled voice came from the tightly closed door: \"Get lost already, I’m not ordering delivery in the next half hour!\"\nThe peephole was dark, Zhou Baowei was probably staring right at it from the door.\nOops, caught red-handed.\nNo choice but to leave now.\n...\nUnsurprisingly, this last order, upon arriving at his own community and clicking ’delivered’, was already overdue by several minutes, prompting a facial recognition scan instantly.\nLin Li quickly went upstairs, opened the door, and performed a great summoning: \"Mom!!\"\n\"Coming, coming.\" Wu Min had already changed into home clothes, shuffled over in slippers.\n\"Help me scan my face.\" Lin Li handed the phone to Wu Min.\n\"Okay.\"\n\"How much did you earn from a whole afternoon of deliveries?\" Wu Min asked curiously and expectantly while scanning the face.\n\"If I remember correctly, about a little over fifty.\" Lin Li said, recalling while taking off his shoes.\n\"Not bad, over fifty is more than I thought, take a picture for Mom later, your uncle and others are praising your maturity.\" Wu Min said gratefully.\nThe face scan completed, the app automatically returned to the main screen, Wu Min instinctively tapped into the income page from the sidebar.\n\"Withdrawable Balance: 5.0\"\n\"...\"\nShe fell silent.\nAfter the silence, Wu Min took a deep breath, reminded herself to remain calm, then asked:\n\"Lin Li, you said a little over fifty, this little, lies between five and ten?\"\n\"Mom, just say it’s a little bit more overall.\" Lin Li waved calmly.\n\"So, this number means my son hurriedly left after lunch at twelve, aimlessly returning home past seven, over seven hours, earning five dollars, right?\" Wu Min continued taking deep breaths and confirmed.\n\"Hello, Mother, yes.\" Lin Li earnestly nodded.\nBut really, Lin Li couldn’t be blamed.\nHe was seriously completing delivery tasks, but the issue was too much overtime, causing money deductions each time, increase and decrease, led to this outcome, and every log-in deducts three bucks insurance fee, otherwise Lin Li would have a full eight dollars profit, increasing by 60%.\nWu Min, upon clicking the details, saw these facts.\nIt presented even a harder to accept truth:\nSo her son wasn’t slacking off, just not meeting platform standards thus constantly getting deductions?\nAfter all his effort, earning less than a dollar per hour?\nThe electric scooter is rented too.\n\"Li,\" she began.\n\"What’s up.\"\n\"You must study well; a kid like you without grades will starve in society.\" Wu Min earnestly advised.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nMy gosh, my mom’s words are hurting.\n...\nWu Min returned to the main bedroom at home, immediately approached the phone.\n\"Child has grown up wanting to experience the hardship of earning money, insisted on delivering food today... very touching, feels the sacrifice is worthwhile.\"\nDeleted the several hundred-character essay first.\nThen opened the sibling group chat.\n\"Second Brother: @Wu Min, Sis, has Ah Li come home yet, how much did he make today?\"\n\"Big Sister: Ah Li was smart and lively since little, surely a lot.\"\nWu Min looked complex yet remorseful.\n\"Wu Min: Little Li just returned, made over fifty.\"\n\"Second Brother: So much? Impressive! ’Like’ ’Like’ ’Like’\"\n\"Big Sister: Excellent! ’Rose’ ’Rose’ ’Rose’\"",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Chapter 148: Why Are All the Options for This Question Not Provided?\nBecause he already ate half of Zhou Baowei’s chicken steak, Lin Li casually grabbed a couple of bites for dinner and returned to his own room.\nHe took his textbooks to the living room and started preparing to study.\n\"What are you doing?\" Wu Min, who had finished washing the dishes, was about to return to the master bedroom to rest, but stopped in the living room when she saw Lin Li’s actions and asked him.\n\"Isn’t it obvious? I’m preparing to concentrate and start studying,\" Lin Li pointed at the table.\n\"Your room has such a big computer desk, can’t it be used as a study desk? Why not study in your own room?\" Wu Min asked.\n\"I’m afraid you wouldn’t notice how hard I’m working, and forget to tear up and praise me while raising my allowance and pocket money,\" Lin Li said smoothly.\nWu Min: \"...\"\nWu Min kind of missed Lin Li’s childhood.\nLin Li was occasionally abstract as a child, frequently occasionally, always frequently.\n— This kid has always been in this careless state since young.\nShe missed it not because Lin Li was different as a child, but because when he was mischievous back then, Wu Min could use a feather duster to whip him until he cried out loud, apologizing to Sister Min and his mom, saying he wouldn’t dare next time.\nAs for why he said next time, it’s because Lin Li would definitely dare next time.\nBut now, her mischievous child is beyond her control with age, Wu Min retrieved a feather duster from the cupboard, and as expected, Lin Li chuckled fearlessly, \"Mom, I’m so grown up now, isn’t it inappropriate to use this on me?\"\n\"I’ll buy a bigger one someday,\" Wu Min nodded, agreeing with Lin Li’s point.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nSister Min is also a genius.\nThen Wu Min negated her own words, \"No, it’s not about the feather duster anymore, I should buy a spiked whip or a Wolf Fang Club.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nEven cultivators fear becoming black slaves.\nLin Li, like a Disney movie, suddenly started singing, \"Goodbye, Mom, tonight I’m setting sail, don’t worry about me, I have oars of joy and wisdom~~\"\nIf only he knew ballet, Lin Li would have shown some dance moves as well.\n\"A wise kid can’t work seven hours for just five dollars,\" Wu Min shook her head.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThe inability to refute feels so frustrating.\n\"Alright, you focus on studying. Since your room’s empty, I’ll help clean it up; it’s all dusty and filthy,\" Wu Min said with disgust.\nActually, Lin Li didn’t think his room was dirty, but unfortunately, the standards of two generations seemed to differ.\nJust as Wu Min was about to enter the room, she stopped and asked Lin Li, \"Anything private you need to handle first?\"\nThe child has grown, needs his own space, and since she wasn’t at home most of the time, who knows what was stashed away.\nOne of Lin Li’s childhood fears was coming home to find his room completely transformed and tidied up.\nBecause that meant many of his secrets might have been exposed.\nAs a kid, Lin Li loved picking up men’s health magazines from the ground because the last page had some risqué jokes.\nIt was considered an enlightenment publication.\nHe got scolded twice for that as a child.\n\"Sister Min, what privacy do I have with you? That’s too distant,\" Lin Li said. In this day and age, who keeps physical items? Good stuff is so well hidden it won’t be found, so Lin Li didn’t care at all.\n\"Alright then, you focus on studying. I’ll quietly close the door and clean, won’t disturb you,\" Wu Min nodded.\n\"So, Mom, can you cry and raise my allowance and pocket money later?\" Lin Li didn’t forget his goal.\nThe door closed, Wu Min even slammed it, echoing loudly.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSo real.\nGuess coming to the living room to study was in vain.\nLin Li currently wasn’t short on money; the Demon Suppression Bureau’s subsidies still had a lot left, and Lin Li only planned on spending the money wisely. But the problem is everywhere in life there’s a place demanding money, like today, where many processes need money to ease or unlock, at this rate, he’d deplete his resources quickly.\nHis system was also useless, leaving the cultivator bound by the mundane world, couldn’t it just inexplicably give him a mountain of gold and silver?\nConcentrated his thoughts, activated [Enhanced Memory], and Lin Li started studying.\nAfter twenty minutes, his memory began to fade, and the first round of study ended, Lin Li turned his gaze to his phone with the breathing light flashing.\nBai Bufan hadn’t replied to the morning’s message at all, but was now finally willing to respond.\n\"Bai Bufan: Bao Wei said you were delivering food today? Are you not studying at all, just trying to annoy me on purpose?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: You’re really so concerned about your face, I knew you wouldn’t stick with it.\"\n\"Heh—\" Lin Li sneered.\nBao Wei really is a snitch.\n\"You initiated a video call\"\n\"Hello?\" Bai Bufan answered, but there was no sight of his face, only the ceiling.\n— Bai Bufan would avoid showing any of his weaknesses in front of Lin Li, the screenshot kid.\n\"Shh—I’ll mute you now, you just watch,\" Lin Li said only that, muted the phone, and placed it aside facing him, immediately starting the second round of studying.\nAnother twenty minutes passed, Lin Li turned his head, and was surprised to find that Bai Bufan hadn’t angrily hung up, but instead showed his face, staring intently at Lin Li.\nSeemed like he was also gritting his teeth.\nSpending twenty minutes watching him study, Bai Bufan had lived his life.\nAfter another twenty minutes, when Lin Li turned his head again, Bai Bufan was crying, tears streaming down both cheeks, staring blankly at him.\nSpending forty minutes watching him study, Bai Bufan had eternity.\nLin Li finally unmuted the phone.\nAnd then sneered.\nEyes weren’t red, tears unevenly spread, sobbing was pretentious, spotted fake immediately, eye drops on the spot.\n\"Crying? Crying counts for time.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Bao Wei cried and you became the gentleman, but when I cry, you tell me crying counts for time? Is my status lower than Bao Wei’s, I won’t accept this! Didn’t you say yesterday you couldn’t bear to see your buddy cry?\" Bai Bufan broke down.\nLin Li closed his eyes.\nThe meaning is simple.\nOnce you close your eyes, you can’t stand it.\n\"Damn!! I’m studying! I’m also studying! I’ll outcompete you, you groove-churning thing!\"\nThe boy’s blush surpassed any romantic words. Bai Bufan turned off the video, flushed, and made a bold vow.\n\"The ancestors of the Bai Family really ought to rise and bow to my brother. Bufan met us and decided to amend his ways. It’s like their ancestral grave is emitting green smoke.\" Lin Li laughed and shook his head.\nThen he added in his heart—a joke, you guys better not actually rise.\nLin Li continued to study.\nHe studied for a total of two hours, one hour was memory-based study with the [Strong Recognition] segment, and the rest of the time without strong memory was spent on solving science problems.\nTo achieve a high ranking in the monthly exam, you need to be well-rounded and balanced, relying solely on rote memorization is not enough.\nThen, under Wu Min’s hesitant and reluctant gaze, he asked her to scan his face to log in to the delivery app, participating in the late-night snack delivery rush.\nConsidering Wu Min goes to bed quite early, Lin Li only delivered for two hours at night, returning around eleven, increasing the task completion count by just 2, reaching 13.\nIt’s worth mentioning that after two hours of effort, the balance went from 5.0 to 4.0.\nLin Li’s biological clock was actually somewhat tired, but he didn’t sleep, instead he continued studying.\nWhen midnight arrived, entering a new week.\n[Update complete.]\nSure enough, will his system always update at midnight every Monday?\nLin Li looked at the system interface, searching for what has been updated.\nIn the last update, the system’s UI added an option, but it had no text and was gray, unable to be selected.\nBut this time, although there’s still no text, it can be selected, however, after selection, the new interface is completely blank without any options to operate.\nThis option representing the new feature is still a semi-finished product, estimating it still has a long way to go before becoming a finished product.\nNo problem, love, faith, wait.\nLooks like besides \"Hollow Knight: Silksong,\" \"GTA6,\" and \"Black Myth\" launching on XBOX, he has another thing to anticipate.\nDid you ask? Any news?\nLin Li clicked into the [Shop], both product slots and the free item replacement button lit up simultaneously.\nFirst, purchase Spirit Stone and \"Limit Break Talisman,\" leaving 790 system currency.\n\"In exchange for Bai Bufan going bald after sixteen, get me a high-grade Spirit Stone!\"\n[Low-grade Spirit Stone]\nUseless Bai Bufan.\nBut accustomed to it, no waves of emotion.\nConsidering the daily income from Spirit Stones in slot one is important, Lin Li chose to freely replace the \"Limit Break Talisman\"—he now has three, and unlike Bao Wei, he doesn’t need to hold back from breaking the limit of stubbornness, feeling this stock is already sufficient.\nSo even if something good refreshes, it can be replaced without any concerns.\nDamn, it’s all Zhou Baowei’s fault, assuming the tool is used for holding in shit.\n[You have refreshed \"Ability Amplifier (+1)\": 100 system currency (daily purchase limit 1), do you want to replace?]\n[Ability Amplifier (+1): Specify an owned ability for use, permanently enhance the effect of that ability, the enhancement limit is \"+1\"].\nIs it actually a tool that affects the system?\nWithout much hesitation, after analyzing the pros and cons for three seconds, Lin Li chose to replace.\nSorry, \"Limit Break Talisman,\" you are a great teammate, but now I need to take the talent elsewhere.\nLin Li purchased one on the spot.\nAs expected, the product slots share one free chance, now both buttons are gray, the system is really stingy.\n[Passive abilities: Bare-Handed Blade Catch, Wall of the Soul]\n[Active abilities: Charge, Strong Recognition, Mimic, Heal]\nThese are the six abilities he currently owns.\nThe one used most undoubtedly is [Strong Recognition], and the one that feels useful and has the broadest applicability, also able to link with other abilities, is [Charge].\nFirst, enhance [Strong Recognition], [Charge] will be enhanced tomorrow, directly skipping the two passive abilities that have no use in modern times, and as for [Mimic] and [Heal], they will depend on his future ’financial situation’ and system task issuance.\n[You have used the Ability Amplifier (+1) on \"Strong Recognition,\" \"Strong Recognition\" has been upgraded to \"Strong Recognition (+1)\"]\n[Strong Recognition (+1): After use, memory is increased to five times the usage amount, lasts for thirty minutes, accumulating one usage every eight hours, maximum storage limit is 3.]\nCompared to the original, the duration changed from twenty minutes to thirty minutes.\nThe change is small, but the enhancement is quite big, originally one could only have super memory for an hour a day, now it’s an hour and a half, pity the storage limit hasn’t changed.\nThe purpose of staying up was to confirm the system update time, after all these operations, Lin Li glanced at the messages on his phone and found Bai Bufan left him a message.\n\"Bai Bufan: Studied up till now, there’s one problem that’s stumped me, can I ask you?\"\n\"Lin Li: Go on.\"\nChen Yu Ying told him, first understand to lead others to understanding, also don’t underestimate problems the weak can’t solve, they might help fill in gaps.\nLin Li followed the guidance, prepared to pass on knowledge.\nThis is what is passed on as the torch, this is the meaning of education.\n\"Bai Bufan:\nA fisherman caught a mermaid by the sea, why did he release her?\nA. The mermaid was too ugly.\nC. The mermaid’s bust was too small.\nD. The fisherman had a kind heart.\"\nScrew the meaning of education.\n\"Idiot.\"\nLin Li felt he shouldn’t waste time on Bai Bufan, true sincerity was fed to the dogs, didn’t reply to the message, just turned over and slept.\nCounting on Bai Bufan, better to count on a dried-out pile of dog poop by the roadside.",

      "content": "Chapter 174: Chapter 149: Goodbye Mom, Tonight I Set Sail\nIt was close to midnight on Monday night.\nLess than twenty-four hours remain until the holiday ends.\nLin Li was lying in bed, just like last night, waiting for the stroke of midnight to arrive.\nToday, Lin Li did nothing but two things: this and that:\nHe got up early and continued practicing the Spiritual Qi Chapter in his room. His efforts over the last two days had almost finished the fourth Chapter of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, enhancing the efficiency of his use of Spiritual Qi once again.\nEven though he had spent much more time on the flesh Chapter than the Spiritual Qi Chapter, the third part was still not completely mastered.\nHowever, progress on both sides was already quite fast. It seemed, at this pace, as long as the supply of Spirit Stones could keep up, completing Task One’s one-month duration might allow him to nearly master all eight Chapters of the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\nOriginally, after finishing his practice in the morning, he had planned to make some deliveries like he did yesterday morning, but Wu Min hadn’t woken up.\nConsidering it was a rare chance for his mom to sleep in, and even though he could take another nap, Lin Li still didn’t want to disturb her.\nThere was no need to contact Shen Kai either, so Lin Li spent his morning learning, apart from taking a nap himself.\nHe made deliveries in the afternoon and evening.\nBut because he had gained a lot more experience, his efficiency was no worse than yesterday’s. Now the progress on Task Four had reached (26/30).\nHe was confident he could finish it before tomorrow evening’s self-study session, worse comes to worst, he’d just take another leave.\nIt’s worth mentioning that his account balance jumped from 4.0 to 10.0, becoming three digits — a legendary improvement.\nThe improvement prompted Wu Min to keep urging Lin Li not to think of making deliveries anymore.\nAs soon as the clock struck midnight, Lin Li immediately went to the [Store] to exchange items.\n[Low-grade Spirit Stone].\nThis damned probability: even when facing bad luck, trying one’s hardest is of no avail. Lin Li sighed with regret.\nHe exchanged for the \"Power-enhancement Tool (+1)\" again.\n\"Used to feel like there was nowhere to use it, but how come now there’s only 570 of system currency left?\" Lin Li whispered to himself.\n[You have used the Power-enhancement Tool (+1) on Charging, updated to Charging (+1)]\n[Charging (+1): Causes your right hand to be completely paralyzed for two hours, after which you can accumulate one use opportunity. For the subsequent hour after using it, the output strength, power, and skill effects of the right hand will be doubled. Paralysis and skill usage cannot be halted, with a storage limit of 3 for charging ability.]\nThe charging storage condition was demanding, requiring a two-hour paralysis, but with the output effect now tripled, Lin Li found it worth it.\nHis late-night operations were completed.\nJust a bit of time on the phone, and then he could sleep once more. Tomorrow, no, today would be another busy day.\nOn his phone, a few people had left him messages, and he even spotted a notification for a red envelope in the group chat.\nAfter all, today was Tuesday, the day when boarding students must return, and it was also the Mid-Autumn Festival, a time when some classmates had the habit of sending holiday greetings in the group chat.\n——Sending holiday greetings on minor festivals is something done either by the quite young or the quite old.\nLin Li politely responded one by one, grateful that they chose to include him in their mass messages.\nTA thought of me.\n「Yao Qiaoqiao: Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, Lin Li.」\nThere was one that wasn’t a bulk message, although, it wasn’t sent right on time either. Felt like it was sent to people one by one on the list.\nWarmed him throughout the day.\n「Lin Li: Happy Mid-Autumn Festival to you too.」\n「Yao Qiaoqiao: \"Hehe\"」\nThe essence of humanity is repetition. Also, your meme was nice, but now it’s mine.\n「Lin Li: \"Hehe\"」\n「Yao Qiaoqiao: \"New Hehe\"」\nLin Li: Too lazy to reply, hehe.\n「Wang Ze: On August 15th, the bright moon shines; With friends and family, enjoy the moon and flowers; A time of reunion, damn you; Share past stories, full of blessings; A bright moon, look ahead; Mid-Autumn Festival, may everything go well!」\nJust as Lin Li was about to send \"Are you kidding me with a mass message too, right?\" he squinted and noticed something amiss.\nHiding it pretty deep, aren’t you?\nYou sneaky bastard.\n「Lin Li: Wang Ze, are you sure you can eat mooncakes instead of steamed buns today? I feel like you’re missing some stuffing.」\nIt took Wang Ze a few minutes to respond.\n「Wang Ze: ?」\n「Wang Ze: Even if it was a mass message, it doesn’t need to be this violent, right?」\n「Lin Li: What are you pretending for? Want me to report your face-changing, do you, little brother. \"Pat Head\" 」\n「Wang Ze: What are you talking about?」\n「Lin Li: I’ve spotted the profanity in your blessing, it’s too obvious, dumbass. Next time, hide it better like in acrostic or telestich poems.」\nWang Ze didn’t reply immediately.\nLooks like he was furious after being exposed.\nHalf a minute later.\n「Wang Ze: Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!!」\n「Wang Ze: Lin Li, I’m screwed, damn! This was Zhang Haoyang’s post in our dorm group, I didn’t notice \"damn you\" and directly mass sent it!\nYou guys deserved the insult, but the problem is I also mass sent it to several family groups and relatives!\n\"Oh crap, it’s been two minutes and I can’t retract it anymore! Argh!! What do I do now!!\"\nThen Wang Ze frantically started spamming gifs, flooding the chat.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Lin Li: ᓖ뮤? Are you kidding?\"\n\"Wang Ze: If I’m lying, may I be infertile while my descendants are aplenty, and may my colon develop taste buds! I really wish this wasn’t real!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis vow is so extreme, you have to believe it now.\nConsidering Wang Ze’s current predicament, Lin Li could feel himself breaking out in a sweat.\nThis is terrifying.\nSending it to guys is fine, sending it to girls...still kind of okay, but sending it to elders...\nLin Li called, and Wang Ze picked it up immediately. Lin Li quickly said, \"Wang Ze, I have a way that might alleviate your current issue a bit.\"\n\"Tell me quickly, what should I do now?\" Wang Ze’s voice sounded anxious.\n\"Do you have a computer nearby?\" Lin Li was much calmer.\n\"Yes, I do!\"\n\"Start it up, connect your phone via USB, then click on the link to the cloud drive I sent you on WeChat and download it.\"\n\"Give me a moment, give me a moment. Damn it, Lin Li, it’s lucky I have you, otherwise I really wouldn’t know what to do.\" The sound from Wang Ze’s side immediately became filled with rustling, seemingly getting out of bed, with the sound of a notebook being opened and keys being tapped, and a tone full of gratitude.\nThen the gratitude abruptly stopped, and Wang Ze’s voice turned stiff and mechanical, voice acting as if stating: \"...Why the hell are they porn?\"\n\"This way you can have a last hurrah before you go. I highly recommend it, remember to watch it on a computer, big screen, much more enjoyable!\" Lin Li happily said.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nSeeing that Wang Ze wasn’t speaking, Lin Li then added, \"If you’re not in the mood for that right now, I also have a link with an amazing video of a line of sows falling into a ditch. It’s really funny; do you want to watch it?\"\n\"Screw off Lin Ziqiao! You freaking bastard!\" Wang Ze roared, \"Your respiratory tract and vocal tract are conjoined, spewing nonsense at a time like this!\"\n\"Ha, good one, saving this for next time when cursing out Bufan.\" Lin Li laughed even while getting cursed at.\n\"Oh well, you can’t undo it. If you want, you can resend a group apology, but be forewarned, it’ll make those who didn’t notice now pay attention, especially those who thanked you, it’ll be more awkward. It’s a dead end.\"\nAfter having his laugh, Lin Li offered a barely helpful suggestion, then comforted:\n\"Sometimes, when things go wrong, changing perspective might make them less terrible. Like the Leaning Tower of Pisa – to us, it’s crooked, but to Hawking, it’s straight. That’s the charm of perspective.\nSo, changing a perspective, your silly act could be seen as a massive friend test.\nA friend like me, who quickly noticed your hidden foul language, truly cares and should be revered like ancestors, preferably with a 200-yuan tribute;\nWhile those who don’t notice the language by tomorrow are fake friends, and removing them isn’t a pity.\"\n\"What if true friends turn into fake friends after seeing this message?\" Wang Ze asked.\n\"Then they deserve to be removed.\" Lin Li calmly analyzed.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nYou bastard.\nWang Ze didn’t speak; after a few seconds, sobbing sounds came through.\nThe day before yesterday Zhou Baowei cried, yesterday Bai Bufan cried, and today Wang Ze cried.\nLin Li should have felt guilty for doing such a terrible thing.\nBut the problem is, the sobbing sound was somewhat familiar to Lin Li, sounding distinctly feminine, and unlike a local person. With memory now better than before, Lin Li remembered it seemed to be from that movie he just sent.\nYou bastard.\n\"Why the hell are you already watching it?\" Now it was Lin Li’s turn to be silent.\n\"You sent it, I downloaded it, the computer is already on, might as well watch it. Hmm, not bad taste.\" Wang Ze’s tone was emotionless.\nThe ethereal sound made Lin Li feel a bit remorseful.\nSome people sound alive but have been dead for a while.\nThis isn’t watching a movie; this is seeking spiritual solace, like watching the Spring Festival Gala just to make the room less quiet during New Year.\nWatch it, watch it, if the kid loves to watch, let him watch more.\n\"Knock knock knock!\" On the phone, the sound of knocking suddenly came.\n\"Wang Ze, come out! What did you just post in the family group!\" A middle-aged woman’s heartfelt call followed.\n\"Lin Li, thanks for the video. I have to go, gotta hang up.\" Wang Ze said, taking a deep breath and laughing once.\nBeep—Beep—\nWang Ze hung up.\nJust now, I shouldn’t have cursed Wang Ze; Wang Ze certainly had true friends, but the problem is, it seems Wang Ze’s true friends may lose one of their own.\nNot sure if I’ll still see him during tomorrow evening’s study session.\nLin Li shared the story, and everyone built their joy upon Wang Ze’s misery, all laughing happily.\nWhen a whale falls, all things arise. Wang Ze only paid with his life to trade for so many people’s cheerful smiles. Surely he’ll rest in peace in the Underworld.\nOf course, not everyone was amused:\n\"Zhang Haoyang: Can someone raise a cry-fund for me to get two Resurrection Armors? If two’s too many, just one for my mom will do; I just got a death threat, urgent.\"\nZhang Haoyang, you’re quite the filial one, huh.",

      "content": "Chapter 175: Chapter 150: Unexpectedly, It’s a University Luminary\nMorning.\nIn the [warehouse], only two Spirit Stones were left. To be prepared for emergencies, Lin Li decided to head to the community park to practice martial arts, focusing on the odd-numbered body Chapters today.\n\"Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, Grandpa Zhou.\" Before practicing, Lin Li greeted Zhou Youwei.\nZhou Youwei looked at Lin Li for three seconds and sighed, \"You came back after all. I thought you had given up.\"\nNostalgia was written all over his face, and Lin Li astutely picked up on Old Deng’s little prideful thoughts.\n\"The word ’give up’ isn’t in my dictionary, Grandpa. I’m not one of those young people who just quit halfway,\" Lin Li said proudly.\nOf course, the dictionary Lin Li referred to was his Oxford Dictionary at home, full of foreign words, and guess what, there really is no ’give up’ in it.\nJust like how Edison never said the word ’give up’, after all, he didn’t speak Chinese.\nAs for Lin Li’s Chinese dictionary, it’s full of things that wouldn’t pass censorship.\n\"Emphasizing that you’re young, huh? Things are getting interesting. An old steed in the stable, still aspiring for a thousand miles. I’ll keep watching you. I’m not giving up either.\" Zhou Youwei declared firmly as he stared at Lin Li.\n\"No problem. I won’t let you down.\" Lin Li vowed to prove his perseverance.\nAnd with that, he began practicing martial arts.\nHalfway through his practice, Zhang Fang was walking on the path outside the bushes. Seeing Lin Li and Zhou Youwei, she suddenly remembered something and shouted to them, \"Old Zhou, Xiaolin!\"\n\"Hey, what’s up, Grandma Zhang?\" Lin Li halted his stance and inquired.\n\"Xiaolin, I saw you haven’t replied to the messages in the community group. Just asking now if you guys are planning to go to the community activity room to make mooncakes later?\" Zhang Fang asked, then showed the bag in her hand, which seemed to contain ingredients like flour.\nGenerally, good management would organize some activities during holidays, but Lin Li’s community definitely doesn’t enjoy such perks. This event must be organized by their unofficial neighborhood committee, funded out of pocket without expectations of returns.\nIn an old community, most residents are retired and prefer organizing activities. Whether as participants or organizers, it provides a way to pass the time.\nIt’s essentially a pretext for everyone to gather and chat while doing something.\n\"Not going, I have no interest in making mooncakes.\" Zhou Youwei was the first to wave it off.\nLin Li initially wanted to decline, thinking that the time could be better spent sleeping or studying. But then he nodded, \"Sure, Grandma Zhang, is it in the activity room? I’ll go take a shower after my exercise and be there.\"\nIn Lin Li’s [warehouse], there was still a \"Body Strengthening and Disease Expelling Pill,\" which he planned to give to Wu Min. The problem was that, like traditional Chinese pills, it was large, and Lin Li hadn’t found a reason or opportunity to get Wu Min to swallow it these past few days.\nMaking mooncakes himself might be a good opportunity.\n\"I’ll go too.\" Zhou Youwei immediately changed his mind.\nLin Li and Zhang Fang both turned to look at Zhou Youwei.\nZhou Youwei’s elderly face remained calm: \"I don’t trust Lin Li going alone. I have to keep an eye on him.\"\nBoth Lin Li and Zhang Fang were relieved.\nThe two exchanged glances, everything unspoken:\nXiaolin, your relationship with Old Zhou is really good.\nYeah, my relationship with Xiaozhou is really good.\n...\n[Committed to getting up before 5:00 AM and earnestly practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique for at least half an hour before 7:00 AM, (11/30)]\nAfter finishing his exercise, Lin Li went home to shower and change clothes. He prepared a \"Body Strengthening and Disease Expelling Pill,\" wrapped it in tissue and tucked it in his pocket, and headed to the community activity room.\nThe \"Body Strengthening and Disease Expelling Pill\" now had a small notch—Lin Li had taken a bit himself, and it tasted like traditional Chinese medicine, slightly astringent and a bit bitter, not pleasant to eat.\nHowever, there were no magical phenomena like feeling energy circulating in the body.\nThis way, he could be more reassured that his mom wouldn’t experience any adverse changes after consuming it.\nInside the activity room, there weren’t many people, and as Lin Li expected, they were mostly of the older generation or two, mainly grandmas and aunties. Male participants were rare, and the conversations weren’t in standard Mandarin, but in Xiling dialect.\nZhou Youwei hadn’t arrived yet.\nZhang Fang saw Lin Li, walked over, wiped her hands, and asked, \"Xiaolin, do you know how to make mooncakes?\"\n\"I just watched a tutorial, so I should be able to,\" Lin Li replied honestly.\nLearning on the spot isn’t embarrassing; Lin Li’s life before getting the system was all about improvisation.\n\"Alright, let me tell you, here are the materials, here’s the pre-mixed flour, molds are over here, and the microwave is there. Making mooncakes is simple; you young folks are smart. If you don’t understand anything, you can just ask Grandma or anyone else.\"\n\"Okay, thank you, Grandma.\"\nZhang Fang smiled and nodded, then returned to chat with a few friends while continuing to make mooncakes.\nJust as Zhang Fang left, the only young person in the room came over and patted Lin Li on the shoulder, \"Let’s make mooncakes, I’ll guide you.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nDude, who the hell are you?\nNoticing Lin Li’s confusion, the young person quickly whispered, \"You don’t want to become the focal point of the grandpas and grandmas’ conversations later, do you? Saving me is saving yourself too!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nBeing the young one among the elderly can indeed make you a spotlight.\nRight now, quite a few eyes were curiously checking out Lin Li.\n\"Alright.\" Having another young person to chat with would indeed be better, Lin Li nodded and followed the person to the materials area.\nThe available fillings were limited and classic: jujube paste, lotus seed egg yolk, and five-nuts. There were no signs of new-style mooncake ingredients here.\nEach of these three types of mooncakes had its distinctive qualities: jujube paste tasted better than the other two, lotus seed egg yolk was more fragrant, and five-nuts simply had more ingredients than the other two.\nWhoever invented the green and red threads in five-nut mooncakes must have a strange sense of taste. Just seeing them made Lin Li uncomfortable, as if tasting an overwhelming sweet sugary flavor.\nSo, without hesitation, he only picked the other two types for fillings.\n\"What’s your name, I’m Zeng Ziang,\" the young person introduced himself.\n\"My name is Lin Li.\"\nLin Li started by taking some flour and used a rolling pin to make the pastry.\nHe looked at the size of the mold again; it shouldn’t be a problem to put the \"Strength and Disease Prevention Pill\" inside.\n\"Lin Li, did you come here alone?\" During the process of rolling the pastry, Zeng Ziang asked with some confusion.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Why did you come here to make mooncakes by yourself so early, at just seven in the morning?\" Zeng Ziang was even more shocked, \"I thought you’d be brought here by your family like me.\"\nZeng Ziang then sighed, \"When I first came home during the Mid-Autumn holiday from school, they treated me like a treasure, but in just a few days, they started to dislike me.\"\nLin Li couldn’t quite understand Zeng Ziang’s situation.\nWu Min had been home for so long, and Lin Li had never found her annoying.\nAs for Sister Min’s view of him, it was probably consistently disapproving.\n\"By the way, are you still in school, bro? A graduate student?\" Despite being relatively young, Zeng Ziang’s appearance no longer resembled a child’s, and Lin Li believed he had already been working for years.\n\"I’m in my fourth year of college now. I wanted to be a graduate student, but after my thesis draft was shown to my professor once, I gave up.\" Zeng Ziang shook his head.\n\"Why?\" Lin Li asked curiously.\n\"Because my advisor said my thesis is of too significant strategic value.\"\n\"Then shouldn’t you pursue graduate studies more?\"\n\"But he said the strategic significance is that if we find a way to let other countries steal my thesis, it would set their tech back by ten years. I suspect he was being sarcastic.\"\n\"Bro, you should trust yourself.\" After a moment of silence, Lin Li encouraged.\n\"I do believe in myself. I think my thesis is okay, but the decision is in the teacher’s hands, and he doesn’t listen to me.\"\n\"No, bro, I meant you should trust your judgment. Your advisor is being sarcastic, no need to doubt it.\" Lin Li quickly explained.\nZeng Ziang: \"...\"\n\"Has anyone ever told you that your words are hurtful, Lin Li?\"\n\"Everyone says that.\" Lin Li nodded.\nZeng Ziang: \"...\"\nSo, you’re a habitual offender.\n\"With undergraduate theses being this difficult, I can’t even imagine doing a grad thesis. I’d just end up postponing my graduation. Plus, my English isn’t good, so I’ve completely given up on grad school.\" Zeng Ziang returned to the original topic.\n\"So are you planning to look for a job, bro? Doing any internships? Found any ways to make money?\" Lin Li asked curiously.\n\"Not really, jobs are hard to find now, I’m preparing for civil service exams.\" Zeng Ziang shook his head but then complained helplessly, \"But the current environment is really tough. I looked at the positions in Xiling, and the competition ratio is as high as hundreds to one. I don’t even know what to say, hiring from hundreds of people to just one, it’s insane.\nAh, the old environment was better, now there’s no way to live.\"\n\"Indeed,\" Lin Li nodded, agreeing with him, \"In the past, there were no application statements, no essays, just by being castrated you could succeed.\"\nZeng Ziang: \"?\"\n\"Uh... Lin Li, your ’past’ is a bit too far in the past. If we’re talking about that past, I might not even consider civil service exams.\" Feeling a chill below, Zeng Ziang was somewhat sweaty.\nThe past he talked about was years ago, but Lin Li’s referred to hundreds of years ago.\n\"Lin Li, what are you studying now, high school?\" Feeling like he couldn’t keep up with Lin Li, Zeng Ziang changed the subject to talking about himself, suspecting it’s better than being surrounded by the older generation, so he shifted the topic.\n\"Yeah, first year of high school,\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Which high school?\"\n\"Nansang.\"\n\"That’s impressive, I missed the Nansang cutoff by six points in my entrance exam, so I ended up at Xiling First Middle School.\" Zeng Ziang praised him, then sighed a bit:\n\"High school is such an amazing time. Asking me to go back and endure another three years, I’d refuse, but I’ll always cherish those years. What’s the saying, you don’t remember the battlefield, only the comrades.\"\n\"Isn’t college life good?\" Lin Li asked after hearing this.\n\"Of course there are things that are good,\" Zeng Ziang immediately retorted.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"I’m sorry, I’m sorry, pretend I didn’t say that,\" Zeng Ziang closed his mouth immediately.\nDammit, how could I taint a pure, innocent high school kid?\n\"Ahem, life is definitely a hundred times better than high school. To put it this way, the first seventeen weeks of each semester in college are like you can go to a top-notch massage place to soak your feet anytime... Uh, can you understand this description? You’ve probably never soaked your feet, but just know it’s very, very comfortable and enjoyable.\"\nLin Li sneered in his heart.\nOld geezer, who are you looking down on?\nWho hasn’t soaked their feet before?\nI’ve fought too many times to count and soaking is even easier.\nBut then Lin Li asked, \"What about after those seventeen weeks?\"\n\"Hehe.\" Zeng Ziang suddenly laughed with relief, \"After the start of the finals week in college life, it’s like having to drink all the foot soak water from the previous seventeen weeks.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"If you worked hard and didn’t soak your feet in the first seventeen weeks, then the water is odorless, and you’d finish it in no time.\"\n\"But if you soaked your feet every day for seventeen weeks, this water becomes terribly hard and painful to swallow, scratching your throat.\"\nZeng Ziang’s first half was quite perfunctory, but the second half was heartfelt. Which part he belonged to was without doubt.\nLin Li nodded in agreement.\nWhat a precise analogy, it just immediately made sense.",

He’s worried that once it’s heated in the microwave, the pill might undergo some unexpected change or transformation.\nAnyway, since it’s a homemade mooncake, if it looks a bit off, mom probably won’t think it’s strange. After baking, he can cut it open and stuff it in.\n\"Let’s go, brother, let’s put it in the microwave,\" Lin Li said.\n\"Okay.\"\nThere’s only one microwave in the activity room, so many of the other elderly ladies and gentlemen waiting to bake gathered here to chat and queue.\n\"Brother, how many minutes do you think would be suitable for baking?\" There are so many online guides, so Lin Li decided to ask Zeng Ziang.\n\"I don’t know much about microwaves, the only thing I know is not to easily believe online information, especially the one about microwaving durian and it suddenly smells like chestnuts.\" Zeng Ziang waved his hands and backed away repeatedly.\n\"Two years ago, the rumor about someone cooking something nasty in the neighborhood was your house, right?\" Lin Li suddenly remembered, \"That day, the guy who got stopped at the door, wasn’t that you?\"\nZeng Ziang: \"...\"\nSilence is the best answer.\nLin Li didn’t dare ask Zeng Ziang any further, so he chose to ask Zhang Fang, who was not far away.\n\"It depends on the thickness of your pastry. I suggest you bake it for three minutes first. If it’s not done, bake it more. Microwave heating can dry things out, making them hard, resulting in a bad texture. So, it’s better to do short times more often than to overdo it.\"\nZhang Fang gave a rational suggestion.\nCan anything in the microwave become hard with long heating?\nLin Li had a bold idea. He wasn’t willing to risk it with his own; next time, he’d try it with Bai Bufan’s.\nSo, Lin Li followed Zhang Fang’s guidance and put his and Zeng Ziang’s mooncakes in the oven.\n\"Is this Wu Min’s kid, Lin Li, right?\" As they entered the group of elderly, the scene Zeng Ziang described of being surrounded by elders immediately began to play out.\n\"It’s me, Grandma,\" Lin Li politely responded.\n\"I even held you when you were little, remember me?\" the other person said with a smile.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhy do adults like to randomly hold kids?!\nDo they know how much distress this causes kids?!\nThankfully, Zhang Fang saved the day, introducing the other person as also surnamed Wu and related through a few generations up with Lin Li’s mom.\n\"How’s your studying going?\" followed by the usual questions like visiting family.\n\"It’s okay.\"\n\"Are you dating anyone?\"\n\"Grandma, I’m just in high school, not yet. I’m still single at the moment. For questions like this, you should ask Brother Ziang. He’s definitely more worried than I am.\" Lin Li pointed to Zeng Ziang, who was trying to hide in the corner.\nZeng Ziang: \"?\"\nOpenly diverting the issue?\nHe thought he and Lin Li were good friends, but apparently not!\n\"Ziang, you know, I also held you when you were little.\"\nZeng Ziang: \"...Hello, Grandma Wu.\"\nGrandma Wu nodded with a smile: \"About to graduate from college, have you found a job?\"\n\"It’s okay.\"\n\"Are you dating anyone?\"\n\"Currently still single.\" Zeng Ziang smiled and nodded.\n\"Being single and not being wanted are two different things, don’t mix them up,\" an aunt said with a sneer.\nZeng Ziang: \"...\"\n\"Mom, your words are a bit hurtful.\"\n...\n\"Mom, your words are a bit hurtful.\"\n\"Let me emphasize again, this is a mooncake. I spent an entire morning working hard to make it for you.\nYou shouldn’t have just described it as ’this lump of a mess.’ That really makes me feel sad.\" Lin Li, back at home, was very upset while showing Wu Min the results of his mooncake, which was attacked.\nWu Min couldn’t hide the smile at the corners of her mouth. She pointed to the ’lump of a mess’ in front of her and the pile of crumbs beside it, saying:\n\"But it’s really hard for mom to believe this lump is a mooncake.\"\n\"It still has some shape. I already ate one earlier, and the taste is fine.\" Lin Li argued with reason.\nAlthough the technique wasn’t very good, resulting in a bit of an explosion (physically), it wasn’t that bad. The basic mooncake form was still recognizable.\n\"Alright, alright, mom will eat it, okay.\" Still with a smile in her breath, Wu Min reached out, and Lin Li carefully selected a mooncake and placed it in her hand.\n\"Made especially for you, the flavor is absolutely unique. It’s a taste you haven’t tried before, Sister Min.\" Lin Li said.\n\"Alright, mom is really looking forward to it.\"\nNo matter what, since it was a mooncake made by her own son with his own hands, Wu Min was truly touched.\nIf it weren’t for the lesson from delivering takeout the day before yesterday, Wu Min would have already written an essay for her social media and shared it with her siblings.\nWith one bite, the crust was quite crispy.\nThe filling tasted sweet at first, seemed like date paste, then dry, then bitter, and then... huh?\nWu Min frowned. If this wasn’t made by her son, she probably would have spat it out. With difficulty, she swallowed and examined the mooncake she just bit into, asking suspiciously, \"What kind of filling is this, why is it so dark?\"\n\"Herbal ingredients.\" Lin Li answered quite honestly.\n\"So it’s herbal filling. No wonder it’s so bitter. This can be under... No! I can’t understand it! Why would there be herbal ingredient mooncakes?!!\" Wu Min, who had forced herself to nod as if understanding, suddenly questioned.\n\"Would you say it’s a brand new version you’ve never tried before?\" Lin Li replied quite straightforwardly.\nWu Min: \"...\"\n\"Is this edible?\"\nThank goodness, at least she hadn’t written an essay on social media or shared it with her siblings.\nHer face was saved once less.\nSeeing Wu Min planning to put the rest of the mooncake back, Lin Li quickly explained, \"Mom, rest assured, it is absolutely edible, harmless to the human body, and quite healthy. How could I ever harm you?\"\nWu Min gave Lin Li a doubtful glance, \"I trust my son.\"\n\"Trust is good.\"\n\"No, I believe you can do such heinous things.\" Wu Min added.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nMy mom, her words really hurt.\n\"Mom, if you keep talking like this, I’m really going to get angry. I wouldn’t do such things, I’m still relying on you to support me. You are my spiritual and physical double pillars to survive. If I did, it wouldn’t be until you got old... hehehe.\" Lin Li started chuckling.\nWu Min: \"...\"\nLaughter erupted.\nNone of the spankings Lin Li received growing up were in vain; being cheeky, it’s normal to pay a price.\n\"Is it really edible?\" However, Wu Min knew Lin Li was joking but raised the ’traditional new-style mooncake’ again, still a bit skeptical.\n\"It’s really edible, mom, and truly good for health. I’ll eat it and show you.\" Lin Li grabbed one piece of the mooncake and took a big bite.\nWu Min sighed and eventually managed to eat the bitter herbal mooncake.\nLin Li was very satisfied.\nThis way, mom’s health is expected to remain quite well for a long time.\nBut Wu Min noticed sharply, suddenly reached out to take the piece of mooncake Lin Li had just bitten, and squinted her eyes to inquire, \"Lin Li, this mooncake you ate doesn’t seem like the herbal one.\"\n\"I only made the herbal mooncake for you to eat, mom. I didn’t say I was eating that,\" Lin Li nonchalantly waved his hand. \"I ate the lotus seed paste with salted egg yolk. It’s not bad. Want to try it? These are all the same.\"\nWu Min: \"...\"\n\"Lin Li, your wings have really hardened, I can truly no longer control you!\" Wu Min took a deep breath.\nLin Li flexed his arms and patted his significantly larger biceps with pride, \"That’s right, look at your son’s wings, they’re strong now.\"\nWu Min: \"...\"\n...\nThe feather duster broke.\nIt’s not that it was used forcefully, but rather for too long, so when it was used on Lin Li’s voluntarily sticking-out bottom, it snapped after only a few hits.\nAt the moment it broke, both Lin Li and Wu Min paused, then began laughing.\n\"You’re really not a kid anymore; you’re so fast, about to turn eighteen.\" Wu Min looked at the broken feather duster, spoke with a gentle expression revealing memories.\n\"According to our national laws, the mother-son relationship lasts a lifetime, not dissolved after eighteen. So, I’m always your child. What, mom, are you planning to abandon me?\nThat’s illegal. If I tell Grandma you have this idea, you’re finished! Heh, I can’t control you, but Grandma can’t either?\" Lin Li sneered.\nWu Min raised her hand as if to slap Lin Li.\nLin Li certainly didn’t dodge.\nSo the hand aimed at his face landed on Lin Li’s head, rubbing his not-so-short hair, Wu Min smiled.\nLin Li picked up the old friend of his bottom and found it hard to repair, then looked up saying, \"Mom, in the afternoon I’ll buy a bigger, more suitable feather duster for spanking the current me.\"\n\"Get mom a whip. With barbed ones, too.\"\n\"That won’t do, my wings aren’t hard enough yet for that, need to wait until I’m stronger to consider it.\"\n\"Mom won’t whip your wings, just your bottom.\"\n\"My bottom isn’t as hard as my wings yet, that’s even less okay, you’ll have to wait until I practice the Iron Butt Cultivation Technique.\"\n\"Is there such a cultivation technique?\"\n\"Of course, mom, there’s a lot you don’t understand...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nSuch vacuous conversations continued between mother and son.",

      "content": "Chapter 177: Chapter 152: There Are Still More Good People in the World\nAfter finishing lunch, Lin Li asked Wu Min to help log him back into the food delivery account, then went out to wrap up task number four.\n\"Sun, it’s the Mid-Autumn Festival today, haven’t you kept track? Hou Yi should really shoot you in the face.\"\nAs Lin Li pushed the electric scooter to its maximum speed, feeling the slightly warm breeze blowing against him, he complained.\nWasn’t it supposed to be only June, July, and August that belonged to summer? Then what’s today’s high of thirty degrees supposed to mean?\n\"Your coffee.\" Lin Li ran towards the waiting customer down the office building.\n\"Thank you.\" The tired office worker yawned and returned to the building.\nDonkeys won’t whip themselves, but humans will buy coffee for their bosses.\nHumans, pretty impressive, right?\nEven Hannibal would shake his head at this; with Uncle Ba’s quality control, he surely wouldn’t eat the bitter workhorse.\nAnd isn’t spilling coffee more invigorating than drinking it? Why does everyone choose to drink it?\n\"Buddy, be careful, they’re checking helmets up ahead.\" On his way back, a passerby turned his head to remind Lin Li.\n\"Ah? Thanks, man!\"\nTruly a good person, Lin Li sincerely wished in his heart that he’d never lack love, nor people when doing that.\nHe quickly stopped the scooter and put on his helmet.\nIf caught, a fine is one thing, but he might also get an earful, especially since the scooter isn’t his, which could be a hassle.\nThe rental did come with a helmet, but Lin Li usually hung it on the front of the scooter without wearing it because wearing it for long would mess up his hair, turning a bowl-cut into flatbread-head, and combing the roots would sting. Lin Li, who didn’t enjoy such experiences, chose not to wear it under the mindset of taking a chance.\nOf course, it’s not recommended; safety is important.\nAfter securing the helmet, Lin Li continued forward.\n\"Uncle Yang?\"\n\"Lin Li?\"\nUpon reaching the intersection, Lin Li noticed someone in a Town Car Bureau uniform looked very familiar, and exclaimed in surprise.\n\"Uncle, how did you become a traffic cop?\" Lin Li maneuvered the electric scooter slightly out of the way and curiously asked.\nThough in small towns and villages, during manpower shortages, the Demon Suppression Bureau and Town Car Bureau did share personnel occasionally. But Lin Li remembered that Yangliang wasn’t exactly at the base level of the Demon Suppression Bureau, so it shouldn’t be up to him—especially since it’s Mid-Autumn today.\n\"Holiday shortages mean staffing issues, and I plan to save up for a long break to rest, so I swapped shifts.\" Yangliang sighed.\n\"I can see that! Uncle, you definitely need a good rest. You’ve become quite haggard.\" Lin Li noted Yangliang’s prominent dark circles and nodded in agreement, then advised with concern, \"Uncle, as you get older, you must take better care of your health.\"\nBe sure to value yourself so that when I succeed in cultivation, I can heal your chronic ailments.\nThe Yang family name is so rare; it must carry on.\nYangliang: \"...\"\nKid, want to guess what I’ve been busy with before my rotation?\nHowever, thanks to Lin Li’s ’aid’, the Sanqiao Demon Suppression Bureau received commendations from above, and the year-end bonuses would be quite substantial. Additionally, since Sanqiao appreciates the hard work and sacrifices of the anti-prostitution team, they not only offered bonuses but also provided extra leave, which Yangliang planned to use between Mid-Autumn and National Day to go out and unwind in the off-season.\nThe only issue is that the leadership hopes that next time they go to a city meeting, they can share their extraordinary anti-prostitution success stories with colleagues from other areas, almost making Yangliang sweat bullets.\nHow do you share that? Suggest everyone go meet Lin Li and get to know Song Luping?\nThese, though, didn’t need to be told to Lin Li. Yangliang didn’t want to add pressure on this poor yet strong kid, so he shifted the topic and asked Lin Li, \"I’ll be careful. Lin Li, are you... delivering food?\"\nYangliang looked at the Meituan helmet on Lin Li’s head and the thermal box at the back of the scooter, hesitant to believe his own judgment.\n\"Yeah.\" Lin Li turned around to open his thermal box, took out a bag containing bubble tea with the delivery seal still intact, and asked directly, \"Uncle, always standing around in this heat without even some shade, hard work—would you like some bubble tea?\"\nYangliang: \"?\"\nWhat kind of delivery person does that? You just take the customer’s stuff and offer it? That’s illegal, you know; they might need to call the police themselves.\nNo, before that—\n\"Lin Li, why are you a delivery person!?\" Yangliang’s tone suddenly dropped, laden with additional concern: \"Have you encountered any difficulties in life? Money problems?\"\n\"Not at all, Uncle Yang, money isn’t an issue. I haven’t even finished spending last time’s bonus. It’s purely for fun, to experience life. It’s quite interesting.\" Lin Li laughed and used the same excuse as he did with Wu Min.\nWatching Lin Li’s sunny smile, Yangliang fell silent.\nHe got it again.\nNo one understands Lin Li better than him.\nTruly a good kid, always figuring out ways to supplement the family’s income.\nAlthough, as he recalled, one can’t be a courier until they’re eighteen, but at this moment, how could he bring up such a matter and make Lin Li feel uncomfortable?\nLaw enforcement should be compassionate.\n\"I see.\" Yangliang’s throat felt dry as he slowly nodded, with nothing else to say.\n\"Uncle, I won’t keep you from your work anymore, and I need to keep delivering, or I’ll run over time.\" Lin Li then said.\n\"Okay, remember... if you need help, look for me.\"\nYangliang watched Lin Li ride off into the distance.\nTruly a good kid.\nThis time around, I will do my utmost to fight for the bonuses and honors for you, nephew.\n...\n[Perfect completion of 30 tasks issued by the Meituan Escort Sect (28/30)]",

It’s pretty much direct selling by farmers without any middlemen, making the price exceptionally cheap.\n\"Watermelons, two yuan for three catties, if they’re not ripe, they’re free! Watermelons, two yuan for three catties, if they’re not ripe, they’re free...\" The loudspeaker hanging on the truck kept broadcasting.\nThis price is indeed much cheaper than fruit shops and supermarkets.\nAfter delivering orders for so long, Lin Li was indeed a bit thirsty, so he rode his electric bike over.\nWait a minute, this boss...\n\"Uncle, do you remember me?\" Lin Li said in surprise as he approached on his electric bike.\n\"Huh? Who are you?\" The vendor was excited to see a customer but was puzzled after hearing Lin Li’s voice.\nHe stared at Lin Li’s face for a long time, but still couldn’t remember knowing such a young person, so he shook his head and said, \"I don’t know you.\"\n\"True, we are not acquainted, Uncle, I’ll just take these two watermelons then.\" Lin Li nodded, satisfied, and patted the two big watermelons, preparing to leave.\nThere really are many strange and good-natured people in this world.\nEspecially those who provide warmth to strangers.\nVendor: \"?\"\n\"Hey, you get back here!\"\n...\n\"It’s ’if the watermelons aren’t ripe, they’re free,’ not ’if we’re not acquainted, they’re free!’\" Lin Li didn’t really intend to run. The vendor easily stopped him and added through gritted teeth.\n\"Then Uncle, could you pick out two unripe ones for me? I don’t want the ripe ones.\" Lin Li nodded calmly upon hearing this.\nVendor: \"?\"\nToday, do you really want to get a free watermelon?\n\"Go, go, don’t disturb my business, just play somewhere else.\"\nIt seemed he couldn’t make a getaway with a free watermelon, so Lin Li obediently bought half a watermelon. Who says seedless watermelons are no good? Seedless ones are the best.\nWatermelons are only enjoyable when dug into, especially the first bite from the center, ideally chilled. So Lin Li asked the vendor to wrap it up with plastic wrap and placed it in the cooler box, planning to enjoy it after completing his task.\n\"Lin Li, is that really you? What are you doing here?\" Beside the truck, Chen Yu Ying said with slight surprise.\n\"Class Monitor? What are you doing here?\" Lin Li reflexively used the elementary school skill—bounce back.\n\"Of course, I’m heading to school, but my dad had some matters at the post office. I just heard your voice and came over to look, and it really is you.\" Chen Yu Ying explained.\nIndeed, Chen Yu Ying was wearing her slightly adjusted school uniform, not as stunning as the little blue dress.\nThe casual clothes version seemed to be something he wouldn’t see again for a long time.\n\"Are you going to school this early?\" It was only just past three in the afternoon, and evening self-study didn’t start until six, so Lin Li asked.\nLin Li generally went right on time.\n\"Yeah, I usually go pretty early.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"I see. As for me, I’m delivering food.\" Before Chen Yu Ying could ask more, Lin Li rode his electric bike to her side and patted his trunk.\n\"Delivering food? Why are you delivering food?\" Chen Yu Ying’s curiosity was undiminished.\n\"It’s nothing, just that I...\" Lin Li used his habitual excuse again to explain.\n\"Really, you’re even interested in this kind of thing?\" Chen Yu Ying nodded suddenly in realization and then asked curiously, \"Is delivering food fun?\"\nLin Li recalled the chicken steak from Bao Wei the other day, looked at Chen Yu Ying in front of him, and nodded, \"It’s quite interesting, there are often unexpected gains and surprises.\"\nChen Yu Ying lowered her head slightly, not locking eyes with Lin Li for long, and lightly nodded, \"Oh, oh.\"\nIf Chen Yu Ying knew that Lin Li had his mind full of chicken steak and Zhou Baowei, she probably wouldn’t react this way.\nSuddenly, Lin Li remembered something, slapped his forehead, opened the cooler box, and took out the milk tea he had once handed to Yangliang: \"Class Monitor, do you want this milk tea? Here you go.\"\n\"Ah, why are you giving it to me? Didn’t you buy it for yourself?\" Chen Yu Ying, having seen it opened before, thought it was bought by Lin Li himself and asked curiously.\n\"I didn’t buy it; it was given by an admirer.\" Lin Li shook his head and explained.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nChen Yu Ying blinked her pretty eyes once and then again, looking at the milk tea, she asked, \"Lin Li, is there a girl pursuing you?\"\n\"Misunderstanding, Class Monitor, it’s not my admirer. Here, look at the receipt on the note, and you’ll know.\" Lin Li chuckled and handed over a receipt.\nChen Yu Ying took it and saw the note on it said:\n\"If the call isn’t answered or she doesn’t want it, the rider should drink it themselves. Sorry for the inconvenience.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nSo that’s the kind of admirer she was.\nIndeed, it was given by an admirer.\n\"I don’t really like milk tea, I feel it’s a bit sticky and doesn’t quench thirst. I’m a fan of refreshing fruit tea, so if you don’t mind, Class Monitor, take it and drink it. I have no use for it.\" Lin Li then explained.\nThis was also why Lin Li handed it directly to Yangliang before.\n\"Alright then, I’ll treat you to fruit tea next time to make up for it.\" Chen Yu Ying thought for a moment and didn’t refuse, taking the secondhand milk tea from the admirer.\n\"Sure.\" Lin Li nodded.\nThe phone had already reminded him that he could pick up the order. Lin Li was about to say goodbye when a loud honk came from behind.\nHe turned his head to see a car stopped behind him, with the owner impatiently honking at Lin Li for blocking the road.\nActually, the owner was the problem, as Lin Li was riding on the non-motorized lane. However, in small towns, this wasn’t strictly regulated—as evidenced by the watermelon truck parked there. With Chen Yu Ying around, Lin Li didn’t bother quarreling with the driver and smoothly drifted uphill to get out of the way.\nAs he watched the car owner leave, Lin Li snorted coldly: \"I’ll remember today’s humiliation, don’t underestimate the young and poor. When I make it big, I’ll definitely equip my electric bike with a super loud horn, and we’ll see who can out-honk whom!\"\nChen Yu Ying chuckled: \"Lin Li, can’t you dream a bit bigger? Can’t you aim to have a car yourself?\"\n\"Well, isn’t it because I don’t have a driver’s license yet? I need to be realistic.\" Lin Li explained.\n\"You sure are pragmatic, but Lin Li, you’re already riding an electric bike. That’s impressive.\" Chen Yu Ying praised.\n\"Our Xiling doesn’t strictly require an electric bike license yet. If you mention an electric bike license, I don’t have one either, but without enforcement, you can ride it however. If you can ride a bicycle, you can ride an electric bike.\"\nWith that tone, expression, and admiring small eyes from Chen Yu Ying, her praise made Lin Li feel quite flattered and somewhat bashful.\n[After studying and mimicking Chen Yu Ying’s operation inside the Mecha, you finally, through your own means, attempted and successfully took control of a Mecha. This world will begin to be amazed by you.\nAs Chen Yu Ying witnessed this, she noticed your Mecha synchronization index was remarkably high and that you piloted it exceedingly smoothly.\nThis is your golden opportunity to showcase your talents, establish yourself firmly in this world, and achieve deep emotional ties!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Two: Share and teach Chen Yu Ying your insights on piloting a Mecha, enrich her related knowledge, and enhance her piloting abilities.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha synchronization index +10; Random ability*1; System currency*150]",

      "content": "Chapter 179: Chapter 153: Who Will Be Moved\nThe system always seems to prompt a task at times Lin Li doesn’t expect.\nHe took a look at the task description.\nIs this basically asking him to teach Chen Yu Ying how to ride an electric bicycle?\nThe task gauge was just another progress bar, with no specific data.\n\"I can’t even ride a bicycle yet, so definitely not an electric bike,\" Chen Yu Ying replied at that moment.\nLin Li raised an eyebrow.\nThe direction of this task was now clearer.\nIn the system’s perspective, a bicycle probably has nothing to do with a mecha since it’s not electric, but an electric bike definitely counts.\n\"Class leader, you don’t know how to ride a bike? That’s unexpected.\"\n\"My parents can’t really either, they both drive cars, so I never learned,\" Chen Yu Ying said a bit bashfully, slightly retracting her neck, and playfully stuck out her tongue.\n\"So, class leader, do you want to learn to ride a bike?\" Lin Li promptly followed up with a question.\n\"Although there’s nothing I need it for right now, it’s surely better to know than not,\" Chen Yu Ying said noncommittally.\n\"It definitely comes in handy, like when everyone goes out to play; a scenario where everyone rides a shared bike might come up.\"\n\"True,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded in agreement.\n\"So, how about I teach you when I’m free? Riding a bike is quite easy, I learned it in just one afternoon,\" Lin Li said naturally. \"You teach me to study, I teach you perversion and bike riding, then our future will be brighter.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nLin Li is really dedicated when it comes to perversion, isn’t he?\nHowever, she smiled and nodded, \"Is it that simple? Then I might try learning it then.\"\nLin Li smiled.\nHehe, class leader, I’m lying to you.\nBack then, I actually spent three whole afternoons and fell countless times before I learned it.\nIt would be really cute if the class leader cried after falling.\nMwahahaha.\n\"Is the thing your dad’s doing at the post office taking long?\" Lin Li asked again.\n\"Not long. He should be out soon, he said about ten minutes. I’ve already been waiting for ten minutes,\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head.\n\"Looks like it’s not happening today then. But that’s just as well. I need to continue delivering takeout; I’m at risk of being late, so I’ll go on delivering first. See you at school, let’s find another opportunity then?\" Lin Li nodded, twisting the key of his electric bike again.\nOld Deng is about to come out, so it’s unrealistic to whisk away his daughter to learn cycling.\nAnyway, it’s not a timed task, no rush. Better to steadily complete one task at a time.\n\"Alright.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nSo Lin Li slowly rode away.\nThen Lin Li slowly reversed back.\nEven before Chen Yu Ying could turn around: \"?\"\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"Class leader, it’s been a long time since I taught you perversion. Today I’ll teach you a little trick with driving. If you borrow a small amount of money through QQ micro-lending and post some lewd pictures in a group, Tencent will usually only ban you for a day at most, never permanently,\" Lin Li said slowly.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nAn increase in useless trivia.\n\"Thank you.\" Chen Yu Ying only found it somewhat amusing and said.\nLin Li laughed too.\nDamn system.\nIn being unreliable, it’s surprisingly reliable.\nLin Li suddenly thought just now, that modern electrically powered rides could be considered mechas by the system, so what about online ’driving’?\nSo he came back to experiment a bit.\nThe progress bar increased.\nThough only slightly, but it increased.\nDamn, cyber-driving counts as driving too? Truly, a system that mistakes thunder for a storm.\nBut it increased too insignificantly. To fill up the progress bar this way, after depleting his know-how, Lin Li probably would need to learn new driving knowledge while worrying about turning into a shameless pervert in Chen Yu Ying’s view.\nLet’s consider it a back-up. If Chen Yu Ying learns to ride an electric bike but the task still isn’t complete, he can slowly grind it to completion this way.\n\"Alright, I’m really off to deliver takeout now.\" Even if further experiments are needed, let it be on a lunchtime after returning to school; Lin Li bid farewell again.\n\"Okay, bye-bye.\" Chen Yu Ying waved once more.\nThis time Lin Li really drove off.\n\"Yingying, let’s go.\" Chen Yu Ying heard a shout from behind, turned back, and saw her father already standing beside the car waving at her with documents in hand.\n\"Coming.\" Chen Yu Ying instantly walked over.\n\"Did you just order takeout or know that person?\" The car’s air conditioning hadn’t been turned off; after his daughter got into the passenger seat, Chen Zhongping asked.\nChen Zhongping had almost been scared to death just now.\nHe was quietly handling documents in the post office and occasionally looked back at his daughter in the car. Then, at one glance, she was gone.\nBut soon he found his daughter was just at the roadside.\nAnd then Chen Zhongping saw something terrifying unfold:\nMy god, a blonde-haired kid on a ghost riding vehicle got close to Chen Yu Ying and even took out some cheap milk tea to lure his daughter!\nChen Zhongping almost rushed out of the post office at that instant.\nUpon closer inspection, he found it wasn’t a blonde stand but a yellow Meituan helmet.\nA false alarm.\nBlame the delivery rider for being so unprofessional, only wearing the delivery helmet without the uniform.\nOriginally, Chen Zhongping thought his daughter just ordered a takeout, but then he found they were chatting for quite a while and seemed very happy. That blonde... the yellow-helmeted kid even seemed quite young, hence the inquiry.\n\"That was my classmate.\" While buckling her seatbelt, Chen Yu Ying explained.\n\"A classmate, not a delivery person? And the bubble tea?\" Chen Zhongping pointed to the milk tea placed on the central armrest and asked.\nChen Yu Ying explained the situation in full detail.\nChen Zhongping breathed a sigh of relief.\nBeing a student at Nansang Middle School signified high quality, using time off for delivering takeouts showed good character, and prioritizing delivery over chatting longer with his daughter meant he wasn’t coveting his daughter.\nThat’s solid.\nHe should be a risk-free and excellent kid who’s quite likable.\n\"What an interesting kid, huh? Then introduce him to your dad when you get a chance.\" While reversing using the rearview mirror, Chen Zhongping said with a smile.\n\"There probably might be a chance, we can talk about it then,\" said Chen Yu Ying, her tone light as she nodded.\nThe expensive car paused for a moment.\nChen Zhongping: \"?\"\nHmm?\nThere is indeed a chance, huh?\nNo, Dad was just joking.\nConsidering Lin Li’s risk level, Chen Zhongping thought a reevaluation might be necessary.\n...\n[Perfectly completed the Meituan Escort Sect’s thirty sect tasks (30/30)]\nFully positive review for the thirtieth one, got it!\n[Task Four completed]\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: Qi blood enhancement by 50%; Random Active Ability*1; Random Magical Tool*1]\nLin Li instantly felt dizzy.\nHowever, having experienced it before, Lin Li didn’t panic. Out here, he might be mistaken for having heatstroke, so while waiting for good reviews after delivering a few orders, he didn’t ride his bike further and sat in a mall instead.\nHe just continued sitting here.\nIt took about twenty minutes for Lin Li to successfully digest the Qi blood enhancement.\nA surge of energy filled Lin Li’s body, feeling like it’s gushing out.\nIt’s coming out.\nLin Li meant the nosebleed.\nThe Qi blood seemed to be a bit too much.\n\"If Tyson dares to come at me alone now, I’d dare call him a useless thing, a worthless chicken waste.\" Lin Li laughed muffled, stuffing two wads of paper into his nose, puffing with confidence.\nAnyway, Tyson doesn’t understand Chinese.\nMoreover, Lin Li stressed the prefix is one on one; Tyson can’t bring an interpreter.\nA cultivator, very meticulous, right?\nPractically speaking, Lin Li felt right now in a chase, Wang Ze probably wouldn’t be able to keep up with him at all.\n[You have obtained Active Ability: Ear Divine Power]\n[Ear Divine Power: Consumes stamina continuously during activation, doubles hearing upon activation, and doubles the effect of techniques and forms that use the ear as a medium.]\nUpon seeing the ability, Lin Li immediately activated it without hesitation.\nIn an instant, Lin Li felt all the surrounding sounds becoming much more distinct.\nSpiritual Qi’s modification of the body was comprehensive, the six senses gradually enhanced over time naturally. Now, he could clearly hear soft conversations even several meters away.\nThe stamina consumption was both considerable and negligible. Lin Li felt a physical fatigue rather than a mental one just ten minutes after activation, as if he’d gone through intensive exercise despite sitting still.\nWith his current self, this divine power could likely be sustained for half an hour at most.\nAfter half an hour, he might be exhausted.\nBut it’s more useful than passive abilities.\nLin Li turned his sight towards the magical tool he anticipated the most.\n[You have obtained Magical Tool: Emotion Storing and Desire Absorbing Bottle]\n[Emotion Storing and Desire Absorbing Bottle: Upon refinement, with the essence blood of a cultivator or spiritual beast as an offering, capable of absorbing intense emotional desires generated by surrounding intelligent creatures or transmitting stored emotional desires to the surrounding intelligent creatures.\nThe effect increases with the degree of refinement until fully refined.]",

      "content": "Chapter 180: Chapter 154: Irreparable Scars in the Mother-Child Relationship\nBecause they were in a public place, Lin Li didn’t manifest it.\nAs a good teen of the new era, Lin Li naturally had his mind filled with all sorts of dirty thoughts.\nUnder the Yellow Heaven, what would happen if I absorbed everyone’s perverted thoughts into the bottle, then accumulated and concentrated them onto one person?\nLin Li smiled wickedly.\nReally looking forward to Bai Bufan turning out like this.\nZhou Baowei works too.\nBut this thing still needs refining, hope it’s not difficult. Let’s see when I get home.\nBesides, is this kind of artifact seriously legit in the Cultivation Realm? Whose artifact requires cultivating with the blood of a cultivator or spiritual beast as a prerequisite for activation?\nIsn’t this some mafia stuff?\nIsn’t this something only an Evil Cultivator would use?\nLuckily it fell into my hands, Lin Li couldn’t even imagine if this thing ended up with good people, what would happen to the world.\nThis artifact would definitely be destroyed or sealed, such a pity.\nWith his mind made up, Lin Li immediately drove home, marked the overdue delivery for over an hour as delivered, and once again paid to help the platform.\nThe capitalists are making a killing.\nReturning to his room, he closed the door. Because his mom never barged in on her own, Lin Li didn’t lock it.\nThen he manifested the \"Emotions Absorbing Bottle\".\nA completely black yet sparkling porcelain bottle, not large, almost fit entirely in Lin Li’s one hand, shaped like a jade pure bottle, with a slender neck, under twenty centimeters tall, the neck taking up almost half.\nSo small, it doesn’t even qualify as a chamber pot.\n\"Ding ding ding.\"\nIsn’t it pleasant? A pleasant sound means a good porcelain.\nNo wonder it’s an artifact, doesn’t shatter on the table even when slammed, who knows what it’s made of.\nThe neck feels comfortable to hold, perhaps the original design was to use it as a hammer. If it’s the \"Emotions Absorbing Bottle\", maybe it could beat a hydraulic press.\nBut let’s not test it, gotta respect the artifact.\nLin Li tried to fill it with water, but nothing out of the ordinary happened.\nTook a sip, and Lin Li didn’t die.\nAfter testing, the current \"Emotions Absorbing Bottle\" is just one incredibly durable porcelain bottle.\nConsidering typically one binds to an artifact with a blood drop, Lin Li took out the Pingjiang Warrior Medal to prick himself.\nThought better of it.\nThis thing has already pricked Zhou Baowei, what if Baowei has something like AIDS, don’t want to get infected.\nThere’s another way, Lin Li took out two paper balls from his pocket.\n\"Ah Ping, do you want to absorb nosebleed? If you don’t want to, just shake your head, I won’t force you.\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Emotions Absorbing Bottle\": \"...\"\nDidn’t shake its head, seems like it does.\nThe red tissue quickly absorbed into the porcelain bottle surface, within seconds, the paper ball only had a faint light red left.\nGood bottle, not picky, Lin Li was very pleased.\nBut it didn’t result in binding behavior, was my blood deemed cultivator’s sacrificial blood?\nRefining isn’t done through blood?\nLin Li had to take out a universal Spirit Stone, tried to channel Spiritual Qi into the hand holding the bottle, then attempt refining.\nThe scattered Spiritual Qi quickly absorbed by the porcelain bottle, and a faint connection really began to establish between himself and the bottle.\nSeems this is the correct way to refine, blood binding doesn’t apply to it.\nOver forty minutes passed, two Spirit Stones in reserve were used up, the connection with the \"Emotions Absorbing Bottle\" strengthened quite a bit but still not reached the usability threshold, a little bit more to go.\nHave to wait for tomorrow.\nReturning the \"Emotions Absorbing Bottle\" to the [warehouse], it was already close to five o’clock, now he had to eat and then head to school.\n\"Wait for mom to take you to school later.\" Wu Min said to Lin Li as dinner was almost finished.\n\"Sure, this lifetime finally feels a bit of family warmth, no longer lonely...\" Lin Li began to act tragic.\nThen his head got tapped by chopsticks.\nIf the road isn’t blocked, driving a car is really much faster than biking, it barely took ten minutes for the school to appear in front of him.\nWish the school allowed electric bikes, at least mom would buy me one.\n\"If you still want to eat today’s leftovers in the fridge tonight or tomorrow, just heat them up, or throw them away if you don’t want them.\" Wu Min said while opening the car door at the school gate.\n\"Off to work again?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Yeah, heading directly for a business trip to Mountain Port in a bit, probably back home by National Day. During this time, remember to take care of yourself.\" Wu Min nodded.\nCarrying his backpack, Lin Li silently got out of the car, bit his lower lip with his upper teeth.\nLin Li’s silence suddenly made Wu Min feel uncomfortable, she awkwardly said to Lin Li: \"Don’t be sad, Li, National Day isn’t far, mom will be back soon, I don’t want to either, I’m sad too, just want to earn a bit more money for you...\"\n\"Mom, I’m not sad, I’m really happy and free when you’re gone.\" Lin Li made a pause gesture with his hand, interrupting Wu Min’s emotional speech.\nHe got used to the long separations a long time ago.\nIf he couldn’t take this, he would have become the king of melancholy a long time ago, maybe even at the age of three by now.\nWu Min: \"?\"\nDarn kid.\nA whole lot of emotion wasted.\n\"It’s not because of that.\" Lin Li took a deep breath.\n\"Then what’s wrong.\" Wu Min looked confused.\n\"Sister Min, you say—, how am I getting home tonight?\" Lin Li turned his head and looked in the direction of his home, his eyes showing a bit of desolation in their haziness. \"Home,\" what a strange yet familiar word, so close, yet seemingly so far away.\n\"You just ride your bike back, you’ve gone home so many times, it’s not like you don’t know the way.\" Wu Min immediately replied, even more puzzled.\n\"Sister Min, but where’s my bike?\" Lin Li turned back and stared intently at Wu Min, his voice suddenly clear and grounded instead of hazy: \"I thought you were going to drive me to school today and pick me up after school.\"\nWu Min: \"...\"\nLin Li’s bicycle apparently made it home a bit earlier than he did.\nWu Min wasn’t really feeling uncomfortable about it, but it was a bit awkward.\nThrottle, start; engine, roar; little car, hurry up and get moving.\nGood thing it’s her own son, if he’s out of luck, then he’s out of luck, he probably deserves it.\n\"Be careful walking home tonight, boys need to protect themselves out there too.\"\nAnd just like that, the car drove away in front of Lin Li, with no pause, leaving Wu Min’s words hanging in the air.\nWu Min is such a good mom; before leaving, she treated Lin Li to some exhaust fumes, how generous.\nLin Li gnashed his teeth as he watched the car’s rear disappear into the distance.\nDamn it, my mom is so irresponsible.\nShe only kills but doesn’t bury. If I’d known, I would’ve ridden my bike over.\n...\nOn the second-floor hallway, since the evening self-study hadn’t officially started yet, the boys were gathered there, looking at the hazy moon in the sky.\n\"Zhang Haoyang, you’re actually still alive, huh.\" Lin Li shouted from a distance.\n\"Hello, I’m now called Wang Haoyang, and this gentleman is my father, Wang Ze, pleased to meet you.\" Zhang Haoyang immediately responded.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"What’s so great about the moon? Today’s isn’t big or round.\" Lin Li came over to them, glanced at the moon along with them, and said uninterestedly.\n\"After all, the moon on the fifteenth isn’t full until the sixteenth.\" Zhou Baowei shrugged and said.\n\"Well, the moon’s got nothing on you, Baowei. Not just full by sixteen, but full for a lifetime.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\n\"Damn!!\"\nWhat a vicious curse.\n...\nLin Li hobbled through the back door into the classroom, then was shocked to find Bai Bufan was already at school but not mingling with the others in the hallway.\n\"What are you up to, Bufan?\" Lin Li asked as he put his backpack on his desk.\n\"I’m... studying...\" Bai Bufan showed the extracurricular exercise book he bought himself, grinning sinisterly.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThe two of them exchanged looks, staying silent for a moment.\nLin Li blinked: \"Bufan, you didn’t prepare for this moment a long time ago, did you? You’re not secretly hoping I’d be provoked by you, are you?\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Bufan, you’re not thinking that by doing this, I’ll experience the pain you felt over the holidays, right?\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Bufan, be honest, did you just snicker imagining the scene where I’m scared...\"\n\"Stop it, dude, stop it, dude, I’m sorry, I won’t do this again.\" Lin Li’s words struck home, and everything he said was spot on, causing Bai Bufan to sweat slightly.\n\"Seeing you study, I feel only relief.\"\n\"Lin Li is so great.\" Lin Li said with such conviction.\n\"Lin Li, I’m begging you, let me go. This has been the scariest Mid-Autumn Festival I’ve ever had. I don’t want to study, I’m exhausted.\" Bai Bufan leaned back, covering his face with the exercise book, lamenting through dragged-out syllables.\n\"Let you go? Ha ha, I’ll never let you go. Never. Isn’t it fun to stalk me? Thank you for stalking...\" Lin Li said lightly.\n\"If you keep this up, I’m going to gouge my eyes out.\" Bai Bufan closed his eyes in agony.\n\"That’s not necessary.\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"So...\"\n\"I mean gouging won’t help, I’d purposely flip through books by your ear.\" Lin Li leaned in and whispered.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Study! Study! I bought this exercise book to study!\" Bai Bufan tried for three minutes, then sighed, \"Saying I can’t go on, but still continuing, how is my life any different from a certain genre of film?\"\n\"Firstly, you don’t make money; secondly, when they say they can’t go on, they’re lying... they have fans, you don’t; thirdly, they...\" Lin Li quickly replied, and there were more answers.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn.\n\"Lin Li, your words are so damn hurtful, stop it, if you keep going I’ll really kill myself.\" Bai Bufan was on the brink of a breakdown.\n\"Hey, Bufan, you know, suicide is actually a form of self-defense, because you’re killing the person who wants to kill you. So next time you feel suicidal, maybe say ’I’m going to defend myself,’ it sounds a bit more positive.\" Lin Li eagerly shared his discovery, trying to persuade.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn you.\n\"Lin Li, your words are becoming increasingly damn hurtful, keep it up and I’ll really... damn, you call this positivity, that’s borderline inappropriate.\" Bai Bufan repeated, ending up amusing himself.\n\"But at least this way, the benefits are huge.\" Lin Li added.\nBai Bufan: \"... Now you’re connecting dots, Lin Li. Whoever invented you is a genius.\"\nLin Li snorted, his expression turning serious.\nBai Bufan’s last comment was one he’d never agree with.\nBecause a genius would never just kill and not bury, making their own son walk home at night.\nWu Min! You cold, heartless soul! I’ll never forgive you!!!",

      "content": "Chapter 181: Chapter 155: Silently murmuring, following closely, writing at the desk\n\"Bao Wei, Lin Li makes me want to defend myself.\"\nZhou Baowei had just come in from the hallway when he heard Bai Bufan say something explosive to him.\nOpening, act, critical, hit.\n\"Don’t bother, I’m grilling.\" As soon as Zhou Baowei finished speaking, he slapped himself: \"To hell with grilling, disgusting!\"\nZhou Baowei currently hates grilling the most.\nAfter slapping himself, he eagerly stepped forward, using his broad body to shield one side of the table. \"Go ahead, I’ll block everything for you.\"\n\"It’s not what you think...\"\nThen, after hearing Lin Li’s explanation about suicide and self-defense, Zhou Baowei was greatly shocked, gaining new useful knowledge.\n\"Utterly dull.\" But realizing he couldn’t see the explosive scenes, Zhou Baowei sighed, \"I was hoping to ride the wave.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Bao Wei, don’t be like this, I’m really scared living in the same dorm with you.\" Bai Bufan scooted closer to Lin Li.\n\"Misunderstood, this wave riding was in the literal sense for eating,\" Zhou Baowei said, \"My dad said if my grades improve significantly in the monthly exam, he’d give me a budget of five thousand to eat whatever I want, so if I can eat everyone ranked above me, my ranking will improve.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Too many punchlines, can’t be bothered to roast.\" Lin Li said.\nBut it really fits Bao Wei’s eating outlook.\n\"What’s the punchline? The way to the top is to devour people, fiercely devour people.\" Bai Bufan said in a deep voice, sounding like Brother Xun.\nAs for enduring hardships, that’s serving those on top.\nLin Li pushed Bai Bufan away: \"I don’t know you, today is indeed suitable for missing people on the Autumn Festival, but you can’t miss them like this, you’ll eventually eat a purple egg.\"\nWho placed Bai Bufan at the same desk position as himself?\nThe evening study session bell rang, and everyone gradually took their seats.\n\"But thanks to you, Lin Li, I actually finished my holiday homework at home, so now I don’t have to catch up on work, and my dad was so happy seeing me study, like Bao Wei’s dad, he promised that if I improve significantly in the next exam, he’ll get me a new phone, a blessing in disguise.\"\nBai Bufan spread open his workbook, speaking with a hint of excitement.\n\"Getting a new phone? What about the old one?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"I put the old phone up for recycling on the used goods site, it’s fast on-site, high valuation, quick payment, for selling idle digital products, I use Tantan!\" Bai Bufan responded, reciting the ad slogan with great familiarity.\n\"Tantan is good, Tantan you can learn.\"\n...\nAbout ten minutes after the evening study session started, Xue Jian carried his briefcase and slowly walked into the classroom, seating himself in the front.\n\"Back from the autumn trip, everyone should gather their wits.\"\n\"The first monthly exam has been scheduled, for next Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, from the 25th to the 27th, giving a day off on Saturday, to allow grading as soon as possible, and review the papers with you all on Sunday and Monday, so you can peacefully enjoy the National Day.\" Xue Jian said slowly after sitting down.\nSince ten subjects need to be tested, three days are needed if exams are not arranged in the evening.\n\"Teacher, can you not grade them? I think that way we can have a better National Day.\" Right Guardian Wang Ze sincerely voiced everyone’s thoughts.\nThen he fell silent under Xue Jian’s deadly gaze.\n\"By then, everything on your desks and the boxes in the walkway need to be cleared, since it’s the monthly exam the drawers don’t need to be cleared, but after the seating chart is issued, everyone’s desks need to be moved, Yu Ying, you organize it then.\"\n\"Okay, teacher.\"\n\"Remember, everyone, don’t treat the monthly exam as trivial, although it’s a small test, many times the results are useful.\"\nXue Jian continued.\nNansang Middle School awards and honors each semester and major exams including the monthly exams within the term are all linked, not only within the school, some universities that have independent admissions also look at students’ usual grades, although the proportion of a first-year high school monthly exam is undoubtedly very small, but you never know if it might cause your elimination for that bit of mosquito meat.\nIt starts next Wednesday.\nToday is only Tuesday, which means I have an entire week of time to strive, more than ten hours of Strong Memory can be used.\nLin Li thought so, and once the time was set, a sense of urgency immediately emerged.\n\"To strive!\" Lin Li cheered himself on.\n\"So are you going to do stand-up at the tavern?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"That’s right.\" Lin Li immediately immersed himself in study, bending over to write.\nBai Bufan watched Lin Li focus on studying and muttered \"Damn,\" then followed suit, bending over to write.\nZhou Baowei watched Lin Li and Bai Bufan focus on studying and muttered \"Trash,\" then followed suit, bending over to write.\nChen Tianming watched Lin Li, Bai Bufan, and Zhou Baowei focus on studying and muttered, \"It’s like dominoes, one falling after another, so funny, if Qiaoqiao could see, she’d definitely laugh, oh remembering Qiaoqiao’s smile, so cute.\"\nIt’s okay, I’ll remember and tell Qiaoqiao on the weekend.\nSo he followed suit, bending over to write.\nThe densest evening study session in Class 4 of Year 1.\nLooking at the two key focus students at the back row and one super invincible key focus student, Xue Jian nodded with some satisfaction.\nAlthough Lin Li definitely has issues, maybe this time it won’t be too bad after all.\n...\nWhen the evening study session ended, Lin Li dragged Bai Bufan, forcing him to watch as he put textbooks and workbooks into his backpack one by one.\nTorturing Bai Bufan was one of the few pleasures left after Lin Li became engrossed in studying.\nThe results were also impressive, Bai Bufan even carried a bag back to the dormitory.\nTonight, he could only walk home, and when passing by the snack street, he initially wanted to buy some stewed dishes for supper, but after noticing the slightly unfriendly gaze from the owner, he opted for another stall.\n\"Young man, do you have any dietary restrictions?\" The owner asked after lighting the fire.\n\"I’m allergic to duckling.\" Lin Li said.\nBoss: \"...\"\nHe walked out to look at his shop sign and then stared at Lin Li: \"Young man, you’re allergic to ducks and still ordered a tea tree mushroom duck pot?\"\n\"No, boss, you’ve got it wrong. I’m only allergic to ducklings. As long as the duck is bigger, I’m not allergic,\" Lin Li explained.\nBoss: \"...\"\nYou gotta be kidding me.\n\"... I see, I’ll make sure to pick a big one for you.\" The boss hesitated, clearly showing that what he said wasn’t really what he wanted to express.\n\"By the way, boss, do you have fresh duck blood here? The kind that’s high quality.\" Lin Li asked afterward.\nLin Li hadn’t forgotten the conditions for using the \"Emotion-Containing and Desire-Absorbing Bottle,\" but he was reluctant to use his own blood each time, plus he didn’t know how much it would require. So he planned to test if the blood of real-world animals could be considered spirit beast blood.\n\"Sure, how much do you need? Should I add it directly to the pot?\" the boss nodded and asked.\n\"No need, just put it in a separate basin, two portions will be fine.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Eight bucks.\"\n\"Done.\"\n\"Here you go, young man.\" The boss took a box of duck blood from under the stall, skillfully slitting the plastic wrap on top with a small knife, poured it into a container, and then covered it, handing it to Lin Li.\nLin Li looked at the discarded plastic box of duck blood and fell into silence.\nIf he remembered correctly, a box sells for two fifty at the supermarket.\nHow do you describe exploitation without using explicit words?\n——This damned old cheapskate in front of him.\n\"Boss, didn’t you say fresh duck blood?\" Looking at the reddish-brown duck blood in the box, Lin Li weakly said.\n\"I just took it out of the packaging, isn’t this freshly prepared?\" the boss argued back.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nLin Li still had his pride.\nIf the boss hadn’t refunded three bucks, Lin Li would definitely have been angry.\nLooking at the duck blood in his hand, Lin Li sighed,\nIt’s okay, the \"Emotion-Containing and Desire-Absorbing Bottle\" was even willing to absorb nosebleeds, a bit of duck blood with additives shouldn’t bother it.\n...\nAt the doorstep.\n\"Goodbye, old friend, hope we meet again,\"\nLin Li said softly to the stone he had been kicking along the way.\nLin Li felt lucky he hadn’t missed a kick, because if a boy missed a stone while kicking it while walking, he usually wouldn’t turn back to retrieve it, but there would be a slight sense of regret in his heart.\nUpstairs, home, after finishing the duck pot, Lin Li materialized the \"Emotion-Containing and Desire-Absorbing Bottle\" in the dining room.\n\"Do you need it cut into octopus shapes for you?\"\nTaking out the duck blood and the kitchen knife, Lin Li added a bit of drama to himself, speaking in a deep voice.\nHe cut off a thin piece with the knife and pressed the duck blood against the bottle.\nThe situation was as Lin Li expected, the \"Emotion-Containing and Desire-Absorbing Bottle\" indeed accepted anything that came its way.\nAlthough not very fast, the duck blood on the bottle was visibly shrinking.\nHe guessed that if it were liquid and purer, it could be absorbed faster.\nUnfortunately, this blood separated from the organism, its proteins had already been denatured. Even if heated, it would only smell better, but wouldn’t revert to liquid blood.\nLin Li simply poured all the duck blood into the \"Emotion-Containing and Desire-Absorbing Bottle,\" and then took out his textbooks to start studying.\nBefore he knew it, it was nearly midnight.\nLin Li picked up the bottle, finding it much lighter than before, tilted it on the table, and after quite some patting, only some gelatinous material and liquid came out.\nProbably additives.\nThis bottle, you could say it’s picky but it’s not, yet it still seems to have its own picky eating.\nTwelve o’clock arrived.\n[Low-Grade Spirit Stone]\n[Ability Amplifier (+1)]\n[450 (1150)]\nThe \"Ability Amplifier\" Lin Li got but didn’t enhance any ability. Since it was a limited purchase item, storing some in advance couldn’t be a bad move.\nIt’s just a pity it was another low-grade spirit stone. Damn system, are you inflating probabilities just to comply with legal standards? With more places requiring spiritual qi, I’m really, really going to be upset with you. Next time if you don’t play nice, I’m going to beg you to be more considerate the time after.\nSigh, it’s all because there’s no spiritual qi in reality; it really makes things tough. If there were spiritual qi, there wouldn’t be this much frustration to endure.\nWith the spirit stone in hand, Lin Li continued refining the \"Emotion-Containing and Desire-Absorbing Bottle.\"\nThe refining from yesterday afternoon already left only a thin barrier between the two. As the spirit stone gradually hollowed out, Lin Li took a deep breath, a hint of joy on his expression.\nInitial refining successful.\n[Over two weeks in the Cultivation Realm and finally succeeded in refining the first magic artifact of my own, though it was developed by an Evil Cultivator, a magic artifact knows not of morality. In righteous hands, even evil can shine bright.]\n[The artifact needs further integration, but rather than keeping it hidden, why not seize this chance to benefit mankind.]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Four: Use the \"Emotion-Containing and Desire-Absorbing Bottle\" to absorb other cultivators’ negative emotions and desires.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Charisma Increase by 10%; Holy Dragon Blood*1; System Currency*100.]",

      "content": "Chapter 182: Chapter 156 Lin Li is manipulating credit\nThe Imperial Tutor has seen dragons, and it seems Lin Li might have a chance to see the sacred dragon’s essence blood, so does that mean he’s going to become a Little Imperial Tutor?\nThat’s definitely the most dignified scene.\nNot only that, but his charm could also ascend by another small notch.\nAfter reviewing the rewards, Lin Li read the task description again.\nSure enough, this artifact didn’t come from a righteous path, it was created by an Evil Cultivator.\nIn layman’s terms, this task involves using a defective bottle for a good purpose, absorbing others’ negative emotions into the bottle and giving them a day of good mood. The task indicator is also a long progress bar.\nAfter reading through it once, Lin Li didn’t bother with it further. No way was he going to head out and figure out how to complete this task right now; instead, he closed his eyes and felt the \"Magic Bottle\" in his hand.\nAfter successfully refining it, his connection with the artifact instantly became closer, and more detailed information about this artifact automatically flooded into Lin Li’s mind, saving him the need for further assessment:\nThe functionality of the \"Magic Bottle\" will enhance as his refinement and personal power increase.\nIt can only absorb sufficiently prominent and intense emotional desires, and requires him to clearly identify such desires on the opponent when activating it. The artifact itself will not automatically feedback any surrounding emotional desires it can absorb.\nThe absorption and output require blood as a sacrifice, which can be pre-offered, but pre-offering has absorption limits. Its use consumes his vitality and spirit, and prolonged usage in the short term will lead to mental fatigue, which is the opposite of the [Divine Power of the Ear].\nIts spellcasting range, in his current unrestricted environment, is about ten meters.\nThe emotional desires stored in the bottle have an upper limit and the more complex the emotional desires stored at the same time, the smaller the total capacity, and the greater the mental consumption during use. Given his current capability, the limit should be relatively low.\nIt cannot consume and devour these emotional desires out of nowhere; if the bottle is to be emptied, these emotions must be output onto himself or other higher intelligence living beings to be consumed. If the emotional desires in the bottle come from sentient magical beasts or cultivators, low-level magical beasts cannot be targeted, and vice versa.\nIt cannot reabsorb the emotional desires it outputs, and after a certain extent of use, it will be damaged. However, after complete damage, it will begin self-repair, with Spiritual Qi and blood accelerating the repair process.\nHaving digested all this information, Lin Li opened his computer, ready to conduct a little experiment.\nBaidu Cloud Drive, start.\nThe \"Magic Bottle\" was held in his hand.\nHey, don’t you say it...\nDamn, starting to think with the lower body really makes humans too dangerous, Lin Li shook his head to dispel this damn bold idea, and immediately activated the artifact with his intent.\nBetting all his credibility, throw it all in!\nThe \"Magic Bottle\" gleamed with a faint glow barely noticeable at night, Lin Li didn’t see any other anomalies between himself and the bottle body, just felt that the originally uncontrollable desires gradually faded, and the tough guy gradually turned tender.\nHis credibility gradually lost, and Lin Li thoroughly became a discredited person.\nThere’s something to this artifact indeed.\nHowever, it only absorbed the generated desires, not the root cause, so if Lin Li looked up and continued watching the screen on his computer, his tenderness would still turn back into toughness.\nIf this artifact could strip emotions, perhaps it wouldn’t even be something Lin Li could activate with his current power.\nFor Lin Li, the most important goal of the experiment was to confirm that as long as the unimportant glow is ignored, then the \"Magic Bottle\" can be used without any anomalies.\nMeaning it can be used completely without anyone knowing.\nThis artifact is definitely lethal because when overly intense emotions suddenly surge into someone’s body, whether extreme joy or sadness, they can cause severe harm or even sudden death. From a covert perspective, its lethality is stronger than the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique.\nConan has another death method that he can’t guess.\nBut that’s in an ideal situation, with Lin Li’s current refinement level and his endurance limit, being able to use it for killing is probably far off.\nRefinement again requires more Spiritual Qi, and having no rice truly makes Lin Li, this continual cooking young lady, feel distressed.\nOne can’t be unlucky forever.\nFor now, he can only take it one step at a time. It’s getting late, so he puts the artifact back into the [Storage] and goes to bed to rest.\n...\n\"According to unofficial history, one day, after drinking too much, Zhou Yu recalled recent humiliations and said to his trusted assassin subordinate, ’Zhuge Liang looks down on me!’\nHe then made a hand gesture as if slicing his neck, signaling him to assassinate. His loyal subordinate nodded and immediately carried it out.\nThat night, Zhuge Liang, Xiaoqiao, and Zhou Yu were all mysteriously assassinated by the assassin. This is how the story of a plot against three wise men came about!\"\n\"Was it, was it really like this?\"\n\"Is this true?\"\nIn the morning, when Lin Li arrived in the classroom, it was Bai Bufan’s classic Three Kingdoms unofficial history segment again.\nSince Bai Bufan brought his phone this week, Lin Li again took on a large part of the smuggling breakfast duty.\nAfter distributing the breakfast, Lin Li returned to his seat.\n\"Lin Li, why is it that as soon as you get to school, you’re so drowsy?\" Bai Bufan yawned, lazily said while digging into breakfast.\n\"Isn’t it simple? Because school is where dreams begin.\" Lin Li replied instantly.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Thank you, I’ve learned something, next time I get caught sleeping in class by the teacher, I know what to say.\" Bai Bufan gave a thumbs up; that’s too positive.\nAnd Lin Li, who was originally reading, also put down the book and started to think.\nWould the desire to sleep be judged by the system as a negative emotion?\nSince the \"Magic Bottle\" doesn’t have anything to hide, treating it as a little hand toy is fine. Plus, it’s so small that Lin Li can keep it in his pocket directly and take it out. No one would find it strange if they saw it.\nMaterialize it, take it out, Lin Li aimed the bottle mouth at Bai Bufan, ready to start absorbing.\n——The bottle has already absorbed the duck blood offered yesterday, so there’s no need for blood now.\nAside from that, Lin Li’s backpack also contained a box of duck blood, just in case.\nLin Li paused slightly.\nBecause he suddenly remembered that the bottle still contained his credibility from yesterday.\nAnd the mixing of emotional desires in the bottle would reduce the storage limit and increase his mental consumption, so Lin Li thought about it and decided to first output the desires inside onto Bai Bufan.\nGo!\n\"Cough, cough.\" Bai Bufan, who was drinking soup, suddenly started coughing violently, almost spitting the soup out of his nose, pursing his lips, his expression strange and uncomfortable.\n\"What’s up, Bufan?\" Lin Li asked with concern.\n\"Nothing, nothing.\" Bai Bufan waved his hand dismissively.\n\"Squeak—\"\nA few seconds later, Bai Bufan slid his chair back about ten centimeters, creating an ear-piercing scraping sound against the floor, then leaned forward and continued calmly sipping his soup.\nThis action transformed Bai Bufan’s spine, which originally formed a ninety-degree angle with his thighs, into an acute angle.\nThis move was meant to cover up something. Oh, come on, we’re all men; Lin Li understood perfectly. He turned his head toward the window, trying to stifle his laughter.\nThe evil cultivator who invented the \"Emotions and Desires Concealing Bottle\" must have been a genius.\nI’d really like to meet him.\nSoon, Bai Bufan finished his breakfast and tossed the trash into the bin outside the door, maintaining the same posture. Then, after hesitating for a moment, he patted Lin Li’s shoulder and asked worriedly:\n\"Lin Li, I have a friend whose uncle Chen inexplicably delayed by an hour. Is that normal?\"\n\"It’s probably normal. At our age, nothing seems strange.\" Lin Li pinched his thigh, nodding as he tried to hold back his laughter.\n\"Is it really normal? There weren’t any triggering factors. Do I really not need to go to the hospital for a check?\" Bai Bufan was somewhat troubled.\n—He had been thinking purely about getting some shut-eye and that the breakfast tasted decent, but suddenly, he wanted to escape. It didn’t make any sense.\n\"Your friend’s uncle Chen delayed; why would you go to the hospital?\" Lin Li asked with ’confusion’.\n\"Huh? Ah? Haha, right.\" Bai Bufan paused, then scratched his head and laughed awkwardly. \"I was worried and confused.\"\nThree seconds passed.\n\"I mean, I should go to the hospital for my friend. That friend isn’t me.\" Bai Bufan earnestly clarified.\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"Really!\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nThe bottle was already empty, and after Bai Bufan turned away dejectedly, Lin Li again aimed the bottle at him, ready to absorb his drowsiness.\nIt failed, absorbing nothing.\nOh, probably the earlier incident had cleared Bai Bufan’s mind, eliminating his drowsiness.\nMy mistake.\nI should have absorbed Bai Bufan’s drowsiness first, then returned it with added reputation.\nStill too kind.\nBut it doesn’t matter; in the morning at school, drowsiness is easy to find.\nEspecially those guys in the back row, they’re notorious for sleeping. Not far away, Zhou Baowei was already nodding off like a chick pecking at rice.\nActivating the artifact again, Lin Li could feel the desire to sleep being sucked into the bottle, and Zhou Baowei’s eyes gradually became clear, returning to focus.\nLin Li’s gaze was fixed on the progress bar for task four.\nIt increased.\nThis meant absorbing classmates’ drowsiness satisfied the system’s requirements.\nBut the increase was so small that Lin Li had to stare at it for a long time to notice any progress.\nLin Li wasn’t sure if this task’s emotional quantity requirement was simply very high or if drowsiness, as a desire, wasn’t negative enough in the system’s judgment.\nEither way, since there’s progress, I’ll keep absorbing. Even though Lin Li was at the last row by the window, a ten-meter range covered everyone in class, and whether someone was sleepy or not was quite apparent, so Lin Li started absorbing from one person to the next.\n...\nIt’s full.\nBefore finishing absorbing the back row guys’ drowsiness, the \"Emotions and Desires Concealing Bottle\" signaled Lin Li that it had reached its limit, unable to take in any more.\nThe refining level is still too low.\nLin Li opened the window and spotted a bird perched on a tree.\nOutput failed, so he tried a few other animals within his ’output’ range, all resulting in failure.\nIt seems this is the emotional reproductive isolation mentioned by the \"Emotions and Desires Concealing Bottle.\"\nHe pulled the window shut and, after some thought, directed the drowsiness onto himself.\nOh, crap.\nThis morning’s Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique focused on physical Chapters, leaving his body a bit tired, and using the \"Emotions and Desires Concealing Bottle\" drained his mental energy. When the drowsiness entered his body, it exploded instantly, and Lin Li almost closed his eyes and fell asleep.\nOnce outputted, emotions can’t be reabsorbed; it’s an irreversible action.\nShaking his head, he struggled to dispel the sleepiness, realizing he shouldn’t harm himself like this.\nSo, who should I harm?\n\"Lin Li, why are you staring at me?\" Bai Bufan suddenly noticed Lin Li was constantly staring at him; he immediately folded his arms and leaned back warily.\n\"Nothing.\"\nLin Li was a bit hesitant.\nTaking advantage of Bai Bufan seemed a bit too much.\nHurting his buddy felt genuinely wrong.\n...\nDuring the morning study session, only Lin Li was singing.\nBai Bufan had his textbook propped in front of him, enjoying a quality sleep akin to a baby.",

      "content": "Chapter 183: Chapter 157: Dice Lao Da Teaches Me to Do the Right Thing\nActually, in theory, there’s an optimal solution, which is to return the sleepiness to whoever you absorbed it from.\nEveryone takes back their own sleepiness, goes home to their mom, and nothing happens to anyone.\nAlthough it seems like nothing has been done, the task progress bar will genuinely go up.\nBut the reason Lin Li doesn’t do this is mainly because his ability doesn’t allow it. This kind of delicate operation, not to mention whether Lin Li can control the amount of desire well, would also consume a huge amount of mental energy, which he absolutely couldn’t handle.\nThe bell for the end of the morning self-study session rang, the first class would start in five minutes.\n\"Damn, I’m so sleepy today, how come? Are you guys tired?\" Bai Bufan, who got caught sleeping during morning reading by Li Binbin and could only stand at the back to read, yawned as he returned to his seat and asked.\nZhou Baowei: \"Not sleepy at all today.\"\nChen Tianming: \"Don’t know why, but I’m not sleepy at all.\"\nQin Zeyu: \"Indeed, as spirited as ever.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nThe guys in the back row didn’t seem to be lying, because when Bai Bufan looked over, he found they were indeed more energetic than each other, their eyes as wide as bells, joking around.\nBai Bufan could only look towards his only fellow sufferer, the equally exhausted Lin Li.\nSitting down, placing his hand on Lin Li’s shoulder, Bai Bufan lamented, \"So, it’s just the two of us this sleepy today? Why, Lin Li, do you have any idea?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Me? Huh? I don’t know? How would I have any idea?\" Lin Li quickly raised his hands in denial.\n\"Damn, it feels like some idiot transferred all their sleepiness to us, truly damned.\" Bai Bufan let go, laid down, intending to catch up on sleep during these brief five minutes while cursing.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHaha.\nIt’s not that bad that it’s damned, right?\nLin Li looked at the \"Jar of Emotions and Desires\" in his drawer, now it’s full again.\nShould he send it to Bai Bufan again? Lin Li glanced at the already snoozing Bai Bufan, genuinely worried he’d sleep forever.\nLin Li had no choice but to look at the other spirited guys.\nAt the moment, Lin Li didn’t know who to trouble, so he thought for a while, took out pen and paper, and wrote down today’s execution list:\n1. Wang Yuezhi; 2. Zhou Baowei; 3. Chen Tianming; 4. Wang Ze; 5. Bai Bufan; 6. Lin Li.\nThen Lin Li took out a dice.\nThe victim of this bottle of sleepiness is left to fate to decide, adding his own name is to show he’s in it with them, after all, they’re brothers in arms.\nThe dice was tossed high, spun as it hit the ground, and soon stabilized under Lin Li’s hopeful gaze.\n6.\nGreat, it actually turned out to be 1+1+1+1+1+1! I can give Wang Yuezhi six bottles of sleepiness! Lin Li punched the air, expressing satisfaction with the result!\nDice master, well played, nice!\nSince it’s destiny, Lin Li couldn’t refuse.\n...\n\"So, Yuezhi, we just need to open the parentheses on the left side for this problem, right?\" Li Ke, who was consulting Wang Yuezhi, said excitedly after some calculations.\nSeeing no response from Wang Yuezhi, he confusedly lifted his head.\nJust before, Wang Yuezhi was still standing, now his face was pressed against his test paper, seemingly drooling from the corner of his mouth, his lower body still standing, causing his butt to stick up high.\nLi Ke: \"?\"\nThat sudden?\n\"Wait, my test paper!\"\n...\nChinese class.\n\"Yuezhi, don’t sleep, you’ve almost slept through the whole class.\" Li Binbin walked to Wang Yuezhi’s side, tapping the table with the back of his hand, said.\n\"Sorry, teacher, I don’t know why, I’m so sleepy today.\" Wang Yuezhi jolted awake and apologized.\n\"Just go to bed earlier from now on.\"\nChinese class is naturally one for sleeping, plus Li Binbin is a very easygoing teacher, wouldn’t make a fuss over this, and continued his lecture nonchalantly.\n\"Yuezhi, what time did you actually go to bed last night?\" Li Ke asked in confusion, \"I remember you went to bed pretty early.\"\n\"Yeah, I went to bed a bit after eleven last night, but today I’m inexplicably sleepy, I have no idea why.\" Wang Yuezhi shook his head in distress.\nBut the next class is Chemistry.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, just because you’re good at chemistry doesn’t mean you can sleep in class. We are covering new topics on the monthly exam. Stand at the back and attend the class!\"\nThe chemistry teacher was relatively strict and showed no lenience upon discovering Wang Yuezhi sleeping.\nWang Yuezhi, with a look of regret, stood at the back of the room.\n\"Teacher, I’m sleepy too, can I stand at the back too?\" Lin Li raised his hand.\n\"Hmm? Alright, go ahead, good attitude. Anyone else who’s sleepy can choose to stand at the back for the lesson.\" The chemistry teacher responded, giving Lin Li a smile.\nFacing Wang Yuezhi’s puzzled and hostile gaze, Lin Li returned a warm look: \"I’d feel guilty if you’re the only one standing.\"\nLin Li wasn’t exactly sleepy, but his spirit was indeed flagging, related to the side effects of using the \"Jar of Emotions and Desires.\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\nWhat an idiot.\nThe class continued, and for the sake of the monthly exam rankings, Lin Li diligently followed along at the back until a piece of chalk head was thrown his way.\nNot sure if it was his barehanded catch in a sword fight capability, but Lin Li caught it steadily, then looked at the chemistry teacher with puzzlement.\n\"Sorry, wrong target.\" The chemistry teacher had already walked off the podium, first apologizing to Lin Li, then his voice filled with rage: \"Wang Yuezhi, even standing at the back, you can sleep standing up?\"\nLin Li turned his head, realizing only now that Wang Yuezhi, at some point, had drooped his head, dropped his book, and fallen asleep again.\nThe stance and actions were quite difficult, something an average person couldn’t manage.\nStartled awake by the shouting, Wang Yuezhi opened his eyes, realized what happened, and hung his head low.\nHow could Lin Li just sit by and watch Wang Yuezhi get scolded at a time like this? After all, his drowsiness was his own fault, so he quickly materialized the \"Emotion Absorption Bottle\" from his pocket and tried to absorb the chemistry teacher’s anger.\nIt succeeded.\nWang Yuezhi, who was bracing himself for a stormy reprimand, found that the figure standing before him said nothing. After a few seconds, he simply said, \"Well, as long as you’re awake, let’s continue with the class.\"\nThen he prepared to leave.\nLin Li rubbed his aching head; his body was starting to struggle with the use of the \"Emotion Absorption Bottle.\" But seeing this outcome, he let out a long sigh of relief.\nHe protected Wang Yuezhi and felt slightly less guilty.\nWang Yuezhi, you don’t have to thank me. It’s something I should do...\nWang Yuezhi suddenly looked up and cried out, \"Teacher, don’t give up on me!\"\nChemistry teacher, Lin Li: \"?\"\n\"I-I didn’t give up on you?\" The chemistry teacher paused, turned around, pointed at himself, then at Wang Yuezhi, looking puzzled.\n\"Then why didn’t you scold me?\" Wang Yuezhi pressed.\n\"Ah? I just suddenly felt there was no need to get angry about this, and there’s really nothing to scold you for,\" the chemistry teacher explained.\n\"I’ve done such excessive things, and it’s not worth getting mad at me, isn’t that giving up on me?\"\nListening to their conversation, Lin Li’s brain momentarily crashed.\nStop arguing, let me think.\nLin Li looked at Wang Yuezhi, who was distressed and flustered, and felt a bit like swearing.\nThis is how you play, huh?\nLin Li gritted his teeth, enduring the headache, and returned all the anger from the \"Emotion Absorption Bottle\" back to the chemistry teacher.\n\"Hah! I haven’t seen a student who wants to be scolded like you do, Wang Yuezhi. You want a scolding, huh? Then let me really talk to you. You think you don’t need to listen to the class and can...\" The angry chemistry teacher immediately started pouring it out.\nWang Yuezhi showed a satisfied smile.\nThat’s right, that’s more like it.\nLin Li also smiled.\nDarn.\nThe chemistry teacher vented his anger, Wang Yuezhi enjoyed being scolded, and Lin Li felt relieved.\nThe class then continued.\nDuring the pause between knowledge points, Lin Li brought up the system interface and frowned slightly.\nAfter absorbing the chemistry teacher’s anger just now, the progress bar increased much faster than when absorbing drowsiness earlier.\nMore efficient.\nIt seems like, as I guessed, the system has its own criteria for the value of negative emotions?\nNow my head hurts from overuse, and the task progress bar is still less than a tenth completed. If I want to quickly finish the task, I must attempt to absorb other higher-value negative emotions.\n\"Don’t worry, Wang Yuezhi, you probably won’t feel drowsy again.\" So, Lin Li whispered to Wang Yuezhi.\nWang Yuezhi ignored Lin Li.\nSuch sarcasm; Lin Li is really petty!\nTwenty minutes later, the bell for the end of class rang. Since it was about time for the physical exercise break, the chemistry teacher didn’t extend the class. He left after assigning homework.\nLin Li was just about to return to his seat to take a nap and relieve some mental stress when he heard Chen Yu Ying calling his name.\n\"Lin Li.\"\n\"What’s up, class president?\" Lin Li looked up and asked.\nThe back row was brighter because of Chen Yu Ying’s presence.\n\"Are you sleepy today?\" Chen Yu Ying inquired.\n\"More or less, a bit,\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Then take this box of mints; they’re very refreshing. Sucking on one should help you wake up a bit.\"\nChen Yu Ying extended her hand, revealing a small metal box in her palm, and said with a smile.\nSince Lin Li often used his brain before, he needed to replenish sugar, so they agreed that Lin Li would provide breakfast for free and Chen Yu Ying would give him some candy.\nWith this understanding, Lin Li naturally didn’t refuse. He nodded and took it.\n\"Thanks, class president.\" Lin Li opened the tin, tossed a candy high in the air, and opened his mouth.\nBut he missed it.\n\"Class president, just pretend you didn’t see that.\" Lin Li chewed the air, speaking seriously.\n\"No, I saw it.\"\nChen Yu Ying walked away with a smile.\nWhen Chen Yu Ying walked away, Wang Yuezhi’s gaze became very piercing.\nUnwavering.\nUnyielding.\nLin Li thought for a moment, then took out a candy from the tin and offered it to Wang Yuezhi, \"Want one?\"\nWang Yuezhi’s eyes widened, and his face, perhaps from shyness, was slightly red.\nLet’s give it one last push, brain!\nLin Li used his other hand to take out the \"Emotion Absorption Bottle,\" quietly aiming it at Wang Yuezhi. Resentment, jealousy, anger, hatred, I don’t care what you are, absorb it!\n\"...\"\nSuccessfully absorbed!\nContinuing to absorb!\nStill absorbing?\nOh my gosh, why won’t it stop?",

      "content": "Chapter 184: Chapter 158: Lin Li Rescues Bao Wei from Peril\nLin Li’s already overwhelmed mind now felt like it was splitting open, and he felt he was just a step away from sudden death, so he hurriedly stopped the operation of the \"Emotion Absorbing Bottle\".\nAt least today it seemed there was no need to do exercises, otherwise, Lin Li would definitely have to ask for leave.\n\"I’m not eating it!\"\nThe Wang Yuezhi in front of him still stared at him fixedly. After ’shouting loudly’, he gritted his teeth and returned to his seat.\nHe recalled just now.\nThe \"Emotion Absorbing Bottle\" couldn’t deprive people of the ability to generate emotions and desires; it only absorbed the emotions and desires produced. In other words, just now...\n— He absorbed slower than Yuezhi was producing.\nWhat a nuisance! Lin Li now only blamed himself for not being stronger. If it weren’t for his head being unable to bear it, he might have been able to fill the whole bottle, right?\nThe task progress bar had significantly increased because of this.\nThis guy, Wang Yuezhi... really is a top-notch power bank.\nAs expected of a brother, full of talent and skills.\n\"Looks like we really don’t have exercises today.\" Bai Bufan, who had already walked outside to get in line, slowly walked in through the back door, saying somewhat thankfully.\nThen suddenly he raised his hand and made a backward jump shot.\nAs for why Bai Bufan suddenly made this move, don’t ask, probably even he didn’t know.\nIt’s like when passing through a door, you might tap the door frame — purely an instinctive move made by boys.\nMany times the body’s reactions are faster than the mind.\n\"Bufan, catch.\" Lin Li opened his eyes and tossed the mint candy in his hand towards Bai Bufan, then said, \"Help me throw it in the trash can.\"\nHaving caught and realized it was candy after already putting it into his mouth, Bai Bufan fell silent after hearing the second half of the sentence.\nHe then spat the candy into his palm, staring blankly at Lin Li: \"Could you say something before you throw next time?\"\n\"It just fell on the ground; with your inhale and exhale just now, the dust and whatnot are already left in your mouth. If you throw it away now, it’s kind of wasteful, so you might as well eat it.\" Lin Li sincerely suggested.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nBut Lin Li made a valid point, so Bai Bufan tossed it back into his mouth. Clean or not, it doesn’t make you sick.\nReturning to his seat, Bai Bufan stretched lazily, then sighed softly:\n\"It’s such a waste to use break time to sleep or do homework; if only I could clone myself, I could go play while they handle the troublesome stuff for me.\"\n\"Isn’t it possible that all your clones would be as lazy as you, resulting in countless yous having fun?\" Lin Li retorted without even bothering to lift an eyelid.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Lin Li, your damn comments are so hurtful.\"\n\"It can’t talk.\"\n\"Your mom.\"\n\"I’m perfectly healthy, thanks for your concern.\"\n\"But I still want to learn cloning because if many of me are out having fun, I have quite a few bold ideas, and they should agree with them.\" Bai Bufan raised his eyebrows.\n\"Alright, you can shut up now, don’t pollute my database.\" Lin Li covered his ears.\n...\n\"Knock knock knock.\"\n\"Lin Li, why are you here?\" During lunch break, Chen Tianming opened the dorm room door, saw it was Lin Li, and curiously asked.\n\"Why isn’t Bufan in the dorm, hasn’t he finished his meal?\" Lin Li expressed slight surprise as he glanced around and found Bai Bufan absent.\nLin Li went out to eat at noon, so he wasn’t with Bai Bufan.\nThe main purpose was to replenish the \"Emotion Absorbing Bottle\".\nWhile outside, having carefully observed, Lin Li noticed that the surface of the \"Emotion Absorbing Bottle\" was no longer entirely black; it now had a few small white lines that visually resembled cracks, though it still felt smooth to the touch.\nPresumably, this was evidence of wear and tear, and when the white lines covered the bottle, it would likely shatter and begin a self-repair period.\n\"I don’t know; maybe he hasn’t finished eating yet.\" Sitting on the lower bunk of his bed, Zhou Baowei shrugged.\nHe glanced at Lin Li twice, then rolled up his pant legs a round, once again assessing it, then unsatisfactorily pulled them back down.\nThe school uniforms were generally a bit large and long, and in the summer, rolling up the pant legs was quite normal.\nHowever, Zhou Baowei felt a bit unwilling. How did Lin Li’s rolled-up pant legs make him look a bit roguish, handsome — top-tier rogue appearance — while on himself, rolling up the pant legs made him look like a farmer’s son ready to plant rice?\nLin Li was truly damnable.\nWhat the hell had this guy done this semester, the change is even bigger than Bai Bufan’s compared to others?\n\"No worries, you two are the same; Bufan not being here is his loss. I’ve just downloaded an amazing 3D animation on my phone; the modeling is top-notch, I must share it with you. What do you say, wanna take a look?\" Lin Li pulled out his phone from his pocket, waved it twice in a tempting manner.\n\"Really good stuff, let me see? Or is there some kind of trap again?\" Zhou Baowei asked out of curiosity.\n\"I’m not watching; I must remain faithful for Qiaoqiao. Watching such spiritually adulterous things would weigh on my conscience,\" Chen Tianming shook his head.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSometimes Lin Li did feel quite helpless.\nIgnoring Chen Tianming, Lin Li sat on Bao Wei’s bed, placing the phone where the quilt could cover it from the doorway, secured it, and opened the video he had downloaded outside.\n3D, with plot, and subtitles.\n\"Wow, it’s Tifa!\" Zhou Baowei exclaimed.\n\"You know her? You play ’Final Fantasy’ too?\"\n\"’Final Fantasy’? What’s that?\"\nHearing this reply, Lin Li and Zhou Baowei exchanged a smile and hugged each other.\nThe 3D zone cannot lose Tifa, just as Chengdu cannot stop selling lubricant.\nDVA, Tifa, Marie Rose, once used their delicate bodies to hold up the sky of the 3D zone. Unfortunately, with the changing times, new works have become fewer and fewer.\nNow the 3D zone unexpectedly belongs to Genshin Impact.\nThe two started watching the video, put on headphones, and listened to the mesmerizing sounds.\nAfter the second class in the morning, Lin Li hadn’t used the \"Emotional Absorption Bottle\" again, feeling much more rejuvenated.\n\"This plot is just too epic.\" When Zhou Baowei covered him with a blanket, no more words were needed.\nEspecially since they’re still going through the plot, and the clothes are still perfectly intact.\nSeeing this, Lin Li was about to take out the bottle to absorb, suddenly remembered that the bottle still contained the complex emotions from Wang Yuezhi from this morning.\nAfter pondering, he thought it should be easier to consume than drowsiness, so Lin Li output all the emotions and desires from the bottle onto himself.\n\"Bao Wei, others endure hardship and work hard, you eat McDonald’s; others push through with determination, you simply can’t go on; others strengthen their bodies, you just gain weight. With eating less or not eating at all, you chose not eating less. What a damn mess.\"\nWith the emotions entering his body, Lin Li immediately felt melancholic and angry, thus venting his frustration at Bao Wei.\nZhou Baowei: \"Huh?\"\n\"Do you notice, when you sleep, your blanket seems a little narrow no matter how you adjust it, and it doesn’t cover your stomach completely? You must be aware, since your blanket is just like that.\" Lin Li disdainfully patted Zhou Baowei’s blanket.\n\"...\"\n\"Come on, dude, I can tolerate you scolding me, but can’t you at least have a valid reason? There’s got to be some basic fairness, right?\" Zhou Baowei looked bewildered and somewhat wronged.\n\"Hoo——\"\n\"It’s nothing, I just suddenly felt in a bad mood. After scolding you for a bit, I felt better. Alright, let’s continue watching the show.\" Lin Li waved his hand with a smile.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nNo way, is this guy seriously nuts?\nLin Li then sighed inwardly, acknowledging again that the bottle was indeed magical. Although he had known and was prepared that he would suddenly feel anger and jealousy, when those emotions entered his body, he found that he couldn’t feel comfortable without venting, and his desire to curse was hard to suppress.\nWith Bao Wei right beside him, it would be a waste not to vent on him.\nWait a second.\nWang Yuezhi didn’t curse me this morning.\nIs he perhaps the true expert, the legendary ninja?\nAlthough it might be because it was several seconds of collected emotions entering the body all at once, Lin Li still elevated his assessment of Wang Yuezhi by a notch, ready to call him the King of Ninjas!\nThe two continued watching.\nThe bottle was already empty, Zhou Baowei, transfer all your reputation to me!\nSuccessfully absorbed.\nNot only that, but the system’s progress bar increased in speed, not only faster than when absorbing drowsiness but also much faster than when absorbing anger.\nCould absorbing this be the most efficient solution?\nDoes the system consider this desire more negative than anger for cultivators?\nIs it directly determined to be obscene, evil?\nWhile Lin Li was pondering, Zhou Baowei’s expression gradually became more serious.\nOriginally staring intently at Lin Li’s phone, his gaze gradually alternated between his legs covered by the blanket and the phone screen.\nStrange.\nZhou Baowei took a deep breath, hesitated to speak, hesitated again, but ended up staying silent because of the embarrassment.\nThe modeling plot was clearly excellent and he quite appreciated it, even ready to ask Lin Li to send him the link for a thorough weekend review, but why on earth did he not react when the most exciting part began?\nHis mind was very receptive to it, so why didn’t he react physically?\nMind willing, yet powerless?\n\"...\"\nCould something be wrong?\nNo way, not at this age!\n\"...\"\nAnd yet, Lin Li hadn’t figured out the answer, but suddenly noticed that the \"Emotional Absorption Bottle\" couldn’t continue absorbing.\nThis meant that Zhou Baowei was no longer generating that kind of desire, or rather, it was no longer a major emotional desire for him.\nLin Li turned his head and, upon seeing clearly, repressed his laughter from escaping his throat.\n——At this moment, Zhou Baowei was drenched in sweat, his eyes unfocused, his lips pale.\nHis actions were indeed somewhat unfeeling.\nBut Lin Li wouldn’t be like Wu Min, who only kills without caring about burial, Lin Li cared about both the killing and the burial.\n\"Emotional Absorption Bottle,\" anxiety, absorb for me!\nSuccessfully absorbed.\nThe progress bar advanced faster than with drowsiness, and slower than with anger.\nAt this time, Zhou Baowei felt much calmer.\nActually... not reacting isn’t necessarily bad, after all, I don’t really need it. If it’s gone, it’s gone. No need to worry, take it easy.\n...Wait, that’s not right.\nHow could I possibly think it’s fine if it’s gone? No way!\nHey, wait, seems like there’s a reaction again?\nYour specially monitored player \"Little Bao Wei\" is online; it has been 0 days, 0 hours, and 3 minutes since its last login.",

      "content": "Chapter 185: Chapter 159: The Humiliation Coming Along Weakness\nLin Li heads to the classroom.\nAfter the big joys and lows, Zhou Baowei finds it hard to have any major emotional ups and downs.\nHe also said he wanted to abstain from desires, claiming that heaven just gave him a warning, so he refused Lin Li’s offer to share again.\nLin Li didn’t insist, not to mention that the recently rested spirit is already severely depleted again.\nBesides, to be honest, he doesn’t plan to continue relying on the emotions of this group of buddies to complete the task.\nDrowsiness comes suddenly and goes suddenly, which no one finds strange, but other emotions and desires shouldn’t be like this.\nAfter all, once it becomes frequent and spreads widely, over time, they will definitely notice the anomaly. By then, everyone’s worries and fears won’t be Lin Li’s intention.\nLin Li already had a plan in mind for the way to complete this task, so he doesn’t want to mess around with the classmates of Class 4, Grade 1.\nWalking to the classroom, Lin Li pushes open the back door and enters.\nThen, he starts rewinding time, exits through the door, and shuts it.\nNope.\n\"Phew—\" Lin Li takes a deep breath.\nThe \"Bottle of Hidden Emotions and Desires\" shouldn’t be used too often; using it too much mentally messes you up and causes hallucinations.\nLin Li opens the door and walks in again, then closes his eyes, letting out a long sigh.\nAfraid to open his eyes, he hopes it’s just his hallucination~\nWhy does the class not look like what I imagined?\nUsually at noon in the classroom, it’s just the bond trio: Lin Li, Chen Yu Ying, Wang Yuezhi.\nHowever, just now Lin Li noticed in one glance that Wang Yuezhi wasn’t there.\nThis can be understood since Wang Yuezhi feels severely sleep deprived today and is likely planning to catch up on sleep during noon.\nChen Yu Ying is there, sitting in her spot.\nThe class also has a few other students, like Zhuo Yongfei, Wen Muyang, etc., which can be understood since next week is the monthly exam, and studying during noon is quite normal, with even more people likely on Monday and Tuesday.\nBut the one thing Lin Li can’t accept.\nIs Bai Bufan sitting in Bai Bufan’s seat at this noon!\nNot the buddies, what gives you the right to sit in Bai Bufan’s seat?\nDid you get permission from Bai Bufan’s deskmate?\n\"Get out, get out.\" The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. Lin Li stepped forward and grabbed Bai Bufan’s collar, dragging him out.\n\"What’s up?\" Bai Bufan straightened his clothes, and after seeing there was no beauty in the corridor, he asked somewhat puzzled.\n\"Why did you come to the classroom this noon?\" Lin Li went straight to the point.\n\"It’s for the monthly exam, I’m working hard for my new phone.\" Bai Bufan spread his hands innocently.\n\"Aren’t you sleepy? Don’t you have a habit of napping?\" Lin Li asked after a moment of silence.\n\"Seemed like I slept too much this morning, not as sleepy this noon.\" Bai Bufan replied.\nLin Li fell silent again.\nBai Bufan not being sleepy, it’s partly his own fault.\nAbsorbing drowsiness doesn’t stop the body from needing sleep. Their alertness is temporary, an illusion. In fact, today Zhou Baowei and Chen Tianming, especially during the fourth and fifth periods, were more sleepy than usual, their heads nodding off fiercely.\nHowever, Bai Bufan’s sleep was real; his body effectively recovered its functions.\nSlept similarly to nighttime, more than usual in the morning, naturally less sleepy than usual at noon.\nUnderstanding this, Lin Li really felt like giving himself a slap.\nThe drowsiness should have all gone to Wang Yuezhi; why did it have to go to Bai Bufan...\n\"Get back, back to the dorm.\" Lin Li said.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Why? You can’t possibly still be seeing me study as a threat, can you? Does this mean I also oppress you?\" Bai Bufan suddenly got excited.\nThen he noticed Lin Li’s contemptuous glance that resembled looking at poo.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nThis gaze is so hurtful.\n\"Anyway, get back to the dorm, or sit somewhere else. I don’t allow you to sit in Bai Bufan’s seat at noon, you aren’t qualified.\" Lin Li said determinedly.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nHold on.\nBai Bufan suddenly remembered who usually sits in this position at noon.\n\"Oh—\" Bai Bufan realized, \"I was wondering why you were in such a hurry, turns out it’s this, oh—\"\nBai Bufan’s expression was vulgar.\nLin Li maintained a polite yet awkward smile.\nThen Bai Bufan felt peculiar again: \"Ding Sihan isn’t coming at noon, why don’t you just sit in her seat?\"\nLin Li sighed.\nChen Yu Ying’s position, surrounded by students who come to study at noon, even a low whisper would be dissed after being said too much. In such a case, Chen Yu Ying probably wouldn’t say another word.\nHe planned to chat about driving things at noon, how could he talk like this?\nNo way somewhere else beats the charm of the classroom corner position?\n\"So go back quickly.\" Since Bai Bufan understood, although his understanding might have some slight misunderstanding, as long as the purpose is achieved, it’s fine, so Lin Li said.\n\"I get it, I get it.\" Bai Bufan patted his chest, returning to their positions arm-in-arm with Lin Li.\nLin Li smiled contentedly.\nSometimes you really have to rely on your brothers.\nBack at their positions, Bai Bufan continued studying.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Why haven’t you left yet?\" After a few seconds, Lin Li asked.\n\"Why would I leave?\" Bai Bufan asked back.\nSeeing Lin Li stunned for a moment, Bai Bufan smiled cruelly, his voice darkened, leaning his face closer to Lin Li:\n\"Lin Li, starting today, I’ll come to the classroom every day, whether it’s before the monthly exam, during it, or after it, whether I study or not...\nremember this, Lin Li, every noon, it’s every day, even if I don’t study, even if I want to sleep—\nI...will...still...come...to...the...classroom...\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n#@!!\nThe most terrifying episode, and also the most effective time Bai Bufan made a threat!\nDamn it, the boomerang hit me on the head.\nLin Li was a bit drenched in sweat.\nHe looked at the \"Vessel of Emotions and Desires\" in his pocket, could it solve the problem?\nIt seemed like it could. This bottle is definitely harder than a skull, as long as Bai Bufan is bashed to death with it, the problem should be solved, and the blood could be a sacrifice to the bottle. Good, good, just do it!\nForget it.\nLin Li awkwardly let out a laugh and met Bai Bufan’s comfortable, revengeful gaze, coughed twice, and said warmly:\n\"Bufan.\"\n\"Hey.\" Bai Bufan curled his lips.\n\"Now that I think about it, indeed, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, I did some really excessive, really beastly things to you.\"\n\"Did that happen?\" Bai Bufan tilted his head.\n\"I now deeply realize my mistake, I really shouldn’t have.\"\n\"Hmm?\" Bai Bufan squinted.\n\"Here, I sincerely apologize to you, sorry, I truly know I was wrong.\"\n\"Wow!\" Bai Bufan twisted his spine.\n\"You bastard.\"\nLin Li was amused by Bai Bufan’s pretentious, exaggerated gestures, made a fist, and then saw Bai Bufan bring his face close:\n\"Hit me, hit me, kill me, just let the corpse stay in its place!\"\n\"What’s this nonsense? Another misunderstanding, right? How could I bear to hit Brother Bai? This is a case of great waters flooding the Dragon King’s temple, Brother Bai. What kind of relationship do we have? We’re bros, those were just small misunderstandings before, there’s no need for them to affect our brotherhood.\"\nLin Li patted Bai Bufan’s back with his fist while ingratiatingly saying.\n\"Go on.\"\n\"Brother Bai is wise and brave...\"\n\"Keep going.\"\n\"Honestly, being able to know you...\"\nLin Li talked until his mouth was dry.\nBai Bufan finally nodded, turned to look at Lin Li, and under Lin Li’s hopeful gaze: \"Did you not eat? Why so weak with the patting?\"\nLin Li took a deep breath.\nWhy didn’t I just faint this pretentious guy this morning?\nI’ve been too lenient with this dude.\nShould I just electrocute him now?\nNoticing Lin Li stopped patting his back, Bai Bufan turned his head in confusion.\nHe found Lin Li grinding a stick from Pingjiang against the wall corner, occasionally making stabbing gestures at the chest.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nIf Bu Hao gets any more smug, he’ll smug himself to death (physically).\n\"Cough, cough.\" Bai Bufan got up, placed the weapon back on the windowsill from Lin Li’s hand, but still maintained an arrogant attitude: \"Xiaolin, I can go back. Even if I have to study in the future, I’ll study in the dormitory, but you... you know what to do, right?\"\nHaving room for negotiation is always better. Friends who often kill know that killing is actually a last resort, so Lin Li nodded like a pecking chick:\n\"Brother Bai, got it. I promise I’ll never send you horror films again, and whether you’re there or not, I’ll study properly and won’t show you any disrespect.\"\n\"Teachable indeed, okay then.\" Bai Bufan nodded. Anyway, if Lin Li breaks the promise, he can always come to the class at noon, so he’s not afraid of any word games Lin Li might play. Then he got up again, coughed twice: \"I’m going back to the palace for a nap, Eunuch Lin, escort me out.\"\n\"Aye, long live the Emperor, your servant sees off the Emperor.\" Lin Li immediately got up, indicated for Bai Bufan to follow him.\nThe two walked to the back door of the classroom.\n\"Refreshing!\" After reaching the hallway, Bai Bufan could finally speak louder, he wickedly grinned at Lin Li: \"Lin Li, turns out even you have a day like this!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nPetty people get complacent.\n\"Alright, alright, Xiaolin enjoy your noon.\" Bai Bufan happily walked towards the stairs.\nAt the moment Bai Bufan turned away, Lin Li’s expression changed, his face darkened, and he let out a cold laugh.\nBut in the next moment, Bai Bufan chose to turn back and caught the change of expression.\n\"What’s that supposed to mean?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Hehehe~~ I didn’t notice~~\" Lin Li started playing dumb.\nWhy does this guy understand me so well, is even my change of expression a part of his anticipation?\nWith an arrest successful, Bai Bufan left completely satisfied.\nLin Li changed his expression again, watching Bai Bufan’s back.\nToday was a heavy day.\nLin Li suffered an unprecedented humiliation, one he will never forget.\nBut it doesn’t matter.\nAs a cultivator, Lin Li has his means, and he never lets a vendetta go past the night.\nLin Li took out the \"Vessel of Emotions and Desires,\" which contained the emotions and desires Bao Wei was sucked into at noon.\nAlthough he swore not long ago to never toy with classmates’ emotions and desires again.\nLin Li is willing to make an exception for Bai Bufan.\nThis contemptible guy... he deserves it!\n...\nAs Bai Bufan reached the staircase, he stopped.\nHe slowly looked down: \"?\"\nBai Bufan wore a mournful expression:\n\"No, dude, what’s up with you, why on earth?\"\n\"Who’s your target now? Can you tell me? This doesn’t make sense.\"\n\"You’re making me feel like I’m the problem, so annoying, surely nothing bad will really happen, just calm down?\"\nBai Bufan was exceptionally anxious.\nXiaobai said nothing, just kept looking up.",

      "content": "Chapter 186: Chapter 160 Haha, Lin Li, this clown!\n\"Pfsst pfsst—Pfsst pfsst—\"\nThe sudden sound nearby startled Chen Yu Ying a bit. She quickly leaned to the left, away from the aisle, while turning her head to look towards the source of the sound, covering her lips with the back of her left hand.\nUpon seeing that it was Lin Li squatting in the aisle, the emotions in her lively eyes shifted from surprise to helplessness and amusement.\n\"Don’t do that, it’s scary.\"\n\"If it wasn’t scary, I wouldn’t do it. I crept over here just for this.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nThat’s so Lin Li.\nLin Li pointed with his thumb to the corner where he was, still making the ’pfsst pfsst’ sound with his mouth.\nChen Yu Ying turned around to take a look, and upon noticing that Bai Bufan, who had taken her seat, was no longer there, she understood what Lin Li meant. She nodded, covered her pen with a cap, and began to organize the assignments and textbooks she planned to write and read at noon.\nThen, hugging her textbooks, she stood up and followed Lin Li to the back row.\n\"Did Bai Bufan leave?\" she asked curiously after sitting down in her lunch spot.\nLin Li, hearing this, immediately covered his mouth with his hand, began to tremble with deep breaths, nodded with difficulty, and said heavily, \"Class rep, so you already knew?\"\n\"Huh?\" Chen Yu Ying became even more puzzled.\nLin Li stood up, bowing his head, crossing his hands in front of him, his head drooping, and began to chant solemnly:\n\"Dear classmate Bai Bufan, at noon on the eighteenth of this month, sadly passed away at the age of 15.5. According to the coroner, the cause of death was dissection.\nHis passing has brought us immense grief, and we express our deepest condolences and remembrance for his departure.\nBai Bufan was once our classmate, excelling in his studies, with a good character, and actively participating in academic activities and social practices. His sudden departure shocked us, and we will forever cherish the beautiful memories and valuable friendship he brought us.\nHere, we extend our sincerest condolences to his family, hoping that they can feel our support and companionship in this difficult time. We will do our utmost to help them through this difficult period...\"\nChen Yu Ying was dumbfounded.\nShe only hadn’t looked back for a few minutes, and how had Bai Bufan’s obituary already been released?\nWas it that sudden? She didn’t even get a chance to see him off one last time.\nAnd why are you so skilled, Lin Li? Just how many times have you rehearsed this in your head?\n\"That’s not the ’left’ I was asking about, I meant did he leave the classroom!\" Chen Yu Ying said, both annoyed and amused.\n\"Didn’t I just say so? Yes, he left forever. Dear classmate Bai Bufan, at noon on the...\"\nSeeing that Lin Li seemed to intend to chant the whole thing again, Chen Yu Ying pursed her lips and nudged the side of Lin Li’s shoe with the tip of her shoe, then glared at him.\nAlright.\n\"It’s all the same, class rep, just consider Bai Bufan as good as dead.\"\nLin Li sat back in his seat, waving his hand nonchalantly.\n\"Okay.\"\nChen Yu Ying nodded. Seeing Lin Li’s attitude, Bai Bufan probably wasn’t coming back at noon.\nShe was reassured it was fine to sit there.\n\"By the way, class rep, on my way back from lunch, I saw a teacher at the school teaching their kid how to ride a bike. It made me think of how you haven’t learned yet. Would you like to try learning during some free time before evening self-study, for instance?\" Lin Li asked.\nThis anecdote was obviously made up to bring up this suggestion.\n\"At school... let’s not.\" Chen Yu Ying thought for a moment, shaking her head. \"Just thinking about how lots of people I know might pass by would make me embarrassed.\"\n\"True enough. So how about this weekend? Are you free? We could set a time and go out? We could find some secluded place without anyone around, in a dark windy gorge, a lad and a lass alone, thunder and lightning... to learn biking!\" Lin Li suggested with a mischievous smile and turned to look at Chen Yu Ying.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nAnyone meeting Lin Li for the first time and hearing such things would probably think he’s a creep.\nThankfully, Chen Yu Ying wasn’t new to Lin Li’s ways. While Lin Li indeed had a strange streak, she knew he wasn’t the typical creep — he was a disciplined one.\nSo she found it more amusing.\n\"I probably can’t this weekend either. I’m already scheduled to study at the library with Ding Sihan and the others on Saturday, and I need to visit my grandma on Sunday.\" Chen Yu Ying responded briskly.\n\"I see. Then let’s find an opportunity some other time.\" Lin Li nodded understandingly when he heard this.\nHe didn’t press further about when she’d be available. Being too eager about such matters would feel awkward, and since this task wasn’t urgent, there was no need to rush.\nIf nothing else, he could rely on his ’knowledge’ of piloting mechas to gradually complete this task, focusing more on other tasks meantime.\n\"Lin Li, do you really want me to know how to ride a bike?\"\nNonetheless, it seemed Chen Yu Ying noticed and curiously inquired.\n\"Of course.\nThe main reason being that I want to repay you, class rep, for all the help you give me in my studies.\nAnd there’s another totally insignificant, super minor reason — I want to see you, while learning to ride, accidentally fall to the ground, crying with pearly tears, and me standing with arms akimbo, cackling and calling you a super-duper big dummy.\"\nLin Li’s control over lengthy sentences was always quite adept, finishing this one smoothly in one go.\n\"You’re enjoying and looking forward to the ’super minor reason’ way too much!\"\nChen Yu Ying stretched out her leg, and then the sole of her shoe fiercely attacked the top of Lin Li’s shoe.",

      "content": "Chapter 187: Chapter 160 Haha, Lin Li, this clown!_2\n\"What, you can look at me like an idiot, but I can’t look at you like that? That’s not fair!\" Lin Li didn’t mind being stepped on at all and was very confident.\nLin Li broke the age-old rule that whoever looks to the left in a stare-down loses, after all, shameless people always win.\nChen Yu Ying turned her eyes away, pouting slightly with a ’tch’ sound, then defiantly said, \"I won’t let you see that kind of scene. I’m very smart. I’ll definitely learn to ride a bike soon. Hmph, by then you’ll be amazed and say how great I am.\"\n\"Pride will have its price.\"\n\"I’m confident!\"\n\"Hehe.\" Lin Li chuckled and then stopped himself from saying more. With a strange but slightly amused expression, he said, \"Class rep, let’s talk about this when you have time. Right now, it’s like we’re two little kids squabbling in mid-air.\nIt’s like I say my deskmate can eat poop, ask you if yours can, and you say of course, your deskmate can eat two tons and then ask if mine can do that. I’d be furious and say, why not? He can eat two tons and even take some home...\"\nChen Yu Ying was amused by Lin Li’s description.\nShe definitely wanted to find a chance to tell Ding Sihan about Lin Li’s description.\nBut recalling it, she did act childish just now.\nIt’s all Lin Li’s fault. She wouldn’t be like this if not in front of Lin Li.\n\"Okay, next weekend? Maybe during National Day we can find some time; let’s talk about it then.\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice still carried a hint of a laugh as she spoke.\n\"Alright.\" Lin Li nodded, not being in too much of a hurry.\nWhen there are six tasks hanging and no new tasks are triggered for a long time, then he might hurry.\n\"Oh, Lin Li, do you want to come to the library with us on Saturday?\" Chen Yu Ying asked as she got back to the topic.\n\"Hmm? Who’s all going? Is it just you and Ding Sihan?\"\n\"Wanqiu is coming too. Wanqiu plans to stay at school this weekend. Si Han’s home is still quite close to the Nansang Library, so it’ll be convenient for us to go then.\" Chen Yu Ying explained.\nNansang Library is not the library of Nansang Middle School, but the county library of Nansang County, located in Xiling Town. It is a first-class library with a thousand square meters of floor space.\n\"Oh, they’re all acquaintances, that’s fine.\" Lin Li nodded.\nThis weekend, after confirming that Chen Yu Ying isn’t learning to drive, Lin Li’s focus would definitely be on the monthly exams. It’s about studying no matter where you are, and the library has a better atmosphere.\n\"Are we going in the morning or what?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Si Han and Wanqiu want to sleep in, so maybe around ten or eleven?\" Chen Yu Ying responded, not entirely sure.\nThis type of large county library isn’t like a school library; you don’t have to worry about not finding a place if you’re late, so there’s really no need to stake out a seat.\n\"Alright, I might go there earlier.\" With a gathering at ten or eleven, it’s not suitable for Lin Li to work out then sleep again, so he might as well go earlier in the morning.\n\"Okay.\"\n...\nMost of the lunch break had passed.\nLin Li stretched lazily.\nLooking at the problem-solving process Chen Yu Ying had written for him, he commented amusedly, \"Class rep, how do you manage to write the curly braces so neatly on both sides?\"\nCurly braces \"{ }\", typically, Lin Li’s \"{\" is quite standard, but when it comes to drawing \"}\", it becomes an exaggerated S curve.\n\"Just draw it slowly.\" Chen Yu Ying smiled, explaining while she casually drew a pleasing right brace on scratch paper, showcasing her fault-free technique.\n\"Maybe it’s not about going slow.\" Lin Li imitated and shook his head after drawing one.\n\"Well, then I don’t know.\"\n\"Alright, I get this problem now too, I’m gonna take a nap.\"\nHaving achieved his study goals for the morning, Lin Li rubbed his temples and said.\nLin Li’s energy was indeed not as good as usual, thanks to the \"Emotion Concealing and Desire Storing Bottle.\"\nResting was for replenishing energy to use it well in the evening.\n\"Okay, you sleep.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"Wait a minute.\" Just as Lin Li laid his head down, he suddenly lifted it again with bright eyes.\n\"What’s up?\" Chen Yu Ying asked curiously.\nLin Li got up without a word and quickly ran out of the classroom.\nThinking Lin Li went to the restroom, Chen Yu Ying didn’t pay much attention.\nBut when Lin Li returned a few minutes later, he had a handful of leaves, which he placed in front of Chen Yu Ying.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Class rep, in case I fall asleep and you’re bored.\" Lin Li waggled his eyebrows, hinting heavily.\nChen Yu Ying’s face turned crimson, clutching her textbooks and homework as she stood up, \"I’m going back to my seat.\"\nLin Li merely smiled and laid down on the table, using his arms as a pillow.\nHaving a good figure indeed seemed beneficial for lunchtime naps too.\nBefore, using his arm as a pillow meant pressing against bones, just uncomfortable, needing a long sleeve for cushioning, but now it was much better.\nA nice little surprise.\nWith that thought, Lin Li closed his eyes.\n...\nCouldn’t fall asleep.\nWang Yuezhi tossed and turned in the dorm bed, concluding he couldn’t sleep.\nWhy though?\nHe was clearly dead tired this morning, skipped several classes because of it, went back to the dorm specifically to nap to avoid a repeat in the afternoon.\nBut now lunch break was nearly over, and not a wink had he slept.\nWhy?\nHe rarely returned to the dorm for a nap at noon, yet the bed utterly defeated him?\nUnable to sleep, Wang Yuezhi’s mind wandered.\nCould Chen Yu Ying have noticed his absence and be worrying?\nAfter all, he never missed a lunch break in the classroom before, if not for Lin Li, a commuting student with no dorm, he could’ve spent a lot of alone time there.\nCertainly, Chen Yu Ying noticed his unbroken attendance record, right?\nThen today...\nWait, today wouldn’t have turned into Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying’s private time, would it?\nBefore his heart could indulge in sweetness, this thought struck, and terror ensued.\nWithout him, the righteous observer overseeing Lin Li, the jerk, who knew what excessive things Lin Li might do?!\nWang Yuezhi panicked more the more he thought, breaking into a cold sweat, leaping from the bed in a rush.\nThe dorm building door, locked during lunchtime, prevented ingress or egress, leaving him no option for leaving.\nHe could only fry in the skillet of time.\nWang Yuezhi felt like someone who, having finished a day’s work earning three thousand a month, saw Hulk lift a twelve-month installment car and hurl it at a villain, only for it to miss and hit the house for which he’d just paid a down payment.\nDespair, anguish.\nEvery minute felt like a year.\nFinally, the gentle bell recalling everyone to wakefulness rang.\nAlready fully dressed, Wang Yuezhi bolted, sprinting full tilt to the classroom.\nFaster, even faster, Wang Yuezhi felt like muscles sprouting wings; Hermes, the god of muscles, nearly embodied him then.\nAt last, breathless, Wang Yuezhi arrived at the classroom, flinging open the main door.\nAnd then he froze.\nFirst, there was the realization that he worried for nothing. There were others in the classroom; someone kept an eye without his presence.\nBut more than that, Chen Yu Ying still sat at her desk, not in Bai Bufan’s spot.\nMoreover, Lin Li, who never took a lunch nap, was now asleep on his arms, not even awakened by the opening door.\nThe gap between them was vast.\nCould it be...\nNot only was the situation not the disaster he feared, but the two were back to their disagreement at lunch today?\nWang Yuezhi’s grin was hard to suppress at that thought.\nHe regretted missing such a lively scene today.\nWen Shuyang, noticing the blissful Wang Yuezhi post-door opening: \"?\"\nWhat on earth was he doing?\n\"Close the door, Wang Yuezhi; the AC is still on,\" she said impatiently.\n\"Oh, sorry.\" Wang Yuezhi promptly shut the door and returned to his seat.\nThen he grinned again.\nBecause upon nearing, he saw Lin Li’s head and arms, adorned with leaves as if from a mischievous act.\nUnaware of being pranked—\nHaha, a clown!",

      "content": "Chapter 188: Chapter 161: The World of Adults Is So Complicated\nWhen evening self-study ended, Lin Li had also successfully recuperated, adjusting his body quite a bit.\nBecause there was still something to do, he headed straight for the bicycle after class, then checked the navigation on his phone, heading to the destination.\nArrived.\nLooking at his target, Lin Li nodded.\nLove Theme Hotel.\nLin Li didn’t go in; after a slight smile, he took out the \"Emotion and Desire Bottle,\" parked and locked his bike, then sat on the bench next to it, took out his phone and continued studying while waiting for willing participants to take the bait.\nThis was a hotel street, with quite a lot of foot traffic.\nLin Li had only been sitting for a few minutes when a couple got out of a taxi that had just arrived.\nLin Li directly took out the \"Emotion and Desire Bottle,\" credibility, I called you once, do you dare to respond?\nResponded.\nLin Li’s sight seemed to be on the phone, but he was actually using his peripherals to observe the couple.\nThen, visibly, the couple’s expressions changed, and they looked at each other.\nWith a bystander’s attitude, Lin Li activated [Ear Divine Power].\n\"...\"\nHe heard nothing.\nIt wasn’t that [Ear Divine Power] failed; they were just tacitly silent.\n\"...Baby, have you booked our room yet?\" After a long time, the girl finally spoke.\n\"...Not yet.\"\n\"Then today, how about... let’s forget it?\"\n\"Sure! Actually, I was thinking the same, let’s just go back and play games? Things like romance aren’t really necessary.\" The boy nodded quickly.\n\"Alright!\"\n\"Driver, take us back.\" The couple turned in sync and flagged down the taxi.\nThe taxi driver who hadn’t left yet: \"?\"\nJust arrived and now leaving, taking the taxi twice, are you two helping Xiling increase GDP?\nForget it.\nThanks to these two idiots, this money is easy to earn.\n\"Alrighty! Get in!\" The driver, smiling outwardly yet mocking inwardly, opened the car door.\nAnd Lin Li, who orchestrated all this, kept his accomplishments hidden.\nTonight he saved billions of little lives again.\nThis was Lin Li’s plan.\nThis is a hotel street, and Love Theme is Xiling’s highest-rated emotional, fun hotel. What else do couples come here for at this hour?\nHardly to look at glow-in-the-dark watches or cats that do backflips.\nSo, just need to stay near the entrance and absorb from those passing by.\nOf course, not everyone can be successfully absorbed; emotions are hard to control, and not everyone who comes here meets the \"Emotion and Desire Bottle\" requirements, but failing to absorb doesn’t matter, after all, there’s always the next one.\nIndeed, going to a hospital, the sadness and despair are endless; after all, hospital walls have heard more pious prayers than churches.\nFrom an emotional standpoint, Lin Li didn’t really want to play with people’s emotions at such places; they might actually need such sadness to vent.\nFrom a rational standpoint, after experiments during the day, lust is the most efficient desire.\nAnd the biggest limitation in completing this task isn’t Lin Li finding suitable negative emotions, but his spirit being far from enough to consume.\nIf he went to a hospital, stayed in the ICU for a minute, Lin Li might faint on the spot from inability to maintain his spirit, entering the ICU at light speed.\n...\nThe \"Emotion and Desire Bottle\" was full.\nIt can only be said that this is a blessed location.\nLin Li even absorbed credibility from a couple of bros just passing by the hotel with arms around each other’s shoulders.\nYou better really be bros, best be going to drink, and the credibility better be from girls coming later.\nLin Li thought of the women’s novels he had read before.\nReading women’s novels is pretty normal, the writing in them can be commendable, and many themes transcend gender.\nThe brotherhood descriptions in them, at first didn’t feel off, although a bit much, he could still convince himself to accept.\nAll this until the brothers he thought of in the book started kissing, instantly shattering everything.\nShocked Lin Li for a hundred years.\nMost of the time, Lin Li could absorb emotions from both parties.\nBut sometimes, like from a middle-aged couple, Lin Li could only absorb emotions from the woman.\nWhen her credibility was absorbed by Lin Li and she suggested to her husband maybe let’s call it off, Lin Li saw the guy almost bursting into a joyful skip.\nMiddle-aged... is it really so bleak?\nTake it as a warning.\nThere were also times when Lin Li could absorb emotions from neither party; who knows what they came here for.\nNow, looking at the full bottle, Lin Li felt a bit nostalgic — Bufan, I miss you.\nHis spirit could still hold on, leaving now would be a shame, the task progress bar still hadn’t passed a third.\nWithout his brother, he had to toughen up himself — actually, Lin Li wanted to give it a try.\n\"Hmm~~——\"\nWhen the emotions in the bottle entered his body with Lin Li’s thoughts, he quickly covered his mouth from an instinctive outcry.\nSo this is what it feels like to be in heat.\nPrepared, Lin Li pressed tightly on the bench with his other hand, and started taking deep breaths continuously.\nOpen eyes.\nWhy does the exhaust pipe of the car in front look so enticing?\nThe kitten next to the car seems pretty cute too?\nWhen these thoughts flashed through his mind, Lin Li slapped himself hard.\nAlmost ended up like Brother Third by accident.\nControl my bodily urges, come on!\nLittle catfish mermaid, flash images in my mind!\nIt took several minutes, knowing this desire would eventually fade, for Lin Li to finally calm down.\nCuriosity almost killed the cat.\nLin Li felt a bit shaken; next time the bottle’s full, he’ll randomly give it to a customer at the store.\n...\nLin Li had been sitting for an hour, and his spirit was evidently weary.\nThe \"Bottle of Concealed Desire\" was probably nearing its limit again.\nAnother couple approached, the woman seemed talented, and the man wealthy beyond measure.\nA short and plump man, not as tall as the woman, looked somewhat sleazy, appeared to be saying something.\nLin Li activated [Divine Ear].\n\"Baby, later I’m going to ’beep—’, then fiercely ’beep—’, you’ll definitely ’beep—’ by then.\"\nDamn, even tigers and wolves would need to claim they’re just cats and dogs; what he’s saying is truly the language of beasts.\n\"Ah~~ I’m so looking forward to it~~ It’s all ’beep—’ down there, I really want to ’beep—’~~\"\nDamn, they’re a perfect match.\nLin Li took a deep breath, activated the magic artifact!\nThen he almost burst into laughter.\nThe man indeed had worldly desires, but from the woman, he didn’t absorb anything at all.\nSo, everything you just said was against your will, huh.\nUnbelievable, I actually thought you’d go through with it.\nAs Lin Li activated the artifact, the man stopped, slightly frowned.\n\"What’s wrong, baby?\" the woman asked in confusion.\n\"It’s boring, I don’t want to sleep with you anymore, I’m going home, do as you please.\" The man yawned, feeling that the thing he had been looking forward to wasn’t that exciting anymore, and spoke as if dismissing a call girl.\n\"How could you? Don’t be like that, let’s go.\"\n\"The bag is still yours, don’t hold me back.\"\n\"You’re the best, baby~~\"\nListening to such a conversation, and with his time and energy about done for the day, he raised his hand and poured all credibility from the bottle into the woman.\nDon’t love? I’ll make you love!\nHowever, to Lin Li’s surprise, the woman merely watched Brother Fu drive away, waving her hand in place.\nNo lust, such strong self-control?\nThen Lin Li saw the woman take out her phone and make a call.\n\"I’ve booked the room, the address is the one I sent you, come and find me,\" the woman said as soon as she connected.\n\"Okay, sis, can you help me with a champagne tower next month?\" Given the close distance, Lin Li could hear the phone conversation.\n\"No problem.\"\n\"I’ll just tell my supervisor I’m on a business trip now, sis.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYour mother.\nThe world of adults is so complicated.\nWho’s taking care of whom, anyway?\nForget it, going home for some sleep is important!\n...\nInside the Love & Passion Theme Hotel.\nThe reception desk directly faced the glass door, so the receptionist could see the flow of people coming and going outside.\nThe smile on the reception staff’s face was strained as hell.\nWhat’s going on tonight?\nOne couple after another approached the door eagerly, ready for her to greet and upsell some additional products, but suddenly, they all turned back like a wise one, leaving in disappointment, or not listening at all after coming in.\nThey looked like they were contemplating a room refund.\nWhat’s going on, was everyone playing a patience game with me?\nFinally, finally!\nA woman dressed flamboyantly came in with a face full of delight, now this is a normal customer!\nNo, it’s not normal either.\nHer male companion had already left, what’s she so delighted about?\n\"Welcome to Love & Passion, may I...?\"\nBut according to protocol, the receptionist had to say it.\n\"Cut the crap, room 4013, give me one of your biggest toys!\" the woman said impatiently, \"Oh, and prepare some low-temperature fire and wire balls too!\"\nReceptionist: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 189: Chapter 162: I Wish to Become a Bank Card, Guarding You\nIt’s already Friday.\nThe night before last and last night, Lin Li was keeping watch on that hotel street, preventing the outbreak of battle after battle.\nBy now, the progress bar for Task Four is mostly complete, and since there’s no night study session tonight, he can go early to further push this task forward. Most likely, he can finish it today.\nAs for the Spirit Stones from the past two days, they were all of unremarkable low quality.\nEncountering misfortune, facing immense failure, as strong as a monster, unable to win despite trying his best.\nLin Li hasn’t used these two Spirit Stones either, keeping them for now.\nTo avoid needing to refine treasures like the \"Bottle of Concealed Emotions\" in the future.\nAs for the \"Ability Boosters,\" Lin Li hasn’t exchanged them, thinking he should prepare at least half a month’s worth of system currency for Spirit Stones.\nThe remaining system currency is 410.\n\"That’s all for this class. Does anyone have anything they don’t understand?\"\nThe physics teacher Luo Hao clapped the chalk dust off his hands and left with his notes after seeing no one had questions.\n\"Sometimes it’s really hopeless because I have no idea what I don’t understand. How do I answer this question?\"\nBai Bufan covered his face and tilted his chair backward, balancing on the back two legs.\nLin Li secretly reached out and pulled the back of the chair hard, lifting it up, seeing Bai Bufan shout in surprise, he laughed triumphantly.\nThis scene is a classic routine for sitting in the back row, as routine as it gets.\nOne can only say, never trust your friends with your back when there’s no danger.\n\"Lin Li, I heard people can hear for hours after they die, but they can’t understand anymore. I’m in that state during class, do you think I’m already dead?\"\nAfter failing to hit Lin Li, Bai Bufan continued to complain.\n\"Got it. I’ll post your obituary on the bulletin board later.\"\n\"That’s not what I meant...\" Bai Bufan flipped the middle finger, then changed the subject to ask, \"Lin Li, what are you doing this weekend, studying?\"\n\"You’re the one asking me this, it’s not me teasing you, of course I’m studying.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Then should we go together? There’s a monthly exam next week, I’m planning to stay at school this weekend, want to go to the library together? I can ask you if I have questions, and if you have questions, you can ask yourself.\" Bai Bufan quickly replied.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"So I’m just bringing along a burden?\" Lin Li responded with a middle finger.\n\"Come on, man, why so petty? What’s yours is mine, and what’s mine is also mine.\" Bai Bufan patted Lin Li’s shoulder, saying, \"You shouldn’t be like this.\"\nPreviously both studied together, cherishing each other’s company, but now Lin Li had already betrayed class solidarity.\n\"This Saturday I’m with...\" Lin Li explained his plans and then asked, \"Why not come along? I can talk to them about it, and you can ask them questions too.\"\nDing Sihan had better grades than Bai Bufan, Qu Wanqiu had much better grades, and comparing Chen Yu Ying’s grades with Bai Bufan’s would be insulting.\n\"What a coincidence?\" Bai Bufan scratched his head and said, \"Can you ask them for me, if anyone minds, I’ll skip it. I don’t need friends to accompany me, I can manage alone.\"\n\"Why would they mind? You’re humans’ best friend, who would refuse having an ugly little dog next to them while studying?\" Lin Li patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder, \"So, Bufan, you’re underestimating yourself, you need confidence.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nConfidence, huh? But this kind of confidence?\n\"Won’t you even say I’m a cute little dog?\" Bai Bufan missed the point.\n\"Check the VCR.\" Lin Li borrowed a mirror from the desk in front to show Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan took a look, nodded miserably, \"You’re right.\"\n...\nLast class of the afternoon, Math.\n\"So should we choose A or C for this question?\" Xue Jian asked the class, pointing at the problem on the electronic whiteboard with a laser pointer.\n\"Hey—\" Since this question was somewhat difficult, the class responded in such a tone.\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nThe students present, with more than ten years of learning experience, would be considered seasoned employees in the workforce. How could they not know how to handle this situation?\nWhen the teacher asked about the top or the bottom.\nIf you don’t know, you draw out the vowel, giving the answer towards the top.\nIf the teacher asked about right or wrong?\nIf you don’t know, you draw out the vowel, answering towards ’wrong.’\nIf the teacher asked about anions or cations?\nIf you don’t know, you draw out the vowel, answering ’eagle stable ions.’\nThis is the cultivation of the old artist generation, basic operation.\nWhen faced with such a situation, the new teacher might choose to pursue the question aggressively until they get a clear answer. But a truly wise and zen old teacher would ’hear’ the correct answer themselves, nod with satisfaction, and say it’s right.\nAs a genuinely wise but not zen old teacher, Xue Jian faced the situation, sneered coldly, \"Lin Li, stand up and answer, is the answer A or C?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nXue Jian chose the strategy with the most comments.\nTargeted, blatantly targeted.\n\"Choose A.\" Now there’s no avoiding it, Lin Li recalculated once more before answering.\n\"Look again.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhy does this feel like being slowly tortured?\n\"I still think we should choose A!\" Disloyalty comes at a price, Lin Li said firmly.\n\"Very well, it’s good that you can stick to your opinion. Sit down, the correct answer is C. This indeed is a common tricky question; the last question in the multiple-choice section of the monthly exam might just be like this, so everyone should read the question carefully...\"\nIn the first half of the sentence, Lin Li was still laughing at having guessed correctly, but by the second half, he couldn’t laugh anymore.\nAh, life, so brief, so fleeting.\n\"Send me a message when you come to the library tomorrow, and I’ll give you the exact location.\" As the math class ended and school was dismissed for the week, Lin Li said to Bai Bufan while packing up his things.\nHe mentioned it to Chen Yu Ying at noon, and she agreed without much opposition. After all, the four of them also had the fate of mountain climbing together. As for Little Qiuqiu, she was an outgoing and generous girl, and it should be Bai Bufan who has social anxiety.\n\"Sure, are you heading home now? How about we have a meal together?\"\nLin Li declined Bai Bufan’s invitation; his mind was focused on completing the task.\n...\n[Task Four has been completed.]\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: Appearance Charm Increased by 10%; Holy Dragon Blood*1; System Currency*100.]\nToday, Lin Li went to a different place.\nHe went to stake out at a hotel located at the entrance of a notorious technical school even in Xiling.\nLet’s just say geniuses are geniuses, Lin Li’s absorption rate tonight was not low at all.\nThis is indeed a good deed.\nIt could reduce the number of new Earth OL accounts that start in the restroom, with beginner tasks of surviving and avoiding being discovered by their moms.\nSuch accounts being trafficked could be seen as an extraordinary change in fate; to them, traffickers are like benefactors.\nAnd why is it that there’s always difficult births in hospitals, and always easy births in technical school restrooms?\nHospitals should come here to gain some experience.\n\"Hey handsome, can I add you on WeChat?\" Just when Lin Li was about to leave, a technical school girl wearing a crop top, tight pants, and dyed, faded blonde hair approached and asked.\nDamn, Lin Li read the legendary sexual harassment from her gaze!\n\"No, thank you.\"\nAfter leaving this sentence, Lin Li got on his bike to leave.\n\"Handsome, don’t go, let’s play a role-playing game together, okay? You be the bank card and I’ll be the ATM, you insert and I’ll give you money~~\" The girl behind didn’t give up as she spoke, with the sound of her approaching footsteps.\nThump! Thump!\nLin Li’s eyes widened abruptly, the most scared he’s ever been in his life.\nWithout hesitation, veins bulging, Lin Li started pedaling, riding away on his bicycle in a flash.\nEven after leaving the technical school area, Lin Li didn’t dare look back. Although another look wouldn’t make him explode, another look and he feared he’d catch something.\n...\nBack at home.\nLin Li took out the \"Holy Dragon Blood.\"\nThe system was quite considerate, providing a mini porcelain bottle.\nJudging by the size of the bottle, it seemed to contain only one drop.\nBefore Lin Li even opened the bottle, he felt the room’s temperature rising gradually.\nLin Li cautiously opened the bottle, and immediately, a torrent of energy rushed toward him, making him feel his whole body’s Qi Blood churning nonstop.\nFeeling extremely uncomfortable and worried that it would evaporate, Lin Li quickly sealed the bottle again and put it back into the [Warehouse].\nClearly, this \"Holy Dragon Blood\" is just like the \"Thunder Seed,\" something he can’t utilize at his current level.\nMoreover, the former is probably far superior to the latter.\nIf the \"Holy Dragon Blood\" were consumed, it’d likely produce some staggering changes—if it doesn’t kill him first.\nBut it’s not something to be considered at this stage.\nLin Li then materialized the \"Emotion Containment Bottle.\"\nThree days had passed, and the bottle was already covered in dense white patterns, feeling like it wasn’t far from breaking.\nLin Li decided to waste it until it ’shatters,’ and then wait for it to restore automatically.\nBecause the present \"Emotion Containment Bottle\" is akin to a phone that can’t be charged, only able to switch batteries once the power is depleted to 30%.\nLin Li is the kind of person who, if his phone only has 89% power, would still try to charge it fully.\nConsidering that there might be many occasions in the future that require using this \"Emotion Containment Bottle,\" it would be better to ’change the battery’ early, instead of running out of ’power’ when needed.",

      "content": "Chapter 190: Chapter 163: Must I Become an Envoy? (Requesting Monthly Tickets)\nSaturday, the next day.\nThere was a third low-grade spirit stone in the [Warehouse].\n[A month of continuity... At least half an hour accumulated (15/30)]\nUnknowingly, task one was already halfway done.\nThese twenty low-grade spirit stones truly aren’t easy to get.\nHowever, it did cultivate Lin Li’s habit of ’waking up early’; sometimes he even wakes up on his own before the alarm rings.\nAt such times, Lin Li generally doesn’t choose to sleep until the alarm goes off.\nBased on Lin Li’s previous experience, if he goes back to sleep at such times, either time goes by really fast and the alarm rings shortly,\nbut that’s actually not too bad.\nWhat he’s truly worried about is when time seems to pass very ’slowly’.\nWhat does heart palpitations mean — when deciding to take a short nap but realizing it’s been too long to believe.\nAt this point suddenly sitting up, there’s a small chance of discovering that the alarm is about to ring in the next second, but a bigger chance of seeing that it’s already rung.\nGrabbing a jacket from home, with a backpack full of knowledge, freshly showered Lin Li rode his bike to Nansang Library.\nThe weather hadn’t improved today; the reason Lin Li brought a jacket was due to the library’s centralized cooling, making some areas extraordinarily cold, so cold it makes one’s hands and feet feel icy on a hot day. So better be prepared.\nArriving early, even though it’s the weekend, the library was full of empty seats.\nIt certainly was a bit chilly; he predicted it correctly, so Lin Li reminded in the group:\n「Lin Li: The library is a bit cold, best to bring a light jacket.」\nAs for not reminding them and then sharing his clothes, warm as it may be, stylish as it might seem, but what about himself being cold, absolutely not.\nHe came here to study, not just to read, so after scanning the electronic map on the first-floor machine, Lin Li booked a study room.\nEight seats, sitting five people is not too much of a waste.\nThen he went to the study room, got himself a cup of hot water, and started studying three sciences plus math, sorting out unsolvable or incomprehensible problems to the side.\n...\nChen Yu Ying was the first to arrive besides Lin Li.\nShe was dressed very simply today, just a regular shoulder T-shirt paired with a denim skirt, maybe heeding Lin Li’s advice, she had a white semi-transparent long-sleeve jacket over it.\nThere was no makeup today, but it didn’t detract from her attractiveness.\n\"I knew you’d be early, but I didn’t expect you to be this early.\" Chen Yu Ying tip-toed forward, relieved once she saw no one else in the room, and said as she walked over.\n\"Class monitor, why didn’t you let me know when you left?\" Lin Li answered off-topic, looking annoyed.\n\"What, were you going to come down and meet me?\" Chen Yu Ying asked with a smile.\n\"You’ll understand in a bit, and by the way, class monitor, your outfit looks great.\" Once Chen Yu Ying settled in front of Lin Li, he frankly admired her outfit for a while and said.\n\"Thank you, what you’re wearing is...\" Chen Yu Ying suddenly closed her mouth.\nBecause Lin Li was wearing his school uniform today.\n\"Go on, why did you stop? How do I look?\" Lin Li pressed, eager for more.\n\"You look very self-reliant!\" Chen Yu Ying thought for a few seconds, then pointed a finger at Lin Li, as if she had found the correct answer, delighted.\nLin Li gave a thumbs up: \"Good compliment.\"\nBecause self-reliance is Nansang Middle School’s motto.\n\"Of course.\" Chen Yu Ying’s crescent-shaped eyes had a hint of pride.\n\"Class monitor, this exercise book, the questions I can’t do are marked, could you take a look for me?\"\nLeaving more admiration for later, Lin Li didn’t forget his main subject, passing the exercise book over.\n\"Alright, the ones with red circles are the ones you can’t do, right? I’ll take a look at the questions first.\" Resting her chin on her thermos bottle, setting the exercise book in front of her, she swayed her head side-to-side, looking very cute.\n\"Uh... no, the ones with red circles are the ones I can do.\" Lin Li weakly added.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nShe stopped her head swaying, blinked, and looked up: \"Lin Li, you’re an idiot.\"\nCute though she may be, her words could really hit hard.\n\"No, class monitor, this is a collection of difficult problems I bought, the basics I’ve known long ago, every question here is the last multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank question of an exam!\" Lin Li thought he still needed to explain a bit.\nLin Li had been working so hard these two weeks, regular exercises couldn’t possibly result in him only knowing a few questions.\nChen Yu Ying thus watched for a bit longer.\nSeeing that she hadn’t spoken for several minutes, Lin Li then got a bit smug: \"See, class monitor, it’s tough, right?\"\nChen Yu Ying looked back at Lin Li, smiled gently: \"A, C, B, D, D, one-half, 64, increasing, a3...\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nGlancing sidelong at the answers that didn’t have explanations.\nAll correct.\nGrass.\nTough my ass.\nComparison truly is infuriating.\n\"I’m done, I’m going to self... harm.\" Lin Li lay on the table, nearly resigning to self-defense in front of a girl.\nWhen will the system turn him into a natural genius?\n...\nThe breathing light on his phone turned on, Lin Li picked up the phone; it was Bai Bufan telling him he set off.\n「Lin Li: It’s f*cking almost ten now, didn’t you say you’d come as early as me yesterday?」\n「Bai Bufan: The phone time in those five minutes before sleep is the most joyful and best four hours of my day.」\nGot it.\nThis unrestrained waste.\nLin Li put down his phone, continued studying, when after Chen Yu Ying explained another question to him, Lin Li gestured to not go on to the next one yet.\nHe picked up his phone again.\n「Lin Li: Bufan, are you on the street now?」\n「Bai Bufan: Yeah, almost there, really almost there now.」\n「Lin Li: This time I surely believe you, turn around and look.」\n「Bai Bufan: ?」\nA dozen seconds passed, Lin Li immediately sent another message.\n「Lin Li: You idiot, the other side, why are you looking there?」\nHalf a minute later.\n「Bai Bufan: ? I looked around, didn’t see you?」\n「Bai Bufan: Where exactly are you?」\n「Lin Li: Nansang Library, sixth floor, study room 12.」\n\"Bai Bufan: ?\"\n\"Lin Li: Bufan, even though I didn’t see it, I can just imagine you on the street, looking around like an idiot, it’s hilarious hahahaha.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Voice message 60s\"\nSeeing Lin Li laugh so happily, Chen Yu Ying curiously got up, covering her chest, and leaned over, trying to see Lin Li’s phone.\nOriginally, the faint elegant fragrance suddenly became rich, as if one could feel the breeze brought by fluttering eyelashes.\nLin Li directly handed the phone to Chen Yu Ying.\nAfter watching it, Chen Yu Ying also chuckled softly.\n\"You idiot, dammit Lin Li, you son of a bitch, you should’ve strangled yourself with the umbilical cord in the womb...\" The voice message, with its excessive mention of mothers, started playing after Chen Yu Ying tapped Lin Li’s phone.\nInsulting without mentioning ’mom’ is like chit-chat, without ’mother’ it’s as harmless as scraping.\nBai Bufan never chit-chats, nor scrapes.\nChen Yu Ying immediately covered her ears in embarrassment, blinking and looking at Lin Li.\n\"You opened it yourself, it has nothing to do with me.\" Lin Li shrugged and paused the voice message.\nChen Yu Ying quickly reacted, her clear eyes widening: \"So Lin Li, you’re regretting not telling me earlier because you wanted to trick me like this too?\"\n\"What else? Did you think I was going to pick you up at the library downstairs, class president?\" Lin Li blinked.\n\"You’re so bad!\"\n\"Still got Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu left to torment, exciting.\"\n...\n\"Ding Sihan: Lin Li!! I knew something was up when you suddenly messaged me privately instead of in the group!!\"\n\"Ding Sihan: I’m remembering this trick of yours! Just you wait, you jerk!\"\n\"Lin Li: Don’t curse me in the group, I still need to trick Qu Wanqiu.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: Huh? Sure. Eh? Why don’t I do the tricking instead?\"\n\"Lin Li: That’s fine too.\"\n...\n\"Ding Sihan!!\" The last one to arrive, Qu Wanqiu, charged into the study room, making sure there were no outsiders before grabbing Ding Sihan by the neck and shaking her.\n\"I can’t speak now, let me go—\" Ding Sihan laughed and struggled.\n\"Hey, class president, you say that pinching someone’s philtrum can wake them up, pinching the neck can adjust the volume, so if both are pinched at the same time, can a person take a screenshot?\" Lin Li watched the scene, then turned his head to the opposite Chen Yu Ying and seriously asked.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"Sometimes I really want to open your head and see what’s inside.\" Chen Yu Ying sighed, \"How could you come up with this stuff.\"\n\"My head’s filled with this kind of stuff.\" Lin Li pointed to the slogan on the study room wall after hearing.\n\"Reading makes you happy.\"\n\"Reading?\" Chen Yu Ying blinked.\nAlthough she thought she might already know the answer, she was reluctant to believe it.\n\"No.\"\n\"Happy?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then it must be ’makes.’\" Chen Yu Ying tried hard to avoid the correct answer.\n\"No.\"\n\"...Must be ’make,’ right.\" Chen Yu Ying sighed with a smile, not knowing whether to acknowledge Lin Li’s self-awareness.\n\"Not entirely.\" Surprisingly, Lin Li still shook his head.\n\"Huh?\" Now Chen Yu Ying was a bit puzzled.\n\"Class president, pay attention to the font color, ’make’ also has types.\" Bai Bufan, standing beside, had been itching to answer, and couldn’t resist the urge to remind.\nLooking at the yellow font, Chen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nLin Li nodded, his tone profound: \"Good reminder, different colors represent different meanings, red is destruction, blue is indifference, green is disguise, purple is mystery, orange is anger, black is homecoming, yellow is ’send me.’\nChen Yu Ying held her textbook over her face, indicating she didn’t want to converse with Lin Li.\nLin Li then resorted to teasing someone else, glancing at Bai Bufan’s dark circles from staying up late playing on the phone last night, and whispered in a voice only audible between them: \"Bufan, where does Xingtian get dark circles if he stays up late? Is this stuff considered heavy taste?\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nAs expected, this guy whispered bad things.\nLin Li’s mind is undoubtedly filled with yellow moronic stuff, an undeniable fact.\nHow he comes up with this crap-inducing question, Bai Bufan really couldn’t understand.\nHowever, an eye for an eye, Bai Bufan also asked: \"Lin Li, then let me ask you, is Newton’s glue a Newtonian fluid or a non-Newtonian fluid?\"\nThe two youths simultaneously fell into deep thought.\nTruly a stimulating thinking feast.\n...\n\"What’s for lunch?\" After successfully figuring out a certain type of question, Lin Li stretched lazily, slinging an arm over Bai Bufan’s shoulder and asking the three girls opposite.\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu had arrived relatively late, and not long after everyone was gathered, it was about time for lunch.\n\"Uh-huh, I’ve got an idea, let’s eat at this place, I’ve been wanting to go for a while!\" Ding Sihan reacted quickly with more excitement than during study.\nLin Li slightly furrowed his brow.\nDamn, is this the kind of person I lost to in exams before?\nLin Li, you’re such a loser!\n\"You two want to eat?\" The girls discussed and then asked Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\nIt’s a meat crab pot place, Lin Li nodded after looking at it: \"I’m fine with it.\"\n\"I’m also fine.\" Bai Bufan agreed.\n\"Then let’s head downstairs to the place now.\" Ding Sihan stood up excitedly, then furrowed her brow again: \"But that place is four kilometers away from us, shall we take a taxi? With five people, do we take two taxis?\"\n\"No need,\" Lin Li waved his hand, pointing at Bai Bufan: \"Bufan rode a bike here, the four of us can take taxis, he can cycle there.\"\nBai Bufan looked at the bicycle key Lin Li forced into his hand, and then looked up at Lin Li.\nLin Li smiled.\nHe smiled back.\nDamn.\nYou’re a beast.\nRemember, the beast’s language is ’act fast.’\n...\nIt’s double time, asking for monthly votes.\nor2",

      "content": "Chapter 191: Chapter 164 I Will Annoy You to Death\nLin Li eventually softened.\nFinally deciding to call two taxis, one for the girls, and the other for the non-girl creatures.\n\"Have you got your taxi? Ours is already here.\" At the library entrance, Chen Yu Ying raised her hand parallel to her forehead to shield her eyes from the sun and asked, turning back.\nWhen bending down, a leg would instinctively lift, and the graceful line would become more aesthetically pleasing.\n\"Yes, we got one.\" Lin Li signaled an OK gesture.\nThese days, hailing a taxi is indeed convenient and fast.\nLin Li still remembers when he was a child, needing to stand at a fixed location to wave down those old-fashioned taxis, some of which had a strong smell of paint inside. If there was a passenger with a heavy perfume smell carpooling, just the thought of it made Lin Li uncomfortable.\nThis situation would make one vomit, and it’s no longer a matter of getting carsick or not.\nThe phone vibrated; the ride-hailing app sent a message.\nLin Li sent an automatic reply.\nThe other side didn’t reply immediately.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou better have written it wrong.\nSoon after, a black car pulled up and turned on its hazard lights, surprisingly faster than the girls’ taxi.\nAfter confirming the license plate number, Lin Li and Bai Bufan got into the car and chose the back seat where seatbelts weren’t mandatory, waving to the girls.\n\"License plate ending in 9749.\" Lin Li immediately said proactively after getting in the car.\nThe driver entered the license plate into the app, and when the interface switched to navigation, he started the car.\n\"The characteristic isn’t wrong; you’re indeed very handsome, young man. I could see you from afar; these days, kids have really good nutrition.\"\nSome drivers are not good at chatting and prefer to drive silently, while others like to chat with passengers. This current driver clearly belonged to the latter group.\nOf course, it could also be for a good rating.\n\"Driver, do you want to solve a riddle?\" Lin Li suddenly asked enthusiastically, seemingly a bit out of sync.\n\"Sure, what’s the riddle? Tell me about it.\" The driver nodded while keeping an eye on the road, quite interested.\n\"I have long legs, guess a food item.\"\nBai Bufan raised an eyebrow and let out a contemptuous laugh as soon as he heard the riddle.\nNot knowing what kind of creature Lin Li was, the driver pondered for a long while and eventually shook his head, frowning:\n\"Young man, I can’t figure it out; tell me the answer.\"\n\"Bufan?\" Lin Li turned his head.\n\"It’s a cake, right.\" Although it was phrased as a question, the tone was clearly very confident.\n\"Bingo!\" Lin Li snapped his fingers.\n\"Cake? Why is it a cake? Oh——\" The driver first froze, then suddenly understood, and finally chuckled wryly.\nNo wonder the emphasis on ’I.\nAfter all, this riddle indeed required specifying gender to determine the answer since if it were a girl with long legs, the answer might have to change to ’ice cream’.\n\"You two are students, right? Oh boy, these days, kids’ trains of thought are hard to keep up with.\"\nThe driver shook his head, looking complex.\n\"Driver, we are not students; these school uniforms are our disguise. Our main job is hunting aliens,\" Lin Li seriously denied.\n\"Aliens? There’s no such thing as aliens in this world,\" the driver said with amusement.\n\"Haven’t you seen aliens?\" Bai Bufan took over Lin Li’s question.\n\"No, I haven’t.\"\n\"You’re welcome.\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged a mysterious smile and leaned back against the seat, looking out their respective windows.\nThe driver, witnessing this scene in the rearview mirror: \"...\"\nYou guys, damn it.\nSo, it’s because you’ve hunted all the aliens that I haven’t seen any, right?\nBut as a driver, one comes to realize the diversity of life forms. Last time, he picked up a request late at night; the client’s note mentioned picking up a drunk friend, promising to pay five hundred for vomiting in the car. He had wanted to take the booking until he discovered the destination was a funeral home.\nIt turned out they thought the funeral home’s cars were too expensive and wanted to call a taxi instead.\nCompared to that, these two kids were quite normal.\nAt a red light, the car had to stop.\n\"Do you want to listen to some music?\" Feeling a bit stuffy and having driven too long that his shoulders were sore, the driver asked.\n\"Sure.\" Lin Li nodded, having no objections.\n\"One step forward at a time, let’s get out and not have any more diary entries, let’s be affectionate, let’s be in the quilt——\" The driver took out a small microphone from the storage box next to the driver’s seat and began to perform passionately.\nLin Li, Bai Bufan: \"?\"\nLin Li finally understood; heroes are like the fish crossing the river.\nWhat the heck, is this how you listen to music?\nThe driver sings?\n\"No more, no more, Master Wu, drive safely, don’t pick up the microphone, or you’ll get points deducted if you’re caught.\" Lin Li gave up.\n\"Alright.\"\nThe driver reluctantly put down the microphone, hoping someday he would meet a passenger who appreciates music.\nSince he couldn’t sing, the driver started replying to some messages on his phone.\nThis originally had nothing to do with Lin Li, but suddenly he thought of something, squinted his eyes and said, \"Master Wu.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Didn’t you say you use handwriting?\" Lin Li asked.\nThe driver, who was typing, stopped his hands, paused for a few seconds, and hurriedly switched to the handwriting interface, beginning to clumsily write.\n\"I do use handwriting.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSo, were you just joking when you said you’d crash into me?\nNah, for singing for me, I won’t give a bad review.\nArrived at the destination, got off.\nLin Li glanced at his phone and said to Bai Bufan, \"Bufan, the fare is 13.8, you can transfer me 14, I’ll cover the remaining 20 cents myself.\"\nBai Bufan smiled, somewhat relieved.\nThis time Lin Li didn’t ask him for twenty bucks, really being considerate.\n\"Hello, how many people?\"\n\"Five people, three girls will be joining us later, please lead them to our table.\" Chen Yu Ying and the others hadn’t arrived yet, but it was unnecessary to wait at the entrance, so Lin Li responded to the staff inquiry after entering the store.\n\"Alright, this way for five people, how about this table?\" The staff led them to a square table with seating on three sides. Seeing Lin Li nod, they also introduced, \"The self-service area is over there, take a look at whatever you need and help yourself.\"\nSi Han seemed to have already ordered the set meal, so they didn’t need to look at the ordering tablet.\nBai Bufan leaned back on the sofa, suddenly grabbed Lin Li’s collar, twisted his neck to look at his own, and curiously asked, \"Lin Li, why is your school uniform collar so white? Mine’s all yellow, even after scrubbing, it’s still yellow.\"\n\"School uniforms are prone to yellowing, regular laundry detergents can’t clean them, a lot of people are troubled by this, but the problem is actually easy to solve.\" Lin Li smiled mysteriously.\n\"Teach me.\" Bai Bufan instantly became an eager student.\n\"Actually, try taking some headache medicine when washing; that way, your head won’t hurt.\" Lin Li replied.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"I asked you to solve the yellowing problem of the clothes, not the headache problem!\" Bai Bufan gave Lin Li two punches on the shoulders.\n\"Who can solve this?\" Lin Li spread his hands, indicating helplessness.\n\"Then why’s your collar so white?\" Bai Bufan became even more puzzled.\n\"My mom knows I throw everything except underwear and socks into the washer, which can’t clean them thoroughly, so she bought me two extra sets of summer uniforms for replacement. If you had two more sets to swap, they’d probably be as white as mine.\" Lin Li answered.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nThe problem seems to have been solved in an unexpected way, not quite suitable for imitation.\nAfter all, summer is almost over.\n\"Let’s go, grab some dishes.\" Lin Li stood up and led Bai Bufan to the self-service area.\nWhen the crab pot was served, it was a ’dry pot’, but once the shrimp, crab, and squid main ingredients were mostly eaten, you could add water to the leftover oily pot, turning it into a hot pot and cook vegetables or meat in it, which also tasted good.\nThis restaurant’s self-service area was quite large, offering not just condiments, appetizers, and fruits, but also some vegetarian dishes. No wonder the ’tea charge’ alone was close to twenty per person.\nReturning with a few plates of appetizers, Chen Yu Ying and the other three had already seated themselves. After placing the dishes in front of them, Lin Li planned to head back to the self-service area and asked, \"Do you guys eat mangoes? If so, I’ll bring some.\"\n\"No need, I don’t like mangoes.\" Ding Sihan waved.\n\"Wasn’t asking you.\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"I was asking, just so you know, the mangoes I mentioned are already peeled and seeded by the restaurant.\" Lin Li explained with a smile to Ding Sihan’s resentful gaze.\n\"Then I want to eat, I love mangoes the most.\" Ding Sihan quickly changed her mind.\nSo relatable.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan went back and forth several times, bringing back a lot of dishes.\nThe ordered crab pot and other individually ordered meat dishes had already started coming out one after another.\nIt’s coming out so fast, could they be pre-made dishes?\nWatching Chen Yu Ying sipping juice, Lin Li suddenly spoke: \"Class Rep, a bottle filled with rocks can still be filled with water, but a bottle filled with water can’t fit a rock. Do you know what this tells us?\"\n\"Hmm?\" Chen Yu Ying put down the cup, tilted her head slightly, her long hair falling from her neck, and asked confusedly, \"Isn’t this an elementary school question, telling us life needs gaps for sunlight to enter?\"\nVery philosophical, but Lin Li shook his head.\nLin Li turned to look at Qu Wanqiu.\n\"Don’t make sweeping statements, don’t act too extreme?\"\nLin Li again shook his head, turning to Ding Sihan.\n\"Don’t add ice when drinking, it’s a rip-off. Here I specifically mention a coffee shop that fills two-thirds of your cup with ice.\"\nLin Li felt somewhat gratified but still shook his head, finally setting his sights on Bai Bufan, whom he held high hopes for.\n\"Class Rep, Lin Li means since we’re having a buffet, don’t drink drinks first.\" Bai Bufan laughed confidently, giving the answer.\n\"Clap!\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s palms slapped together, \"You get me!\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nShe blinked, didn’t say anything, and quietly took another sip.\nHumph, I’ll just drink it.",

Even if it’s pre-made food, it’s top-notch pre-made food.\n\"It’d be great if Bao Wei were here; he’d probably finish off all the crab shells.\"\n\"Forget the crab shells! I bet Bao Wei would lick clean the black oxidation stains left at the bottom of the pan from high heat.\"\nFull and satisfied, Lin Li and Bai Bufan walked behind the three girls, teasing the absent Zhou Baowei.\nThat’s how it is between bros; if you’re not here, you’re fair game for ribbing.\nLin Li couldn’t imagine what kind of persona he’d have in the dorm when Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei chat without him.\n\"Should we get something to drink?\"\nNot rushing to hail a cab back to the library, Qu Wanqiu pointed to a milk tea shop across the street and said to the group behind her.\n\"Sure.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded and then turned to Lin Li, \"Lin Li, I still owe you a fruit tea. How about I buy it now?\"\n\"Okay.\"\nThe group headed over.\nIn front of the milk tea shop, after Lin Li told Chen Yu Ying what he planned to drink, he noticed Ding Sihan silently refusing to order, and asked, \"What are you doing, Ding Sihan?\"\n\"Don’t disturb me; there are two little people fighting in my mind right now.\" Ding Sihan gestured for silence, looking hesitant and conflicted.\n\"Just drink! It’s okay. You’re planning to study for a day; how can you not have a milk tea to satisfy your craving? This is a power-up station...\" Lin Li, hearing this, immediately morphed into the devil and began whispering sinisterly in Ding Sihan’s ear.\nBai Bufan glanced over, the Sword Tomb is indeed the Sword Tomb.\nThen, though not daring to come closer, he stood in place and loudly echoed, \"Yes! Absolutely! Everyone’s drinking; why not join in.\"\nFeeling annoyed, Ding Sihan distanced herself from the approaching Lin Li and said disdainfully, \"I never said I wouldn’t drink.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Then why are those two little people in your head fighting? Just playing around?\" Lin Li was puzzled.\n\"Because one says to add coconut jelly, and the other says to add milk foam,\" Ding Sihan explained matter-of-factly.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSo the two are demons battling it out, with no angels involved at all?\nI’m defeated.\n\"So what’s the verdict? Haven’t settled it yet?\" Lin Li sighed and asked.\n\"They reached a draw and signed a non-aggression pact, so...\" Ding Sihan sighed and stepped forward, \"Hello, I’d like a double mix passion fruit with coconut jelly and milk foam.\"\nOnly children make choices; adults don’t get options, and teenagers truly can have it all.\nLin Li smiled contentedly.\nWhen I get married, Ding Sihan, you’ll be at the same table as Bao Wei.\n...\nThe five of them, carrying milk teas and fruit teas, returned to the study room at the library to start their afternoon of learning.\n\"Wow, it’s a bit cold.\"\nThe air conditioning in the afternoon was noticeably stronger than in the morning, so the only one without a jacket, Bai Bufan, rubbed his goosebumps and complained to Lin Li.\n\"I reminded you, didn’t I? Why didn’t you bring a jacket?\" Lin Li frowned.\nTrying to act tough? Now you’re paying for it?\n\"When did you remind me?\" Bai Bufan was shocked; then he checked his chat history and found only where Lin Li teased him in the morning, frowning, \"There’s nothing.\"\nLin Li pondered for a moment.\nOh, he had only reminded the group.\n\"Then guess not.\" Lin Li nodded sincerely.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"What do you mean ’then guess not’? You had that ’you deserve it’ look just now, and you still have it now? Aren’t you taking any responsibility?\"\nFacing such questioning, Lin Li got up, took off his jacket, and under Bai Bufan’s grateful gaze, put it back on himself.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" Lin Li sat down naturally and innocently looked at Bai Bufan staring at him, \"Did you think I was going to give it to you? If I give it to you, what am I supposed to wear?\"\nBai Bufan declared that Lin Li was not a nice guy and didn’t rank behind him.\nWith Bai Bufan’s gnashing of teeth, Lin Li sighed again, got up, and soon returned, handing him a paper cup: \"Then don’t drink the iced milk tea, drink this instead.\"\nBai Bufan picked it up, took a sip, and immediately became agitated: \"Ah~~ What’s this~~ Ah~~ What did you give me~~ Why is my body getting so hot~~\"\nFeeling the three girls across beginning to watch him with wary eyes, Lin Li truly felt like grabbing Bai Bufan’s collar.\n\"It’s hot water, I added hot water.\"\nNow the three girls were no longer cautious, but looked at Bai Bufan as if he were mentally disturbed.\n...\nLin Li’s jacket eventually was shared between the two, or Bai Bufan would threaten to hang himself in the study room.\nThe afternoon was spent in earnest study.\nComing to the library to study as a group was indeed meaningful for Lin Li.\nPreviously, when studying alone, he’d look around and see only Bai Bufan not studying attentively or not studying at all, which basically had no pressure on Lin Li and didn’t serve as any kind of incentive.\nBut now, looking up, he saw three girls studying diligently, which was quite motivating to study harder.\nThe mood was better.\nBefore, only looking at Bai Bufan, what the hell kind of dreary days were those.\nMoreover, when facing problems, at home, he’d need to take out his phone to consult the class leader, but this wouldn’t guarantee a timely response, and Lin Li was easily ’accidentally’ distracted by social media or short video platforms.\nBut in the library, when you have questions, there’s no need for a smartphone as an intermediary. If you don’t understand something, just reach out and tap on the desk in front of Chen Yu Ying.\nA pretty girl teaching you in person is a hundred times better than a beautiful dealer dealing cards online. One! Hundred! Times!\nSo Lin Li straightforwardly threw his damn smartphone into the trash can—just a stumbling block on the learning path. If Bai Bufan hadn’t said it was unnecessary, Lin Li would have stomped on it twice.\nBai Bufan’s study efficiency was even more ridiculously enhanced.\nAfter all, when faced with bad temptations, others say no, but Bai Bufan says it’s not enough.\nIf anyone disturbed him from doing serious work, he would play along with them, and if they saw Bai Bufan wave his hand, it wasn’t a refusal; it was self-explanatory.\nThus, Bai Bufan’s efficiency in studying at the library increased even more than Lin Li’s.\nBesides, there’s another very important factor: the phone Lin Li threw in the trash was his own.\nHe has nothing to distract him.\nDamn, Lin Li is truly a beast, even wanting to stomp on it twice.\n...\nUnknowingly, it was already getting dark outside.\nThis time, since there wasn’t a specific place they wanted to eat, the group just had a simple bowl of noodles near the library.\n\"Let’s take a walk and have a break. Combine work and rest, I don’t really feel like going back to study right now.\" Ding Sihan took big strides ahead, stretched her body after interlocking her hands above her head, and said to the others.\n\"I think that’s a good idea.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nReturning to the library only to throw your phone back into the trash can—although Lin Li was doing it for his own good, this beast was also being bad for his own good.\nMoreover, studying for too long can lead to diminishing returns, and the concept of combining work and rest is inherently meaningful.\n\"Sure thing,\" Lin Li agreed indifferently.\nHe was also a bit tired from studying.\nNow all he sees are science problems, whether his eyes are open or closed.\nIndeed, the journey of the first hundred questions is long and arduous.\nThe infrastructure around the county library is quite complete, with two parks nearby, a gymnasium, a swimming pool in the area, and a commercial complex.\n\"There’s a musical fountain every weekend night at Nanxin Lake Park. Let’s go check it out.\" Ding Sihan suggested.\nThe group had no objections, so they slowly headed in that direction.\n\"Class rep, do you know what this sign means?\"\nOriginally walking behind with Bai Bufan while scanning the surroundings, Lin Li suddenly stepped forward and said to Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Hmm?\" Chen Yu Ying looked in the direction Lin Li pointed, recognizing it as a traffic sign. After looking at it for a while, she shook her head, \"I don’t know.\"\n\"This is called ’No Overtaking.’ Now you know,\" Lin Li said.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nTurns out, Lin Li wasn’t trying to ask her; he was trying to teach her?\n\"Oh.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nLin Li wasn’t asking without reason; the progress of task two had just slightly increased again.\nIndeed, teaching Chen Yu Ying about automotive theories is part of the mecha insights, and the growth rate is faster than race car driving.\n\"This safety sign means ’No Bicycles on Upgrades,’ that one means ’No Long-term Parking for Vehicles,’ and that one indicates ’Roundabout Ahead’...\"\nGiven this, with nothing better to do while walking, Lin Li began to ramble from the back.\n\"Lin Li, how do you know so much?\" Although Chen Yu Ying wasn’t really interested, since it was Lin Li who said it, she didn’t mind listening. After a while, she curiously asked, \"Are you planning to take the driving test as soon as you turn adult this year?\"\nLin Li gave a proud smile, ready to start bluffing, but beside him, Bai Bufan glanced at Lin Li’s phone and scoffed, \"Because he just searched it up.\"\nAfraid Chen Yu Ying wouldn’t believe it, Bai Bufan even turned Lin Li’s phone around, showing the search history.\n\"What traffic safety signs have bicycles on them?\"\n\"What do the three looped arrows signify?\"\nLin Li indeed just searched it up. After all, he didn’t plan to take the driving test immediately after turning adult, so how could he have the free time to memorize these things?\nChen Yu Ying blinked, with a slightly amused expression.\nThis amusement was obviously stolen from Lin Li’s face.\nChen Yu Ying is a thief, Chen Yu Ying is bad.\n\"Class rep, turn your head back. The upcoming scenes involve blood and violence, don’t look.\" Lin Li said with a smile to Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Oh.\" Chen Yu Ying obediently turned her head as told.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Don’t turn, class rep, turn back to look at me once more? Class rep, class rep?\" Bai Bufan begged.\nIn fact, Chen Yu Ying paid more attention to Lin Li’s words.\nFaced with Lin Li’s relentless approach, Bai Bufan gave an awkward smile.\nIn theory, when an enemy approaches, the best way to deal with it is to strike back, right?\nBut right now didn’t seem the right time to strike back, so Bai Bufan looked around and quickly shifted the topic, pointing at Lin Li’s phone with its various search results of traffic signs, he said:\n\"Lin Li, have you noticed that the little dumb black figures doing these stupid things on the signs are... Ah!!!\"\nLin Li didn’t have the time to be a racial knight; he planned to be a Bufan knight first.\nBai Bufan: Got wrecked (sad).\n...\nContinue asking for monthly tickets.\nAntenna: Got wrecked (happy).",

      "content": "Chapter 193: Chapter 166: Devoting My Youth to You\n\"You’re right, they’re all little black people. Has Lao Da been silently protecting us this whole time with this method? Is there a safety warning sign for low-flying helicopters?\"\nLin Li looked at the sign with those black figures and said emotionally.\nCovered in dust, Bai Bufan widened his eyes at Lin Li, wondering how this guy could seamlessly transition back to a conversation he started after tormenting him. Was him hitting me just going to be brushed off so easily?\nIt seemed like it really was.\nPatience. The day I succeed in quitting my habits will be the day Lin Li faces his end.\nWill I win? I will win.\nHating by association, Bai Bufan brushed off the dust and sneered, \"People like you see a black person and only think of Kobe’s joke ’Little Ghost Riot.’ Lao Da has 5 championships, 2 FMVPs, 1 MVP, and 30,000 points. Who are you, anyway?\"\n\"I’m alive.\" Lin Li replied calmly.\n\"...\"\nThe sudden yet serious reply made Bai Bufan laugh out loud.\n\"Haha, what a coincidence, so am I.\" Glancing aside, Bai Bufan pointed to a spot not far away, \"But there’s really a 24 over there.\"\nOver by Nanxin Lake Park, there’s a lit basketball court where the sound of sneakers rubbing against the ground, basketballs bouncing, and guys shouting could be heard faintly.\nWhat Bai Bufan was pointing at was someone playing basketball in an iced tea jersey among them.\n\"Damn it, anyone daring to play on an outdoor public court has to have great skills. I wouldn’t dare to embarrass myself in public like that.\"\nWatching from a distance, Bai Bufan did his signature air fadeaway jump shot, saying enviously.\nThough Lin Li and Bai Bufan were among the tallest in class 1-4, Bai Bufan’s basketball skills were average, and Lin Li’s were terrible.\nLin Li would only play with his classmates during PE class, usually when playing half-court 3-on-3, where he’d be dragged to the inside due to his height to grab rebounds.\nBecause his athletic ability was lacking, he couldn’t grab rebounds that well, and now his level was unknown.\nAs for the phrase, \"You’re so tall, why don’t you play basketball?\" Lin Li was tired of hearing it.\nStrolling is strolling no matter where, and after hearing what Lin Li and Bai Bufan said, plus knowing the fountain starts at the exact hour, they weren’t in a hurry, so the girls leading them slightly changed direction toward the court.\nThey watched through the wire fence, put up to prevent balls from rolling onto the road, looking at the people inside sweating it out.\nNumber 24 moved quite cleanly, a bit out of character.\n\"Damn, what a winner in life... I wonder whose girlfriend she is, being so pretty,\" Bai Bufan said enviously, looking at a woman sitting on the bench next to the court, assumed to be a player’s girlfriend.\n\"Get over your fear of girls first, then think about that,\" Lin Li said with a laugh.\n\"How’s Feifei doing? After the monthly exams, she’ll probably be out soon, right?\" Bai Bufan asked with a deep tone.\n\"Who’s Feifei?\" Qu Wanqiu asked curiously, as Bai Bufan hadn’t lowered his voice much.\n\"Someone we’ll never see again.\"\n\"... I’m sorry.\"\nBai Bufan let out a long sigh, relieved she didn’t continue to ask.\n\"Being good at basketball really adds a lot of points,\" Ding Sihan placed her hand on the wire fence, looking at the court with a yearning expression, \"I think every girl has fantasized about a scene where a tall and handsome guy accidentally hits her with a ball and then compensates her with an entire bright youth.\"\n\"A shot put?\" Lin Li inquired.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nThe love story instantly became a murder mystery.\n\"... A basketball!\" Ding Sihan corrected.\n\"But a basketball wouldn’t land you in jail, right? To spend your whole youth in jail as punishment seems way too harsh. It feels wronged just thinking about it,\" Lin Li said, feeling even more puzzled, \"Ding Sihan, won’t you provide a letter of forgiveness? You’re being a bit unreasonable.\"\nDing Sihan looked at Lin Li, her face turning red.\nFrom anger.\nShe took a deep breath, pointing her finger vigorously at Lin Li, speaking in frustration, \"Lin Li! You atmosphere breaker! You really don’t get romance at all! Compensating with one’s youth is metaphorical, not literal! Your immediate task is to read more love stories to cultivate your emotional intelligence and sense of romance!\nOtherwise, you’re destined to die alone!\"\nChen Yu Ying’s gaze followed the distant basketball, watching it swish through the net with a pleasant sound, and listening to the conversations from both sides, she covered her mouth and chuckled softly.\nLin Li was probably doing it on purpose. After all, Lin Li wouldn’t be Lin Li if he weren’t cheeky. Si Han actually understood; no matter how annoyed she looked now, she wasn’t actually bothered by it. In private, she’d said many good things about Lin Li to her numerous times, finding him quite interesting.\nThinking about it, keeping a Lin Li around would indeed be amusing, wouldn’t it?\n\"Love stories? I read them often. I even have a particularly memorable one right now. Do you want me to share it with you?\" Lin Li thought for a moment, then held up an index finger like a lightbulb moment.\nThe three girls all turned their heads to look at Lin Li. Although they knew Lin Li probably wouldn’t tell a good love story, they were still curious and urged him, \"Let’s hear it.\"\n\"Once there was a depressed Bai Bufan who really liked a tree. He confessed to the tree, but the tree didn’t give a definite answer and just kept stringing him along.\" Lin Li’s love story was short, summarized in one sentence.\nWhat a tragic love story.\nBai, Chen, Ding, Qu: \"...\"\nChen Yu Ying pursed her lips, then turned her head and buried her face in Ding Sihan’s shoulder, her body shaking slightly.\nWah wah wah, all the good karma I’ve accumulated over the past fifteen years will be deducted now that I’ve gotten to know Lin Li.\nLin Li is so annoying.\n\"After hearing that, I have a love story too.\" Bai Bufan raised an index finger like a lightbulb moment and said, drawing lessons from Lin Li, \"Once there was an adventurous Lin Li who encountered a snake during his explorations. The snake liked Lin Li but was rejected. Yet the snake refused to give up, so it kept clinging to him.\"\nHearing this, Lin Li turned his head, giving Bai Bufan a knowing look, and the two of them exchanged a mutual high-five.\nI am not alone in my path.\n\"There’s another love story. Do you want to hear it?\" Lin Li asked, smiling gleefully, once the three had recovered.\n\"No, no, we’re not listening! What you said is not a love story at all!\" Ding Sihan firmly covered her ears and shook her head.\nLin Li, a bit unwilling, wanted to continue talking, unable to bear the silence, thus he added, \"This time it’s about a fairy tale, and the ending is that the princess and the prince live happily ever after together, and it’s genuinely and purely happy. I swear.\"\nDing Sihan squinted her eyes, looking somewhat skeptical at Lin Li. It was hard for her to imagine such a fairy tale from Lin Li’s mouth, although she knew curiosity could be detrimental, she couldn’t help but nod:\n\"I’ll trust you once more. Go ahead.\"\n\"One day, an old man and an old woman were boating on the lake, the old woman accidentally fell into the lake.\nAt this moment, a goddess rose from the lake and asked the old man, ’Was it a princess or an old woman who fell in just now?’ The old man honestly replied it was the old woman, so the goddess was delighted ’You are truly an honest person, so I’ll give you a princess.’\nAfter the princess appeared, she immediately kicked the old man off the boat.\nAt this moment, a goddess rose from the lake and asked the princess, ’Was it a prince or an old man who fell in just now?’ The princess also honestly replied it was the old man, so the goddess was delighted ’You are truly an honest person, so I’ll give you a prince.’\nFrom then on, the princess and the prince lived happily ever after, until forever.\"\nLin Li narrated the story with a smile that carried a fairy tale-like charm, conveying this happily ever after story.\nBai, Chen, Ding, Qu: \"...\"\nThe ending seems pretty happy, but it somehow feels off.\n\"What happened to the old man and the old woman?\" Qu Wanqiu asked.\n\"Blub blub blub.\" Lin Li immediately made the sound effects.\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nDamn it, blub blub blub, the scene of sinking to the bottom has been fully imagined.\nAlso turned into silt to breed more fish.\n\"Ah ah ah!\" Ding Sihan started to smack her lips, \"I let you want to hear Lin Li’s story! I let you want to hear Lin Li’s story! My mind is all polluted! You truly deserve it!\"\n\"Teacher Ding, don’t do that! Teacher Ding, don’t do that!\" Lin Li tried his best to stop the words with encouragement.\nLike this, one wouldn’t be beaten to death.\nAfter watching for a while, the five left the public court; before they left, someone approached, asking Lin Li and Bai Bufan if they wanted to join in the game, probably because they were short of players.\nThere are still many good people on the court.\nIf the invitation was not focused on Chen Yu Ying, Lin Li might have gone up to make a fool of himself.\nThis time he narrowly avoided an elbow.\nThe court was near the park, so they arrived at the park area in no time.\nThe park is bustling, completely unmatched by Lin Li’s neighborhood park. Many people here set up stalls selling food, decorations, toys, and even phone cases and screen protectors. On the central stone plaza, there’s even large toy cars for children to drive.\nMany kids on the plaza are launching flashing shuttlecocks or bamboo dragonflies into the sky.\nThat vibrant, everything-competitive scene remains vividly in front of us.\nBecause the main purpose was to see the musical fountain, the group crossed the plaza, heading towards Nanxin Lake.\n\"There’s a contact lens stall over there. Why not take a look?\" On the way to the target, inevitably encountering thorns, halfway through the plaza, Ding Sihan suggested.\nThen they changed direction.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan also followed, but their eyes constantly focused on the large toy cars on the plaza, exchanged glances, nodded simultaneously: \"Want to drive.\"\nEspecially since driving also meant bumping into other little friends; if only the car seats were bigger, the two would have eagerly gone to bully the kids.\nWhat a pity.\nBai Bufan looked at other stalls, and Lin Li’s attention returned to the contact lens stall. After a few glances, he felt confused.\nAre these contact lens colors actually created by humans?\nShark Tears, Basque Ice Blue, Sky Grey, Electric Purple, Bionic Green.\nThose who can see these names and imagine the corresponding contact lens colors must be geniuses.\n\"Which color do you all think looks best?\" Qu Wanqiu picked and chose, curiously asking everyone’s opinions.\n\"Sky Grey.\" \"Peacock Brown.\" \"Royal Purple.\" \"Snail Rice Noodles.\"\nThe gaze of the three girls and the stall owner all sharply turned to Lin Li, the atmosphere disruptor.\nHe had just said ’Snail Rice Noodles.’\nLin Li raised his hands and stepped back two paces, showing surrender.\n\"Lin Li, Lin Li, come look, there’s a story!\" Bai Bufan suddenly excitedly waved to Lin Li from not far away, signaling for him to come over.\nLin Li walked over and asked, \"What’s up?\"\n\"Look at this!\" Bai Bufan lowered his voice and pointed to a stall.\nIt seemed to focus on textiles, taking orders for clothing alterations, fabric sales, repairs, and what Bai Bufan pointed out was an addition to the stall, a conspicuous note, saying ’Please clean the crotch area before bringing it in for sewing, thanks for your cooperation.’\nLin Li stared for two seconds, then lowered his voice and began to laugh wildly.\nBehind every rule hides a story untold,\nWhen Aunty bites the thread, the sky probably collapsed.",

      "content": "Chapter 194: Chapter 167: Countless Light Sources Bring Countless Shadows\nBecause the music fountain has a fixed schedule, the girls didn’t spend too long at the stalls or browse other ones.\nThese little stalls without storefronts sell disposable colored contacts for four to five yuan apiece, even monthly ones with fragrance.\nThe fountain happens every weekend, except for special holidays, and the content is the same, so there’s no big crowd gathering by the fence to wait in advance. Instead, the upper steps of the square become the best viewing spot.\n\"Let’s sit here.\" After confirming their view wouldn’t be obstructed, Lin Li pointed to a row of steps and said.\nBai Bufan sat down.\n\"Forget it, let’s change spots.\" Lin Li changed his mind again.\nBai Bufan got up with an annoyed look on his face, then watched as Lin Li pushed him aside and sat in the spot he just occupied.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDo you have to use your pants to wipe the dust off the ground first?\n\"Give me back my spot!\"\n\"I’ve got tissues...\" Girls always carry tissues, Chen Yu Ying said with amusement as she watched the two suddenly start a playful fight.\n\"A paper-wiped surface isn’t as fragrant as one wiped by Bai Bufan’s pants!\" But Lin Li simply ignored her.\n\"Ship it.\" Qu Wanqiu looked at the two with good-natured anticipation, hoping for more dramatic events.\n\"Shipping everything will only harm you.\" Ding Sihan sighed, shaking her head, still more devoted.\nIn the end, Lin Li’s behind won.\nThe five of them sat side by side on the steps.\nBai Bufan was to Lin Li’s left, Chen Yu Ying to his right.\n\"Woof woof woof.\"\nNext to him, Bai Bufan used a little canine summoning trick to call over a stray dog that seemed to be a frequent at Nanxin Lake Park.\nThough it was a mongrel, it was of decent appearance, its fur quite shiny, likely cared for by someone regularly, and was not afraid of people. Hearing its kind’s call, it eagerly came over, warmly letting Bai Bufan pat its head, sniff around him, and even tried to shake hands.\n\"Remember to wash your hands after petting a dog, especially one that’s not clean, or it could make you sick.\" The scene was cozy, but amidst the warmth, Lin Li reminded.\n\"Got it——\" Bai Bufan was just about to nod, then saw Lin Li go up and hug the dog, taking it to the public sink to wash its paws.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nWait, let me think.\nWasn’t the one supposed to wash hands himself?\nWas the unclean thing referenced just now actually him?\nWell.\nWatching the dog being taken to wash up by Lin Li, the girls laughed.\nDing Sihan felt fortunate she hadn’t hurriedly greeted the dog earlier, otherwise, Lin Li’s teasing might have been directed at her.\nBecause there were many people around and they were in school uniforms, it wouldn’t be too embarrassing. When Lin Li returned, Bai Bufan didn’t curse out loud but rather mouthed an elaborate family tree for Lin Li.\nLin Li pretended not to see it this time, just saying not to curse next time.\nWith still five or six minutes left before the fountain show commenced, the five sat together, enjoying the cool evening breeze, feeling the tousle of hair on their foreheads, and listening to the whispering conversations around them.\nEven without looking at their phones, squinting, it’s even more comfortable than sitting in the library with air conditioning. If summer nights were always like this, they would be worth cherishing, right?\nMaybe because you have to study while in the library.\n\"Splash.\" Sound of water splashing.\n\"What fell down, was it a rock?\" Bai Bufan looked up to ask.\n\"Not sure, maybe a frog.\" Lin Li lazily squinted, too comfortable to open his eyes, shrugging indifferently.\n\"Oh.\"\n\"Bufan, let me quiz you, who’s the best diving duo in the world?\" Lin Li suddenly asked.\n\"Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi?\" Bai Bufan answered.\n\"Nope, it’s your girlfriend and mom.\" Lin Li provided the correct answer.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nThe three girls who overheard laughed aloud.\n\"Lin Li, here’s the question: your girlfriend and mom both fall in the water, and you can only save one, who do you save?\" Ding Sihan asked.\n\"Mom.\" Lin Li answered without much thought.\n\"Aww, such a good son, Mom’s proud.\" Ding Sihan was moved to tears.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nNot quite sisterly.\n\"Then Mom, could you demonstrate a fall into the water with Ding Sihan, and I’ll see who I save?\" Lin Li sincerely asked Ding Sihan.\n\"No way.\"\nDing Sihan proudly turned her head, already victorious, she wouldn’t fall for that.\n\"Inventing such questions is truly either stupid or malicious, just to ruin relationships.\"\nLin Li earnestly evaluated this category of questions.\nThe whole day is filled with hypotheticals. If you’re so free, why not go plow two miles of field for the old ox?\n\"Hey, let’s change the scenario. Lin Li, if your best buddy and your girlfriend both fell into the water, and you could only save one, who would you save?\" But Ding Sihan was still pushing for an answer.\nBai Bufan sighed.\nAt a time like this, as the understanding friend, I should probably tie a stone to my leg and sink myself first.\n\"Before I answer that question, can you explain why my buddy would be with my girlfriend, and why they’d fall into the water at the same time? I feel like I’m being betrayed, so I won’t save either. They can both die for all I care.\"\nHowever, unlike how Bai Bufan imagined, Lin Li narrowed his eyes and spoke in a cold voice.\nDing Sihan: \"Eh?\"\nBai Bufan: \"Uh-huh!\"\n\"Sounds like a bargain!\" Bai Bufan suddenly spoke up cheerfully, only to receive an elbow jab from Lin Li.\n\"What if it’s just a regular fall into the water?\" Ding Sihan continued to ask.\n\"I’ll recite pi backwards for my buddy.\" Lin Li chuckled.\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Ding Sihan didn’t understand.\n\"I’ll entertain him, so if he dies, it’s no big deal.\" Lin Li explained.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"You sure do know how to entertain,\" Ding Sihan couldn’t argue with that.\nAmidst the laughter, with a \"whoosh\" sound, a water column rose from the center of Nanxin Lake, and the surrounding lights lit up.\nThe night fell, and the city lights came on.\nThe music started, and the fountain show began. Passersby who had already seen it gradually gathered around again.\nThe lights and water screen wove into flowing paintings.\nUnder the glow of the lights, the water splashes transformed into brilliant colors, sometimes like delicate ribbons dancing in the air, sometimes like flames leaping in the sky.\nChen Yu Ying’s clear eyes reflected all of this. She didn’t record it on her phone, just quietly watched the scene.\n\"Watch out!\"\nUntil an urgent shout came from behind her.\nChen Yu Ying turned her head. It turned out to be a shuttlecock flying toward her. It was gleaming and a bit dazzling as it got closer. Although the top wasn’t sharp, it would definitely hurt if it hit her head.\nShe saw it clearly because the shuttlecock stopped quietly in front of her, caught by a hand from beside her without even looking back.\nChen Yu Ying tilted her head and looked at Lin Li. Under the lights of the musical fountain, his jawline seemed even sharper.\nWas it her imagination, or did Lin Li look even more handsome?\nLin Li was still watching the fountain, his eyes reflecting the neon lights, but Chen Yu Ying suddenly found it amusing, especially noticing his seemingly proud lips as she said:\n\"Don’t pretend anymore; it’s getting too deliberate.\"\n\"Class rep! Wasn’t that awesome? I caught it without even turning my head! Saved your life! So cool, really so cool! Can we adjust a satellite to send me this video? I want to make it a QR code and engrave it on my tombstone!\"\nOriginally wanting to stay cool and stylish, Lin Li couldn’t help but turn his head proudly, self-praising with a fluctuating tone.\nThis was the real Lin Li.\nCoolness had nothing to do with him.\n\"Wow! So cool!!\" Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu, seeing Lin Li break his cool facade, immediately exclaimed in an overly dramatic voice.\n\"So-so.\"\nLin Li seemed to ignore the intentional tone, gesturing for them to stop the praise while his expression urged them to continue.\nBy then, the culprit and his guardian had already rushed over, and the guardian quickly apologized: \"Sorry, sorry, the kid got the direction wrong while playing. We’re really sorry, are you hurt? Come on, apologize to the brother and sister!\"\n\"S-sorry.\"\n\"Class rep, what do you think? Should we make him pay with his youth?\" Lin Li whispered.\nDing Sihan, standing next to him, rolled her eyes. Could Lin Li make a comeback from this?\n\"What’s there to pay for?\" Chen Yu Ying laughed and scolded, shaking her head at the apologizing adult and child: \"It’s okay, no one got hurt.\"\nSince it wasn’t about unruly kids or irresponsible parents, it was indeed just a small accident without any real consequence, no point in making a fuss. Lin Li also returned the shuttlecock to them.\nA harmless disturbance.\nThe show continued.\nThe music reached a climax, and so did the fountain, sending high jets of water into the air like rockets, commanding attention.\nThen, the water splashes descended at a nearly touchable speed, creating layers of white mist, resembling a fairyland.\nChen Yu Ying was still gazing at the highest point reached by the water column just now.\nWhy should the one who got hit have to pay with their youth? Can’t they be a bit more shameless?\nIn the lake.\nOn both sides of the lake shore, dazzling neons lit up, the water columns burst forth sequentially.\nOn the shore.\nThe shadows nestled close together.",

Just as short as Lin Li.\" Retracting his hand and ignoring Lin Li’s scream and the girl who didn’t know what happened, Bai Bufan reluctantly looked at the lake.\nUnwilling to part with this beautiful time without having to study.\nBut the break was indeed long enough, so the five of them obediently returned to the library to continue studying.\n...\nThe melodious music rang punctually at 8:50, echoing throughout the library.\nThe library would close at 9:00, and it was time to start clearing out.\n\"Carpet, carpet, ’car’ is car, ’pet’ is pet, and when a car runs over a pet, it’s flattened into a carpet, nice!\"\nWith Lin Li’s help, knowledge entered Bai Bufan’s brain in a strange way.\nNow if you asked Bai Bufan how to spell ’tadpole’ or ’inheritance,’ he could answer with precision.\n\"The craziest learning day ever, I’m really fully loaded.\" Bai Bufan exhaled deeply, placing the textbook on his head, according to his theory, this way knowledge would enter the brain with the help of gravity.\nThen Bai Bufan suddenly sat up straight, dug out his phone from the trash can, and pulled Lin Li over: \"Come on, Lin Li, let’s record a video.\"\n\"Who are you planning to disgust?\" Lin Li immediately saw through the intention.\n\"Of course, it’s for Zhou Baowei.\"\n\"Then I’ve got to support that.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up, eagerly participating in the filming of the video.\n「Zhou Baowei: Are you all fucking crazy, studying in the library till now? Having answers crammed in your minds for exams, how is this different from cheating? Wanna have a fair and square luck contest with me or not?」\nSeeing such a response, both of them were very satisfied.\nThen Lin Li looked up at Qu Wanqiu across from him and asked, \"Qu Wanqiu, are you coming to study at the library tomorrow?\"\n\"Hm? What are you up to?\" Qu Wanqiu, who was packing her bag, immediately clutched her bag upon hearing this, looking at Lin Li warily and scanning him up and down.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThat kind of look could be a bit hurtful.\n\"No, this time, I’m not planning on being cheeky. It’s just if you’re coming, then I’ll come with you to the library, and that way, I can ask you if I don’t understand something, and you can ask me to type questions for the class monitor if you get stuck.\" Lin Li explained.\nHe simply acknowledged the library’s study efficiency.\nBesides, Qu Wanqiu’s science grades were decent, and since Chen Yu Ying couldn’t come tomorrow, she could completely fill in as a substitute.\n\"Oh, sure.\" Qu Wanqiu casually nodded.\n\"Okay, I’ll still get up early to save a seat tomorrow, just send me a message if you’re coming.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nHaving prepared for a conversation, Ding Sihan heavily cleared his throat as he watched Lin Li, who just lowered his head to pack his bag after speaking.\n\"The trash can’s here, you’ve already retrieved your phone, feel free to spit.\" Lin Li nudged the trash can over to the other side with his foot.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"What about me, what about me? Why aren’t you asking if I’m coming tomorrow!\" Ding Sihan patted the table and said.\n\"Losing you as my study partner is like a fish losing a bicycle.\" Lin Li didn’t fully raise his head but pretended he had glasses and nudged them down, looking disdainfully at Ding Sihan.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nSuch words could be very hurtful.\n\"What about me, what about me.\" Bai Bufan rushed over to join in on the scolding.\n\"The sprinting world lost Hawking; you’re even less useful than Ding Sihan, more like a stumbling block.\" Naturally, Lin Li showed no mercy.\n\"Not so far off, right? I must have some advantages over Ding Sihan, right?\" Bai Bufan disagreed.\n\"Oh—Ding Sihan, Bufan thinks he’s better than you,\" Lin Li immediately repeated Bai Bufan’s words loudly, then instigated, \"Is that so? Then tell us, where are you better than Ding Sihan?\"\nBored, Lin Li wanted to see bloodshed.\nDing Sihan’s eyes were locked onto Bai Bufan.\n\"In interpersonal relationships, my desk mate dares to eat shit, how about yours?\" Bai Bufan had a ’Lin Li, you finally took the bait’ look on his face, and said it loudly.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nChen Yu Ying heard this and laughed while looking at Lin Li, thinking to herself, it’s no wonder they became best desk mates, their thinking aligns in such unique ways.\n\"Not a chance.\" Ding Sihan conceded.\n\"My desk mate dares to drink urine, how about yours?\" Bai Bufan grew more daring.\n\"Not a chance.\"\n\"My desk mate dares to mmm—breathe—I can’t breathe——\"\nBai Bufan grabbed at the jacket suddenly covering his head completely, struggling for a breath of fresh air.\n...\n\"How is everyone getting home?\" Lin Li asked the group as they took the elevator down.\n\"My dad’s picking me up by car.\" Chen Yu Ying answered.\n\"It’s just a ten-minute walk home from here, walking back is fine.\" Ding Sihan pointed in a direction.\n\"Walking back.\" The school wasn’t far from the library either, about a twenty-minute walk, so Bai Bufan and Qu Wanqiu replied the same way.\n\"We’re just dispersing like this? Not hanging out a bit more?\" After everyone spoke, Ding Sihan began to coax everyone into playing for a bit longer.\n\"The school gates close at ten, do you want them sleeping on the street?\" Lin Li glanced at Ding Sihan.\n\"They could just sleep over at my place, we’ve got a guest room.\" Ding Sihan hugged Qu Wanqiu, and after remembering there was also Bai Bufan, added after pondering for a moment while looking at him, \"And, there’s an extra bathroom.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nNot even willing to offer the living room, huh.\nLin Li gave a thumbs up.\n\"Never mind, I’ll just go back to the dormitory.\" Qu Wanqiu waved it off.\n\"Darn it, mainly because my parents will probably be back around midnight, I’ll be so bored and lonely by myself.\" Ding Sihan sighed before wailing.\n\"If you feel lonely alone, why not turn off the light and watch a horror film, after a while, you’ll feel as if there’s someone in the kitchen, someone in the bathroom, someone under the bed, maybe even... someone inside the cement walls...\nHave you watched Conan? There might just be a corpse placed on top of our elevator right now.\"\nLin Li suddenly shone a flashlight on his own face from below and spoke with a sinister tone.\nDamn, the Conan library murder case is truly Lin Li’s childhood nightmare.\nLuckily, he’s grown up now, and it’s no longer a childhood nightmare but has become a teenage shadow.\nHowever, for Lin Li’s terrifying description, Ding Sihan looked at him like an idiot and even sighed, as if showing concern for the mentally challenged.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis look is so damn hurtful.\n\"If a ghost really came to my house, I’d dare to play cards with it. If it were handsome, I’d even be willing to reenact a love story between a human and a ghost. Are you trying to scare me?\" Ding Sihan laughed mockingly.\nWhat a female version of Ning Caichen, almost forgot, Ding Sihan is the guy who stayed incredibly calm throughout the haunted house, so scaring him with ghosts is indeed a bit ridiculous.\nChen Yu Ying slightly pursed her lips and curled her body a bit.\nDamn, such a failure—\n\"Lin Li... dammit... I’ll be all alone in the dorm tonight...\" Just as Lin Li regretted his stupidity, a trembling voice came from beside him.\nHey!\nNot a total failure, there’s an unexpected surprise.\n\"I’m sorry, Bufan, I didn’t mean it, but Bao Wei kept telling me that when he sleeps, he can see a beautiful corpse lying back-to-back with you under your bed. Did he tell you? By the way, Nansang Middle School used to be a mass grave...\"\n\"Damn! Shut the hell up!!\"\nBai Bufan didn’t have the courage of Wei Kun, no matter how beautiful it was, it was no use. He angrily covered his ears.\n\"Almost forgot you’re afraid of ghosts. It’s a pity I didn’t drag you into the haunted house at Pingjiang Amusement Park, my faint-hearted buddy.\" Lin Li, instead of continuing to create a creepy atmosphere, laughed and taunted.\nJust because your deskmate dared to eat shit, don’t you know your deskmate also dares to eat it!\n\"How could you recklessly tarnish my name...\" Bai Bufan’s face turned red, and the veins on his forehead popped out.\nSparking a series of incomprehensible mutterings about ’not being afraid’ and ’having basic reverence’, which made everyone in and outside the elevator laugh, filling the elevator with a joyful atmosphere.\n...\nAs soon as they walked out of the library, they saw a car honking in the distance, with the high beams turned on.\n\"That’s my dad’s car, shall I go over first?\" Chen Yu Ying turned to say goodbye to her friends.\nFrom afar, Lin Li saw that it seemed to be Old Deng, the one who once had a chance meeting but never chatted, picking Chen Yu Ying up. Why had they switched cars? Is the family’s wealth so abundant that they have spare vehicles?\nMoreover, is it an illusion, why is Old Deng not staring at his daughter but at him?\n\"Bye-bye.\"\n\"Alright, everyone head home and find your mothers.\" After Chen Yu Ying got into the car, Lin Li snapped his fingers, ready to walk towards where his bicycle was parked.\nAnd was then pulled back by Bai Bufan.\n\"Go back with me and Qu Wanqiu, I’m begging you.\" Bai Bufan whispered as he leaned in.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"You want me to walk all the way with a girl alone, that’s a death sentence for me.\"\n\"Bufan, haven’t you already been able to chat normally with girls? What are you afraid of?\" Lin Li was a bit puzzled.\n\"It’s different, I can only just respond when spoken to, but when it comes to being alone with a girl, I have no idea what to say. By then both of us will walk silently, or she’d start and I just uh uh uhh? Even thinking about it is awkward, absolutely unbearable, I’d rather walk back alone.\"\nBai Bufan resolutely shook his head.\nStill too few sessions with Feifei.\n\"Practice a bit, Wanqiu is very nice and can take a joke. Just treat her like a buddy, you’ve got to try.\" Lin Li sincerely wanted Bai Bufan to improve, so he encouraged him.\n\"You need to step out of your comfort zone.\"\nOnly after stepping out of your comfort zone will you know how comfortable it actually was. Lin Li didn’t say the rest.\nHearing this, Bai Bufan gritted his teeth and nodded.\nUnder Lin Li’s hopeful gaze, he walked over to Qu Wanqiu and Ding Sihan who were chatting and laughing.\n\"Qu Wanqiu.\"\n\"Hmm?\" Qu Wanqiu looked up at Bai Bufan.\n\"What movies do you usually watch?\"\nQu Wanqiu, Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nLin Li: \"!\"\nShe didn’t have to answer nor could answer this question, because Bai Bufan had already been dragged away by Lin Li from behind.\n\"What the hell are you doing!\" After pulling him to a slightly farther place, Lin Li grabbed Bai Bufan’s neck and asked.\n\"Didn’t you say to get along like brothers! The first thing I ever said to you was this, wasn’t it?\" Bai Bufan argued with reason, even giving an example.\n\"But you can’t just be buddies like that! Not everyone in this world is a nerd like us, movie small talk works but not for normal people!\" Lin Li raged.\n\"But I’ve already done my best!\"\nLin Li let go, sighed sadly, and thought to himself that the road with Feifei would be long and arduous.\nTo make Bai Bufan act like a normal guy, it’s going to take a lot more work.\n\"Alright, I’ll go back to school with you two first, then I’ll head home, and meanwhile, I’ll show you the simplest way to chat.\"\nEven though Lin Li suspected Bai Bufan of blackmailing him into going along, Lin Li worried that forcing the two to go back together, he might have to rely on Yangliang’s connections to visit Bufan in jail tomorrow, so he agreed.\nDing Sihan’s home was in the opposite direction of the school, so the four of them said goodbye again.\n\"Be safe, and if something happens, visit me in a dream, my mood hasn’t been great lately.\" Lin Li cursed venomously.\nDing Sihan turned back to make a face upon hearing this.\nThen the three of them walked towards the school, with Lin Li pushing his bicycle in the middle, Bai Bufan and Qu Wanqiu on either side.\n\"Qu Wanqiu.\" Lin Li spoke.\n\"What is it?\" Despite carrying a heavy backpack, Qu Wanqiu stepped lightly and inquired back.\nBai Bufan also looked over, planning to attend the class and learn the art of conversation.\n\"What movies do you usually watch?\"\nBai Bufan, Qu Wanqiu: \"?\"\nWhat the hell do you want me to learn?",

      "content": "Chapter 196: Chapter 169 Lin Li Knows a Bit About Poetry (Seeking Monthly Pass)\n\"I’m talking about movies, what’s with that expression?\" Lin Li laughed and added before getting a response.\n\"Eh—you better be.\" Qu Wanqiu didn’t believe him at all, expressing disdain.\n\"Stop with the ’eh’, do you have any recommendations for normal movies? Name a few, I still have time tonight, can watch one before bed.\" Lin Li pressed on.\n\"Of course I do...\" Qu Wanqiu nodded immediately and started asking Lin Li if he had seen those movies she endorsed.\n...\n\"Chatting is such a simple thing.\" Lin Li spread his hands under the boys’ dormitory building.\nSending Buddha all the way to the west—if you only send to the school gate, it would be awkward on the way back to the dorm, so Lin Li simply found an excuse to follow to the dorm.\nAfter Qu Wanqiu entered the girls’ dorm, only the two of them were left, Lin Li summed up.\n\"Oh, right, I mimicked you at the opening because my image in their eyes is already ruined, so doing this doesn’t feel strange to them. This might help dilute the impact of your stunning opening; don’t imitate this, it’s different from forming alliances with them over movies.\"\nBai Bufan felt rare warmth in his heart after hearing this: \"You occasionally act like a human, I thought you just wanted to be annoying.\"\n\"Indeed, that’s also part of it.\" Lin Li didn’t deny.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nJeez.\n\"Alright, I’m heading home on the bike, if I delay any longer, the school gate won’t let me out.\" Lin Li swung onto his bike, turned around, and waved goodbye.\n\"Alright, bye, really appreciate tonight.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\n\"You’re welcome, buddy. Oh, by the way, Bufan, there’s something I need to tell you.\" Lin Li suddenly remembered something, braced himself on one leg, turned around, and said.\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"A woman in white followed us for a while, just passed us and entered the boys’ dorm. Be careful tonight.\" After saying this, Lin Li pedaled his bike happily and rode away.\nLeaving Bai Bufan, who wanted to swear but couldn’t, disoriented in the wind.\n...\n\"Monday, Monday, you son of a— getting up early every day, might as well just die!\"\nMonday.\nWhen Lin Li walked into the classroom with breakfast, instead of hearing Bai Bufan’s wild tales of the Three Kingdoms, he heard Wang Ze reciting poetry.\nAmazing poem, amazing poem, Wang Ze turns out to be a cultured sports student.\nYet Lin Li was also a poetry master, adept at acrostic poems.\n\"In front of the bed, the bright moonlight, suspected to be frost on the ground. Looking up at the bright moon, thinking of hometown.\"\nThis is Lin Li’s proudest work.\nAs for yesterday, Sunday, what Lin Li did was simple, except for Chen Yu Ying not coming because she went to her grandma’s house, the remaining four spent the whole day at the library, and went back to school for night study.\nStudied for another day.\nMind slathered with lubricant, knowledge bursting uncontrollably.\nLin Li gradually gained confidence in science subjects.\nAfter all, it’s only the first year of high school, although the knowledge taught compared to junior high is worlds apart, in terms of mastering difficulty and keeping up with the pace, it’s still quite manageable, as the current teaching progress, the types of questions keep changing, but fundamentally remain the same.\nLiterature subjects have the support of [Strong Memory].\nWill it win? It will win.\nThese two days brought in two more low-grade spirit stones, but inventory still totals three—used two this morning on the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\nAs for today’s Monday system update, the new options are further improved, yet still unknown what they’re for, with no trigger or feedback.\n[You’ve refreshed \"Snatch Bag\": 50 system currency (limited purchase 1 per day), do you want to replace?]\n[Snatch Bag: Temporarily master \"Snatch Bag\" ability after use, within an hour, forearms and palms can cross space, reaching the area you wish to appear in, crossing distance limited by your strength, minimum two meters.\nUsing this ability causes no spiritual qi fluctuation, ]\nRefreshed by Lin Li after buying another \"Ability Amplifier\", chose to refresh slot 2, resulting in this appearance.\nLin Li thought about it, chose to replace the slot, and exchanged for one.\nConsidering he came all this way, might as well switch it up.\nAfter this operation, Lin Li’s system currency dropped down to 300, with [Warehouse] holding three low-grade spirit stones, three \"Limit Break Charms\", two \"Ability Amplifiers\", and one \"Snatch Bag\".\nBut Lin Li didn’t use it.\nAfter all, this is like the useless Limit Break Charm, selling at 50 system currency each, with a limit of one purchase per day, testing it is simply a waste.\nJudging by plain readings, it seems to enable remote object retrieval.\nSeems quite impressive, truly an immortal technique, will see more when there’s a chance to use it later.\nReturning to his seat, Lin Li slapped an napping Bai Bufan on the head: \"Wake up, eat breakfast, why are you so sluggish today.\"\n\"Isn’t it your fault...\" Bai Bufan opened his eyes, yawned.\n\"No wonder you’re staying at school this week, you guys went to the library together over the weekend, young people’s impulses are understandable, but still watch out.\" Picking up his breakfast, Zhou Baowei expressed his concern after hearing this.\n\"Get lost.\" Bai Bufan raised his middle finger.\n\"You could blame this on me?\" Lin Li was shocked.\n\"Yeah it’s your fault, I habitually stay up late on weekends. Problem is, over this weekend, mornings are spent at the library reading, calculated it, though wake up later than usual, actually sleeping less than school days.\"\n\"During weekend activities felt nothing, now Monday just started, backlash hits me, isn’t this on you?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Seeing you like this, any ghost assigned to do sleep paralysis at 3 A.M would worryingly complain, ’Damn, wouldn’t this guy turn into my colleague, increasing my workload soon?’\" Lin Li sighed and shook his head.\nSince this groove system appeared, Lin Li himself practically stopped staying up late for entertainment, living quite a healthy routine.\n\"Staying up late feels great for a moment, keeping at it feels great all the time, it’s not about staying up late, it’s seeking freedom I can’t pursue.\" Bai Bufan continued arguing, since during daytime, his phone often gets confiscated by despicable people.\nBut then Bai Bufan felt his armpit with concern in his voice: \"Sometimes suddenly feel a twitch in the armpit, it goes away in a bit, but could it be a sign of sudden death?\"\n\"This is armpit pain, a warning from your body. No need to worry too much, grind into powder quince, angelica, processed shell ginger, cinnamon bark, nutmeg, sand ginger, and licorice each fifteen grams, mix it with water for daily oral intake...\"\n\"Wait, you know Chinese medicine? Hold on, let me take notes, alright, say it again, slower.\" Bai Bufan hurriedly stopped Lin Li, took out paper and pen indicating to repeat.\n\"Quince, angelica...\"\n\"OK, this will relieve the situation right, I’ll take leave later to get the herbs.\" Bai Bufan was pleased.\nAsked Bai Bufan why he lives, he’ll say no idea, everyone else is living.\nBut let him really die, he keeps matters separate.\n\"Uh, not exactly, with this, after sudden death, you would smell fragrant after cremation, people might think you’re awesome, possibly even voluntarily collect your bones as relics, right, borrow your skull to play soccer then?\" Lin Li shook his head.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn you.\n\"You’re 65 grams of gold, worth 40,000 at full price.\"\nThe note became a paper ball and hit Lin Li’s head, Bai Bufan raised a sharp middle finger.\n\"Healthy routine is the root solution, Bufan you have to watch yourself, your mind is twisted enough, keep your body healthy.\" Lin Li laughed.\n\"Will try, anyway, to avoid sudden death today, I’ll nap now, don’t wake me during early study unless Koukou arrives.\" Rapidly finished breakfast, Bai Bufan leaned back on the desk for extra sleep.\nDue to exhaustion, his consciousness was already hazy.\n\"What if it’s me here?\" Someone spoke before the early study bell even rung.\n\"Who the heck are you?\"\n\"I’m Xue Jian.\"\n\"You’re—ah?\"\nBai Bufan was no longer sleepy.\nMagic hands, Dr. Xue.\n...\nWish everyone a happy New Year in 2025.\nHeld a monthly vote and small prize draw this month, for details see the single Chapter later.\nOverall, requesting monthly vote.",

His ability to absorb sleepiness is much better than my energy drink.\"\n\"Cultivation should be like Old Jian’s.\"\n\"Lin Li couldn’t help but feel this way inwardly.\"\n\"When Bai Bufan glanced at him with a fierce eye, Lin Li could only respond with an innocent look.\"\n\"This was a silent exchange.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: ’Why didn’t you remind me, you idiot!’\n\"Lin Li: ’I didn’t know.’\n\"Lin Li truly didn’t know. Xue Jian must have sneaked up from the back door. If Xue Jian hadn’t spoken up, Lin Li wouldn’t have known Xue Jian had already approached.\"\n\"As a cultivator, I need to be more vigilant.\"\n\"Besides, Xue Jian’s ability to stay silent was impressive.\"\n\"’Come with me,’ Xue Jian said to Bai Bufan after a glance at him.\"\n\"Oh crap!\"\n\"Bai Bufan actually felt wronged. Self-study hadn’t even started yet. Is napping illegal? As for foul language, the number of sixteen-year-olds on this planet who haven’t sworn is probably smaller than that of people who control large tantrums.\"\n\"But being caught left no justification. Bai Bufan could only follow Xue Jian dejectedly, ready to face consequences.\"\n\"Lips gone, teeth cold; Lin Li and Zhou Baowei both laughed with grief, expressing sadness through joy.\"\n\"’Lin Li, you come along too,’ Xue Jian glanced at Lin Li again.\"\n\"Lin Li’s laughter now turned to Zhou Baowei.\"\n\"Oh great, there goes my luck too.\"\n\"So Xue Jian led the way, with Lin Li and Bai Bufan trailing behind a bit at a distance.\"\n\"When the three of them didn’t stop upon reaching the office, Lin Li suddenly realized and felt relieved.\"\n\"Safe now.\"\n\"Bai Bufan also started sensing something was off. Although Lin Li being in trouble when the class had issues was a given, the current situation seemed less about dragging them to the office for scolding.\"\n\"Noticing Lin Li’s relief, Bai Bufan whispered, ’Lin Li, what’s going on?’\"\n\"’We got reported. Wang Yuezhi told Old Jian that two naked lunatics in clothes were sleeping at the back of the classroom; that was us,’ Lin Li whispered back.\"\n\"’We aren’t...’\"\n\"No way.\"\n\"’...naked in clothes. Listen to yourself; remember, I will avenge this on Wang Yuezhi,’ Bai Bufan nodded approvingly.\"\n\"As they left the teaching building with Xue Jian, Bai Bufan was confused again and looked at Lin Li, asking, ’Lin Li, where are we going?’\"\n\"’The Political Education Building.’\"\n\"’Wait...Is this about the previous autumn outing?’ Seeing Lin Li’s familiarity, Bai Bufan associated.\"\n\"It was Autumn Travel King’s outing.\"\n\"’Mm, Uncle Yang mentioned it over the weekend, but I didn’t expect us to be brought over so soon,’ Lin Li nodded.\"\n\"At the principal’s office door, Xue Jian knocked: ’Principal Wang.’\n\"’Bufan, protect your eyes later; there might be backlash.’ Lin Li reminded, bowing his head due to experience.\"\n\"It’s a pity Bai Bufan didn’t trust him. When the door opened, he was dazzled by the morning sunlight reflecting off the principal’s shiny head.\"\n\"Ignore an elder’s advice, enjoy all year; ignore Lin Li’s advice, suffer right away.\"\n\"This time, though, the principal opening the door lacked last time’s intimacy and kindness. He looked at the new face, Bai Bufan, with a complex expression, then gazed deeply and painfully at Lin Li.\"\n\"Lin Li felt a bit embarrassed being stared at like that.\"\n\"’Come in,’ the principal said in a heavy tone.\"\n\"Alarm bells rang.\"\n\"Although not sure why they rang.\"\n\"’Sister Sun,’ Lin Li greeted Sun Ying, whom he had met once before, as soon as he entered.\"\n\"However, today the Demon Suppression Envoy next to Sun Ying was not Yangliang but a new face. Yangliang had informed Lin Li he went on vacation with family over the weekend and couldn’t come to school.\"\n\"Consider him lucky; no, consider it a shame he missed meeting Lin Li.\"\n\"He deserved a rest after this strenuous period.\"\n\"’Xiaolin,’ Sun Ying smiled and nodded at Lin Li, then introduced, ’This is Officer Fang. Your Uncle Yang should’ve told you he couldn’t attend.’\n\"’Hello, Uncle Fang. Yes, Uncle Yang mentioned it.’\n\"’Good, then we’ll get straight to the procedure. Principal Wang, these two kids...’\n\"’No need, no need,’ the principal waved his hands so quickly they blurred, using both, ’No need for introductions this time. I roughly know what these kids did; as long as it helps you, skip my part.’\n\"Sun Ying: ’...’\n\"Based on Sun Ying’s expertise, the principal seemed to be exhibiting PTSD tendencies, worth noting to avoid sensitive triggers.\"\n\"’We’ll get to the photo session directly then.’ Sun Ying had no objections and signaled to a colleague, who took out two banner rolls.\"\n\"’This is Bai Tongxue, right? Here’s your banner,’ the Demon Suppression Envoy Fang confirmed, looking at the expectant Bai Bufan next to Lin Li.\"\n\"’Yes, yes, that’s me!’ Bai Bufan was eager.\"\n’Receiving a banner for the first time was a total surprise, though Bai Bufan couldn’t shake the feeling that the Demon Suppression Envoy Fang handing the banner had an odd expression.\"",

A glittering golden title met his eyes:\n\"Anti-Pornography Vanguard Dog\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWait a second.\nYou have got to be kidding me.\nWhy is there a \"Dog\" in the title?\nNo, no, according to Lin Li, this thing has two sides, there’s still a chance.\nBai Bufan’s dead heart was hanging in suspense again, and he excitedly flipped it over. As expected, there were another five glittering golden words.\n\"Woof Woof Woof Woof Woof\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nNo, no, no, no, no.\nBai Bufan felt like he was currently in a jungle cave in the Amazon, first hearing a surge of powerful music and then seeing a giant durian.\nHe had been utterly humiliated.\nBai Bufan squinted. The Demon Suppression Bureau couldn’t have humiliated him like this, and there were absolutely no official words on this banner.\nCome to think of it, how could Sanqiao send him something like this? It definitely wasn’t from them!\nBai Bufan suddenly turned his head to look at Lin Li.\nIs it you! Sword Tomb!\n\"Why are you looking at me like that? How could it be that on the weekend I spent my own money to have Uncle Yang make such a banner, have Sister Sun bring it over to give you hope only to disappoint you and make a fool of you? No way, I couldn’t have done this.\" Lin Li hurriedly denied in a quick breathless speech.\nShit.\nBai Bufan laughed, a gritted-teeth kind of laugh. If the environment allowed it, his arrow of punishment would have already been shot at Lin Li’s face.\n\"Sister Sun, do I... really have to... take a photo with this?\" Bai Bufan shook the \"Woof Woof Woof Woof Woof\" in front of him, smiling worse than crying, and asked Sun Ying.\n\"No, no, no, this is a surprise gift Xiaolin sent to you, haha, it’s not really... suitable for our official platform haha.\" Sun Ying quickly refused.\nAlthough she was professionally trained, Bai Bufan clutching the banner to his chest, plus his current constipated expression, was just too funny.\nNot laughing would be divine.\n\"You, damn, remember this.\" Bai Bufan rolled up the banner bit by bit and put it away, facing everyone with a smile but speaking with a voice squeezed through his teeth.\n\"I’m the ’Anti-Pornography Vanguard’, you’re the ’Anti-Pornography Vanguard Dog’, this is our passionate bond.\" Lin Li felt like his genuine intentions fed a dog, very sad.\nA side glance from Demon Suppression Envoy Fang and he suppressed his laughter, then took out a second banner.\n\"You’re not going to humiliate me twice, are you?\" Bai Bufan apprehensively took a step back.\n\"You’re not worth me spending that much money.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nShit.\nStill got humiliated twice.\n\"Teacher Xue, this banner is for you.\" Demon Suppression Envoy Fang walked towards Xue Jian.\nXue Jian took a step back, also showing apprehension.\nDemon Suppression Envoy Fang: \"...\"\nHe quickly added, \"This banner is from us at Sanqiao.\"\nWith the official endorsement, Xue Jian finally sighed with relief. While taking it, he asked curiously, \"Officer Fang, can I ask why you’re giving me a banner?\"\nAlthough Xue Jian was there that day, he knew clearly he was just eating snacks with his wife and didn’t do anything.\n\"This was also at Lin Tongxue’s personal request. He said he already has a banner, and receiving another shortly after has no meaning, suggesting it should be given to you for educating Lin Tongxue and Bai Tongxue. We thought it made sense, and you indeed deserve it,\" Demon Suppression Envoy Fang explained.\nXue Jian: \"...\"\n\"For educating Lin Tongxue and Bai Tongxue\"\nWhy... does it sound like an insult?\nXue Jian’s gaze shifted to Lin Li.\nThis kid occasionally has a human touch.\nDid he actually remember what happened last time until now?\nXue Jian opened the single-sided banner, and its content was normal:\n\"Teaching Excellence, Students All Over the World\"\nThough unrelated to this recognition, Xue Jian remembers clearly these were the words on the ’fake banner’ he crafted himself.\nWas Lin Li mocking him?\nForget it, this darn kid, being sarcastic is his passive skill, probably naturally being cheeky, Xue Jian found it somewhat amusing.\nHe accepted the banner and sincerely thanked Demon Suppression Envoy Fang.\n\"Later on when taking photos, Teacher Xue, we will need your cooperation, no avoiding fame this time,\" Sun Ying said with a smile.\nXue Jian nodded.\nIt’s just a banner, he wasn’t interested.\nLin Li, you are such a show-off.\n\"And here are your bonuses.\" Demon Suppression Envoy Fang handed the two envelopes with names on them to Lin Li and Bai Bufan. \"Because your contributions were different, the amounts vary. Lin Tongxue, you get four thousand yuan. Bai Tongxue, you get eight hundred yuan.\"\nAt this moment, Sun Ying added, \"Lin Li, although you provided more information this time and indeed helped us eliminate more obscene criminal dens, there was a symbolic addition last time, and it will be slightly more for the first case, so don’t be unhappy about getting less this time. Your Uncle Yang also did his best to fight for you this time.\"\n\"I couldn’t be happier, no complaints at all.\" Lin Li grinned broadly, he loved this part.\nBeing a ten-thousandaire through his own efforts, this is the power of a cultivator.\nBai Bufan was even more content, even if he only got ten yuan, he’d lament about unexpected windfalls, let alone a full eight hundred, enough to buy a Spring Breeze Elf (Stallone, Schwarzenegger) and switch hands, how marvelous.\n\"And here are these goods, which Officer Yang specially commissioned me to bring for you two. Consider them his personal rewards. After all, his performance this year...\" Demon Suppression Envoy Fang smiled, then took out a bag under the expectant gazes of the two.\nAs expected, more supermarket gift cards lay at the bottom, along with a few books.\n\"This rice and noodle card is for you, Lin Li. This ’High School Freshman Workbook’ is for you, Bai Bufan. This soybean oil card is for you, Lin Li. This ’Olympic Challenges’ is for you, Bai Bufan...\" Officer Fang distributed the items one by one.\nLooking at the stack of educational books before him, Bai Bufan: \"...\"\nHe turned to look at Lin Li, and the value cards in front of him.\nLin Li, this time innocently shaking his head: \"This really has nothing to do with me, I swear.\"\nBai Bufan was dumbfounded.\nIt didn’t seem like Lin Li would deny it at this point.\nSo, was this Yangliang’s arrangement?\nWhen did he offend him?\nBetrayed gratitude! Betrayed gratitude!\n\"Your Uncle Yang entrusted me to distribute these, he said it signifies different high hopes he has for you both. Don’t let him down, do well.\"\nDemon Suppression Envoy Fang gave a thumbs up. Though he barely held the laughter, he wanted to laugh again seeing Bai Bufan’s expression, feeling it necessary to clarify it wasn’t intentional.\nWhen he got these things from Yangliang, he had asked why they were distributed like this. Yangliang only said Bai Bufan deserved it.\nWhat did this kid do to provoke Brother Yang?\n\"Thank you.\"\nBut after all, they were rewards, the two thanked. Bai Bufan barely smiled, and Lin Li held back laughter equally hard.\nThe rewards distributed, the following were normal Q&As and photo sessions.\n\"These photos and my personal info would be anonymous, right?\" Bai Bufan, inexperienced, inquired with concern.\nHe couldn’t let his family know about all this.\n\"Yes.\" Sun Ying nodded.\n\"Right, can I choose my pseudonym?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"Sure, Lin Li’s pseudonym is Xiaoli, what do you plan to choose as your pseudonym?\" Sun Ying had no objection.\n\"Lin Li.\"\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"Wasn’t calling you,\" Bai Bufan worried Sun Ying didn’t understand, further explained, and emphasized, \"I want my pseudonym to be Lin Li, preferably the full alias as Nansang Middle School Junior One Class Four Lin Li.\"\nSun Ying: \"...\"\nWho taught you to pick a pseudonym like this, damn.",

      "content": "Chapter 199: Chapter 171: All-Natural, No Artificial Elements, No Awkward Criticism\nBai Bufan’s alias was rejected.\nBecause once it’s accepted, Lin Li’s alias would immediately become Bai Bufan of Class 4, Grade 1 at Nansang Middle School.\nAdditionally, the one who reacted most strongly wasn’t Lin Li, who merely let out a cold snort, but Principal Wang, who disregarded the scenery and rushed back to persuade Bai Bufan.\nWhoever knows Nansang Middle School, there’s no Lin Li or Bai Bufan, they’re not even acquaintances, don’t pretend to know each other!\nEspecially Lin Li, the banner should only be for the homeroom teacher, not the principal. You can belong to Class 4, Grade 1, but you can’t be from Nansang Middle School.\nHelpless, in the end, Bai Bufan took on the alias Xiaozhou.\nThe interview and photo session quickly wrapped up.\n\"Alright, we won’t take any more of your time, go to class.\" Sun Ying said, getting up and putting away her pen.\nHowever, Bai Bufan shook his head upon hearing this, \"Sister Sun, you can take a bit more time.\"\nXue Jian stared over.\nThe first class on Monday is often a homeroom session, but it frequently swaps with the last math class on Friday.\nThis takes up his time.\nBai Bufan instantly shut his mouth.\nAs they parted at the door, Lin Li noticed the principal’s gaze and said before leaving, \"Principal, it’s fine, next time I’ll make sure you get a banner too.\"\n\"Hiss—you have a good intention, but it’s best there isn’t a next time.\" The principal didn’t seem too appreciative, sincerely saying to Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nBut last time he left with a system task, this time there wasn’t one, so maybe there really won’t be a next time.\n\"Bufan, are you going to keep your banner yourself, or leave it with the teacher to take home on the weekend?\" Xue Jian asked Bai Bufan on the way back.\n\"Teacher, you keep it for me.\" Bai Bufan, clutching the workbook, made the right choice immediately, \"If you want it, I can give it to you too.\"\nIt’s unlucky to keep it himself.\nIs this even a banner?\nIf those guys in the dorm see it, my title as the \"Anti-Pornography Vanguard Dog\" will never go away.\nGrumbler Lin Li.\n\"What do I need your banner for, the teacher already has one.\" Xue Jian declined Bai Bufan’s kind gesture and showed his own.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"By the way, Bufan, remember after you go back, we only got the workbook, not the money.\" When the two lagged behind Xue Jian again, Lin Li quietly discussed with Bai Bufan.\n\"Understood!\" Bai Bufan nodded seriously.\nOtherwise, it has to be shareable.\n\"Also, it’s not safe to bring it back to the dorm. To prevent it from being discovered, let me keep it for you first. I’ll save it and return it when you’re older.\" Lin Li quickly added, putting forth his proposal.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Scram.\"\nThat’s just as bad as sharing it.\n...\n\"So that’s what happened this morning.\"\nAt noon, although the principal and Xue Jian were smarter this time and didn’t make a fuss, the classmates still noticed Lin Li and Bai Bufan being called out, so at lunchtime, Chen Yu Ying still asked curiously.\n\"You took Bai Bufan to, um, get a foot massage?\" Chen Yu Ying was greatly shocked.\n\"I was leading him on the path to uphold justice, don’t make it sound so bad.\" Lin Li thought it necessary to clear his name.\n\"What an interesting experience.\" Chen Yu Ying remarked, then looked at Lin Li, \"I wish there would be a chance for me to experience it too.\"\nLin Li, who was drinking water, almost spat it out.\nTaking the tissue Chen Yu Ying handed over to wipe his mouth, Lin Li coughed and said, \"Cough, cough, class president, no, do you also want a foot massage?\"\nHonestly, he didn’t have the guts.\nChen Yu Ying is no Bai Bufan; in Xue Jian’s eyes, Bai Bufan might be a mini Lin Li, unwanted but not discarded, but Chen Yu Ying is different. Even if Lin Li took her to do something noble like anti-pornography work, he would still feel Xue Jian’s love and justice afterward.\nThe mighty fist of love and justice.\nOnly being scolded by Xue Jian would be a good outcome. If that man who he’s met twice finds out he took her daughter for a foot massage, Lin Li would only think to comment on his fate—\nShang Yang knows the horse’s strength, Bi Gan understands people’s hearts.\nUnless given a task.\nLin Li cast a sidelong glance at the system. With such a perfect chance to mess with him, they really won’t give a task?\nUseless thing, looks like the system is unwilling to be his excuse.\n\"It’s not about foot massage, I just want to experience the kind of undercover operation, where you assume an alias, battle wits with criminals, and reveal your identity at a critical moment, it sounds so interesting. That’s what I’m referring to.\" Chen Yu Ying explained, feeling a bit shy under Lin Li’s gaze.\nSeeing the longing in Chen Yu Ying’s eyes, Lin Li scratched his head.\nIt’s normal to add some artistic flair to his experiences, right?\n\"If there’s really a chance next time, I’ll call you.\"\n\"Alright.\"\n...\nTuesday night.\nAs the end of evening self-study approached, the class started to stir.\nThe least survivable stationery in the world is the eraser, and the most survivable item is the protractor.\n\"No way, where’s my eraser, I had such a big eraser.\" As Lin Li sorted things for tomorrow’s exam, he became more convinced of this truth.\nIn this world, if someone can truly use up an eraser without losing it or tearing it into small pieces to throw at Zhou Baowei’s head, they’re a legend.\n\"Careless fool, never mind, I have extras. I put all my erasers in my pen case.\" Bai Bufan scoffed.\n\"Wait, where’s my pen case, I had such a big pen case?\" A minute later, Bai Bufan was no longer scoffing.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou really are a fool.\n\"It’s fine, every action has an equal counteraction. If erasers are easy to lose, they should be easy to find. Let’s see if there’s one on the ground.\" Lin Li, always the genius, proposed a new theory.\n\"Got it!\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nAnd Lin Li secretly got up and tossed the eraser from Zhou Baowei’s desk onto the floor.\n\"You’re right! There is one! Let’s split it!\" Bai Bufan caught it accurately and excitedly proclaimed.\nZhou Baowei just watched these two fools perform here.\nThen he accepted the fact that his eraser was split into three.\nAnyway, Lin Li would compensate him with a new one tomorrow.\nSoon, the bell rang, marking the end of the last session of evening self-study, and Chen Yu Ying stood up: \"Everyone, move the desks according to the diagram on the blackboard, don’t just leave it to the duty students.\"\nEven if it’s just a midterm, you still need to maintain a certain distance between examinees, so you mustn’t leave everything as it is.\n\"I’m moving out.\" Lin Li got up and informed Bai Bufan.\n\"OK.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nAfter rearranging the desks, for the sake of tidiness and cleanliness in the classroom, there are usually quite a few extra desks and chairs, typically moved out by students closest to the front or back doors.\nLin Li was among those farthest from the door, but he disliked strangers occupying his seat.\nSome people are just nosy, finishing their test without checking it, then glancing around their seat, trying to find some traces of the previous owner, to fiddle with some trinkets.\nThe existence of such people Lin Li firmly believed in, because he was one of them.\nAlthough things on the desk had been moved to the back cabinet, there were still plenty inside, alongside which was inserted a Holy Sword, so Lin Li simply moved his whole place.\n\"Need help?\"\nAfter moving his desk and chair, Lin Li saw Yu Yu moving her desk and asked.\nWithout waiting for an answer, he straightforwardly took over the task.\n\"Thanks.\" Yu Yu, who wanted to refuse, had to say.\n\"You’re welcome.\"\nLin Li noticed a delicate pin on Yu Yu’s desk, looking much nicer than the tacky Pingjiang Warriors pin. Not fond of silence, he struck up a conversation, \"Yu Yu, your pin’s pretty nice, where’d you get it? I want one too.\"\n\"...It’s not store-bought, it’s self-grown.\"\nLin Li: \"Huh?\"\nNo way.\nHold on.",

      "content": "Chapter 200: Chapter 172: What you do not desire, recklessly impose on others\n\"Eh?\"\nLooking at Yu Yu, whose hand was pressed against her chest and couldn’t dare to meet his gaze, Lin Li’s brain was trembling.\nDon’t make noise, I’m thinking.\nForget it, I’ll just start the noise myself.\n\"No! Yu Yu, I meant your brooch looks nice, not that your chest looks nice!\" After speaking, Lin Li realized he hadn’t really said anything, hastily trying to correct himself again: \"Also no! I meant this brooch, it’s a brooch! It! It’s quite nice, and I wanted to ask you where you bought it.\"\nComing to her senses, Yu Yu realized she’d made a huge misunderstanding and buried her head completely in her chest: \"S-sorry, I misunderstood.\"\nYou can’t blame Yu Yu; mainly it’s because Qu Wanqiu and Ding Sihan labeled Lin Li as the super invincible big being born and ultimate invincible big pervert while chatting in the dormitory, and Chen Yu Ying basically didn’t refute it.\nYu Yu believed it.\nSo Yu Yu felt that Lin Li saying such things was quite... normal.\nOn top of that, she intermittently felt an inexplicable, faint attraction to Lin Li, so she responded on instinct.\nNow that Yu Yu has reacted, she was already shy by nature, even more so than Lin Li, happy that her chest was large enough to cover her face as much as possible.\n\"It’s my fault for speaking ambiguously, blame me.\"\nThe impression Lin Li got from Yu Yu was overly shy and bashful; if it were Ding Sihan, Qu Wanqiu, or Chen Yu Ying, he would roll with the misunderstanding and continue being a \"pervert,\" but for Yu Yu, acting that way might offend her, so Lin Li behaved himself.\n\"I made this myself... it’s not available for purchase.\" Yu Yu’s voice was as soft as a mosquito.\n\"I see, no wonder it looks so nice.\" Lin Li sincerely deflected and then placed the desk against the wall in the corridor, with the drawer facing the wall to prevent things from falling out: \"Put it here?\"\n\"Okay, thank you.\"\n\"If there’s nothing else you need help with, I’ll be off then?\" Lin Li promptly prepared to make a speedy escape.\n\"Mm, thank you.\"\nLin Li turned and left, passing the back door, he saw Bai Bufan making exaggerated expressions:\n\"Your language is too artistic, man. I’ve never seen anyone in this world more skilled in the art of language than you. I need to learn from you.\"\nYou bastard.\n...\nWednesday.\nLin Li got up very early.\nThe early bird catches the worm, the earlier bird eats Prometheus.\nAfter exercising, Lin Li returned home to continue studying.\nThis morning, there was only a Chinese exam, since the time for this subject was too long—two and a half hours, from nine to eleven thirty—so he could afford to go a bit late.\nHowever, Lin Li had already memorized those ancient poems and literary texts inside out, so he focused on practicing calculations for the biology test in the afternoon.\nOnce the time was about right, Lin Li headed to school.\nLin Li’s exam room was Class 12 of Grade 1.\nIn the corridor, Bai Bufan was holding the textbook, reciting ancient poetry.\nExam seating at Nansang Middle School was completely random for mid-term and final exams, but for monthly tests, the seating was based on the previous big exam rankings, so students in the same exam room had similar grades.\nAfter all, Lin Li and Bai Bufan had been evenly matched opponents before, and getting paired up was quite normal.\nAs the saying goes, grades are three parts fate, seven parts diligence, and ninety points reliant on your deskmate.\nBut this seating method for exams doesn’t work well for cheating by whispering in the later exam rooms:\n\"Do you know how to do this question?\"\n\"I don’t know either, do you know how to do this question?\"\n\"I don’t know either, what about this one?\"\n\"Don’t know.\"\n\"Great, neither of us knows, we’re doomed.\"\nThat’s likely the scenario.\n\"This is the last time I’ll be in the same exam room with scum like you for a monthly test.\" Lin Li walked beside Bai Bufan and said with a smile.\n\"Carried over numerous companions once visited, reminiscing those glorious and plentiful bygone days...\" Bai Bufan, who was reciting poetry, only glanced sideways at Lin Li, too lazy to argue.\n\"Hey, Bufan, do you know what poem Cannibal Race exchange students find most artistic when they come to normal society to study?\" Lin Li immediately asked.\nBai Bufan ignored him, continuing to recite: \"But they are youthful classmates, full of vigor...\"\n\"That’s right, this sentence!\" Lin Li snapped his fingers, \"You’re so smart.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYou bastard, it’s the ’eat’ of ’eating rice’, isn’t it?\nBut foot fetishist Bai Bufan, now busy cramming for exams, indeed had no time to deal with Lin Li, continuing his recitation: \"The people of the past have mounted the yellow crane, leaving this place with only an empty Yellow Crane Tower...\"\nSeeing this, Lin Li felt pressured, and he too had to study, starting to recite: \"Old friends bid farewell from the west of the Yellow Crane Tower, a VIP ascends the third floor. The young lass’s smile remains unchanged, but the bald head of the past cannot be seen.\"\n\"Get lost! I swear if I think of this during the exam, you’re finished!\"\nBai Bufan unceremoniously kicked Lin Li away.\nLin Li chuckled and did not disturb further, leaving his backpack outside the door; three pens were enough for the Chinese exam. Based on the seat chart at the door and on the blackboard, he found his seat.\nSecond to last row by the window, though this time on the corridor side.\nThe seat’s owner cleaned up quite well, even the drawer was empty, no chance to peek.\nSince he arrived just in time, it wasn’t long before the classmates started filing into the classroom, followed closely by the invigilating teacher.\nJust as expected, the invigilating teacher brought a stack of papers even without a sealed bag.\nHe was well-known, Teacher Yan, responsible for invigilating the morning session, was the homeroom teacher Wang Ziyan.\nAs Lin Li made eye contact with Wang Ziyan, Wang Ziyan covered his mouth and dry-heaved.",

Everyone, put unrelated items on the podium or near the door. If you need to use the restroom, go now. Just a reminder, during the exam, no restroom breaks unless in special cases.\"\nAs the test papers were being sorted on the podium, Wang Ziyan spoke loudly to everyone.\nLin Li, with only three pens, stayed still at his seat.\nWhile idly observing his surroundings, he noticed the guy next to him, remembered from glancing at the seating chart that his name was Feng Kai. He carefully took out a note filled with writing from his backpack and placed it in the drawer before handing over his backpack.\nDid he do something wrong?\nNo.\nWang Ziyan said to hand over items unrelated to the exam. If someone prepares a cheat sheet for the exam, then nothing would be unrelated to it.\nLin Li never thought of relying on cheating to complete system tasks, not out of moral integrity, but because it seemed pointless.\nCheat sheets are mostly useful for subjects like humanities. In humanities, [Strong Memory] is already imprinted in my mind.\nIn sciences, what’s the use of a cheat sheet?\nCopy formulas?\nIs having formulas enough to solve science problems?\nThis is just like ’this is a black piece, this is a white piece, surround them to capture, here, face your first opponent, Cloud Peak Chess Player Ke Jie,’ isn’t it?\nBesides, Lin Li doesn’t like the feeling of sneaking around nervously, unless it’s an affair.\n[Within the sect, one’s true abilities should be revealed through fair competition. Taking shortcuts destroys one’s path and may lead to corruption by demons in the future.\nAs a member of the sect, how can one watch fellow disciples go astray? One must intervene upon seeing cheating.]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Four: In this sect competition, stop any witnessed acts of cheating.]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: Comprehension increased by 10%; Random System Reward*1; System Currency*100]\n[Random System Reward: Open to receive a system-related reward.]\nThe system can really change a person’s standing; ever since Lin Li got the system, he always wanted to steal something.\nFor example, now, Lin Li wants to steal Feng Kai’s cheat sheet.\nBut it’s too late, as the other party has already returned from depositing his backpack. Now, if Lin Li tries to take it, he’ll definitely get caught.\nAlthough the other party likely wouldn’t dare alert the authorities.\nLin Li glanced at the system again.\nThis task is easy to understand; it’s about transforming into Dragonfly Captain and judging the sins during the exam.\nActually, it’s simple to complete. Just stand up and report any cheating you see.\nHowever, Lin Li doesn’t want to complete the task in such a way.\nPublicly reporting cheating is an act not easily understood by others.\nNot only other students, even teachers may find it unnecessary, advising you to focus on yourself and not worry about others, possibly thinking you’re just being difficult, earning their disdain.\nEven Lin Li himself, upon hearing that someone indiscriminately reports cheating, would consider the person odd and extreme.\nTherefore, unless absolutely necessary, Lin Li doesn’t want to use such a blunt approach.\nThe system’s not mean enough to make one stop all cheating in the monthly exam, just the part one witnesses and hears is enough. Then, later, if one doesn’t see or hear it, it’s fine.\nBut for now, the task’s triggered target is certainly the priority.\nNo big deal, Lin Li has always been a genius.\nNow Lin Li has a plan, especially since he knows the invigilating teacher, and knows the not-so-serious Wang Ziyan.\nLin Li stood up and walked towards Wang Ziyan.\n\"Teacher Yan,\" Lin Li started.\n\"Lin Li? What’s the matter?\" Wang Ziyan asked.\n\"I want to cheat.\"\n\"Then go do it, since the exam hasn’t started yet.\" Wang Ziyan didn’t raise his head, just nodded toward the front door, indicating that he could go to the restroom now.\nWait.\nSomething’s wrong.\nIt seems Lin Li wasn’t talking about going to the restroom a moment ago.\n\"Lin Li, what did you say?\" Wang Ziyan lifted his head to confirm.\n\"I want to cheat.\" Lin Li repeated.\nWang Ziyan: \"...\"\nYou damn brat.\nWhat’s the point of saying this to me?\n\"First of all, cheating is disgraceful, a useless act that violates school rules and holds no meaning for your life. Secondly, what’s the purpose of telling me? Do you expect me to cover up or even assist you? Don’t even think about it, behave yourself.\" Wang Ziyan’s expression turned a bit stern.\n\"No, I respect your role as an invigilator, so I’m simply provoking you.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nWang Ziyan: \"?\"\nYou damn kid.\nGoddamn provocation.\nThis seems more infuriating than asking me to cover up for him.\nBefore Wang Ziyan could speak, Lin Li showed a sly smile and continued:\n\"Teacher Yan, I’m thoroughly prepared for cheating in this Chinese exam. Upon realizing that you’re the invigilator, I felt even more thrilled. You’ve probably seen Conan, right? I am the modern Thieving Kid. I love the sensation of notifying the teacher first then cheating right under the teacher’s nose, it gives me an incomparable sense of accomplishment.\nAfter all, ordinary cheating is too unchallenging for a master like me.\"\nWang Ziyan: \"...\"\nEven Senior Xue never said that Lin Li is such a kid.\nNo, is something wrong with him?\nThieving? Idiotic!\nEven though Wang Ziyan’s words sounded serious earlier, as a newly graduated teacher, how could he not be aware of the prevalent nature of cheating?\nIn an extreme sense, cheating successfully without getting caught is a kind of skill.\nBut someone like Lin Li, Wang Ziyan swore, has never been seen in his life.\n\"The challenge letter is already in your hands, Teacher Yan. Accepting or not is your choice, regardless I will cheat.\"\nSeeing Wang Ziyan’s twitching mouth, Lin Li sneered and snapped his fingers, confidently turning back to his seat.\nWang Ziyan just stood there dumbly watching Brother Xiaoshuai Lin Li return to his seat, continuing to look at him provocatively.\n\"Teacher, teacher, the exam has started. Could you distribute the test papers now?\" someone urged.\nUpon hearing this, Wang Ziyan came to his senses, took a deep breath, and blew at his bangs, before distributing the test papers to each group.\nAccording to plan, after distributing the test papers, he should start sneaking to play on his phone – as an invigilator, playing on the phone can’t be too excessive because during exams the head of teaching will inspect, not only assisting in watching students but also checking if invigilators are too lax.\nAs a newbie teacher like Wang Ziyan, who doesn’t quite fit in with those old teachers or have connections and power, he was quite worried it might affect his assessment. So he could only sneakily play, that way the head of teaching would turn a blind eye.\nBut now, Wang Ziyan had no thoughts of playing on his phone at all.\nTaking student provocation without reacting is a feat by itself.\n\"Do your exam well, don’t harbour any thoughts of cheating! I’ll be watching you all the time!\"\nWang Ziyan spoke loudly and sternly as he looked towards Lin Li’s direction.\nJust that?\nThat’s not enough, so even after hearing Wang Ziyan say that, Lin Li’s expression remained disdainful, and he pretended to glance at his drawer, shook his clothes, and confidently lifted his head, showing a face full of conviction.\nWang Ziyan immediately walked to Lin Li’s side, bent over to see, but Lin Li’s drawer was empty.\nThen he noticed Lin Li’s smug smile.\nGreat, kid, you’ve successfully captured my attention.\nWang Ziyan walked up to the podium, moved the chair down, placed it right next to Lin Li, then dusted off his sleeves, and sat down with style.\nLin Li turned his head and made eye contact with Wang Ziyan.\nLin Li chuckled.\nThis is exactly what he wanted, Feng Kai, how the hell are you going to cheat now?\nWang Ziyan laughed too.\nThis is exactly what he wanted, Lin Li, how the hell are you going to cheat now?\nFeng Kai also laughed.\nThis isn’t what he wanted, damnit, how the hell am I going to cheat now?",

      "content": "Chapter 202: Chapter 173: What evidence do you have to prove I didn’t cheat!\nWith Wang Ziyan by his side, Lin Li felt especially at ease and immediately delved into writing his exam paper.\nWhile keeping his eye on his own paper, he also managed to watch Feng Kai.\nAn hour and a half flew by in no time.\nWang Ziyan looked a bit smug.\nYou like provoking me, don’t you, Lin Li? Now you’re seeing the consequences, aren’t you?\nNow Lin Li started writing the essay, but on the answer sheet, the earlier questions, the ancient poetry dictation part, and the in-class classical Chinese part were all blank.\nIt’s obvious that these are the parts Lin Li intended to cheat on, but now, because of my surveillance, he can’t write them.\nHowever, Wang Ziyan grew a bit serious—why was Lin Li still so confident, without a trace of anxiety? Could he have another trick up his sleeve?\nNo, he can’t pull anything under my watch!\nWhatever trick he might have, I’ll deal with it as it comes.\nHonestly, this little interlude during invigilation...Wang Ziyan found it quite amusing, adding much fun to the usually boring monitoring process.\nThe senior teacher directing the patrol earlier even nodded and smiled at me when he saw me invigilating from the back row.\nSitting on a small stool for a long time, my buttocks were a bit sore, so Wang Ziyan got up, ready to take a walk around the classroom.\nLin Li and Feng Kai both noticed his move.\nAnd when Lin Li noticed his mischievous peer preparing to pull out a cheat sheet from his pocket, he acted immediately.\nSo just as Wang Ziyan took a couple of steps, he heard the rustling sound of test pages being turned behind him.\nWang Ziyan swiftly returned to his original position, and saw Lin Li frustratingly put the test paper back under the answer sheet and resumed writing his essay.\nGot it! He wasn’t really confident, he was just pretending to have time, trying to bluff to make me let my guard down!\nRealizing this, Wang Ziyan felt relieved, sat back down with a smile.\nFor the next hour, he didn’t plan to move a muscle.\nNo way he can lose now.\nAfter another twenty minutes, Lin Li had finished his essay.\nThen he turned back to the unwritten parts of the ancient poetry section, eyeing the questions, occasionally glancing at Wang Ziyan.\n\"Teacher, can I submit early?\" As soon as it was eleven, a student asked.\nNansang Middle School allowed papers to be submitted up to half an hour early, with some students just waiting for this moment.\n\"Yes, put your answer sheet on your desk.\" Wang Ziyan stood up and nodded upon hearing this, then immediately sat down to continue watching Lin Li.\nLanguage arts is a subject where there’s no going back once you write—the answer sheets are limited in space, so as Wang Ziyan spoke, nearly half of the students who finished writing rushed to submit their papers.\nLin Li remained unmoved.\nWang Ziyan also remained unmoved.\nBut Feng Kai was anxious.\nHe still hadn’t figured out why the invigilator kept sitting beside him, even when people were submitting papers, he didn’t even move to sort the papers on the podium.\nHe left several lines blank in the ancient poetry section, and the answers were all in his pocket.\nSo near, yet so far.\n\"Teacher, can I go to the bathroom?\" Feng Kai suddenly clutched his stomach and asked.\nThis was his only option.\n\"Didn’t I just say you can’t go to the bathroom during the exam?\" Wang Ziyan turned to look at the right side, not agreeing immediately.\n\"My stomach suddenly doesn’t feel well.\" Feng Kai lowered his voice, pretending to be in discomfort.\n\"Sigh, well then...\" Wang Ziyan, being young, was a very agreeable teacher.\n\"Teacher, I need to use the bathroom too!\" Lin Li said seriously, immediately interrupting.\nThis couldn’t end in failure.\n\"You can’t go.\" As for Lin Li, Wang Ziyan didn’t even think before refusing.\n\"Why? My stomach doesn’t feel great either. If he can go, why can’t I? I can go later, at a different time than him.\" Lin Li analyzed earnestly.\n\"Who said he could go to the bathroom,\" Wang Ziyan stood up, glanced at both of their papers, and said seriously: \"Your essays are all written, it’s already past eleven, if you two want to go to the bathroom, submit your papers!\"\nFeng Kai: \"?\"\nFeng Kai realized he was stuck.\nHe had already claimed a stomachache, but now abruptly not submitting his paper would seem strange.\nOh well, just a few points, it’s not important.\n\"Teacher, I’m submitting my paper.\" Feng Kai sighed.\n\"Alright, put it up here.\" Wang Ziyan nodded, then smiled at Lin Li, seemingly also challenging him: \"How about you, Lin Li, are you submitting your paper?\"\n\"I’m not submitting, I can hold it in, I’m not done yet.\" Lin Li naturally refused.\n\"Heh.\" Wang Ziyan sneered.\nLin Li started concentrating on checking the other subjective questions, seeing if there were any gaps he could fill in.\nFor instance, this blank.\nHe could totally add a line like \"expressed the author’s homesickness.\"\nTime ticked away, and in this examination room, there was no student who insisted on writing until the very last moment and wouldn’t submit early; maybe there were some in the first exam room.\n\"Go on.\"\nAfter placing his paper on the podium, Bai Bufan signaled with his eyes.\n\"Not going.\"\nAs soon as Lin Li responded to this signal, Wang Ziyan immediately stood up: \"Leave the exam room immediately after the test, don’t linger! And definitely don’t pass infor\nmation!\"\nBai Bufan was startled.\nWhy so reactive?\nBut he still swiftly made his escape.\nGradually, the entire classroom was left with only Lin Li and Wang Ziyan.\nWith only five minutes left until the end of the exam, the students outside in the corridor were already dispersing.\n\"Lin Li, you lost.\" With only the two of them, Wang Ziyan didn’t lower his voice, he said with a smile.\n\"Oh, really?\" Lin Li smiled upon hearing this, looking at Wang Ziyan, with a bright smile.\nWang Ziyan felt unease from this smile.\n\"You have no chance! Only five minutes left, and I’ll keep watching!\" he emphasized.\n\"I captured my chance long ago!\" Lin Li suddenly took the answer sheet from under the test paper, smiling at Wang Ziyan: \"Sorry, Teacher Yan, you’re the one who lost!\"\n\"Little exam paper, let me show you my mighty penmanship!\"\nLin Li wrote rapidly, those blank spaces as if he had a mental draft, without even needing to look at the test paper, he filled them in swiftly.\nAfter checking it over once more, Lin Li capped his pen and placed it on the table, declaring loudly: \"Teacher Yan, I—am submitting my paper!\"\n\"What! Impossible! When did you cheat?\" Wang Ziyan was shocked.\n\"Was it just then, with that classmate of yours? I knew it! You guys must have been exchanging answers!\" Wang Ziyan regretted, he should’ve punched Bai Bufan earlier.\n\"No.\" Lin Li denied.\n\"You kept looking out the window just now, was someone outside giving you the answers?\" Wang Ziyan continued to question.\n\"No.\" Lin Li’s expression was enigmatic, \"Teacher, give it up, you won’t figure it out.\"\n\"I’ll go check the surveillance now!\" Wang Ziyan pulled out his trump card.\nYet Lin Li remained unfazed.\nWait a minute.\nHold on.\nWang Ziyan suddenly realized he was stuck in a thought loop, squinting his eyes: \"Lin Li, did you not cheat at all?\"\n\"What a joke, Teacher Yan, do you have any evidence to prove I didn’t cheat?\" Lin Li, having submitted his paper, stood up, opened his arms, enjoying his victory, sounding anxious upon hearing this.\nWang Ziyan: \"...\"\nWhat kind of reverse strategy is this?\nWhat student asks a teacher, \"what evidence do you have to prove I didn’t cheat\"?\n\"Then do you have any evidence to prove you cheated?\" Wang Ziyan retorted.\n\"Everything I just wrote is one hundred percent correct.\" Lin Li confidently said, \"I didn’t know it before, but I do now; how is that not cheating?\"\nWang Ziyan: \"...\"\nSomething’s off.\nHow am I supposed to know what you knew before!\n\"Lin Li, are you just tormenting the teacher without actually cheating?\" Wang Ziyan grew more convinced, this kid didn’t cheat!\nSenior Xue’s introduction of this kid to me was definitely lacking!\n\"No, I cheated!\"\n\"You didn’t cheat!\"\n\"Teacher Yan, you’re slandering me, I obviously cheated!\" Lin Li got angry after being questioned.\n\"Fine! You cheated! I’ll tell the school and have your scores canceled!\" Wang Ziyan was also angry.\n\"Hey? Wait. No. No, no, no, sorry, I didn’t cheat, Teacher Wang, sorry, I memorized these, just didn’t write them down; I’m sorry.\" Lin Li confessed.\nWang Ziyan: \"...\"\nYou son of a bitch.",

      "content": "Chapter 203: Chapter 174: The Taste of Knowledge is Always Pleasing\n\"Next time, don’t act like this, or one day you’ll actually be accused of cheating, then you’ll behave.\"\nLin Li was only allowed to leave after Wang Ziyan knocked him three times on the head with a paper stick made from Lin Li’s Chinese test paper.\nLin Li had read \"Journey to the West,\" so he understood that Teacher Yan meant he should apologize in his room in the middle of the night if he wanted genuine forgiveness.\nHopefully, he’ll be gentle with me tonight.\nSpeaking of which, was Brother Monkey really that smart? Lin Li thought that if Bodhi Ancestor knocked his head three times in front of other students, his first reaction would be to lie down and call the police, saying ’Old man, you dare to punish students? How dare you?’\nNo wonder Brother Monkey is Brother Monkey, and I’m just a handsome guy.\nPutting the Chinese test paper in his bag, Lin Li headed to the cafeteria for a meal.\nNormally, at this time, school hadn’t finished yet, but today, when Lin Li arrived, most people were leaving the cafeteria—everyone had already eaten.\nOne could only say that the Chinese exam was too overrated; not handing it in early was an injustice to the subject.\nAfter getting some food, Lin Li found an empty table and sat down to eat.\nThe next step was simple.\nThe system required that he not tolerate any deceit, so if he became blind, the problem would be perfectly solved.\nWho said solving the person causing the problem doesn’t count as solving the problem?\nTherefore, Lin Li decided to arrive just on time or even late for the upcoming exams and focus entirely on the paper once inside, never glancing at others, preferably submitting it a few minutes early.\nIf he couldn’t see anyone cheating, then the cheating simply didn’t exist.\nAnd since his seat was by the wall, he could easily avoid seeing anyone just by turning his body that way.\nPerfect.\nHis plan was pure genius.\n\"Damn, the teacher this morning, for some reason, sat right next to me, and I couldn’t take out my cheat sheet. I didn’t write half of the ancient poems, and next week Wenxiu will kill me. I hope the teacher this afternoon isn’t like that. Biology and geography, I haven’t memorized anything; I’m completely relying on my cheat sheets.\"\nSometimes Lin Li really wanted to dig his ears out.\nLike at this moment when the words reached his ears.\nLin Li looked up and saw Feng Kai and his classmates walking toward the cafeteria exit.\nFeng Kai, damn you, Feng!\nWhy the hell is it you again!\nHis plan faced issues before it even started.\nThe system could tell whether he was seriously practicing, so pretending not to hear or trying to forget had no point. Lin Li sighed; the plan had to change.\nFeng Kai had to be dealt with.\n...\nThe first exam in the afternoon was geography.\nBy the time Lin Li reached the exam hall, it had already started for half a minute. The teacher was handing out exam papers, and everyone else was properly seated.\nThe invigilator was no longer Wang Ziyan, and Lin Li didn’t recognize this one at all, which was normal; during monthly exams, invigilators were changed every half day.\nFor midterms or finals, they basically changed for every subject.\nLin Li’s provocative technique only worked on familiar and easy-going teachers like Xue Jian, Wang Ziyan, and Li Binbin.\n——Xue Jian was strict, but Lin Li was used to his scoldings; one more time made no difference.\nFacing other teachers could easily result in accidental self-sabotage like Wang Ziyan mentioned.\nReturning to his seat, Lin Li immediately started reading and directly answering on the test paper.\nSo easy.\nThe effort put into Chinese didn’t have a noticeable effect, but the geography test was effortlessly smooth for Lin Li, and he was sure he was right since all the key points were firmly in his mind.\nAn unprecedented wonderful experience in exams.\nCCCC.\nFour Cs in a row? If it were before, Lin Li would’ve started reevaluating those four questions, doubting if he made a mistake, but now, confidence was his peak.\nEven if the Celestial King came, it would still be four consecutive Cs!\nWith this slight sense of joy, Lin Li quickly completed the test.\nHe didn’t turn toward the wall while writing, as planned during lunch, but instead faced the aisle.\nAfter all, he needed to keep an eye on Feng Kai.\nLin Li suddenly stopped writing because Feng Kai was making a move.\nLin Li saw Feng Kai glance up, confirming the invigilator was idly playing with a pen on the platform, and then take a deep breath and reach into his pocket, pulling out a folded piece of paper.\nSimultaneously, Lin Li also reached into his pocket, conjuring the \"Bottle of Hidden Emotions.\"\nInside was the full bottle of fear and anxiety Lin Li had specially collected from a cinema during a half-hour outing at noon, costing thirty-five yuan.\nGo.\nFeng Kai was just about to check his cheat sheet when he was suddenly consumed by intense fear.\nWhen scared, the mind either goes blank or becomes overwhelmed with worries; Feng Kai belonged to the latter.\nCheating is too risky; if caught, his life might be over! He might even die!\nExaggerated, irrational thoughts began circling in Feng Kai’s mind.\nCold sweat almost instantly seeped out.\nHe must not be caught; the evidence had to be destroyed.\nYes!\nThat’s right.\nSo when Feng Kai threw the cheat sheet into his mouth and chewed and swallowed, Lin Li was somewhat dumbfounded.\nThis wasn’t an outcome he had anticipated.\nLin Li’s original plan was just to make Feng Kai feel fearful every time he took out a cheat sheet.\nThere’s a famous psychology experiment called Pavlov’s dog.\nBefore a dog salivated to eat, it was turned on a red light or a bell rang, and after some time, food was presented whenever the bell rang or red light appeared.\nLin Li intended to make Feng Kai develop PTSD over taking out cheat sheets similarly.\nWas it that he didn’t control the quantity well? Maybe too much fear was delivered at once, scaring him this much?\nLin Li checked the \"Bottle of Hidden Emotions\" and found that he still couldn’t precisely control the output; he’d just used almost half.\nFeng Kai, since you ate it, kudos to you.\nLin Li continued working on his test paper, not letting his guard down since he didn’t know how many cheat sheets Feng Kai had prepared.\nAs for Feng Kai.\nIt took him twenty whole minutes to barely suppress this unexplainable fear and anxiety, his body no longer trembling.\nWasting twenty minutes during an exam on this will be a memorable experience of his life.\nFeng Kai, who was dripping with cold sweat, wiped it off, and normal thinking once again occupied his mind.\nDang, when did I become so timid?\nThis teacher doesn’t care at all; how could I possibly get caught? I was simply worrying for nothing, scaring myself.\nNever mind, continue cheating.\nFeng Kai groped his empty pocket and fell silent.\nWhere did my cheat sheet go?\nFeng Kai, who had forgotten his actions due to excessive fear, gradually recalled everything.\nDid I eat something twenty minutes ago?\n...\n\"Ugh—\"\n\"Ugh—\"\n\"Hey, student, are you okay? Do you feel unwell?\" Although the invigilator in the afternoon wasn’t serious during the exam, he was genuinely a caring teacher. After hearing Feng Kai retching incessantly, he concernedly came down from the platform to inquire.\nFeng Kai: \"...\"\n\"No worries, teacher, it’s just a bit of a stomach issue,\" Feng Kai replied with a forced smile.\n\"Do you need to go to the infirmary?\"\n\"I think the counseling room might be more suitable for me.\"\nInvigilator: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 204: Chapter 175: Lin Li Successfully Holds Hands!\nIt was clear that in the geography subject, Feng Kai had only prepared one cheat sheet.\nOtherwise, he wouldn’t resort to sticking his fingers down his throat during the exam, looking ashen-faced.\nIt’s been twenty minutes since he swallowed it, not sure if there’s any point in gagging now.\nLin Li quickly finished the geography exam, then checked it twice from start to finish, correcting some small careless mistakes.\nThis exam wasn’t too difficult; Lin Li felt confident that he’d score at least ninety, maybe even higher.\nLin Li handed in his paper five minutes early and immediately left the classroom, wearing the earplugs he bought during lunch. He returned after the biology exam had started for a minute.\nHe absolutely couldn’t overhear others’ cheating plans again, especially from other exam rooms.\n...\nBiology exam.\nFeng Kai was silent.\nFeeling the sensation of the biology cheat sheet in his stomach, he smiled forcibly and weakly.\nIs this the taste of knowledge? So bitter.\nFeng Kai didn’t know what he was truly afraid of, but when scared, the brain can’t make rational decisions.\nLin Li, who orchestrated everything, remained humble, but he wasn’t smug about it.\nOn the contrary, he frowned deeply.\nHe thought his approach was fundamentally wrong.\nHe suspected Feng Kai would cheat in every upcoming subject. Was he just going to keep scaring him?\nRelying on this method constantly wasn’t realistic. Sooner or later, Feng Kai might become desensitized to fear and stop eating the cheat sheets, plus generating a lot of fear is also a mental burden for himself.\nIf it affected his own exam results, it was counterproductive.\nHis initial decision was wrong.\nDecided.\nLin Li planned to lay all cards on the table tomorrow, having thought of a makeshift excuse.\nHaving finished and checked the biology exam sheet, calculating the questions he had done similar exercises before, and given biology has almost no subjective questions, Lin Li estimated he could score near full marks.\nChecking again, Lin Li was ready to turn in his paper, but just as he stood up, he sat back down.\nHe sighed.\n—— Once he stood up and had a clear view, Lin Li saw the girl in front of him was looking at the phone in her drawer.\nHe wished he’d handed in his paper with his eyes closed; he let his guard down.\nFortunately, the invigilator didn’t notice him stand up and didn’t insist on him handing in the paper.\nWhy does this exam room have so many talents?\nHowever, Lin Li did believe that even in the top exam room, you wouldn’t miss seeing a crowd of ’cheaters’, because oftentimes, students with good grades are even more concerned about their scores.\nManifest \"Bottle of Hidden Emotions\", output.\nIn Lin Li’s vision, the girl immediately straightened her back and pushed her phone further into the drawer, making a slight bumping sound, but aside from Lin Li, no one noticed.\nDidn’t eat the phone, what a pity.\nHowever, Lin Li’s brows furrowed right after, because the emotions inside the \"Bottle of Hidden Emotions\" were used up.\nThe majority was spent on Feng Kai; Lin Li didn’t anticipate there’d be another expert in this exam room. To ensure Feng Kai would repeat the behavior and with just this subject left, it wasn’t saved.\nAs for absorbing emotions on-site, now in this exam room, he could at most absorb some anxiety towards the end of the exam time.\nAnxiety directed at the girl in front might actually fuel her desire to look at her phone.\nHe hadn’t considered thoroughly enough, leading to the current situation.\nPeople must pay for their wrong decisions, but largely it’s also because the task activated at the wrong time. If it activated yesterday, he might have made a more rational judgment.\nSuddenly standing up to report her now, with the cheating method being a phone and the physiological gender being female, all the BUFF was stacked, making it much more troublesome to deal with later.\nBut Lin Li, being a Cultivator, had other means.\nHe looked at the \"Treasure Bag\" in the [warehouse], now was a good time to test this tool.\nAfter completing this task, there would be gains.\n[You have used the \"Treasure Bag\", and for the next hour, you will have the ability: \"Treasure Bag\".]\nLin Li took a deep breath, and instead of immediately aiming to traverse into the girl’s drawer, he only intended to traverse a few centimeters ahead of himself to check the effect.\nHe used his left hand, which wasn’t easily noticed by those in the classroom.\nWhen Lin Li had the thought of traversing, he saw the space at the tip of his left finger, and the space he wanted to traverse to, become distorted. Then, as his hand moved forward, it was like a portal opened between the two places, and the fingertip appeared out of thin air.\nMagical.\nSystem, I really wish I could learn this.\nIf I could permanently learn this, I wouldn’t need to glance around adjusting my underwear, doing so many fake moves anymore.\nI could also scratch if it itched directly.\nWait, now’s not the time to daydream about that. Lin Li started setting the teleportation space in the girl’s drawer.\nLin Li intended to take the phone into his hand to see if it had a lock screen password. If it didn’t, he’d turn up the volume and open TikTok. If it did, he wouldn’t return it for now, and would wait until the exam was about to end to give it back.\nAnyway, if it disappeared, she wouldn’t dare say anything.\nThe plan was flawless once more, and Lin Li focused intently, estimating the drawer’s position, performing telekinesis from afar!\nGot it!\nEh?\n...\nWei Jing didn’t know why she was so scared just then, but fortunately, the fear came and went quickly.\nStill couldn’t do the questions, so she hastily searched for answers; there was still time.",

So she slightly turned her body and reached out to get the phone she had just tossed in.\nGot it!\nHuh?\nWhat did I grab? Why does it feel so strange?\nWei Jing instinctively tried to withdraw her hand but failed, so she bent over to look at the drawer.\nShe saw two hands interlocked at the fingers.\nOne was hers, and the other seemed not to be hers.\nHuh?\nHuh.\nHuh!!!!\n\"Ah!!!!!\"\nEveryone in the examination room turned their attention to Wei Jing, who had jumped up and screamed suddenly, and many were startled.\nThe invigilating teacher, who had been mentally absent except for a moment ago when he worried about Feng Kai, stood up too, looking concerned and worried at the frightened Wei Jing, and asked, puzzled, \"What’s wrong, student?\"\n\"Hand! Hand, there’s a hand! There’s a hand in my drawer!\"\nWei Jing had retreated a meter away and was standing beside Lin Li, so scared that she stammered, pointing at her drawer with a trembling voice.\n\"Hand? A hand in the drawer?\" The invigilating teacher was confused, completely unable to understand Wei Jing’s statement.\nIs there a bug named ’shou’ in the drawer?\nHe had already moved beside Wei Jing’s position, bent down to check the drawer, then took out a phone: \"Oh oh, are you talking about this phone? It should belong to the student at this location, right? Ha, what’s so scary about a phone.\"\nThe invigilating teacher chuckled helplessly.\nAnd he didn’t suspect at all that this phone was Wei Jing’s.\n\"No, sir! There was a human hand in the drawer! I even shook hands with it just now!\" Wei Jing’s language ability recovered a bit, and she quickly waved her hand and said.\n\"Ah?\" The invigilating teacher seemed to have heard something unbelievable and checked the drawer meticulously again. He even motioned Wei Jing to come closer and used his phone to turn on the torch:\n\"Look, there’s nothing else, just a few books. Kid, are you too stressed? It’s alright, it’s just a small test, relax.\"\nWei Jing also calmed down significantly. Could it be... it was really an illusion?\nRecalling it now, it indeed was ridiculous; what happened just now was like a horror movie.\nWei Jing returned to her seat, checked once again herself, and, darn it, there really was nothing.\nMaybe she should really take a good rest.\n\"Sorry, teacher, maybe it was my mistake just now.\" Wei Jing apologized, biting her lip.\n\"It’s okay, it’s okay, continue with the test.\" The invigilating teacher waved his hand, redirecting the students around back to focus on the test, simultaneously pointing to Lin Li behind Wei Jing and lecturing:\n\"You guys should learn from this student, stay focused, look at this student, hasn’t lifted his head the whole time, diligently working on the test paper, don’t just lose focus at the slightest disturbance.\"\nFeng Kai: \"...\"\nWas that little disturbance just now a slight one?\nWasn’t that more like heavenly fire?\nThe girl screamed so loudly, someone who can not get distracted by that is practically a miracle worker.\nFeng Kai now suspected that the guy behind Wei Jing might be deaf, how else could it be possible to have no reaction?\n\"Teacher, can you return my phone?\"\nSeeing the invigilating teacher about to return to the podium, Wei Jing asked weakly.\n\"Oh, this is your phone, okay.\" The invigilating teacher nodded, reaching out halfway, then withdrew his hand, realizing something wasn’t right: \"Eh? Why did you bring a phone?\"\nWei Jing: \"I...\"\n\"Why did you bring it to the examination room?\"\nWei Jing: \"I...\"\n\"Ask your homeroom teacher to get it from me later.\"\nWei Jing: \"Darn...\"\nWei Jing could only watch as her phone was taken away, feeling deeply regretful.\nFrightened herself, and her phone was confiscated.\nWhy did she see such a hallucination!!!\nUgh, the hand in the drawer turning left is the most annoying!\nThe classroom was silent.\nA guilty Lin Li finally stopped scribbling randomly on the test paper.\nWhere’s the diligent writing of the test paper, he was just drawing lumps of black circles here.\n\"Whew—\"\nSweat was pouring.\nLin Li didn’t anticipate catching a hand instead of a phone.\nNor did he expect such a huge reaction from the girl just from holding hands; Lin Li admitted he was handsome, but even then, this was somewhat unnecessary.\nThe cheating plan with the person at the desk in front was completely destroyed, and it was time to escape this place; meanwhile, outside, he could test the \"remote grabbing\" ability more boldly.\nSo Lin Li, who had prepared in advance, got up immediately to hand in the test paper.\n\"Teacher, I’m submitting the paper.\"\n\"You can leave it here, huh? Why are you squinting?\" The invigilating teacher nodded, raised his head, and asked puzzledly upon realizing Lin Li was squinting.\n\"Teacher, it’s just that my eyes are small.\"\nOf course, that’s nonsense, he was afraid of seeing the next phone or other cheating individuals.\nInvigilating teacher: \"?\"\nIs that right? Wasn’t his eyes like this back when I praised him?\nSeeing the invigilating teacher not speaking further, Lin Li immediately left the classroom, carrying his backpack to the nearly empty playground.\n...\nThrough a period of experimentation, Lin Li got some understanding of this ability.\nFirst, the distance for remotely grabbing objects was indeed only two meters, the minimum guaranteed by the ability.\nSecond, the \"remote grabbing\" can carry objects through space but has a limit; the objects cannot be larger than the size of Lin Li’s palm, for instance, a long stick couldn’t be pulled sideways but could be pulled when vertical.\nThird, it can grab living creatures, but there are limitations; Lin Li successfully remotely grabbed an ant but couldn’t bring his right hand when trying to grab his left, even making his left unable to return, likely due to the object being too large.",

He decided to stock up a few.\nLin Li now redeemed today’s quota, turning the inventory of \"Pocket Snatcher\" in the [Warehouse] back to 1.\nPoints are only 210 now, Lin Li decided to pause the daily Spirit Stone exchange.\n\"Pocket Snatcher,\" Lin Li still plans to exchange another, leaving only 160.\nDon’t want refreshing great 50-system currency stuff later and end up without enough.\nThe heavy hope on Spirit Stone is still placed on completing the one-month body training task early next month.\n...\nThe next day.\nToday’s exams are in mathematics, physics, politics, and technology, starting at eight in the morning; Lin Li came a bit early.\n\"Words reveal the truth, whispers of the old days, human interests and emotions in books are meaningless, indescribable, driving people mad, the more you read, the lonelier and more despairing you become, haha, I understand, I completely understand, ’Physics’ is the true Cthulhu novel, haha! I’ve made it!\"\nWhen Lin Li came to the exam hall in the morning, as soon as Bai Bufan saw Lin Li, he started raving.\nAnother one has become foolish.\nEven though the next test is math, Bai Bufan was looking at physics.\nAfter all, compared to these two pure science subjects, physics has slightly more content to memorize.\nLin Li, this time, when the classroom was about full, went up to the podium table, clapped his hands to attract everyone’s attention.\n\"Sorry to interrupt everyone! I’m in a bad mood recently because last night I was killed thirty times in a row by a spinning opponent in the game, so I particularly hate cheaters.\nIf anyone’s cheating, better not let me find out, or I’ll apologize in advance, I’ll report you. This is serious, not a joke, please understand, and finally, sorry again for disturbing you all.\"\nLin Li used relatively gentle words to say something slightly harsh, then stepped down.\nThis was Lin Li’s prepared revelation.\nThis would affect him less than suddenly reporting someone.\nAfter all, he already gave a warning, so it’s not an unspoken backstab of the student class.\n—It’s an audible backstab.\nFaced with Lin Li’s speech, some people found it baffling, some didn’t care since they weren’t planning to cheat anyway, some guys laughed out loud when they heard Lin Li was killed thirty times, and some like Feng Kai widened their eyes.\nWhen Lin Li returned to his seat, Bai Bufan came forward with concern:\n\"Lin Li, are you okay, feeling better? Competitive gaming cheaters are pure tombs, they’re like Yang Weinan buying a cannon machine, making his much-ridden wife fly up, then thinks he’s really amazing just because he pressed the button.\nNo need to deal with such idiots.\"\nBufan really has nothing to say about himself; seeing me looking truly upset, he immediately came to comfort me.\nLin Li smirked and whispered closer to Bai Bufan, sharing a closer-to-the-truth statement: \"Actually, I’m not upset, I was lying to them, I just wanted to report those cheating, found it quite amusing, wanted to mess around.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nHe was silent for a moment.\n\"Lin Li, you seem very sunny but in fact very dark. Your sunshine is all pretense,\" Bai Bufan commented.\nLin Li, upon hearing this, instead laughed proudly: \"That’s right, I’m such a person, usually joke around with you, very easygoing...\"\n\"That’s not what I mean.\" Bai Bufan shook his head.\n\"What?\"\n\"I said you’re feigned sunshine.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nDamn you.",

      "content": "Chapter 207: Chapter 176: Slash for the Brothers\n\"Hey, follow me to the bathroom, and I’ll show you if I’m pretending to be something I’m not,\" Lin Li said with a cold smile, reaching out to drag Bai Bufan outside.\n\"Huh? No need for that, bro, really,\" Bai Bufan waved his hand, then clenched his fist to boost morale, \"I support you! I truly despise cheaters. There aren’t many like me who can resist the temptation of a new phone and rely solely on myself.\nIf there were more people like me in the world, it would undoubtedly become a better place.\"\n\"Because you damn well sit in the first row,\" Lin Li sneered, pointing at Bai Bufan’s spot in the exam room.\nThe last second group, first seat, possibly the most insecure position.\n\"It’s got nothing to do with the front row. Even if I sat in the second row, I wouldn’t cheat,\" Bai Bufan said disappointedly, surprised at how Lin Li saw him.\n\"And what if it’s the third row?\" Lin Li inquired.\nBai Bufan didn’t respond.\n\"I’m asking you a question,\" Lin Li smirked.\n\"We’ll see when the time comes,\" Bai Bufan chuckled.\nAfter confirming there were no emotional issues with Lin Li, he returned to his seat and continued reading the Cthulhu novel \"Physics.\"\nBeside him, the somewhat anxious Feng Kai finally had his chance, immediately making some sounds to draw Lin Li’s attention, and asked, \"Bro, were you serious just now?\"\n\"Just joking, I was kidding,\" Lin Li replied.\n\"Phew—\" Feng Kai breathed a sigh of relief, wearing an expression of ’I knew it,’ \"Bro, you scared me. By the way, how are your math and physics scores? Want to discuss them later?\"\n\"You might have misunderstood me. When I said ’kidding,’ I meant that I was kidding about ’joking’—I wasn’t kidding. If I catch you cheating, I’ll report it,\" Lin Li explained with a gentle smile.\nFeng Kai: \"...\"\nGetting played twice in one sentence? That’s a bit much.\nFeng Kai’s expression became slightly more serious, trying to appeal with reason, \"Bro, there’s no need for this, right? I understand you’re pissed because of that backstab, and you’re upset, but you need to find the right outlet, no need to take it out on others.\"\nLin Li couldn’t be bothered to respond, resting one hand on the desk, twirling a pen, waiting for the exam to start.\nFeng Kai grew more anxious, stood up, and slapped his palm on his desk, \"Bro, what you’re doing is betraying all of us students, it’s disloyal, unfilial, unkind, unjust, impolite, unwise, untrustworthy!\"\n\"You’re right.\"\nSeeing that his persuasion finally seemed to work, Feng Kai relaxed a bit.\nBut Lin Li hadn’t finished, \"I am indeed disloyal and un... whatever? Anyway, I’m exactly the kind of person you described, so either cheat without me noticing, or be prepared for me to report it.\"\nScrewing up occasionally is enjoyable, but consistently screwing up is even more delightful.\nWhy care about the possible gossip in school?\nNow, Feng Kai was somewhat angry, slapping the desk again, \"Have you thought about others retaliating against you?\"\n\"But I’m not cheating in this monthly exam, so I’m temporarily invincible,\" Lin Li remained unmoved.\n\"But have you thought about your classmates, your friends? What will you do when your class gets targeted by the whole school because of you?\" Feng Kai continued to nag.\nLin Li sighed, got up, walked over to Feng Kai, and pointed to Bai Bufan who was sitting in the first row far away, \"Look, that’s my best buddy. No matter what kind of revenge, aim it at him, I’ll take it for him.\"\nFeng Kai: \"...\"\n\"No, bro, what I meant was...\"\nFeng Kai’s words were cut off by Lin Li, who looked at him indifferently, \"I don’t care about your point. My point is you should just stop babbling; it’s noisy. It’s your bad luck to encounter me in this monthly exam, it’s that simple. You think cheating puts you on a moral high ground?\nReporting cheating makes my class targeted by the whole school? Can you represent the whole school, or can you rally the whole school? That’s enough, bro.\"\nLin Li returned to his seat and continued twirling his pen, while Feng Kai said nothing more.\nEven when Lin Li, already tall for a freshman year, suddenly put on a cold face, the pressure was instantly felt, and Feng Kai was intimidated.\nLin Li turned his head: hehe.\n...\nIn the morning’s math and physics exams, perhaps because there wasn’t much point in cheating, Lin Li didn’t see anyone cheating.\nAfter taking the two exams, Lin Li felt fairly good about his performance.\nFor math, Lin Li only missed the third sub-question of the last question; everything else was filled in. The only uncertain part was the last fill-in-the-blank question. Regarding the last multiple choice question, Lin Li had done a similar problem before, so he believed he had the correct answer.\nHe filled in everything for physics, but whether it’s right or not is another matter, because physics is a subject where a problem with one formula or calculation can cause cascading errors.\nHowever, in the afternoon, with the first subject being politics, some people were immediately eager to cheat.\nLin Li had been deliberately avoiding seeing others cheat, but when the politics teacher came around to distribute corrections for printing errors in the exam paper, he couldn’t avoid looking up.\nAfter the politics teacher left, Lin Li sighed and directly spoke loud enough for the whole classroom to hear:\n\"Teacher, the student in the fourth row of the fourth group should be looking at a cheat sheet, it’s in the drawer, oh, now it seems to have been dropped underneath and pressed with a shoe...\"\nFeng Kai looked at Lin Li who was broadcasting the cheating live, and realized he had to be honest.\nSeeing is believing.\nThis guy was serious, it’s best to keep his cheat sheet hidden in his pocket.\nThe invigilator naturally couldn’t ignore Lin Li’s words, confirmed them, seized the cheat sheet, and it was rather benevolent, at least allowing the reported student to continue the exam. Some stricter invigilators would have immediately stopped the exam, indicating the student failed.\n...\n\"You really reported it, didn’t you? Damn!\" After the exam ended and the invigilator had just walked out, Zhang Wei came straight at Lin Li with red eyes.\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan immediately stood up, his voice preceding him before his presence, \"It’s cheaters like you that get reported, so what? Lin Li, I’ll back you up! Mess with my bro, and I’ll cut you down.\"\nLin Li felt touched—Bai Bufan actually stood up for him immediately.\nHold on.\nLin Li saw Bai Bufan reaching the doorway, about to leave the classroom, \"Where the hell are you going to back me up?\"\n\"I’m going back to the dorm to get my phone to help you cut a deal on Pinduoduo.\"\nLin Li gave a thumbs-up.\nHope he’s a new user.\n\"Keep it up, if you can slice out five hundred bucks, the ashes can stay at the parcel locker for ten years, which is much cheaper than buying a cemetery plot.\"\n\"Business prodigy!\" Bai Bufan’s eyes lit up.\nSeeing these two chatting made Zhang Wei even angrier. He quickly approached Lin Li, just as he was about to pound on Lin Li’s desk, Lin Li casually placed his right hand on Zhang Wei’s head, rubbing it, with a benevolent smile that could melt any creature:\n\"Don’t get worked up, it’s just a minor issue, nothing to be angry about.\"\nHis left hand peeked out the mouth of the \"Bottle of Desires\" from his pocket.\n\"That makes sense,\" Zhang Wei nodded, finding himself less angry. Indeed, he was in the wrong first, feeling ashamed and angry, and Lin Li indeed seemed daunting.\nBut leaving just like that didn’t feel right; he thought he had to leave some harsh words, give himself an out:\n\"I’ll let you off this time, just don’t report again in the future, be sensible.\"\n\"That’s not possible, I’ll still report if I see it, it’s better if you’re sensible,\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"Don’t disrespect me...\" Zhang Wei’s face turned angry again, reaching out to grab Lin Li’s collar, but Lin Li held it down.\n\"Forget it, you don’t respect me, I won’t either, whoever wants respect can have it,\" Zhang Wei changed his tone.\nAfter saying this, he withdrew his hand and left the classroom.\nEveryone present who wanted to see the drama unfold was stunned, especially Feng Kai, who was eagerly awaiting a violent spectacle.\nNo way, that’s it?\nEven Bai Bufan, who was ready to go out and rally people to back Lin Li up, returned to the classroom, looking at Lin Li’s hands in confusion, \"Hey Lin Li, what did you just do?\"\n\"Moved him with love,\" Lin Li smiled innocently, \"Actually, I’m Nangong Wenya, touching someone makes them dumb.\"\nBai Bufan suddenly felt a bit shy, \"I had a crush on Wenya when I was a kid...\"\n\"Shut up, I don’t know you, disgusting, get lost,\" Lin Li said with a dark face.\n\"Just kidding, just kidding, my crushes were Dongfang Tie Xin and Beiming Xue,\" Bai Bufan changed his tune.\n\"That’s just human nature. I’ve actually made mistakes too; my crush was Ximen Xiao,\" Lin Li sighed with relief.\n\"...You’re the real master,\" Bai Bufan admitted.\nThe two of them bantered for a while.\nThen Lin Li returned to his seat, took out his technical textbook, and looked interestingly towards the door.\nDuring the second round, he didn’t have time to absorb the anger.\nWasted one [charging].\n...\nZhang Wei, heading towards the bathroom, turned around to make sure no one was following him out of the classroom, then sharply shook his right hand.\n\"Hiss—ha—\"\n\"Damn bro, if you have martial virtue, you should have said so earlier!\"\n\"I would’ve behaved earlier, right?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 208: Chapter 177 FBI Warning: Diabetics Enter with Caution\nIt must be said that the effect of killing chickens to warn monkeys is indeed immediate.\nAfter Zhang Wei was reported, the following subject was also one with significant cheating benefits, but the exam hall was particularly honest.\nLin Li could even notice many people turning their heads to look at him while taking the exam.\n——Without realizing it, he’s gone from being a test-taker to an invigilator.\n...\nAfter the afternoon exam was finished, Lin Li returned to the classroom after dining outside.\nDuring exam week, there are people reciting everywhere, almost every stair corner had someone squatting there.\nUnfortunately, Lin Li, who had activated the [Strong Memory] cheat, had sadly formed a thick barrier between him and them.\nIsn’t reciting just a matter of looking once and knowing it?\n\"Wei Jin Southern and Northern Dynasties, absurd yet beautiful, men are steamed, women are fried, children are skewered for barbecue.\" In the corridor at the front of Class Four’s door, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei were sitting with their buttocks on Lin Li’s desk, reciting.\nThey’ve gone crazy studying again.\n\"Baowei, how was today’s exam?\" Lin Li didn’t mind and, after pulling his chair open to sit, asked casually.\nZhou Baowei snorted: \"Just a minor monthly exam, what’s there to fear?\"\nSo confident? Lin Li was preparing to start mocking.\n\"He takes whatever is on the exam.\"\n\"Really got screwed.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSo, it turns out you are only afraid of what is on the exam. Well, it seems there’s no need to mock.\n\"Damn, today’s politics exam was the most ridiculous. Why were there no questions on what I studied?\" Zhou Baowei was still not done complaining, full of resentment.\nLin Li frowned upon hearing this; those short answer questions in today’s politics exam mostly didn’t require referencing materials, you just needed to memorize the answers; the points were quite ’popular,’ it shouldn’t be entirely missed.\nThinking of a possibility, Lin Li squinted his eyes: \"Baowei, what did you study?\"\n\"Studied nothing.\" Zhou Baowei answered instantly.\n\"You son of a bitch!\"\nLin Li directly punched Baowei’s thigh.\nAfter landing a punch, he got a bit addicted, Lin Li started continuously punching with force, even turning to Bai Bufan: \"Bufan, homemade pork meatballs with manual beating, want a bowl?\"\n\"Give me a pound.\"\nZhou Baowei raised his middle finger to Lin Li, but didn’t stop Lin Li from beating him; rather, he asked with interest: \"Lin Li, you have a natural massage saint physique, your beating feels quite comfortable, why don’t you massage my leg every day, I’ll give you 20 a month.\"\n\"Is Lin Li this cheap? Add a zero, then maybe.\" Lin Li snorted.\n\"Alright, 20 for 10 months.\" Zhou Baowei nodded, his smile was gratified, hadn’t seen such an employee who thinks of the boss in a long time.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li widened his eyes, but then looked towards Bai Bufan, expression mournful:\n\"Bufan, it’s over, Baowei has evolved, he is no longer that ugly, dumb, funny, pitiful waste who you could just kick like a ball with no retaliation as Baowei, he is now that ugly, dumb, funny, pitiful waste who you could just kick like a ball but occasionally retaliates as Baowei.\"\nBai Bufan’s eyes welled up upon hearing: \"What!? Woe is me! Tragedy!\"\n\"There’s no need to emphasize those adjectives twice, damn it! You two dogs!\" Now it’s time for Zhou Baowei to massage Lin Li.\n\"Zero? I just heard someone say zero. Where’s the zero?\" Wang Ze’s head peeked from the classroom window, asking expectantly.\nThen received a gaze of idiocy from the three people.\n\"Alright, seems there’s no zero, but it’s okay, I can become zero,\" Wang Ze peeked his head further out, staring sincerely at Zhou Baowei’s crotch: \"Baowei, why do you have the key to my back door?\"\nThe corridor quieted for a second.\nEveryone was thinking.\n\"Damn it!!\"\nZhou Baowei left Lin Li’s desk clutching his crotch, a face full of fear while Lin Li and Bai Bufan laughed and clapped, giving thumbs up to Wang Ze: \"New and good, you’re impressive.\"\n\"Hehe.\" Wang Ze scratched his head, \"So anyone want to open the door?\"\n\"Get lost.\"\nEvening self-study was about to begin, and Lin Li drove Bai Bufan down, moved the table back into the classroom — the corridor lighting was too dim, the main reason being the teacher wouldn’t allow it.\nBecause Lin Li didn’t need to recite much, the main focus during evening self-study was on studying chemistry questions.\n\"Okay, got it.\" During break, after concluding Chen Yuying’s analysis at her desk, Lin Li nodded and snapped his fingers.\n\"How have you been doing in exams these days, confident to make it to the top hundred?\" Chen Yuying looked up at the tall Lin Li, tilting her head and asking.\n\"Up to now quite confident, the exams don’t seem too difficult, how about you, class president?\" Lin Li reciprocated.\n\"Same as you, quite confident to make it to the top hundred.\" Chen Yuying replied.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThis, this is not the same, right?\nDing Sihan suddenly asked mischievously: \"Lin Li, where’s your brooch, I want to compliment it?\"\nChen Yuying chuckled, Lin Li gave a middle finger back.\nOf course knowing that Ding Sihan was teasing him, why Yu Yu shared everything with the dorm people.\nOn the way to return to his seat, he saw Zhou Baowei still bent over writing during the break, he curiously put his head over.\nThe small piece of paper was filled with ant-sized characters.\nLin Li was silent.\n\"Baowei, is this a cheat note?\" He confirmed.\n\"That’s right, Old Jian said it well, a good memory is not as good as a bad pen, especially my lousy memory, it relies on the pen,\" Zhou Baowei nodded.\nWhen will I possibly manage to suppress the curiosity of wanting to peek everywhere.\nThe task was practically completed, yet now the burden increased.\n\"Do you dare explain this understanding to Xue Jian?\" Lin Li heavily patted Zhou Baowei’s shoulder, then seriously added: \"Baowei, cheating is disgraceful.\"\n\"Lin Li, but a 5000 yuan feast is edible.\" Baowei said passionately.\n\"Baowei, don’t be like this, reciting is indeed difficult, but when you find this path tough, it means it’s uphill, while running slowly, pleasant laughter surrounds, but running fast, whooshing wind surrounds...\"\nLin Li hoped to awaken the conscience in Baowei’s heart.\nYet conscience isn’t something everyone has.\n\"Lin Li, don’t pour chicken soup, those successful people who said these words have all eaten the chicken, I too want to eat the chicken, I don’t just want to drink the soup, no need for more words, my mind is decided.\" Baowei waved his hand.\nThis guy’s talent for eating is a bit excessive.\nLin Li looked at Zhou Baowei and smiled.\nSince that’s the case.\nI’ve made up my mind.\nAlthough Zhou Baowei is not in the same exam hall as me, if it’s just him, there is still a solution.\n...\nThe next day, Friday, the last day of the monthly exam.\nIn the afternoon, after the chemistry exam and just before the final subject, history, Lin Li came to Zhou Baowei’s exam hall and waved at him from outside.\n\"What’s up?\" Zhou Baowei walked out and asked, puzzled.\n\"Can I borrow your history book for a bit? Last-minute cramming, Bufan and I didn’t bring ours,\" Lin Li said.\n\"Sure.\" Bao Wei went in and brought out the textbook.\nAfter looking at it for a few minutes, Lin Li changed his tune and said, \"Bao Wei, the knowledge points in the book are too vague. Do you have your cheat sheet? Let me jot down the points on it.\"\n\"Be careful not to let anyone see,\" Zhou Baowei surveyed his surroundings first, then took out that almost black ’white paper’ from his pocket.\nLin Li looked at it for a long time, until the proctor arrived with new test papers.\n\"I’m out of time, I have to get into the exam hall, Lin Li!\" Zhou Baowei said in a lowered voice.\n\"Alright, handing back your cheat sheet.\"\nLin Li watched Zhou Baowei enter the exam hall, an evil smile on his face.\n...\nExam in progress.\nBao Wei’s exam hall.\nThe exam had been going on for almost forty minutes, and it turned out the efforts from last night and this morning had helped, but only a little.\nThere were still too many questions on the history paper that he couldn’t answer at all.\nFortunately, Zhou Baowei recalled that most of this was noted in his cheat sheet.\nHis cheat sheet was practically the Yongle Encyclopedia.\nHe glanced at the teacher; the afternoon proctor was quite strict, diligently overseeing the exam, still seated at the lectern. Zhou Baowei reached for his pocket.\nHe took out the cheat sheet, densely packed with tiny characters to cram as much information as possible into the smallest space.\nZhou Baowei looked down at his cheat sheet, ready to absorb the knowledge.\n\"Zhongli: Cheating? Interesting!\"\n\"Thunder General: At this moment, when silence falls!\"\n\"Barbatos: May the Wind God bless you!\"\n\"Keli: Boom~ Boom~ Bomb!\"\n\"Jean: Keli!\"\n\"...\"\nWhat the hell, it’s Genshin!\nHow did his cheat sheet become all Genshin!\nThis clearly isn’t his handwriting!\nWho the heck switched his cheat sheet! It could only be Lin Li, that sword grave!\nDamn! What a beast! This guy even impersonated his cheat sheet, writing a whole paper to pull a switcheroo! Aren’t you tired!\nZhou Baowei felt a shortness of breath.\nLast night, he heard from Bufan that Lin Li had been abused by a gamer and recently hated cheating, but seeing Lin Li’s nonchalant response earlier, he thought their good relationship meant special treatment.\nNow... it seems like he was indeed treated specially, just in a brotherly way.\nLin Li, damn you! Just wait!\nFootsteps approached, and Zhou Baowei looked up; the proctor had unknowingly already stepped down from the lectern and was walking toward him.\nHe hurriedly stuffed the cheat sheet into the drawer.\n\"Take out the cheat sheet.\" Unexpectedly, the proctor came straight to him, rapping his knuckles on his desk with such a cold tone.\n\"Teacher, I don’t have a cheat sheet,\" Zhou Baowei said weakly.\n\"Do you need me to help you take it out? I’ll give you three seconds, three—\" This proctor’s oppression was even stronger than Xue Jian’s.\nZhou Baowei gritted his teeth, took out the paper, and handed it to the proctor.\n\"Take your pen and paper and get out, you don’t need to take this subject, your homeroom teacher will find you later.\" With a cold laugh, the proctor took the small paper but didn’t let Zhou Baowei off the hook, even starting to collect his answer sheet.\n\"Teacher, wait!\" If his answer sheet was collected, the five-thousand-yuan feast would be completely gone, Zhou Baowei was anxious, holding down his answer sheet while emphasizing, \"Teacher, that really isn’t a cheat sheet.\"\n\"Still stubborn? What is this if not a cheat sheet? Want me to read it out?\" Seeing Zhou Baowei stubbornly clinging to his claim, his character only intensified his anger, so his voice grew louder, holding the cheat sheet up to his face, \"Keli: Boom~ Boom~ Bomb——\"\nStudents who had been focused looked up in shock, and upon realizing what was being said, the proctor shut his mouth.\nHe stared at the contents of the cheat sheet, eyes widening but pupils contracting.\nA whole page of Genshin quotes?\nNo, dude.\nI need insulin.\nI need insulin.\nHelp!\n\"Teacher, I already said it’s not a cheat sheet.\" Zhou Baowei pressed his temple, looking down at the desk.\nThe only connection this paper has with history is probably that it’s all lore.\nWhile he proved himself, Zhou Baowei didn’t feel much better.\nAfter a long silence, a crumpled ’cheat sheet’ rolled to Zhou Baowei’s feet, the proctor’s voice lacking its usual authority: \"Continue the exam, and don’t bring things unrelated to the exam into the hall again.\"\n\"Got it...\"\nZhou Baowei was in a complex mood.\nLin Li, thank you, but screw your virtual mom.\nLin Li, screw your virtual mom, but thank you.",

      "content": "Chapter 209: Chapter 178 Occasionally, It’s Nice to Have Pets\nOne of the classic horror film suspense scenes is when you turn your head and find an ugly, disgusting face pressed against the glass, with distorted features staring at the camera with a resentful and hateful gaze.\nAs it turns out, such scenes can appear not only in horror films but also during monthly exams.\nLin Li pretended not to notice Zhou Baowei’s face. After confirming his student number and name were correctly written, he handed in his test early.\nWith the assistance of [Strong Memory], history became too easy.\nAfter submitting his test, Task 4 was not completed yet. Most likely, it would only be finished after the sect competition officially concluded.\n\"Lin Li!!\"\nJust after leaving the exam room, Zhou Baowei gave him a loving hug and whispered fiercely.\n\"Bao Wei, why did my Genshin Impact guide disappear? Any ideas?\" The two tacitly left the exam area and headed to the staircase, where Lin Li struck first.\n\"How dare you accuse me! I’ll kill you, Lin Li! You’re like seven kilograms of gold—four thousand added!\" Zhou Baowei was even angrier.\n\"It’s all for your own good. You’ll understand once you grow up.\"\nLin Li emphasized while dodging Zhou Baowei’s attacks.\n\"Forget it, let’s call it a blessing in disguise. I’m sparing you this time.\" Zhou Baowei heaved a sigh of relief, with large-hearted empathy.\nThe main reason was Master Zhou’s kind heart, the secondary reason being Master Zhou couldn’t catch Lin Li.\n\"What’s up?\" Lin Li, sensing there was more to it, curiously asked.\nThe staircase soon echoed with his carefree laughter. After hearing the story, Lin Li heavily patted Zhou Baowei’s shoulder: \"Bao Wei, I actually saved you.\"\n\"Damn, but during the exam, the teacher kept looking at me with the eyes of a poet! Is this considered rescue?\"\n\"Poet? A broken halberd, recognizing the sand wall with wine, right? Hahaha.\"\nPain and joy between people aren’t truly shared; Lin Li only thought Bao Wei naturally didn’t like to laugh.\n\"Sigh, it feels like my grand feast is ruined, heartbroken in September. I hope next month will be kinder to me.\" Zhou Baowei sighed deeply.\n\"Still hoping? You’re hopeless like Mi Haisa, wishing each month would be nicer to you. In reality, you’re a thick L who wishes you dead every month.\" Lin Li sneered.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nFlat out, Lin Li, your words really hurt.\n\"I can’t live, I want to commit suicide, I’m going to jump right now, you better stop me.\" Zhou Baowei gave up and sulkily squatted at the stairs, his expression gloomy.\n\"It’s your own doing; if you had memorized seriously, you wouldn’t be this miserable. Besides, a little setback like this can knock you down? Push yourself for the next exam.\" Lin Li scolded.\n\"I was a kid who always played the invincible versions of 7K7K games, what kind of resilience do you expect?\" Zhou Baowei had no motivation, even rebutting confidently.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nCan’t argue, clearly no tolerance for setbacks.\n\"You play 7K7K? Not 4399? 7K7K is full of games for little girls!\" Lin Li thought the more crucial point now was arguing about something else.\n\"7K7K had adult content very early on.\" Zhou Baowei said succinctly.\nThat’s quite good.\nAbsolutely outmatched 4399.\nSeems like my awakening came a bit late.\n\"Then why not play 3366 or 2144? As a kid, I was there blowing up girls’ skirts all day, and finding faults in beauty pictures, fun and playful.\" Bai Bufan, who also finished his test, eagerly joined the conversation upon hearing this.\n\"Hello, Teacher.\" But Lin Li didn’t respond, instead greeting with respectful nod towards the stairway.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nHe turned and ran.\nZhou Baowei looked up toward the empty stairway, and seeing Bai Bufan who had run off, afraid of being seen by the ’teacher,’ he gave Lin Li a thumbs up:\n\"I really like Hu Yifei’s quote. You don’t learn other weapons, Lin Li, but choose to master the sword. Can’t practice upper sword, don’t practice lower sword, natural sword species, nothing to critique.\"\nSee how scared Bai Bufan was.\n...\nLin Li and Zhou Baowei returned to Class 4’s entrance.\nIn Class 4, only a few persistent test-takers were left.\nThose in the corridor were mostly Class 4 students.\nEveryone returned to the classroom in sync—not because they agreed to do so, but because the school gates stayed shut until the exam officially ended, so going home wasn’t possible. Better to return to class and keep their papers, saving getting scolded by the teacher later.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, are you ready to call me daddy?\" Seeing Wang Yuezhi in the corridor, Lin Li laughed with arms akimbo, looking villainous.\n\"To think you’d have such courage after the exam, beats me who gave it to you.\" Wang Yuezhi scoffed, feeling secure with his advantage.\n\"The courage from the class monitor’s sincere, gentle, and full effort teaching this month.\" Lin Li smartly replied.\nWang Yuezhi turned and left, seemingly making a firm decision without hesitation.\nClearly, Class 4 was his home.\nWhy leave one’s homeland?\nHis departing silhouette, somehow seemed a bit desolate.\nClass 4 was Exam Room 5—the main exam room was the school auditorium.\nThe closer to the main exam rooms, the more likely to have students taking it till the very last second.\nClass 4 was among them.\n\"Ring—\"\nThe bell signaled the end of the exam, only then did the scattered students willingly submit their papers.\n[Task 4 completed.]\n[You have earned a reward: Physical Improvement: Insight Enhancement 10%; Random System Rewards*1; System Currency*100]\nReturning his desk and chair to the class, Lin Li viewed the system’s message.",

      "content": "Chapter 210: Chapter 178 Occasionally, It’s Nice to Have Pets_2\nThe mind became a bit clearer, and some previously stubborn issues now have new perspectives for understanding.\n[You have activated a random reward from the system, you received a Random Reward Double Card (3/3) *1.]\n[Random Reward Double Card (3/3): When completing a system task, you may choose to use this card. One random reward from the task’s rewards will be doubled. This card is usable three times, limited to once per task.]\nFor Lin Li, who is lacking everything right now, this is pretty good stuff that can double three rewards.\nWith the recent sect competition task, as long as the result comes out with him in the top hundred, then [Physical Improvement: Wisdom Improvement 20%; Divine Sense Mental Enhancement 100%; Random Magical Artifact *1], doubling any of these three rewards would be a significant boost for Lin Li.\nWisdom means intelligence, Divine Sense allows for easier use of abilities and artifacts, and the artifact itself is treasure.\nAfter finishing moving the tables and setting the exam papers, Lin Li returned home.\nAfter dinner, Lin Li sat at home, feeling somewhat at a loss.\nAlthough this was just a small monthly exam, for Lin Li, it felt like a final-level major exam.\nHonestly, Lin Li hadn’t put in this level of effort facing finals before.\nHe’d been studying intensely these past few days, and now suddenly there’s no need for that; Lin Li didn’t even bring his textbooks home, feeling somewhat empty.\nPeople really are too cheap.\nLin Li took out the ’Emotional Management Bottle,’ its white cracks densely covering its surface.\nLin Li continued using it to absorb his emotions and feed them back to himself.\nCrack.\nAfter playing with himself for half an hour, the ’Emotional Management Bottle,’ already at the edge, reached its limit. Lin Li felt the connection between him and it break, and the bottle was covered in white lines.\nThe ’Emotional Management Bottle’ still retained the shape of a bottle. Being prepared, Lin Li went to the fridge, poured several boxes of duck blood into a basin, and buried it directly inside.\nHoping the confinement bottle can soon defeat the illness.\nNow, Lin Li had nothing to do.\nSeems like the only option is to play that game.\nSleep Roulette: the thrill and danger lie in napping without setting an alarm, which can result in sleeping for twenty minutes? Or maybe a few hours? Or perhaps waking up tomorrow? Nobody knows.\n...\nLin Li opened his eyes, still feeling somewhat sleepy and dizzy.\nWhen he was sleeping, it was still bright outside, but now it’s already pitch dark.\nSitting up and resting for a while, Lin Li took out his phone.\nIt’s nine-twenty in the evening.\nPerhaps due to suddenly shedding the burden of heavy study, or maybe because of the consumption from using the ’Emotional Management Bottle’ these past few days, Lin Li ended up napping for a full three hours.\nLin Li swiped down the phone’s status bar.\nNot a single message.\nLin Li got up, opened the curtains, and outside, with the lights from countless homes, there was even the aroma of food, and occasionally he could hear some neighbors laughing joyfully.\nTurning back, the house was empty and silent.\nMaybe he should watch some horror movies too; it sometimes fills the void of loss and emptiness.\nDo abstract kids get sad too?\n\"Wait a minute!\"\n\"How come the Daily Voucher Benefit Guy hasn’t messaged me either? I wonder, I haven’t blocked him, have I?\" With enhanced wisdom, Lin Li quickly spotted the blind spot.\nHe opened up WeChat.\nThen he saw WeChat starting to spin circles.\nThis meant he hadn’t been receiving messages at all.\nSo Lin Li felt a sense of anticipation and nervousness.\nWhen the spinning stopped.\n[Daily Voucher Benefit Guy: Come claim your vouchers...](2)\n[Brothers, We Must Fight: @All Members...](99+)\n[Three Humans and a Dog: Someone @me...](99+)\n[...]\n[Bai Bufan: ?](99+)\n[Chen Yu Ying: It seems like it’s going to rain tomorrow.](6)\nScrew you, loss and emptiness. Seeing the red dot on the screen, Lin Li felt alive again.\nLin Li first opened Chen Yu Ying’s messages.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t have anything going on tomorrow. She initially wanted to ask Lin Li if he’d like to teach her how to ride a bike tomorrow but noticed the weather forecast indicating rain.\nIt’s completely unsuitable for learning how to ride a bike in the rain.\n[Lin Li: I’m free tomorrow, but if it does rain, let’s reschedule for National Day.]\n[Chen Yu Ying: Okay.]\n[Chen Yu Ying: Why didn’t you reply sooner?]\n[Lin Li: I planned to take a nap after coming home and ended up sleeping until now, sorry.]\n[Chen Yu Ying: Oh, it’s okay, just checking. \"Puppy nodding\".]\n[...]\nAfter chatting with Chen Yu Ying, Lin Li decided to take a look at how Bai Bufan managed to spam 99+ messages on his own.\n[Bai Bufan: I’m home, time for games! If you say you need to study after the exams, Lin Li, you’re even cooler than a 3A, you’re a 4M.]\n[Bai Bufan: Private Lin Li, step out!]\n[...]\n[Bai Bufan: Where are you, damn it? If you’re dead, at least give me a dream? Can I use your ashes for my supper tonight?]\n[Bai Bufan: ?]*20\n[...]\n[Bai Bufan not connected]\n[Bai Bufan: Pick up the phone, you dog!]\n[Bai Bufan: \"Dragon Picture: I must control you\"]*18\n[Bai Bufan: \"Dragon Picture: I’m very angry\"]*20\n[Bai Bufan: Celebrating Lin Li’s unfortunate passing on the night of the 27th of this month, at age 17.5...]\n[...]\n[Bai Bufan: Revive, my dear beloved!]\n[Bai Bufan: ?]\nThough most of it was insults, Lin Li found the chat records quite amusing.\nSometimes, it’s really nice knowing Bai Bufan.\n[Lin Li: Napping, you’re yelling \"beep—\" at your mom?]\n[Bai Bufan: Didn’t think to report to me before sleeping? You’re really hard-headed now, Lin Li.]\n[Lin Li: Not really, just woke up, you already know.]\n[Bai Bufan: Give me a taste.]\n[Lin Li: You little glutton, really can’t handle you.]\nAfter typing this line with a smile, Lin Li thought for a bit, and then edited and sent it again.\n[Lin Li: Seriously, Bufan, sometimes I’m really glad to know you, man.]\nBai Bufan didn’t reply immediately, but after almost half a minute:\n[Bai Bufan: ?]\n[You withdrew a message.]\n[Lin Li: Sorry, I got possessed for a moment.]\n[Bai Bufan: You gave me a scare, thought you were about to confess, I already put on my wedding dress.]\n[Lin Li: Alright, weren’t you calling me to play games? Are we still playing?]\nHonestly, after a month of the system’s conditioning, Lin Li doesn’t have much desire for games anymore, plus he’s worried about becoming addicted again. Lin Li is actively restraining himself.\nBut just for the emotional support Bai Bufan provided tonight, playing a game with him is an unquestionable responsibility.\n[Bai Bufan: OK, but let me tell you first, I’m at my hometown now, the network isn’t very reliable, don’t curse me if I mess up.]\n[Lin Li: Don’t worry, tonight I’m your companion. You’re the boss, what companion curses the boss? Log in!]\n[Bai Bufan: Alright! Logging in!]\n...\nAt ten twenty in the evening.\n[Lin Li: Bai Bufan, why don’t you go play games in the cemetery?]\n[Lin Li: How come your hometown didn’t let you die of old age?]\n[Lin Li: It’s rare for me to want to play a game, and you let me lose so badly?]\n[Bai Bufan: ... You said you wouldn’t curse me.]\n[Lin Li: Just because I said I wouldn’t curse you doesn’t mean I won’t curse you? I told you to play well, why didn’t you? Figuring out now? What were you doing earlier?]\n[Bai Bufan: Lin Li, just remember, you’re just a companion right now...]\n[Lin Li: Companion your mom!]\n[Bai Bufan: I’m the boss!]\n[Lin Li: Boss your mom!]\n[Bai Bufan: Damn!]\nLin Li actually worried about relapsing into a gaming addiction.\nClearly overthinking it.\nIn terms of internet addiction treatment, Dr. Bai really is an expert.",

      "content": "Chapter 211: Chapter 179 Nothing to Show Off, Basic Operation\nSunday.\nToday, because of the schedule adjustment, we have classes.\n\"Boss, why has your sticky rice price gone up again?\" Lin Li, who was riding his bike to buy breakfast for his friends, saw that the price list had been updated, with another fifty cents increase, and asked the owner.\n\"I can’t help it, I don’t want to either, but duck meat prices have gone up again recently.\" The boss replied helplessly.\nLin Li squinted.\n\"That’s not right, boss. Most of the toppings on the sticky rice are mushroom chicken or pork, right? What’s it got to do with duck meat?\" Lin Li questioned.\n\"I love eating duck meat. Without making a bit more, I can’t afford it.\" The boss answered.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nOK, I’m convinced.\nWith such an explanation, Lin Li could accept the price increase.\nAfter buying breakfast and placing it under his raincoat, Lin Li then rode his bike to school.\nThe weather forecast was accurate; it rained yesterday, so the bike-riding plan fell through.\nAlthough it was drizzling today, it actually felt even more stuffy and hot.\nBefore it officially starts to cool down and enters autumn, we’ll probably have to wait for a cold front to bring a shower.\n\"According to unofficial history, in order to eliminate Dong Zhuo, Wang Yun used a beauty trap and invited Lu Bu to drink at his home. During the conversation, Wang Yun mentioned Guan Yu warming wine to slay Hua Xiong, valiant in battle, wielding the Cyan Dragon Crescent Blade, a contemporary tiger general.\nLu Bu heard this and laughed dismissively: \"Guan Yu? Not worth mentioning. My Fangtian Halberd is twelve feet long, and the shaft alone is twelve feet.\"\nAt that moment, Diao Chan overheard from outside the window, her heart stirred, and that’s why she married Lu Bu!\"\n\"I see, no wonder Lu Bu always asks where his ’loop’ is. It indeed needs to be looped, or else it’s uncomfortable!\"\nEvery day, if Lin Li doesn’t hear Bai Bufan’s Three Kingdoms tales when entering the classroom, he feels an itch in his heart.\nNow he’s at ease.\n\"Tech answer sheets? Have the tech results been released?\" After distributing breakfast, Lin Li noticed an extra answer sheet on his desk and asked.\n\"They should be, the class representative just handed them out. Once the multiple-choice answers are out, you can calculate it yourself.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nAlthough the exam just ended on Friday, the marking time for Wednesday and Thursday’s subjects was actually quite ample.\nIn fact, during last night’s self-study, the biology grades were already out.\nLin Li scored 94, tying for fifth in the class, and the biology teacher mentioned him by name for praise.\nWith exams, once you see where you went wrong after getting the results, you instantly understand, but during the exam, no matter how much you check, you can’t figure it out.\nOnce the thought process is set after the first pass, it’s tough to spot your logical errors. Of the six points deducted, four could have not been lost, and Lin Li felt a bit regretful.\nHowever, despite the regret, Lin Li was quite satisfied with this score; it was a good start.\nEven though Wang Yuezhi scored 96, he had an odd look in his eyes towards Lin Li last night.\nCould it be that he really wants to acknowledge an enemy as a superior?\n...\n\"You guys are really giving back what was taught to you to the teacher. In the class, more than half of the students managed to get such a question wrong. It’s just unacceptable; you must pay attention next time. Alright, there are a few more questions, I’ll take time during evening self-study to explain them to you.\"\nAfter the bell rang, the chemistry teacher shook his head and left the classroom.\nNo matter whether the subject scores are out or not, all teachers are going through test papers aiming to finish by National Day.\nOtherwise, after the holidays, if asked why they did it that way, this group of students would definitely not be able to answer.\n\"I think the chemistry teacher misunderstood us. If we don’t return the knowledge he taught us, what will happen to the next batch of students? You guys who don’t return what you take are really too selfish.\" Bai Bufan stretched and disdainfully said to Lin Li, who was in the correct half.\nIn the realm of shamelessness, Bai Bufan leads the way.\n\"You really are thinking of the teacher.\" Lin Li gave him a thumbs up.\nBai Bufan smiled and then put away the chemistry test paper, glanced at the class schedule pasted on the desk, and started looking for the history test paper in the drawer:\n\"Though there were some minor mishaps, compared to before, it’s much better. As of now, my new phone is still within hope. History is my least confident subject, so many questions were just guesses, hoping to get more right.\"\nLin Li looked at Bai Bufan’s test paper, yawned, and left the classroom from the back door.\nA few minutes later, just before class started, Lin Li returned through the front door.\nWith chalk in hand, he walked to the blackboard under the gaze of all classmates and began writing.\n[ACCBD]\n[BCBAA]\n[CADBA]\n[DDBCB]\nThen he knocked on the blackboard and said to everyone, \"These are the history answers, double-check them yourselves.\"\nUpon hearing this, everyone immediately turned to the multiple-choice section of the history test paper to check their answers.\nHistory class representative Wen Muyang: \"?\"\nDid the teacher abandon me?\nWhy give the history answers to Lin Li and not to me, the class representative?\nEveryone furrowed their brows, but one person’s expression lit up brightly, then they suddenly stood up, exclaiming, \"Whoa! All correct! Bao Wei! I aced the history multiple-choices! It’s solid! It’s solid! My new phone is almost certain now!\"\nThe joys and sorrows of people don’t interconnect.\n\"Hmm? Huh?\" Chen Yu Ying became more confused the more she checked the answers, more puzzled, then she lifted her head in doubt: \"Lin Li, are these the correct answers the teacher gave you?\"\n\"How could the fourth question be B? How could it be attributed to Lin Zexu leading the Boston Tea Event?\" Chen Yu Ying’s face was full of questions.\n\"The eighth question is off too, why is the Hammurabi Code issued by Cixi? Is this correct? It can’t be right, can it?\"\nOnce Chen Yu Ying spoke, it instantly sparked agreement among the already confused crowd, who all raised their heads to question Lin Li.\n\"I never said these were the correct answers from the teacher.\" Lin Li honestly stood on the podium, looking somewhat innocent.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Then what are these answers?\" Chen Yu Ying continued to pursue questions on behalf of everyone.\n\"These are just Bai Bufan’s history answers; I just let you check them against yours.\" Lin Li revealed a sincere smile.\nClassmates: \"?\"\nThe whole class put down their red pens, turned their heads, and looked at Bai Bufan.\nAt this moment, Bai Bufan seemed oblivious to what Lin Li was saying, immersed in the joy of getting everything right.\n\"Yo~ Bao Wei, really, that many crosses?\"\n\"Your history level is so lousy, huh?\"\n— As a genius historian, Bai Bufan had already transformed into the Master of the Shadow Flow, performing the MVP settlement dance, swaying left and right, looking pleased, humming an unknown tune, sarcastically taunting Zhou Baowei.\n\"Actually, getting all history multiple-choices correct is just like that, there’s no need to mention it every day because I know there are many people who get it all right. Constantly mentioning my full marks as if I’m the only one seems unnecessary...\"\n\"History is really too simple~~ too simple, oh oh, too — sim — ple — \"\nHe continued dancing like that until he realized the class was unusually quiet.\nBai Bufan raised his head.\nWhen he quieted down, the classroom fell completely silent.\nHe blinked his eyes:\n\"Hey?\"\n\"Why is everyone... looking at me?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 212: Chapter 180: Understood, but understood incorrectly\nSeeing this scene, Bai Bufan was a bit confused. He didn’t understand why everyone was staring at him.\nWas he too conspicuous?\nOh, that must be it.\nSeems like a lot of people just said I got a lot of questions wrong, and me being all right is too showy, really makes people jealous.\nIt’s human nature.\nBai Bufan immediately raised his hand and said seriously:\n\"Let me clarify first, I didn’t cheat. This is all my own work, all correct.\"\nThe class burst into laughter at his words.\n\"No!! Why are you all laughing! I really didn’t cheat! I swear, if there’s even a hint of dishonesty in my history score, when I pull out hangnails in the future, I’ll pull out a meter of skin along with it!\"\nBai Bufan got anxious, seeing his classmates still ridiculing him, he vowed angrily.\n\"Hiss—ah—\"\nBai Bufan’s vow seemed a bit too harsh, just thinking about that scene made Lin Li’s fingers throb.\nEver since tearing a finger skin once, Lin Li always kept nail clippers in his drawer.\nAnyway.\n\"Bufan, nobody suspected you of cheating.\" Lin Li smiled as he said.\nEven if cheating a little, it wouldn’t be this answer.\n\"Everyone mainly wants to ask you, for question four, why is Lin Zexu the one leading the Boston Tea Party, it’s quite a puzzle for us, can you explain?\" Lin Li pressed further.\n\"Huh? Isn’t Old Xu the one who burned opium at Humen, how could he be involved in the Boston Tea Party?\" Bai Bufan heard the words, returned to his seat, picked up his history exam paper, glanced at it, and was shocked:\n\"Oh man! How did I write B for this one? During the test, I clearly knew to pick C!\"\nThis kind of brain thinking the right answer but selecting the wrong one behavior is quite common.\nEspecially among students.\n\"Eh? Then why did the answer pick B? Is the answer wrong too?\" Bai Bufan finally realized belatedly, lifted his head, looked at Lin Li, eyes widening: \"Wait, whose answer is this?\"\n\"Yours.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nThe worst part is ~when silence suddenly descends on the room~\n\"What’s up with Bufan, why aren’t you talking?\"\nThe worst part is ~when your friend’s concern suddenly emerges~\n\"Lin—Li—I’m ’beep—beep—beep—’\"\nWhen Bai Bufan’s roar sounded, and he chased Lin Li with red eyes, class four erupted into complete laughter mode.\nBut at this point, a problem arose; Bai Bufan couldn’t catch Lin Li.\nWatching Lin Li eternally mocking him from across the classroom, Bai Bufan was furious, his expression completely indifferent, brotherhood severed: \"Lin Li, I can’t catch you, but I have ways!\"\n\"Oh, what ways do you have!\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"I’ll make you taste what it’s like to lose a brother! Zhou Baowei, go to hell!\" Bai Bufan started punching and kicking Zhou Baowei.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nEh? Not bros? Why am I involved?\n\"Stop! You dare beat my brother? Then I’ll beat your brother!\" Lin Li, who values brotherhood the most, was furious. As retaliation, Lin Li also rushed up to punch and kick Bao Wei.\nBai Bufan, beating Zhou Baowei: \"Submit, Lin Li! If you don’t, I’ll keep beating!\"\nLin Li, beating Zhou Baowei: \"I won’t submit! Do you submit? If not, I’ll keep beating! Until death!\"\nBai Bufan: \"Not submitting! Show me you have what it takes to kill one!\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...I submit, is that okay?\"\nThe two pretended not to hear, just kept throwing punches.\nThe two were less than half a meter apart, yet their punches all landed on Zhou Baowei’s back.\nAlthough not painful at all, Zhou Baowei still had to marvel at these two idiots, building a wall without a roof, pure walls.\nWhen the history teacher walked in, the two had to return to their seats.\n\"Can this be erased?\"\nSeeing these answers on the blackboard, the history teacher asked everyone.\nShe thought it was answers from a previous subject, in case students hadn’t finished checking.\n\"Teacher, these are Bufan’s history choice answers, if you want to erase it—uh uh!\" Lin Li’s words were half said when Bai Bufan, eyes widening again, covered his mouth.\n\"History answers?\" Suddenly involved in the gossip, the history teacher picked up her answers and compared them, then scratched her head: \"You know, it’s kind of similar, but I almost don’t dare to recognize it.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n...\n\"Lin Li, in this world, besides me and Northern Myanmar, who else would open their heart to you? I treated you sincerely, and this is how you repay me?\"\nAfter the history class ended, Bai Bufan, eyes empty, slumped on the desk.\nSpirit deflated, limbs powerless, like someone just finished shooting a scene from ’He sat on the sofa, and behind him stood five black guys’.\nLin Li’s move was really too ruthless.\nWhen the history teacher heard the answers on the blackboard were from Bai Bufan’s choice questions, the whole lesson was spent incessantly dragging him, making him stand up and explain his thought process every time he got a question wrong, as a negative example.\n\"You had it coming.\"\nLin Li snorted, picking up his water cup to get some water.\nWhen I got back to the classroom, I saw Bai Bufan blocking Zhou Baowei from getting on the podium.\n\"Lin Li! Help me stop Bao Wei! Don’t let him go up and erase the answers!\" Bai Bufan shouted for backup as soon as he saw Lin Li come in.\nThe next class was English, and the blackboard was filled with rows of new answers.\nLin Li laughed.\nDo unto others the madness they do not wish for themselves.\nBai Bufan harming others is just desserts, but others harming Bai Bufan is despicable behavior.\n\"Coming!\" Bai Bufan wielded a pure sword aura, but fortunately Lin Li wasn’t a saint either. Hearing this, he quickly placed his water cup on the cabinet behind him and stepped forward to help block Zhou Baowei.\nBrothers united, their strength can break gold.\nThe bell rang.\nAmid Zhou Baowei’s heart-wrenching screams, he was forcibly pressed back into his seat by Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\n\"Let me see how Bao Wei chooses English answers.\" Lin Li pulled out the English test paper and began comparing.\nWait a minute.\nSomething’s off.\n\"Why are Bao Wei’s answers exactly the same as mine?\" Lin Li turned to look at Bai Bufan.\n\"Because they’re your answers.\" Bai Bufan smiled.\nZhou Baowei’s face, which had been filled with collapse and despair, now wore a cunning smile, matching Bai Bufan’s as they looked at Lin Li together.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nBu Hao!\nMilitary strategy! They used military strategy!\nThis was clearly a trap set up by the two against me!\n\"Damn, I’ve really met my match today.\" Lin Li pressed his fist to his forehead in frustration, speechless.\nBai Bufan and Zhou Baowei burst out laughing.\n\"Tap, tap, tap.\"\nThe barefaced Koukou, wearing a small bee microphone and low-heeled shoes, walked in.\n\"Everyone, take out your monthly exam papers.\" Koukou said while glancing at the answers on the blackboard.\n\"Teacher, the blackboard is——\" Bai Bufan was about to explain to Koukou.\n\"Huh? You guys already know the answers? You’ve all written them out for me in advance? These are the multiple-choice answers for the monthly exam. Check them yourselves; we’ll discuss the questions that most students got wrong. Bufan? What’s up? Is there something you want to tell the teacher?\"\nAfter saying that, Koukou looked up warmly at Bai Bufan, who had just called out to her.\nBai Bufan, Zhou Baowei: \"?\"\nThe two turned mechanically to look at Lin Li.\nCome on, bro, you got them all right?\nLin Li leaned back in his chair, fingers running through his hair, and only after ’noticing’ their gaze did he look at them:\n\"Hmm? What’s wrong? Is there something you need? Bao Wei, you’re nearsighted, can you see the answers on the board clearly? Want me to check your paper for you?\"\nDamn, this guy is really putting on an act.\nWith a vocabulary of 3,500 words in high school, thanks to [powerful memory], Lin Li had mastered them thoroughly. The unfamiliar words beyond the syllabus in the first-year monthly exam came with Chinese annotations. As long as he could fully understand the exam content, it was just like doing elementary school language questions—getting them all right wasn’t too surprising.\nBut even though he got them all right, he might lose points in listening and grammatical transformations, as well as in writing, which makes getting first in class hard.\nBut it’s already enough; a conservative estimate puts it at at least 130+. For a Lin Li who previously fluctuated around 100, this was an epic improvement.\nLooking at Lin Li’s smug face, Bai Bufan’s mouth twitched.\nSeeing his brother doing so well, Bai Bufan was genuinely happy for him.\nRea-l-ly! Hap-py! For him!\nThe cabinet moved, Bai Bufan didn’t want to play anymore.\nHow could it end like this?\n\"No——!!!\" No longer able to bear it, Bai Bufan shouted unwillingly, tears streaming down his face.\n\"The snow flies~ The north wind howls~\" Lin Li sang beside him.\n\"What on earth is going on?\"\nOnly Koukou was left with a bewildered face, wondering what antics these two jokers were up to again.\nBut it didn’t matter; Koukou knew how to handle them:\n\"It’s still so noisy even after class starts. You two, stand at the back and listen.\"\n\"Okay, let’s take a look at the first reading passage... Combine it with the parts about nature in the text, so this question’s answer is C. Do you understand?\" Koukou started to explain the question.\nLin Li glanced over at Bai Bufan, then asked, \"The teacher asked if you understand, quickly answer.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Who the hell taught you to understand ’under stand’ like that? Genius!\" Bai Bufan gave a thumbs up.\n\"If I weren’t a genius, how else would I get a perfect score on the English test? Isn’t it obvious?\" Lin Li felt he deserved the title.\nThe two exchanged a look and nodded with satisfaction.\nToo bad a third party intervened.\nKoukou, who had somehow made her way to the two, pointed to either side with a grin that didn’t quite reach her eyes: \"You two... one stand on the left, and one stand on the right!\"\nThe small bee microphone emitted a sharp blaring sound, possibly containing noise.",

      "content": "Chapter 213: Chapter 181: Eh! Got it! I got it!\nMidnight.\nUnder Lin Li’s watch, it was the 30th, Monday, and a new week had arrived.\nThe new UI interface had once again improved, with a few new gray buttons appearing. However, there was currently no text, nor could they be interacted with.\nSkipping over this part, Lin Li clicked into the [Shop] and exchanged for a \"Probe Bag,\" bringing his stock to 2, with a remaining system currency balance of 260.\nThen, with the opportunity to refresh, Lin Li once again chose to use it on the second product slot, swapping the \"Probe Bag.\"\n[You have refreshed \"Luck Symbol\": 150 system currency (limit 1 per day), do you want to replace it?]\n[Luck Symbol: Drop blood on it and attach it to the body to use. Once used, it will greatly enhance the user’s luck for one minute.\nOnce the enhanced luck is exhausted, the symbol will prematurely expire.\nTwo of these symbols cannot be used simultaneously, and using two consecutively with less than a three-day interval will result in a backlash of luck, greatly lowering luck below the normal value for a while.]\nIt’s like a sibling to the \"Poop Suppression Talisman,\" but in terms of price, it’s three times as much, costing 150 system currency.\nBut if it can enhance luck, this mysterious thing might be worth the price.\nEspecially since I really need some luck right now.\n[You have purchased \"Luck Symbol\" *1.]\n[You have purchased \"Random Quality Spirit Stone\" *1.]\nWith two purchases, Lin Li’s balance was down to a measly 90, breaking below three digits.\nBut Lin Li swapped it very decisively.\nBecause in terms of luck, he had never won on the \"Random Quality Spirit Stone.\"\nNow with a forced boost, there’s no way I could still lose, right?\nHowever, before using it, Lin Li opened a few games, pausing the interface on the lottery sections.\nThis way, if the \"Random Quality Spirit Stone\" doesn’t exhaust the luck boosted by the \"Luck Symbol,\" the remaining minute can be ’wasted’ on these.\nGame items can be redeemed for cash; every little bit counts. It’s just a pity Lin Li can’t buy a lottery ticket offline; otherwise, he’d likely hit at least a second prize.\nAs for the first prize, who knows if it’s even in the pool; that’s beyond what luck alone can achieve.\nThe \"Luck Symbol\" and the \"Limit Breaking Symbol\" are the same size and seem to be made of the same material, only differing in the design on them.\nIf only I could make these talismans myself someday. System, be helpful; it’s better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish.\nPricking a finger, dripping blood, Lin Li took a deep breath and applied it to the back of his hand.\nThere was no sensation, probably similar to the effect of a \"Limit Breaking Symbol.\"\n[You have used \"Random Quality Spirit Stone\" *1.]\n[You have obtained \"Spiritual Spring\" *1.]\nThe talisman paper immediately fell off Lin Li’s hand, losing all its luster.\nAll the enhanced luck was exhausted in less than a second, even faster than Bai Bufan.\nBut it was worth it.\n0.1%, a chance of one in a thousand, finally got it.\nBetter not to trust my luck in the future.\nLin Li, worried that the \"Spiritual Spring\" might be liquid, specifically ran to the bathroom before manifesting it.\nIt was a pale round basin with a diameter of about twenty centimeters, quite weighty. Lin Li could barely support it with one hand, holding it perfectly with both hands.\nThe whole basin was as crystalline as jade, emitting an enchanting fragrance.\nIn the center of the basin was a small hole, and the once dry bottom, at Lin Li’s inspection, now gradually turned a bit damp.\nWhen Lin Li touched the moist bottom, instinctively channeling it, the spiritual qi was instantly absorbed, and the bottom became dry again.\nThis was a ’spring eye’ that would continuously produce either spiritual qi or spiritual liquid, Lin Li concluded.\nAfter thinking for a bit, Lin Li got up and returned to his room, taking out a low-grade spirit stone that was emptied and placing it over the spring eye.\n\"It really works.\" Lin Li exclaimed.\nAfter three minutes, it was visibly apparent that the spirit stone’s interior began circulating the crystalline essence again, while the area around the spring eye remained dry.\nThis purchase was the right choice.\nAlthough the spiritual spring might dry up, given its probability of appearance, it should at least cultivate a hundred low-grade spirit stones, maybe even hundreds or a thousand.\nThis amount is enough for Lin Li to alleviate the current spiritual qi scarcity issue.\nMoreover, for Lin Li now, it’s possible to derive the formula \"Luck Symbol\" + \"Random Quality Spirit Stone\" = \"Spiritual Spring.\"\nEquivalent to having a fixed cost of 170 system currency to purchase one Spiritual Spring.\nIt would have been helpful if the \"Luck Symbol\" had come out sooner; all that suffering and wasted spending before.\nBut there’s no point in regretting; buying early to enjoy early, buying late to enjoy discounts, Lin Li is not one to look back.\nNow the important thing is to activate some tasks and accumulate some system currency.\nBefore going to sleep, Lin Li placed multiple empty spirit stones in the \"Spiritual Spring\" and also covered it with a wash basin — to prevent any possible evaporation and dissipation of spiritual qi and liquid.\n\"Brother, I know you rely on arrays to protect yourself in the Cultivation Realm, but our conditions are a bit rough now. Hang in there; once I ascend, I’ll get you a big house.\"\nUsing a stainless steel wash basin usually used for dirty clothes to cover the \"Spiritual Spring,\" Lin Li couldn’t hold back a smile.\nWhat a spectacular collision between the Cultivation Realm and the modern world!\nAll things have a spirit, mosquitoes excluded, so Lin Li intends to PUA the \"Spiritual Spring\" a bit, encouraging it to work harder.",

      "content": "Chapter 214: Chapter 181: Eh! Got it! I got it!_2\nIf he doesn’t work hard, how can I, as the boss, move into a bigger house?\n...\nJust past four in the morning.\nWhen the alarm clock woke him up, Lin Li first checked the \"Spiritual Spring\". The efficiency wasn’t exactly quick. In about four hours, only about half of the spirit stone at the bottom was charged.\nDoes this mean it can charge about three spirit stones in a day?\nThat seems about right. Use one in the morning for practice, another one to strengthen the \"Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body\", and one more to refine the \"Emotion-Containing Bottle\".\nThere are still four spirit stones in his pocket for emergencies.\nIn terms of spirit stones, he was finally on the right track.\nLin Li then went to the fridge to check on the current state of the \"Emotion-Containing Bottle\".\nThere weren’t many white cracks left.\nLin Li took it out of the fridge and locked it in his bedroom cabinet with the remaining duck blood—Wu Min might come back today, and it wasn’t safe to leave it in the fridge.\n...\nAt school.\n\"100 points! I scored 100 points!\" Zhou Baowei shouted excitedly.\nSeeing Zhou Baowei so excited made Lin Li a bit unsure and he glanced at his own test paper.\n\"The full score is 150... right?\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan.\n\"Yeah,\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis \"yeah\" meant \"right\".\n\"It is indeed 150,\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nSo the two of them turned their heads and looked at the celebrating Zhou Baowei with eyes that said ’are you kidding me?’.\n\"Has your math improved this much? Lin Li, I really should keep you in check.\" Bai Bufan said dejectedly when he found out Lin Li scored 132 in math.\nHe only scored 112.\nAlthough it was a significant improvement compared to before, compared to Lin Li, he felt like a small freak meeting a big freak.\n\"Research shows that 77% of people aren’t good at math. You belong to that group, while I, on the other hand, am part of the noble 33% that’s different from you,\" Lin Li sneered.\nBai Bufan scratched his head, feeling something was off.\nAnd honestly, Lin Li felt a bit regretful about his score—he lost points on two trap questions, otherwise, it could have been higher. In truth, the math test wasn’t particularly hard, and with this score, he was only ranked tenth in the class.\nChen Yu Ying scored 148.\nThere are indeed gaps between people.\n\"Your progress is putting a lot of pressure on me,\" Bai Bufan sighed, \"I preferred your old self, when everyone looked down on you, and you were just a worthless fellow.\"\n\"If you’re feeling stressed, just think about Bao Wei’s shoes,\" Lin Li comforted.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nHe gave Lin Li a thumbs up: \"When you put it that way, I instantly feel no pressure at all. You’re really something, Dr. Lin.\"\nZhou Baowei at the side: \"?\"\nThese two are swearing so dirtily.\nWhile others’ success can indeed be enviable, Zhou Baowei felt his failures were understandable. Apart from being stimulated during Mid-Autumn Festival and striving for a few days afterwards, his most diligent times were spent searching through forty unfiltered websites.\nThe grades aren’t that good, and he deserved it.\nBut until now, although the final grades weren’t out, the estimates were about right, and he believed he made some progress overall. He hoped Old Zhou would be sensible and not expect him to teach everything.\nThose with heart need no teaching, those without cannot learn.\n\"At least I can still celebrate National Day with joy. I heard from my cousin that in sophomore and junior National Days, if you don’t take home twenty sheets of paper in math, language, English, and electives, it means the teachers aren’t working hard, so this is our last bit of light and heat!\"\nBai Bufan rubbed his hands with some anticipation:\n\"This time, I definitely want to have a meaningful National Day.\"\n\"Hahaha—\" When Bai Bufan’s gloomy gaze swept over, Lin Li stopped laughing and nodded seriously, \"Yeah, it’ll be meaningful.\"\nBai Bufan: \"Crap.\"\n\"You saying this is like telling Bao Wei to lose weight over National Day, Bufan.\" Lin Li laughed.\n\"Don’t say that, I’m really planning to exercise this National Day,\" Bao Wei responded upon hearing that.\n\"Hahaha—\" When Zhou Baowei’s resentful gaze swept over, Bufan stopped laughing, nodded solemnly, \"Yeah, there will be exercise.\"\nThen he understood Lin Li.\nZhou Baowei: \"Crap.\"\n\"I plan to do the sister exercise to planking this National Day,\" Zhou Baowei explained anyway.\n\"What’s that exercise?\" Bai Bufan was curious.\n\"It’s lying in bed supporting a tablet. I plan to support it all day!\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Why don’t you say you’re planning to do sit-ups all day, then, one sit-up at night and one when you get up the next morning?\" Bai Bufan said speechlessly.\nThen Zhou Baowei could definitely exercise for a whole National Day.\n\"That’s not impossible; these two exercises can even be combined! Great, my hopes of losing weight just soared!\" Zhou Baowei sincerely thanked Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan waved his hand in annoyance, turning to Lin Li:\n\"Lin Li, what do you plan to do for National Day? Can you do something meaningful?\"\n...\n\"Lin Li, what do you plan to do for National Day? Are you free?\"\nBecause during the test paper explanation, there was generally no homework assigned, plus today was the last day before National Day, most students went home to pack at noon, leaving only the three bonded people in the classroom again.\nHe stayed in the classroom because he had nowhere else to go, Chen Yu Ying stayed to chat with him, but what was Wang Yuezhi doing here?\nLin Li was puzzled.\nChen Yu Ying inquired at that moment.\n\"Wait a minute, let me check my schedule,\" Lin Li replied.\n\"Schedule? You have one of those?\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit surprised.\nThen she saw Lin Li take out a blank sheet of paper, flip through it theatrically a few times, and then shake his head at her, \"I’m free.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nHe was certainly very free.\n\"If you don’t have plans for National Day, I might as well ask you out to play. We might not stay in Xiling, and you’d come, right?\" Chen Yu Ying asked, staring at Lin Li and blinking.\n\"Sure. Not in Xiling? Where to?\" Lin Li didn’t reject but was curious.\n\"Not finalized yet, thinking about a few places. After all, there’s nothing much to do in Xiling, it’s so small, been here for so many years,\" Chen Yu Ying was tapping the desk with her finger, explaining.\n\"But if it’s those tourist spots during the holiday, we’ll be crushed, right?\" Lin Li firmly believed that peak travel was not travel but torture.\n\"Not going to major tourist spots. What I’m currently planning is to book a party homestay, and adapt on the fly. If we want to go out, we go; if not, just play games or rest, it won’t be the kind of commando-style trip you dislike.\"\nIt seemed Chen Yu Ying was indeed prepared.\nA party homestay is a type of accommodation equipped with a variety of entertainment facilities inside, such as board games, a home KTV, mahjong, and even a pool table. It’s larger and primarily intended for entertainment rather than overnight stay.\nBigger ones could even be rented for just daytime or nighttime to accommodate group activities.\n\"Okay, then call me when it’s time. I’m still holding a grudge against you not learning to ride a bike, you’ll have no excuse then,\" Lin Li nodded.\nIf Chen Yu Ying hadn’t invited him over National Day, he definitely would have asked her to learn cycling. With only three tasks left, learning mecha is the only one he can speed up.\n\"Sure, that was the plan anyway. It should be easy to learn, and there are bound to be large, quiet places around the homestay,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"So is it just the few of us? Should I invite someone?\" If going to such a party homestay, it’s unlikely it would be only two people. During the last autumn trip, he had said that he’d help if needed, so Lin Li asked.\n\"I just invited my roommates. Si Han and Wanqiu already agreed, others will ask their family tonight, might not be able to come, but Bai Bufan can come play. You two together... it’s really fun.\"\nChen Yu Ying didn’t know what she remembered and covered her mouth to laugh. Her laughter was crisp.\nIt’s hard to guess what was funny, as there were so many amusing points between Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\nEveryone laughed at these two, yet the two of them were just as ridiculous.\n\"Could you say it without taking long breaths, President? Hearing you say ’you two together’, I was thinking about how to prove myself innocent,\" Lin Li shrugged, joking: \"Mind the way you break your sentences,\nbreak it properly.\"",

He happens to want a more interesting National Day too,\" Lin Li said.\nInvolving Bai Bufan would indeed make things much more interesting.\nAt least if Bufan comes, my status won’t be the lowest, and if I’m in a bad mood, I can relieve stress by teasing him a few times.\n\"How much will it cost approximately?\" Lin Li then asked.\nRenting these homestays isn’t cheap, typically starting at a thousand per day; for more luxurious ones, it could go over ten thousand a day. Not to mention it’s the National Day holiday, if you don’t book at least half a month in advance, there would be a significant premium.\nLin Li wasn’t too concerned. After all, he had made himself a ten-thousand-yuan person. He didn’t mind spending money on such things.\nPeople have to live for themselves.\n\"You don’t need to worry too much about the money. My mom knows someone who runs these homestays, which is why, even though the exact location isn’t decided yet, we’ll choose among a few places. No need to hurry.\nIt’s because those places have their homestay, which can be reserved for us. We can even stay for the entire National Day, for free.\"\nWhen Chen Yu Ying said the last two words, her eyes sparkled with a bit of excitement and pride as she looked at Lin Li.\n\"Impressive,\" Lin Li praised briefly before smiling and asking, \"But isn’t free the most expensive?\"\n\"We don’t have to worry about adults’ favors. Repaying this favor is their business. We’ll just consider the accommodation free,\" Chen Yu Ying stuck out her tongue, smiling, revealing she’s a filial daughter, and said:\n\"So, we only need to consider the cost of food, drinks, and entertainment later. It won’t cost much, and if we spend most of the time enjoying ourselves in the homestay, it will be even cheaper.\"\nChen Yu Ying intended to give a specific number but then thought for a while and realized it was hard to say. After pressing her forefinger against her lips momentarily, she said:\n\"The budget... let’s cap it at three hundred. If we end up spending more, I’ll let my parents cover the excess.\"\n\"Class Rep, do you usually like to use steel wool? Like playing with fire? Please, do tell me. It’s crucial for my future career planning!\" Lin Li immediately said aloud.\nLin Li is actually a noble character who does not bend for mere gains.\nIn the Eastern Jin era, five dou of rice were equivalent to about eight kilograms today. These cost less than a hundred bucks in a supermarket.\nHowever, it’s clear that the Class Rep can offer more than a hundred bucks’ worth.\nThat’s not just about rice; to not bend here needs a big thumbs up.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nShe certainly understood about steel wool and fire.\n\"What exactly are your career plans?\" Chen Yu Ying laughed and said, \"Actually, I could treat everyone, but Wanqiu and the others might feel embarrassed.\"\n\"Class Rep, you know me, I have always been thick-skinned. Please be sure to treat me completely. I certainly won’t feel embarrassed,\" Lin Li said righteously.\n\"Nope.\" Chen Yu Ying blinked her eyes and responded as soon as Lin Li finished speaking.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"I won’t treat you. I would rather treat Bai Bufan than you. You pay your own way.\"\nChen Yu Ying turned her head away ’indifferently’ and even hummed softly.\n\"Class Rep, you’ve changed. You used to give me money right away when I asked, even asking if it was enough. But now, to my surprise, you refuse without hesitation, even targeting specifically. You’d rather throw the money to the dogs than give it to me.\nOur relationship is apparently not what it used to be.\"\nLin Li was disappointed, lost, and hurt.\n\"Yes, yes, exactly.\" Chen Yu Ying still nodded, her tone very dismissive.\nWang Yuezhi turned his head, his eyes radiating a strange light.\nIndeed, it’s really not what it used to be, bro.\nSeeing Chen Yu Ying’s faint smile with her back to Lin Li, Wang Yuezhi’s strange light faded, and he turned back.\nIt’s true it’s not what it used to be, bro.\n\"In this case, with this price for the National Day holidays, Bai Bufan should find it hard to refuse,\" Lin Li concluded.\n...\n\"Didn’t you ask me this morning if there’s any chance to take you out for National Day? Bufan, now we have it.\" When lunch break ended, and Bai Bufan returned to the classroom, Lin Li said to him.\n\"What?\"\n\"Class Rep invited me out for National Day. Although the place and time aren’t set yet, it definitely won’t be boring, so I’m inviting you too. Are you in or not?\" Lin Li explained briefly.\n\"I’m surprised you thought of me for something like this,\" Bai Bufan was quite interested.\n\"I want to shop with you, go to movies, have some milk tea, and eat delicious food. To me, everything has meaning only if it’s done with you, because I don’t have money myself,\" Lin Li said emotionally.\nBai Bufan moved back a meter with his chair, covering his rear, but when he heard the last twist, he moved back with a grim look.\nAlmost thought Lin Li was going to lose it again.\nWith that final sentence, it indeed has meaning only with him.\n\"Damn it, almost forgot to ask. How much will this trip cost? Can it be as cost-effective as autumn outings during National Day?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"The cap is three hundred per person. Any extra, the rich Class Rep will cover for us. If you cover my share, it will only need six hundred,\" Lin Li explained.\n\"Ha, six hundred yuan also counts as money to me?\" Bai Bufan breathed a sigh of relief and spread out his hands confidently, smiling.\nTsk, tsk, tsk.\nLin Li shook his head. The guy who snagged eight hundred bucks from the Demon Suppression Bureau is really—\n\"—my life, Lin Li! Six hundred is life for me! You’re friggin’ asking me for six hundred!\" Lin Li’s inner thoughts weren’t even finished when his collar was grabbed by Bai Bufan.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"If it were three bucks, I’d do some psychological work for a few days, grit my teeth, and cover you, but you’re asking for three hundred?\" Bai Bufan shook Lin Li’s collar, \"Besides, didn’t you get way more money last week than me? Where’s your money?\"\n\"My money has a purpose,\" Lin Li admitted sheepishly.\n\"What’s the purpose?\"\n\"I don’t know, but it surely has a purpose,\" Lin Li thought for a moment, then answered, \"I’ve got it! I want to deposit it in the bank for interest.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You damn!\"\n\"Just cover your part yourself. The Class Rep’s plan is... basically, so it’s like autumn outings; you’ll need to stay overnight outside. Will your family be okay with that? Don’t change your mind at the last minute,\" Lin Li, not actually planning to have Bai Bufan cover him, said after smoothing his collar.\n\"It’s OK. My family is lax with me. If I tell them, they’ll definitely agree, and they might even give me some budget, maybe even covering all expenses with some left, so I won’t have to use my military funding,\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nIf the ultimate purpose of spending money is for some R&R, how can this not be considered military funding?\n\"You are indeed raised laxly; I can tell by your character. After all, those raised in a more conventional environment are usually reserved and hide under the sofa wagging tails fearfully when guests come,\" Lin Li recognized, analyzing seriously.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nYou fucker.\nIn the afternoon, the school still hadn’t released the full school rankings.\nThis efficiency, truly worthy of a public school.\nWhen the last class ended and the school’s dismissal bell rang, the holiday safety commitment letter along with a few exam papers were handed out, signifying the official start of the National Day holiday.\nPutting on a raincoat, Lin Li rode his bike home and opened the door.\nWu Min was already sitting on the sofa looking at her phone.\n\"Oh wow, isn’t this the Sister Min who throws her own son at the school gate, leaving him to fend for himself? You actually remembered to come back? You actually have feelings for this family?\"\nThe wound of betrayal never heals, so Lin Li naturally wouldn’t miss this sarcastic opportunity.\nWu Min didn’t say anything at first, pulled out a brand new feather duster from under the coffee table, seemingly tempered with oil.\nThis spanking might actually hurt a bit.\n\"I don’t have a son,\" Wu Min said.\n\"Oh, sorry Auntie, I must have come in the wrong door.\" Lin Li immediately shut the door with a ’bang’.\nStanding outside, he sighed.\nPeople shouldn’t be sarcastic at will, now he’s gone and made himself an orphan.\n...\nThis Auntie still has a kind heart; after seeing Lin Li, the orphan, she ultimately chose to adopt him.\n\"Mom, during National Day I might go out for a few days...\" As he ate the food Wu Min cooked, Lin Li informed her.\n\"Are there any girls going?\"\nParents always prioritize asking about the presence of the opposite sex.\n\"Yeah, there are,\" Lin Li said frankly.\n\"Do you still have living expenses? I’ll give you some more, don’t be stingy when going out with girls,\" as expected, Wu Min was more generous at this point, saying, \"How much do you need?\"\nLin Li thought for a while, eagerly looking at Wu Min: \"Mom, we’re planning to buy a homestay together, each person about three million and three hundred, I’m currently short about three million, help me out, thanks.\"\nWu Min: \"...\"\nOnly this son of hers could say something like needing three million.\nGoing out to play and collectively buying a building, huh?\nStill says thanks, how polite.\n\"I’ll give you thirty million.\" Holding back the urge to dump the food on her son’s head, Wu Min sneered.\n\"Really, mom? After all these years, you’re finally telling me I’m actually a rich second generation?\" Lin Li was a bit expectant.\n\"These thirty million are actually: must be happy, must be joyful, and must keep one eye open when you sleep.\" Wu Min also responded to Lin Li’s expectations.\n\"Does the last ten million mean you want to kill me? Even a fierce tiger won’t eat its cubs, Sister Min!\" Lin Li’s expectation turned into horror.\n\"I’ll transfer you five hundred later; you have to find a way to make up the remaining three million yourself, mom can’t help you.\" Wu Min didn’t respond further but said, \"Let me know the names of the classmates going with you; in case I can’t reach you, I can contact them.\"\nWu Min still trusts Lin Li’s independence, but she always has basic concern and worry.\n\"That’s enough, that’s enough, you’ve worked hard during this time, mom, eat more.\" The filial Lin Li started serving his mother food.\nHe only served the potatoes that Lin Li disliked.\nNo meat was served.\n...\nAfter being punished by Wu Min to finish the potatoes, Lin Li rubbed his bloated stomach and lay down on the bed.\nHe took out his phone, and Bai Bufan confirmed once again that he had no problem going out, his family had already agreed.\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Yu Yu is going to visit his grandparents, and Mu Yang’s family already has travel plans... so in the end, it’s just us again. @Lin Li, is Bai Bufan coming?\"\n\"Lin Li: He’s coming; it seems I still have to drag him along.\"\n\"Lin Li invited Bai Bufan to join the group chat.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying initiated a group call.\"\n\"Am I really in this group?\" Bai Bufan’s first reaction upon joining the group call was to tease Lin Li.\n\"An emperor always needs eunuchs by his side, find a chance to castrate yourself, Bufan.\" Lin Li responded with regal laughter.\n\"Your Majesty, I have a small question: I see your group’s name is ’Three People and a Dog,’ may I ask what role His Majesty plays among them?\" Bai Bufan immediately found a point of attack.\n\"They are the three; I am the one, the mighty one.\" Lin Li answered instantly.\nBai Bufan was silent for a moment.\nNot many options left for himself.\n\"Fuck.\"\nEveryone in the voice call immediately laughed out loud.\n\"Alright, let’s get down to business. It’s not fun to go out on a rainy day; I saw the weather forecast says it’ll rain tomorrow and the day after, so how about we leave on the third?\" Chen Yu Ying said after stifling her laughter.\nNo one objected.\n\"Since we don’t know how long we’ll be out, it’s best everyone finishes their homework in the next two days. It’s not much anyway. Now, let’s discuss where to go; places with homestays include...\"\nThe five of them began to discuss, with Lin Li and Bai Bufan mainly playing the role of echoing with ’oh yeah yeah yeah.’\nEventually, the three decided to go to Shanting Town, not too far away, adjacent to Nansang County, a coastal town with both mountains and water, offering more places to have fun than Xiling.\nThe group discussed the travel plans for a while longer before hanging up late at night.\nAfter refusing Bai Bufan’s invitation to play games and harshly mocking him instead, Lin Li started studying for subject one and subject two.\nThis way, when they go out to play, he can find an opportunity to teach Chen Yu Ying this information.\n[Strong Memory] remains consistently useful.\nAfter studying until 10:30, Lin Li went to sleep feeling great.\nSeptember 30th, today is another ordinary day.",

Want to speak, but tears flow first.\nSeptember 30th, this is definitely not an ordinary day.\nThe sky drizzles continuously, so even though it’s already afternoon, it’s still incredibly dark.\nBut for some people, it’s a brand new beginning, a bright future.\nXiling Detention Center.\nSong Luping is receiving his final admonition.\n\"You can go out now, I don’t want to see you here again, be good...\" Speeches everywhere are always boring and lengthy; the detention center director’s is no exception.\nBut finally, it ended.\nSong Luping stepped forward and got his release certificate, along with the previously confiscated belongings and clothes.\nTaking off the uniform representing rank and job security, Song Luping changed into his clothes and headed to the door.\nNo one was there to pick him up at the door.\nThis was normal.\nSong Luping’s family is not in Xiling. Although the Demon Suppression Bureau surely contacted them, it’s not his first time being caught; they’re used to it and naturally wouldn’t travel far just to get him.\nUnder the watchful eyes of the Demon Suppression Envoys, he directly walked through the drizzle and left the detention center.\nThis is... the taste of freedom.\nBy Yellow Heaven, he finally got out.\nSong Luping spread his arms wide, looking up at the sky, not caring about the rain at all.\nAt this moment, he was even a bit moved to tears.\nHe felt like Andy from \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"\n\"Some birds aren’t meant to be caged!\" he shouted the classic line.\n\"What a silly bird.\" The Demon Suppression Envoy at the door frowned and couldn’t help but retort.\nSong Luping: \"...\"\nThe mood he painstakingly built was completely ruined.\nAlthough he was caught several times, this time felt really different for Song Luping.\nThis time, for some reason, he was targeted.\nSong Luping was very sure he misjudged something. His most esteemed junior, Bai Bufan, his connections in the Demon Suppression Bureau, are definitely not with Yangliang.\nMoreover, Yangliang most likely has a bad relationship with Bai Bufan in there.\nWhen arrested, after saying he knew Bai Bufan and seeing Yangliang’s reaction, he thought he was in luck, but it turned out to be against him.\nNot only was he the first to be judged and sentenced, but he also entered the detention center at lightning speed and received much more \"attention\" than in previous times.\nThe legal texts and conduct rules he had to recite were always picked during spot checks!\nWhen cleaning or engaging in recreational activities, the hardest and most tedious tasks were always given to him.\nIs this fair?\nThis isn’t right!\nYangliang was even the only person who visited him in prison, each time asking where it was hard or tiring. After answering honestly, he found those tasks doubled the next day.\n—Should’ve known better than to answer. Yangliang is such a petty person, abusing his power!!\nAnd if it weren’t for the upcoming National Day holiday, he would still be stuck there, unable to get out.\nSo this release really made Song Luping want to cry.\nAfter venting his emotions, Song Luping first found somewhere to shelter from the rain, then turned on his phone.\nLow battery.\n\"Damn it.\" Cursing under his breath, Song Luping had to return to the small place where he had already paid half a month’s rent to charge his phone.\nFinally, it was powered on.\nFirst, he needed to tell his boss he was willing to work overtime during National Day. If he didn’t earn money, not being able to pay rent would be one thing, but not having money for women would be the end of him.\nThen, Song Luping opened the small box in his bedside table, took out the hidden backup fund inside, and started rubbing his hands excitedly.\n\"Fifteen days, fifteen days, I’ve finally made it through these fifteen days!\"\nHe hadn’t indulged for fifteen days.\nThis number is terrifying; he must release some tension.\nAs a former quasi-patron king of Xiling, Song Luping could never solve it on his own.\nThis is a matter of dignity.\nTo celebrate the end of his detention, he’s going to get a woman!\nSong Luping was quite glad he knew Bai Bufan, because knowing him allowed him to compile a map of Xiling Chicken Farm that he knew.\nThus, now he doesn’t have to trouble himself looking through cards and phone numbers; he just needs to pull out the document and glance at it.\n\"Who should I favor today?\" Song Luping mused like an emperor about to choose a consort.\n\"It’s you! Love River!\"\nSong Luping picked up the phone and dialed the number.\n\"...\"\n\"Sorry, the number you dialed is switched off. Please try again later.\"\nNot working today? Understandable, taking a day off.\nTry another one.\n\"You can do it too!\"\n\"...\"\n\"Sorry, the number you dialed is switched off. Please try again later.\"\nSong Luping frowned slightly, then realized.\nThe National Day is coming soon, those with legitimate businesses are probably on holiday. He can still look for the self-employed ones without physical stores; after all, because it’s him, they’re willing to come to him.\nSong Luping opened WeChat and randomly selected a madam’s WeChat contact.\n\"Song Luping: Big sis, is anyone available to help send a package today?\"\nAfter using the codeword, Song Luping waited with anticipation again.\nThere was no response.\nSong Luping scratched his head in irritation.\n\"Song Luping: Is there stock today?\"\nHe tried another one, but still no response.\nSong Luping clenched his teeth, and decided to send a group message, figuring that he could apologize to the other sisters later.\n—This actually violated his own beetle code, but Song Luping couldn’t hold back any longer.\nThen countless messages went unanswered, as if sinking into the sea.\nWhat on earth has happened to this world?\nSong Luping was filled with terror.\n「Hua’Er: Brother Ping? You’re out already?」\nSeeing that someone finally replied to him, Song Luping’s hands shook in excitement.\n「Song Luping: Xiaohua’Er, yes, it’s me! Has anyone asked you out today? If not, come over to brother’s place to hang out?」\n「Song Luping: Hua’Er, let me tell you, damn it, this is crazy.」\n「Song Luping: [Screenshot]」\n「Song Luping: Did you see that? None of these people are replying to me, don’t know why they’ve stopped doing business.」\n「Hua’Er: ...」\n「Hua’Er: Brother Ping, I’m actually free today, but I’m no longer in Xiling. I’ll entertain you next time you’re in Yangshun.」\n「Hua’Er: As for why things look like they do in your picture... Brother Ping, you might not know, but the situation in Xiling has changed.」\n「Hua’Er: It’s not that they’re not replying to you; they’ve all been arrested, and the earliest they’ll be released is after National Day.」\nSong Luping: \"?\"\n「Song Luping: What a joke! All arrested? I was only gone for fifteen days! How could so many be arrested?」\nSong Luping couldn’t believe it.\n「Hua’Er: It’s true, brother. Xiling organized an unprecedented targeted sweep ten days ago, taking down nearly all the chicken farms there without any warning.」\n「Hua’Er: I’m one of the lucky few to have survived this sweep. The rest of us sisters are either preparing to wash our hands of it for good and marry an honest man, or like me, relocating our collective businesses and moving to other places to work, determined never to work in Xiling again.」\n「Hua’Er: Right now in Xiling, you won’t find a single chicken farm still daring to do business. They’re either closed, lying low, or have escaped.」\n\"Thud.\"\nSong Luping’s phone fell to the ground, and he hesitated to pick it up.\nAfraid to open his eyes, hoping it’s just a hallucination.\nHow could this be.\nWas I really only gone for fifteen days, not fifteen years?\nNo, no way, this can’t be true!\nPulling off the phone before it was fully charged, Song Luping suddenly pushed open the door and ran crazily into the rain.\nHow to describe heavy rain without saying rain?\nOverpass, Maybach, Nibelungen.\nDeep night, Song Luping, shared bicycle.\nWith his electric bike out of power, Song Luping, having to make do with a shared bicycle, braved all the rain, finally reaching the chicken farm nearest to his home.\nHe dashed upstairs.\nSealed notice.\n\"Haha.\" Song Luping let out a tragic laugh, hopped onto the shared bicycle, and headed to the next place.\nSealed notice.\nStore transfer.\nClosed for business.\nThe place was deserted.\nThe backlash from pedaling the bike full tilt for a long time hit, creatine filled Song Luping’s legs, rendering him incapable of going any further.\nThe rain continued to fall.\nThere was a roof nearby that could shelter him from the rain, but Song Luping, in utter despair, just sat on the shared bicycle, letting the rain blur his vision.\nPerhaps it wasn’t rain.\nThings change, nothing remains the same, tears precede words.\n\"Haha.\"\n\"Haha.\"\n\"Hahaha——\"\nSong Luping lifted his head, bursting into maniacal laughter.\n\"Gone! It’s all gone!\"\n\"The work of my life! It’s all gone!!!\"\n\"The connections of my life, they’ve all been destroyed!!!\"\nSong Luping shouted loudly, even though it was deep into the night.\nSomeone in the surrounding residential buildings curiously turned on a light and stuck their head out to look at Song Luping.\nSomeone sighed sympathetically—\nFor something to make such a young person collapse like this, it must be really tragic; I hope he can hold on.\nSomeone else, refined—\n\"What are you screaming about, huh! Don’t you know people need to sleep at night? Screw you! You idiot!\"\nA shamed Song Luping hunched his neck and slunk away, pushing his bicycle.\nHe looked at his phone, soaked with rainwater.\nThe face of the only soulmate of his life, Bai Bufan, flooded his mind.\nIn these past two weeks, he must have been enduring the most.\n\"Bufan, brother is back,\" Song Luping hoarsely murmured.\nHe recalled Bai Bufan’s WeChat ID and sent a friend request.\n...\nLin Li, who was asleep, opened his eyes groggily.\nTurning over, he adjusted the part of his underwear wedged in his backside, and went back to sleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 217: Chapter 184: A rod-shaped shadow appeared on Lin Li’s face\n\"’Defend.’ requests to add you as a friend.\"\nOn October 1st, Lin Li, woken up by his 4:30 alarm, saw this message on his phone.\n\"Silently counting, fifteen days have already slipped away from my hand; like a drop of water on a needle’s tip dripping into the ocean, my days drip into the stream of time without a sound or shadow, making my head sweat and my tears pour down unwittingly.\"\n\"Brother Ping, I miss you so much.\"\n\"Ignore\"\nAfter reciting the elementary school text, Lin Li naturally chose to neither accept nor reject it, treating it coldly.\nNostalgia is nostalgia, but Song Luping is useless now. There’s no point in adding him until the system issues a task that requires him.\nEven though Lin Li is a storytelling king, he can’t just make up stories everywhere.\nAdding him back for nonsense is just trouble.\nSwitching back to his main account, he saw someone mass sending National Day greetings.\nLin Li smiled slightly.\n\"Lin Li: October 1st, a bright moon in the sky; friends and family, enjoy the moon and flowers; moments of reunion, screw it; reminiscing the past, full of blessings; a full moon, looking forward; National Day, may all things go well!\"\n\"Wang Ze: ...\"\n\"Wang Ze: Are you beating a dead horse?\"\nLin Li was somewhat shocked; Wang Ze actually replied instantly. Was he already up at this time?\nNo, that’s not right.\nSometimes you already know the answer when you ask the question.\n\"Lin Li: Are you still awake?\"\n\"Wang Ze: No shit, were you asleep?\"\n\"Lin Li: You’ve wasted your whole life; I’ll carry the flag of the only male athlete in class four. I went to bed at ten last night and just got up.\"\n\"Wang Ze: A friendly reminder, it’s earlier to sleep at six in the morning than you who just sleep at ten at night; you’re the wasted one.\"\n\"Lin Li: ...Stupid.\"\n\"Wang Ze: I won’t say more; I need to go wash my hands.\"\n\"Lin Li: Hmm? What are you washing your hands for at 4 a.m.?\"\n\"Wang Ze: The kid is too clingy.\"\n\"Lin Li: ...What the hell.\"\nLike hell the kid is too clingy; this kid is probably in the billions.\nBecause it’s still raining today, even though it’s already 4:30 in the morning, outside is as dark as midnight. In this weather, morning exercise has to be in the living room.\nThe sound of my exercise isn’t too loud, thankfully, so it won’t wake Wu Min up.\nProgress now is (24/30), today I can reach 25 after practice, and I’m expecting to finish the task by the 6th. We can say victory is at hand.\n[Update complete.]\nHowever, when pulling up the system, Lin Li saw this notification.\nThen he was a bit puzzled.\nWasn’t there just an update yesterday? Why is there another today?\nDoes this mean updates happen not just on Mondays but also at the start of the month?\nWell, updates are good; this means the system is becoming more humanoid. Lin Li first checked his [store].\nSurprisingly, the free item refresh count hadn’t reset and remained darkened.\nThis update didn’t even provide the basic update benefits?\nUnlucky.\nLin Li clicked on the unnamed interface that appeared, finally finding the update point—a button in the otherwise blank interface was lit up, suggesting interaction was possible.\nSo Lin Li clicked as swiftly as possible.\nThere seemed to be a blinding white light flashing before his eyes, making him instinctively close them.\nThe overwhelming white light soon faded, and Lin Li opened his eyes. The good news was that there were no Genshin graphics before him.\nThe bad news was that he was surrounded by ruins and rubble. It was just breaking dawn, a faint light filtering through the clouds, faintly revealing the surroundings that seemed to be a city turned to ruins. Strange howling noises echoed from afar, accompanied by a faint stench in the air.\nLin Li blinked.\nLin Li blinked, blinked again.\nLin Li blinked several more times.\nIs this right, dude?\nThis can’t be right.\n\"Holy crap!!\"\n\"Damn it!!\"\n\"Where the hell did I end up? Is this still in the country?\"\n\"Smack!\"\nLin Li acted quickly, giving himself a slap, but the scene before him remained unchanged.\nLooking down, Lin Li saw that he was still wearing a short-sleeved shirt and shorts, along with indoor slippers he didn’t get to change out of.\n\"Did I just travel through space? So suddenly, dude? Damn system, couldn’t you have taken me earlier, now of all times? Are you kidding me?\" Lin Li’s brain slightly short-circuited as the situation before his eyes was completely beyond what he had anticipated.\nHe immediately brought up the system again and opened the same interface.\nOnly now, the button he’d just interacted with became grayed out, but the second button lit up.\nWith a slight sigh of relief.\n\"Ah...\"\nJust as Lin Li was about to try pressing it, he heard a faint raspy sound coming from the distant corner, along with the sound of gravel being stepped on.\nHe was already here, no rush to leave. Lin Li turned his head, and since his phone wasn’t with him, he changed his title to [Light of Xiling] to brighten up the surroundings a bit.\nHis enhanced senses, courtesy of Spiritual Qi, receiving a considerable boost in capability, picked up the noise from far away, but Lin Li still sought cover.\nNothing is more important than personal safety.\nAn individual slowly came into view from around the corner.\nBut calling it a person was a stretch, considering no human has a head and neck forming a sharp angle.\nClumped dirty hair was glued together by some mucus, looking like a withered bush.\nWith a hole in the head and half the cheek sliced off, the mouth couldn’t close, with reddish-brown saliva dripping down.",

      "content": "Chapter 218: Chapter 184: A Rod-Shaped Shadow Appears on Lin Li’s Face_2\nThe skin was generally greenish, with large patches looking as if they were rotting, pitted, and seemingly harboring pus.\nThe intermittent breathing, mixed with thick fluid in the throat, produced a creepy gurgling sound.\nOne eye socket was empty, while the other had a pale eyeball barely hanging in, awkwardly darting around.\n\"Dude... you don’t look like a local either.\" Lin Li said, awkwardly smiling while hiding behind cover.\nThis is a damn zombie!\nThis must be a zombie!\n[Home is always home; the alternate world is ultimately a transient. Family ties are bonds no one can sever. Finally, today, you have obtained the key to return home. Though the stay is brief now, it is a promising start, and one day, you will dwell here forever.\nAfter returning to the modern world, your aura and charm, honed by cultivation techniques in the other world, are far beyond average.\nAt this moment, this beautiful lady who’s fallen for you at first sight, salivating over you, is the best proof.\nOn the day you return home in glory, climb to the peak, the brilliant life in the modern era officially unfolds from this moment!]\n[Task trigger!]\n[Task Four: Hold this beautiful lady’s hand and enjoy the sunrise.]\n[Task Reward: Random Ability*1; Random System Item*1; System Currency*100.]\nLin Li: ᓖ뮤?\nDon’t disturb, let Lin Li think.\nWhere is the beautiful lady?\nLin Li retreated while looking left, right, up, and down, finally confirming that around him, barely anything could be called ’alive’, probably just this guy in front of him, no, this lady.\nSystem? Can you bloody open your eyes and take a good look!\nIs this a beautiful lady?\nI can’t even determine the gender!\nShe fell for me at first sight? Salivating?\n...Seems like it.\nBut! But!\nThat’s just in the literal sense of wanting to eat me, right?\nWhile Lin Li was thinking, the beautiful lady finally locked onto him, who was only showing his head.\n\"Ugh—\" with a low growl, the beautiful lady began running toward Lin Li with a peculiar zombie-like stride, though only her actions were frantic, not her speed.\nBut the distance between the two did start to shorten.\nFight! Fight! Fight!\nIntense battle intent burned within Lin Li’s heart.\nLin Li turned and ran.\nWhile running, he pulled up the system, clicking the second lit button.\nA flash of white light.\nLin Li ran toward the couch ahead and flopped onto it.\nOnce he took a clear look at his surroundings and confirmed it was his home, Lin Li finally breathed a slight sigh of relief, laid on the couch for several seconds before gathering his wits.\nAfter calming down, Lin Li first went to the bathroom to take a shower, spraying disinfectant alcohol all over himself, the soles of his slippers, and the floor he just walked on.\nDon’t fucking bring back any virus from that bizarre world.\nOne must know that a mild modern cold virus could wipe out an entire city a few centuries ago.\nIf it’s due to me that the modern world turns into that world of ruins, the guilt would be immeasurable.\nAfter showering, it was already 4:50, and Lin Li suppressed other thoughts, starting to practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique.\n[For one continuous month...Cumulative at least half an hour (25/30)]\nThis time, it took nearly two hours, practicing till almost seven to complete the task of the day, nearly failing.\nNo way about it, although Lin Li tried hard to be serious, he kept reminiscing those few minutes of bizarre experience, and being distracted would be seen as unserious by the system.\nLin Li lay on the bed.\nNow he could finally think about what just happened.\nFirst, he did cross over for a few minutes, beyond doubt.\nThe lingering Task Four in the [Task] column was the best proof.\nAnd that interface without text, right now, the first two buttons Lin Li had pressed were greyed out, but the third one was lit.\nWithout text, Lin Li wouldn’t press it; who knows what could happen.\nSystem, I badly named it \"bugged\" for a reason.\nThese buttons without text are like giving the next programmer a shit-ton of uncommented code.\nLin Li thinks he managed to decipher that the first button is ’Depart’, the second ’Return’.\nLin Li was actually quite scared; fortunately, there was a ’Return’ button you could press anytime after ’Depart’. Otherwise, if stuck in that world, Lin Li dared not imagine his fate.\nLooking at Task Four’s trigger message.\nLin Li truly gnashed his teeth.\nReturn home, return home, you treat the modern as the Cultivation Realm, as the all-female world, and that place as the modern?\nThe system is truly reliable at being unreliable.\nBut Lin Li could slightly understand the system’s logic.\nThis was supposed to be a button pressed in the Cultivation Realm or all-female world, allowing a return to the modern era.\nBut since Lin Li never traversed, pressing it meant going to another world?\nBut the problem is, based on the information gathered in those one or two minutes.\nThe environment leaned modern; there was no Spiritual Qi sensation, not the Cultivation Realm, and zombie-related missions in the all-female world never mentioned zombies, nor were there Mecha wrecks, so it didn’t look like it, either.\n\"Did it create a new world for me?\" Lin Li could only come to this conclusion.\nToo little information.\nIf Lin Li didn’t immediately return, he could have gained more intelligence.\nBut that was too unstable, firstly for safety, secondly without any preparation, and lastly if wasting time resulting in task one’s interruption, the sunk cost would be too high.\nLooking at Task Four, but one must say, this task’s rewards are very rich; Lin Li was quite tempted.\nWith abilities, items, and currency, all things Lin Li wanted.\nBut... holding hands with a zombie to watch the sunrise?\nSuch a scene is too beautiful, Lin Li isn’t daring enough to imagine it.\n\"Can I just hold hands?\" Lin Li looked at the system’s text, suddenly speaking to himself.\nThe task didn’t say to watch the sunrise with the beautiful lady together, did it?\nBorrow this lady’s hand (literally), can I hold it to watch?\nSince it’s a zombie, borrowing a hand to use isn’t too much, right?\nConsidering the system’s unreliability, Lin Li thought his unreliable idea would be seen as reliable by the system.\nCould try it.\nBut definitely not now, the third button, without text on it, Lin Li won’t press.\nThere are still too many mysteries puzzling Lin Li.\nWait till the first button lights up again, then consider going to that world.\nBesides, must be fully prepared, can’t be haphazard like this time—what’s presently known is, slippers and clothes can accompany oneself through the passage to another world.\nSo next time, Lin Li will sure try bringing weapons and armor, absolutely not going empty-handed.\nThe prerequisite for completing the task is ensuring personal safety.\n\"The funeral master of that world truly lacks foresight, not understanding.\" Lin Li sighed and complained.\nIf Lin Li were a funeral master, he would sure secretly tie all the shoelaces of each deceased together, wouldn’t it be very fun during a zombie apocalypse?\nEntertaining oneself is also saving others.\nIf the beautiful lady couldn’t move, how easy the task would be to complete.\nWhat a pity.\nHaving thought of all these random things, Lin Li collapsed onto his bed, covered his face with a pillow, feeling somewhat lamenting yet amused:\n\"October really gave me a harsh wake-up call.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 219: Chapter 185: Double Standard Little Old Deng\nNumber three.\nThe system hasn’t caused any trouble these past few days, and Lin Li has just been staying at home obediently.\nFor the past two days, after finishing his homework, the things he’s done the most are studying for the driver’s license theory test and researching the most efficient way to use cold weapons.\nAfter all, he would definitely need to rely on the beautiful lady’s hand, and he had to chop it off at some point.\n\"Mom, if a package arrives in the next few days while I’m not home, please remember to pick it up for me,\" Lin Li said while sitting on the sofa to Wu Min, who was coming out of the master bedroom.\nThough it’s hard to buy genuinely lethal weapons online, some basic protective gear and outdoor survival gear are still easy to purchase.\nIn the future, when Lin Li ventures into the zombie world, these will be among his life-saving tools.\nEven though he placed an order on the first, because of the National Day holiday, nothing has been delivered yet. Considering he doesn’t know how many days he’ll be out having fun, Lin Li had no choice but to ask Wu Min for help with collecting the packages.\n\"Got it, are you leaving now? How are you guys getting there? Do you need me to give you a ride?\" Wu Min nodded and asked while looking at Lin Li, who was ready to set off with his backpack.\n\"No need, my classmate said she rented a car to pick us up, and it should be downstairs any minute,\" Lin Li shook his head.\nThe world cannot do without rich ladies.\nRich! Powerful!\n\"Alright.\" Wu Min nodded upon hearing that, then opened Lin Li’s bedroom door, frowning, \"Why does your room look like a pigsty again? If Mom doesn’t clean up for you, you don’t know how to do it yourself?\"\nPreposterous, what pigsty, it’s clearly his cozy haven. It may look cluttered, but in reality, it’s not at all tidy.\nBut it’s okay, Lin Li always knew how to handle Wu Min:\n\"Mom, how could you ask such a question? Everyone knows pigsties are always cleaned by the pig farmers. Have you ever seen pigs sweeping the floor themselves in a pigsty? Besides, now it’s not allowed to become sentient, we’re all rural registered, Mom, you’ve kinda forgotten your roots.\"\nWu Min: \"...\"\nShe really didn’t expect herself to be accused of forgetting her roots.\nSo Wu Min let out a cold laugh: \"I haven’t forgotten my roots, I still know how to slaughter a pig, and this year, we’ll do it earlier, no need to wait till the end of the year.\"\n\"I’m sorry, Mom.\" Lin Li was a pro at apologizing gracefully.\n[Chen Yu Ying: @Lin Li, about five more minutes until we reach your apartment building.]\n[Lin Li: Okay, I’ll head to the door now.]\nAfter seeing the message, Lin Li got up: \"Mom, I’m heading out.\"\n\"Alright, have fun.\"\n\"Hey Mom, can you give me three million? It’s really important to me.\"\n\"You, get out of here.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nWith his backpack on, Lin Li went to the entrance of the residential area.\nForget five minutes; possibly not even three had passed when a pitch-black business van drove over and stopped right in front of Lin Li.\nThe one-way window went down slowly, and the bright smile of the young girl inside made the sunlight even more radiant.\nHer makeup was fresh and elegant, with normally straight black hair now ending in several small curls.\n\"Lin Li,\" Chen Yu Ying waved her hand.\nInside the car, it was just Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, as Bai Bufan and Qu Wanqiu didn’t live in Xiling Town and would be picked up after Lin Li.\n\"Oh, haven’t even reached Disney World, yet I saw a princess first?\" Lin Li smiled and complimented while looking at Chen Yu Ying’s curly hair.\nThe window, which had been fully lowered, went back up halfway, obscuring the girl’s slightly flushed face.\nHer eyes glared at Lin Li softly.\n\"Lin Li, so this is where you live?\" Chen Yu Ying curiously glanced at the apartment complex behind Lin Li, trying hard to change the topic.\n\"Darn, class monitor, you’ve already figured out my home address.\nEven though it’s usually just me at home, and I don’t like closing doors, and I sleep like a log, where even if someone broke in and did something to me, I wouldn’t resist—I still hope that, class monitor, you’d keep your distance and not disturb me in the middle of the night. I certainly wouldn’t accept or look forward to such a thing. Oh right, my exact address is 7-502, just don’t go to the wrong place.\"\nThis long-winded sentence was really too long. Even Lin Li had to take two breaths to finish.\nChen Yu Ying, Ding Sihan: \"...\"\n\"Who would bother disturbing you in the middle of the night?\" Chen Yu Ying chuckled, pouting her lips.\n\"Really not? What a pity. But that’s okay, class monitor, can you tell me your exact address? I’ll come to bother you every weekend in the middle of the night. In this field, I’m an expert, quite experienced.\" Lin Li suggested, showing it wasn’t a big problem.\nAt this time, the car window on the driver’s side also rolled down, and the driver looked at Lin Li.\n\"Driver sir, where should I put my bag? Can you open the trunk, please?\" Lin Li started to speak.\n\"He’s my dad. Dad, this is Lin Li.\" Chen Yu Ying added at this moment.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li blinked.\nThis Old Deng seemed to indeed be the Old Deng he had met twice before, but both times were from a distance, so he didn’t remember too clearly.\nConsidering what he just said...\nOh dear!\n\"Hello, driver uncle!\"\n\"Pft!\"\n\"Hello, Uncle driver!\"\n\"Pft!\"\n\"Hello, Uncle Chen!\"\nChen Zhongping: \"...\"\nWhat sort of good kid starts a greeting with a double spit?\n\"I’ve opened the trunk, go put it in,\" he said.\nLin Li didn’t immediately go over; instead, he turned to Chen Zhongping seriously: \"Uncle, I was just kidding around. I don’t bother girls randomly in the middle of the night, honestly.\"\nDamn.\nIf Lin Li had known that Chen Yu Ying’s dad was driving, he wouldn’t have said that lengthy sentence out loud, but rather whispered it to Chen Yu Ying after getting in the car.\nChen Zhongping: \"...\"\n\"Right, Uncle. Lin Li always does thorough planning before disturbing, lots of reconnaissance involved; he’s very ethical in harassment,\" Ding Sihan added on Lin Li’s... \"behalf.\"\nOriginally using a grateful glance toward Ding Sihan, Lin Li’s emotions in his eyes transformed into ’resentment.’\n\"We have decent security at home, you can’t just enter on a whim. Get in the car first,\" Chen Zhongping gestured as he turned his head.\nThe trunk had considerable space, and with only a suitcase in it, Lin Li placed his bag in the corner before getting into the car from one side.\nWith seating for seven including the driver, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan sat in the three-person rear row, which was slightly cramped due to the luggage behind.\nProbably because there were three girls, the larger, more comfortable aviation seats were left for Lin Li and Bai Bufan instead.\nChen Yu Ying was wearing a fashionable light purple and bright white interwoven dress today, revealing she probably really liked dresses.\nLin Li also liked dresses, but Wu Min said boys shouldn’t wear dresses and only bought them for herself, not for Lin Li.\nAll he could say was it’s frustrating and disappointing.\nThe light inside the car outlined soft shadows around Chen Yu Ying’s profile, interlacing light and shadow, beauty and grace.\nXu Song was right: purple girls do have a special charm.\nThe only flaw was the slight upward curve at the corner of the young girl’s mouth, seemingly mocking him.\nOh, right, the same applied to Ding Sihan sitting beside who was also dressed and mocking Lin Li.\nOkay, putting aside personal bias against Ding Sihan, she wore a white T-shirt and slim-fit jeans today, with the extra part of the shirt tucked into her waist, actually not bad, felt like she could kick him to death.\nOnboarding, Lin Li’s gaze locked onto the system.\nHowever, even until he sat stably and Chen Zhongping started driving, the system didn’t trigger any tasks, leaving Lin Li unsure whether to feel disappointed or not.\nHowever, Lin Li soon turned his head to ask Chen Yu Ying in a low voice: \"Class monitor, didn’t you say it was a rented car? Why’s your dad driving?\"\n\"I rented my dad’s car, and he’s our driver, why wouldn’t it count?\"\nChen Yu Ying pursed her lips with a smile, her bright eyes filled with innocence.\n\"Is your dad strict or anything?\" Lin Li cautiously probed.\n\"Not at all, he’s quite open-minded and gentle, a really great dad,\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head.\nOriginally planning to continue praising her father, Chen Yu Ying halted her words suddenly, noting Lin Li’s expression didn’t show any disappointment then let out a breath of relief internally.\nLin Li also let out a sigh of relief.\nHe most feared interacting with stern elders who didn’t joke around.\n\"Uncle Chen.\"\nLin Li quickly tried striking up a conversation with Chen Zhongping, wanting to further express his brightness and greatness—that he wasn’t a pervert.\nAnd then he saw Chen Zhongping turn his head, his stern, even cold expression, speaking with no emotion: \"What’s the matter?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nClass monitor, you liar.\nYour Old Deng is not open-minded and gentle at all.\n\"Dad, I’ve sent the address of the next classmate to your WeChat, check it out,\" Chen Yu Ying also spoke up at this moment.\n\"Alright, Daddy got it~\" Chen Zhongping turned his head further, now smiling warmly and openly, nodding.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nIs this right?",

      "content": "Chapter 220: Chapter 186: Not That Outstanding\nThis isn’t right, is it?\n\"Uncle?\"\nWhen Lin Li tried calling again and saw Chen Zhongping’s face become serious when he looked at him, possibly even glaring, Lin Li understood.\nThe Chen Family probably inherited the art of face-changing.\nBut it’s understandable; he brought it on himself. Can’t blame Old Chen for not having a good attitude towards him.\nSince being ’targeted’, Lin Li quietly scrolled through his phone all the way, responding occasionally when the two girls behind him spoke.\nEvery time he spoke, Lin Li felt the gaze from the front seat.\nSo many witty remarks had to be swallowed regretfully.\nNext time, he should ensure the surroundings are safe before messing around, Lin Li regrets his recent long-winded speech.\nBai Bufan’s house is quite far; after more than half an hour, the car finally arrived at his apartment block.\n\"Lin Li: @Bai Bufan, we’re downstairs. Where are you?\"\nSeeing no one at the first floor, Lin Li sent a message in the group.\n\"Bai Bufan: Didn’t you say ten minutes? Why are you here now? I’m still packing, wait a bit.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: No worries, take your time packing.\"\nChen Yu Ying doesn’t like making people wait, so she always gives a later expected arrival time. It was the same when they arrived at Lin Li’s house earlier.\n\"I’ll go up and rush him.\"\nAfter the car stopped completely, Lin Li felt Chen Zhongping wasn’t watching the road anymore and was spying on him, making him feel uncomfortable staying in the car.\nSo he might as well visit Bai Bufan’s house, maybe he could find some gold bars or other small items, take full advantage.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan had no objections, so Lin Li went up alone.\nBai Bufan had already shared his exact location, including his apartment number, in the group.\n\"Knock knock knock.\" Once he reached by elevator, Lin Li knocked on the door.\nThe door was opened by a woman, presumably Bai Bufan’s mom.\n\"Hello Auntie, I’m Lin Li, Bufan’s classmate.\" Lin Li nodded politely and bowed slightly.\n\"Ah, hello hello, you’re here early! Bufan just woke up and is freshening up, come in first, here are some slippers for you.\" Mrs. Bai was very warm and welcoming.\nIf only Old Chen were this friendly, or the few hours left of the journey wouldn’t be so arduous.\nLin Li walked into the bathroom to meet eyes with Bai Bufan, who was brushing his teeth, dressed in pajamas and shorts.\nBai Bufan was a bit awkward: \"Haha, hello, I’m Venom.\"\n\"Weren’t you packing? Why just woke up? Looks like you got up after seeing my message?\" Lin Li smirked without genuine amusement.\n\"I’m packing myself, am I not part of the stuff?\" Bai Bufan chuckled.\n\"Playing dumb, you little rascal, tell me Buffan, what kind of wise guy are you?\" Lin Li’s expression was doting, but his words carried a slight jab.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"I’m almost ready, just need to change clothes after washing up, packed my things last night, didn’t expect you all to be early. Justice is always delayed, why can’t I sleep ten more minutes?\"\nBai Bufan felt a bit aggrieved.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nBringing justice into oversleeping, Bai Bufan sure has a way.\nAfter rinsing his mouth, Bai Bufan hastily wiped his face and headed to the bedroom.\nLin Li followed him.\nNeat and tidy.\n—Except that it has nothing to do with Bai Bufan’s bedroom.\nAs everyone knows, dirty clothes in the washing machine, clean clothes in the closet, and those in-between clothes just go on the chair next to the bed, while Bai Bufan’s bedroom chair was bearing weights it shouldn’t at this age.\n\"Weren’t you told to finish homework these days, why is it all blank?\" Lin Li wandered around, touching and probing, noticed the blank homework on the desk, and teased.\n\"No way, I tried, but just after one problem my phone got jealous, had to appease it for three hours. With such a phone, what can I do?\"\nBai Bufan, in the middle of changing clothes, explained helplessly.\n\"Lin Li, you must know, a phone’s lifespan is 3 to 5 years, but human lifespan is 70 to 100 years. Phones are just a passersby in humans’ lives, but for phones, humans are their entire lives, so I mustn’t neglect it, must spend more time with it.\"\n\"Didn’t expect you to be so sentimental.\" Lin Li was moved, touched by his words.\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nLin Li: \"Then why get a new phone? Your old one still has life, being so sentimental, I’ll help you deal with the new one when it arrives.\"\n\"No, that’s another matter completely, isn’t there a possibility I’m devoted to the harem philosophy?\" Bai Bufan immediately corrected.\nLin Li responded with a scornful laugh.\nAfter changing clothes, Bai Bufan carried the suitcase that was ready in the living room, and went to change shoes at the entrance.\n\"Auntie, we’re leaving.\" Seeing Mrs. Bai sitting on the living room sofa, Lin Li bade farewell.\n\"Leaving? Take some fruits for the road.\" Mrs. Bai immediately got up, grabbed some oranges from the coffee table, and handed them to Lin Li.\n\"No need, thank you, Auntie, the car’s fully stocked, we’ve got everything. Thanks anyway.\" Lin Li said.\n\"Such a good, polite kid, if only Bufan were more like you.\" Mrs. Bai nodded contently at Lin Li.\nWhile bending over to change shoes, Bai Bufan halted his movement, looked at his mother through his legs: \"Huh?\"\nIs this even human language?\nGood? Polite?\nIf one day he really was like Lin Li, their house would probably start anew.\n\"Lin Li? Sensible and polite? Mom, your misunderstanding of him is too deep, he’s even more me than I am!\" Bai Bufan couldn’t stand his mom praising Lin Li, he immediately undermined.\n\"How dare you curse!\" Mrs. Bai frowned.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nGeez, mom’s words are hurtful.\n\"Lin Li, you must be very good at home, right?\" Mrs. Bai asked Lin Li.\n\"Not particularly good.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nBai Bufan snorted, acknowledging Lin Li’s honesty.\n\"I usually linger in bed until around four or five in the morning, after making breakfast for the family, I take at least an hour of rest, then do laundry and mop the floor. At noon, I usually give my mom a simple massage...\" Lin Li continued to describe.\n\"Just earlier, we debated who’s cleaning the house with my mom.\"\nOut in the world, identity is self-given.\nBai Bufan couldn’t believe what he heard.\nBecause he’s been in the rain, should he tear his umbrella too?\nSeeing his mom’s gaze towards Lin Li getting more pleased while her look towards him got more distasteful, Bai Bufan hurriedly pulled Lin Li away, whispering: \"Shut it! Shut it! Come on! Don’t keep them waiting!\"\nAfter the elevator doors closed and the first floor was selected, Bai Bufan suddenly pressed the open door button and intended to go outside.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Lin Li asked in confusion.\n\"I forgot the pocket money by my bed; too troublesome to deposit seventy to eighty bucks in the bank, useless at home, just like waste paper, gotta spend it.\" Bai Bufan explained.\n\"Unnecessary, spend it next time, they’ve been waiting quite a few minutes already.\" Lin Li held Bai Bufan’s arm, signaling time was of the essence.\n\"My house is right here, getting my mom to fetch it takes less than thirty seconds, how much time can it waste.\" Bai Bufan emphasized.\n\"Oh, honestly, can’t do anything about you, already got them for you, here.\" Sighing, Lin Li got those scattered bills out from his pocket, handing them to Bai Bufan.\n\"Eh? Thanks.\" After seeing they really were his bedside money, Bai Bufan happily accepted.\nThe elevator doors closed, beginning to descend.\n\"Wait.\"\nBai Bufan realized something and turned, pressing his forehead against Lin Li’s:\n\"Why is my money in your pocket?\"\n\"Obviously I foresaw you’d forget, surely can’t be I wanted to take them, right? Impossible, I wouldn’t do such a thing.\" Lin Li answered innocently.\n\"You only took the money, right?\"\nLin Li stepped back and nodded hard: \"Yes.\"\nBai Bufan squinted, reached into Lin Li’s pockets, felt familiar items, revealing a relaxed smile, voice turning cold:\n\"What’s the hell is this?\"\n\"My lucky fidget spinner.\"\n\"What the hell is this?\"\n\"My lucky nail clipper.\"\n\"What’s the hell is this?\"\n\"My genuine Xiling chicken roll, in abstinence, stop meddling.\"\n\"Damn he’s right! Are you wearing crotchless pants?\" Bai Bufan flinched, then hysterically pressed the elevator’s sanitizing alcohol.\n\"Just kidding, it’s actually your bedside corndog, hehe.\"\n\"...Damn it!\"",

Especially so calm after getting together, that was hard to overlook, prompting Chen Yu Ying to question them.\n\"Right, how come Lin Li isn’t even checking his phone? Shouldn’t he start watching those borderline videos by now?\" Ding Sihan also queried.\nThe subtle gazes from the rearview mirror instantly sharpened.\nLin Li gulped, thinking, Xiaodingding, the parents are here, you’re killing me...\nBai Bufan laughed awkwardly, \"No, no problem.\"\nThat subtle gaze concentrated solely on Lin Li.\n\"No, just enjoying the scenery.\" Lin Li could only say.\n\"Does it have to do with my dad?\" Chen Yu Ying seemed to have keenly picked up the now single difference from their outing.\n\"But I’ve already told dad about your personality, you don’t need to worry about earlier. He knows you mean no harm.\"\nChen Yu Ying spoke earnestly and naturally.\nOtherwise, she would’ve stepped in to explain for Lin Li when he said those long sentences earlier.\nDing Sihan also nodded, she was no slouch with emotional intelligence. She dared to ’defame’ Lin Li in front of Chen Zhongping precisely because Chen Yu Ying had informed her beforehand.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li looked up at the rearview mirror.\nThe other party averted their gaze.\nClass Rep, did you really say it?\nDoesn’t seem like it.\nLin Li blinked, took a deep breath, if this was the case...\nA life without cheeky banter is no different than living as Bai Bufan!\n\"Class Rep, your dad is indeed glaring at me, I’m really too scared to misbehave...\" Lin Li mustered up his courage, deciding to tattle, but his voice was still weak.\nThe car went quiet for a few seconds.\n\"Dad!\" Chen Yu Ying angrily turned her head, trying to make eye contact with her father at the wheel.\n\"No! I wasn’t glaring at him, let him act up as he wishes!\" Chen Zhongping hastily denied, appearing a bit flustered.\n\"Really! Especially when you guys talk to me, your dad glares at me even more fiercely, Bufan can attest, he was also glared at.\"\nSeeing Chen Zhongping fluster, Lin Li was emboldened, bolstered by borrowed strength, directing his gaze at Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan gritted his teeth.\nLin Li had started the confrontation, and he must join the fray!\n\"Exactly! Uncle has been glaring at us the whole time!\" Bai Bufan concurred.\n\"Dad!\" Chen Yu Ying raised her voice a bit more, frowning with clear displeasure.\n\"I didn’t.\" Chen Zhongping was still stubborn.\nLin Li covered his eyes with his arm, voice trembling, \"His glare was so intense I could barely speak, almost making me cry.\"\nBai Bufan copied, \"I want to cry too.\"\nChen Zhongping: \"?\"\nIf not for Chen Yu Ying’s heads-up earlier, Lin Li would’ve stayed silent until Chen Zhongping left, knowing full well that in front of an elder whose first impression was negative 100, acting up meant a death sentence.\nNot everyone was going to like his personality, Lin Li was fully aware.\nBut now, sorry uncle, since you’ve heard the truth about me—let nature be unbridled!\n\"I feel so aggrieved now, constantly wondering if I did something wrong to deserve such treatment.\" Lin Li continued embellishing, fanning the flames was the best.\n\"I feel the same, like I’ve turned into a criminal.\" Bai Bufan parroted, disrupting the father-daughter relationship was the best.\n\"I’m even thinking of going home, at least at home I won’t feel like this.\" Lin Li kept going.\n\"...\"\nRealizing there was no ’echo’, Lin Li confusedly looked at Bai Bufan: \"Why did you stop?\"\nBai Bufan laughed sheepishly, pointing not far away, \"My house is over there, I’m afraid uncle might actually take a turn and drop me home. Earlier, after hearing your stories, my mom seemed to consider abandoning me, I wouldn’t feel comfortable going home, can’t join in on this.\"",

If I had known, I wouldn’t have agreed to let you drive us!\" Chen Yu Ying, who had mastered the ability to extract real information from Lin Li’s exaggerated descriptions, successfully analyzed the situation and said with great dissatisfaction.\nWe clearly agreed beforehand.\n\"I really didn’t, just took a look at them, didn’t glare, and there was noise in the back, so isn’t it normal to look? Not looking would be wrong! No worries, just keep talking, I don’t dislike the kids.\" Chen Zhongping tried to explain.\n\"I don’t believe you.\"\n\"When did Dad ever lie to you.\"\n\"This morning, when you said your driver was sick.\"\nChen Zhongping: \"...\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Dad! Stop the car!\" Chen Yu Ying demanded in a commanding tone.\nWhen Chen Zhongping stopped the car, Chen Yu Ying immediately got out and sat in the front passenger seat.\n\"You guys keep talking, I’ll keep an eye on my dad. If he dares to glare at you again, I’ll glare at him and let Mom be mad at him throughout the National Day.\" After fastening her seatbelt, Chen Yu Ying glared at Chen Zhongping.\nChen Zhongping: \"...\"\n\"Drive!\"\n\"Oh.\" Chen Zhongping blinked and started the vehicle again, now forced to stare straight at the road ahead.\nThe four in the back exchanged looks, then Lin Li and Bai Bufan began to chuckle softly.\nLin Li quickly turned to gaze at Ding Sihan:\n\"Ding Sihan, I’ll make it clear once more, I wasn’t watching borderline videos before, I was watching #normal wear# no bad influence# dress freedom# freedom from being defined independent women, don’t insult them!\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nLin Li must have held this in for several minutes.\nPoor guy.\nBut this is the real Lin Li.\n\"No looking back! Focus on driving!\"\nJust as Ding Sihan was about to speak, she was interrupted and amused by the voice from the front seat.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged glances.\nHehe.\nNow, neither of them is feeling awkward.\nChen Zhongping sat up straight, eyes on the road, occasionally hearing the chatter and laughter of his daughter’s friends and those dangerous creatures behind him, and if his glance in the rearview mirror was a bit stern, his daughter’s headband would land on his hand.\nBut he didn’t feel the slightest discomfort.\nGlancing at his daughter, who was glaring unhappily at him with arms crossed, Chen Zhongping found her adorably fierce, but... sigh...\nHeh heh.\nWhoever dares to mess with my precious daughter, this old man will end him—I’ve already got the pig-killing rune ready to go.\n\"No laughing! Watch the road!\" Watching her father suddenly enter a state of simultaneous laughter and sternness, Chen Yu Ying sternly tapped her father’s arm with the headband again.\n\"...Sorry.\"\n...\nSince Shanting is adjacent to Nansang, it took less than an hour to reach Shanting.\n\"Ying Bao, are we almost there?\" Ding Sihan asked after seeing the road sign \"Next Stop: Shanting\".\n\"Yeah, about ten more minutes. Since it’s a single-story house, it’s a bit on the outskirts, I sent the exact location in the group,\" said Chen Yu Ying, glancing at the car’s GPS.\nDing Sihan nodded, checked her phone, \"Then it’ll be almost noon when we get there. We can drop our stuff and find a restaurant to eat. I’ll check the guide to see if there’s a must-eat place in Shanting.\"\n\"Alright, we can cook for ourselves tonight.\" Chen Yu Ying agreed.\n\"Aren’t you going to ask Bufan?\" Lin Li asked curiously, looking at Ding Sihan, \"He’s the expert in this field.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nSo I’m an expert again?\n\"Did Bai Bufan already make a guide? I thought you two weren’t interested in stuff like that,\" Ding Sihan looked curiously at Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan pointed to himself: \"Me?\"\nFaced with Bai Bufan’s puzzled gaze, Lin Li explained, \"Ding Sihan is looking for a must-eat place, and among us here, the most ’must-eat’ is you, who else should she ask?\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn.\nDing Sihan bowed her head and couldn’t stop laughing.\n\"I’m never believing it again when Lin Li says Bai Bufan is an expert,\" she concluded.\n——The last time he was supposedly an expert was when he was an eunuch.\nLet’s just say, having a close relationship with Lin Li is dangerous, you can’t avoid being part of his stories.\nA dozen minutes later, the car finally arrived at the destination.\nChen Yu Ying said calling the place a cottage was selling the homestay short, though not luxurious, it felt more like a self-built small villa from the countryside, with down-to-earth decor that’s both pretty and ugly.\nBut hey, it’s free, no need to be picky.\n\"I feel like this house hugged me when I was a child, it looks quite like my home, hope the internet is good,\" Bai Bufan commented.\nLin Li glanced at Bai Bufan without speaking, and when Bai Bufan curiously turned his head, surprised there was no jab coming,\nSeeing Lin Li lost in thought, he couldn’t help but ask, \"Lin Li, what are you thinking about?\"\n\"I’m thinking about if Little Dragon Girl saw the place Yang Guo used to live, would she sigh and say, ’I also want to experience the life Yang Guo lived’,\" Lin Li said.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWhere’s the cockcrow?\nSometimes Bai Bufan really wants to open up Lin Li’s head to see what exactly is inside.\nAfter the car stopped, everyone got out with their luggage.\nChen Zhongping searched the mailbox at the entrance for a while and found a set of keys left there, which he used to open the gates to the courtyard and house.\n\"Come inside,\" he said.\nThe girls went in first, and just as Lin Li and Bai Bufan were about to follow, Chen Zhongping slightly blocked their path.",

Before coming, she had already briefed him a bit, so he had an idea about Lin Li’s character.\nOtherwise, if he was completely unfamiliar and found Lin Li talking like that to his daughter during their meeting, Chen Zhongping would have turned red long ago, and he wouldn’t just glare at Lin Li.\nHe knew his daughter didn’t mind this.\nBut that didn’t stop Chen Zhongping from wanting to say a few words in private.\n\"Thanks, Uncle, you’re very generous, but could you convert it into cash?\" Lin Li quickly replied.\n\"Ahem, cough, cough!\" Chen Zhongping almost choked on his own words.\nWho the hell told you this could be converted to cash?\n\"No, it can’t.\" After catching his breath, Chen Zhongping said with a dark face.\nLin Li looked a bit disappointed.\nThese days, the older generation always likes to give young people advice or words of wisdom.\nWhat’s the use of these? Young people need some money, why not give that!\n\"Why aren’t you coming in?\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice got closer, accompanied by footsteps, noticing nobody had followed.\n\"Uncle, then please go ahead with your advice.\" Lin Li said, still feeling a bit disappointed.\n\"Give what?\" Chen Yu Ying’s head popped out, looking at the three of them with curiosity.\nEveryone’s eyes turned to Chen Zhongping.\n\"Give... give me a way out.\" Chen Zhongping said.\nWith his daughter there, it wasn’t convenient to continue talking with these two kids.\nLin Li: \"A thousand miles away?\"\nChen Yu Ying happily waved: \"Then bye-bye, Dad?\"\nBai Bufan: \"Skr~\"\nChen Zhongping: \"...\"\nHis daughter’s smile was so sincere.\nChen Yu Ying’s happiness was quite hurtful to Chen Zhongping, his little apple was leaking air.\nForget it, as long as his daughter is happy.\n\"Lin Li seems off-kilter and talks weirdly? But he’s actually a fun and interesting person.\"\nThat’s what she told him before coming.\nOf course, Chen Zhongping wouldn’t completely believe it just like that.\nHowever.\nThe response from the homeroom teacher of Class Four, Xue Jian, was – \"Lin Li and Bai Bufan are both good kids, but indeed it’s not obvious to the naked eye, there’s no need to worry too much.\"\nNot only that.\nThe day before yesterday, Lin Li’s parent actively added him and, upon hearing that he would be there too, hoped he would be tolerant, while warmly reminding him – \"My child might not look human, but he really is, and a good boy at that.\"\nThree strikes.\nThis is the main reason why Chen Zhongping was so tolerant of Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\nAbsolutely not because he was afraid of his daughter being upset, even if he dared to be angry, he didn’t dare to say it.\n– At most, at most, it was a secondary reason.\nHowever, Chen Zhongping naturally couldn’t just leave like that. He brought these two \"beasts with the heart of humans\" good kids inside and gave a brief introduction to the indoor facilities to the five of them, focusing on the safety aspects.\nThe space in the homestay was quite large, with four floors in total if you included the basement used partly for storage.\nThe floors were tiled, some with wooden panels, mostly covered with soft mats, so to keep it clean, most areas required shoes to be taken off.\nApart from the pool table which didn’t take up much space, the other entertainment facilities in the party homestay were quite complete, including a home KTV, cinema; mahjong table; foosball, and even an esports room—with five connected desktop computers inside.\n\"Remember what I’m telling you, always be cautious when using fire and electricity, I’ll be in the mountain pavilion these days.\nYingying, later send your dad’s phone number to your group chat, any of you can call me if anything happens, including wanting to go out, I can drive over to take you.\nRight, as a fundamental rule, when you sleep, boys and girls use separate floors, and there’s more than one bathroom here...\"\nChen Zhongping nagged on, repeatedly advising them.\n\"Alright, got it, got it, we’re not kids anymore.\" Chen Yu Ying said with a helpless face.\n\"Indeed, Uncle, I’m almost an adult.\" Lin Li echoed in agreement.\n\"Could it be that because you are not kids anymore, I’m even less at ease?\" Chen Zhongping said, then looked at Lin Li: \"Especially since you’re almost an adult.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nClass leader, how exactly did you describe me to your old dad before coming?\nLin Li seriously suspected that Chen Yu Ying had committed slander against him.\nThis ’especially’, it especially hurts!",

      "content": "Chapter 224: Chapter 188: Prejudice Is an Insurmountable Mountain\n\"Dad!!\"\nAfter a brief silence, Chen Yu Ying stepped forward and pushed Chen Zhongping toward the door. The blush on her face rippled like waves, looking quite pretty, but the words from her mouth were not at all pleasant:\n\"Just go, go! If you keep saying such weird things, I’ll get mad!\"\n\"Sorry, Xiaoding, Xiaoqu, Yingying is counting on you—bang!\" Chen Zhongping’s words, along with his body, were shut out the door.\nXiaolin and Xiaobai seemed to have been ignored, or perhaps he just didn’t have time to entrust them.\nHmm, he must have forgotten to entrust them—at least that’s what Xiaolin thought.\nAfter closing the door, Chen Yu Ying pressed her face to the peephole, observing whether her father had really left.\n\"My dad’s gone. Sometimes he’s just unreliable, don’t take his words seriously.\" After a while, moving her gaze away from the peephole, Chen Yu Ying said somewhat apologetically and helplessly.\nIt’s not that she doesn’t understand her father’s worries, it’s just that she’s already promised, guaranteed, and explained everything at home, yet it still turned out like this.\n\"Actually, it’s understandable. If I found out that among the classmates my daughter went out to play with and stayed overnight, someone of the opposite sex started talking about night raids and perverts, my daughter could never take public office in her life. I can only blame myself.\"\nLin Li didn’t have much temper or resentment, it’s human nature.\nAcquaintances can tell he’s purely joking, but strangers cannot, even though Lin Li would never act like this in front of strangers.\nBut you can’t blame Chen Yu Ying for not saying it in advance, right?\nForget it, better to blame Bai Bufan.\n\"Why can’t she take public office? Are you punishing your daughter by not letting her take it?\" Qu Wanqiu didn’t understand.\n\"Because Lin Li’s daughter’s classmate has already gone down, and Lin Li himself has already gone in, so she definitely can’t pass the background check for public office.\" Bai Bufan understood, so he explained on behalf of Lin Li.\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nUnderstood.\nBut Lin Li skipped too many steps himself, just giving the answer with no points included!\nIn contrast, Chen Yu Ying’s dad does have a pretty good temper.\n\"I should have known not to set up a pervert persona.\" It’s hard to remedy the image in front of Chen Zhongping now, no matter how many good words the class monitor says, it probably won’t help.\n\"Setting up a persona refers to consciously creating and displaying a specific social image or role, do you still need to create one? Aren’t you just playing yourself?\" Ding Sihan gave a sidelong glance, full of disdain.\n\"I have to remind myself to hold back every moment, doesn’t that count as consciously creating and displaying? Isn’t that setting up a persona? You really want me to show my true colors?\" Lin Li immediately retorted.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nSo a pervert is already the result of Lin Li holding back.\nIn the Ganges.\nDing Sihan found herself accepting this conclusion in just a second.\nThat’s Lin Li for you.\n\"Can’t refute that, it definitely is a persona. I’m starting to regret and feel scared, hold back a bit.\" Ding Sihan gave a thumbs-up and hugged herself.\n\"Don’t be too scared, look, there’s surveillance watching me here too.\" Changing into new slippers, Lin Li saw a surveillance camera in the corner as he walked to the first-floor living room and said with a smile.\n— Unlike hotels and inns, these types of homestays used for team-building do have surveillance in some public areas because of property issues, it’s not illegal and they do inform the renters.\n\"Uncle might be watching me from behind the camera right now.\" Lin Li said with a laugh.\n\"Zzz—\"\n\"Zzz—\"\nThe sound of a piston rod operating was heard, and the camera nodded.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nEh?\n\"...\"\nNot the uncles? I was just saying it, are you really behind the camera?\nThat was a warning just now, wasn’t it?\nTurns out it’s a camera that also records sound, so everything I said just now was heard?\n\"Damn...\"\nLin Li held his forehead, feeling a bit dizzy while taking deep breaths, like a friendly ice room was greeting him.\nNow his persona is updated again, but unfortunately, it’s more embarrassing.\nThe joke he made with Ding Sihan might not sound like a joke to Chen Zhongping.\nIt might even have reached more than just Chen Zhongping’s ears.\nLin Li smiled relievedly, shook his head self-deprecatingly, walked to the surveillance camera, took a deep breath, bowed slightly, and spoke earnestly:\n\"I’m sorry, Uncle, I was joking just now, I’m aware of it, you don’t need to worry too much, sorry, I won’t say such improper things from now on, I’ll take responsibility for these words, I apologize once again.\"\nFacing the now bowing Lin Li, Bai Bufan scratched his head, feeling a bit at a loss.\nHe could tell that Lin Li was feeling a bit down now, but does this mean they have to interact with this earnest Lin Li from now on?\nThen Bai Bufan thought it might be better to go home.\nHaving just one Lin Li like this, it feels like it’s going to play him to death.\nInitially thought the trip would surely be interesting, but now the anticipation has sharply dropped.\nUpon seeing this scene, Chen Yu Ying, with a dark expression, stepped out the door with her phone, and even through the door, one could hear a bit of her talking on the phone.\nA few minutes later, she returned to the living room, looked up at the surveillance camera: \"Lin Li, check if it’s off.\"\n\"It seems to be off.\" Lin Li said after noticing that the small red dot indicating the camera was running had disappeared.\n\"Hmph! Alright, now you two can be as perverted as you want, don’t worry about these things.\" With a light snort, Chen Yu Ying’s expression improved a bit.\nLin Li scratched his head, why does this sound so odd.\n\"Class monitor, I’m not a pervert.\" Bai Bufan raised his hand to indicate, feeling somewhat wronged.\n\"Oh, sorry.\" Chen Yu Ying immediately apologized.\n\"Class monitor, I’m not a pervert either.\" Lin Li also raised his hand to indicate, feeling quite wronged.",

Don’t treat me differently, okay?\" Feeling ignored, Lin Li tried to summon Chen Yu Ying’s conscience, \"Moshi moshi, class president, acknowledge me, please?\"\nA conscience-less Chen Yu Ying: \"Let’s go, upstairs.\"\nBut hearing Lin Li’s cheerful tone again, Chen Yu Ying smiled.\nThis is better.\n...\nFive people went upstairs.\nIn the big homestay, there was actually not a single bed.\nIt’s not like there’s no place to sleep, it’s just that there aren’t the usual single or double beds, but there’s an open sleeping space on each floor that can easily accommodate four or five people. There are also several sofa ’beds’ and lounge chair ’beds’ outside.\nThe three girls stayed on the third floor with a private bathroom, while Lin Li and Bai Bufan stayed on the second floor.\nThe girls being on the upper floors meant they could avoid many awkward situations when going up and down the stairs daily.\nActually, Lin Li wanted Bai Bufan to sleep at the door of the courtyard as a guard, but Bai Bufan refused, being quite selfish.\nThey agreed to meet on the first floor after putting their things away.\n\"Lin Li, follow me.\" As soon as Lin Li came downstairs, he saw Bai Bufan, who had come down first, calling him over.\n\"What’s up?\" Lin Li followed him.\nSo the two of them went to the bathroom on the first floor.\n\"Look.\" Bai Bufan pointed to the notice on the wall.\n\"Please do not flush anything other than toilet paper down the toilet, to avoid clogging. Thanks for your cooperation.\"\n\"How should we deal with our poop? Do we need to put it in a bag and throw it outside?\" Bai Bufan asked worriedly.\n\"Idiot, isn’t there a trash can here? Just face your butt towards it when you poop.\" Lin Li laughed, \"The toilet is for flushing paper, the trash can is clearly for poop.\"\nBai Bufan really hadn’t thought at all.\n\"I see, my thinking was really limited.\" Bai Bufan suddenly understood.\n\"What are you guys talking about? What kind of thinking?\" Ding Si Han, coming downstairs and seeing the two muttering at the bathroom door, came up to inquire with interest.\nDing Si Han joined them, looking curious.\nShe left looking disgusted.\nDamn it, two idiots.\n...\n\"So which restaurant are we going to eat at later? Is it decided?\"\nOnce all five gathered downstairs, Lin Li looked at Ding Si Han.\n\"Yes, it’s decided. There’s a nearby mountain pavilion specialty shop with pretty good reviews. Let’s go there.\" Ding Si Han nodded, \"There’s a supermarket on the way, so we can also buy food and snacks on our way back.\"\n\"Buying food, what’s the point of buying food?\" Lin Li seized on a blind spot.\n\"Didn’t you listen during the voice call?\" Chen Yu Ying asked.\n\"Of course I listened. It’s definitely because I forgot rather than secretly opening TikTok in the background and not listening to what you were saying. There’s no way, I wouldn’t do such a thing.\" Lin Li confessed.\n\"Let’s try cooking dinner ourselves tonight!\" Chen Yu Ying playfully glared at Lin Li, then explained, with a hint of expectation in her eyes, \"There’s a kitchen here, a refrigerator, do it ourselves, good food and clothing.\"\n\"But class president, I totally can’t cook.\" Bai Bufan said, looking at Lin Li, \"Lin Li can’t either.\"\n\"You useless thing, don’t lump me in with you.\" Lin Li laughed.\n\"Yu Qian’s homemade side dishes don’t bring them out.\" Bai Bufan mocked.\n\"Listen up,\" Lin Li laughed, \"I’m skilled in tasting and appreciating Sichuan, Lu, Cantonese, Fujian, Su, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Anhui cuisines, proficient in writing the Chinese characters for steaming, boiling, stir-frying, stewing, baking, sautéing and frying cooking techniques, familiar with the on/off for stoves, rice cookers, microwaves, and range hoods.\nWorld’s apart from you.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nWhat the hell.\n\"I’m useless, Lin Li is a mouthy useless.\" After thinking, Bai Bufan made his evaluation.\nLin Li didn’t retort this time.\nChen, Ding, Qu: \"...\"\nNo kidding, Lin Li’s spiel left everyone a bit dazed, almost fooled.\n\"Si Han and I actually can’t cook either, Wanqiu is the only one who can cook, that’s why I suggested it.\" Chen Yu Ying smiled and explained.\n\"I only know a little bit, the real fallback is hotpot. We’ll just buy seasoning packets, if cooking fails, we’ll switch to hotpot, toss the food into it, all good.\" Qu Wanqiu said, embarrassed, quickly offering a humble explanation.\n\"Hotpot is indeed versatile, the homestay’s emergency equipment is also complete, that’s okay, attempting to cook a meal is fine.\" Lin Li nodded.\nQu Wanqiu: \"... Emergency equipment really doesn’t need emphasizing.\"\n\"Okay then, let’s go have lunch first!\" After a brief discussion, Chen Yu Ying stood up and said.\n[The sect’s team outing officially begins, but regrettably, the first trial is not what one excels at, hard to become useful.\nGold will not be obscured by dust, if within the team one cannot stand out, how can one become eternally powerful?\nPerhaps seek opportunities, prove oneself, gain recognition.]\n[Task triggered!]\n[Task five: During this team outing, obtain sincere recognition and praise from other team members (0/4).]\n[Reward: Physical Improvement: 50% increase in insight, 100% increase in Spiritual Qi absorption speed; system currency*100.]\nHabitually lagging behind the girls with Bai Bufan, Lin Li saw such a task notification appear when putting on shoes at the entrance.\nObtain sincere recognition and praise?\nLin Li pulled Bai Bufan: \"Bufan, I’m the best son, right?\"\nDoes that count?\nTry it, anyway, they’ve always had this father-son bond.\n\"Get lost, I’m the best son.\" Bai Bufan instantly retorted.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nI even took the initiative to lower a generation, you want to fight over this too?\nBai Bufan took a couple of steps and suddenly turned back:\n\"No.\"\nLin Li, finding it hard to control his expression, looked at Bai Bufan with both concern and affection: \"Being parents, it’s really hard to see you like this, makes one shed tears. Well, in that case, I’m the best dad, right?\"\nBoth are recognition and praise, since Bai Bufan likes this kind, Lin Li didn’t mind either.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Spit spit spit!\"\n\"I take it back, I thought you said you were my dad, Lin Li, you’re indeed my best son!\" Bai Bufan hurriedly corrected.\nThough unsure why Lin Li was suddenly acting eccentrically, there was no reason not to take advantage of the opportunity.\nThe task showed no reaction.\n\"I don’t think it came from the heart, come, say it sincerely again.\" So Lin Li looked into Bai Bufan’s eyes, encouragingly.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nBai Bufan was actually a bit scared now, moving two steps sideways at the entrance, caution in his expression: \"Lin Li... What do you want?\"\n\"Just say it sincerely, that’s all, nothing more.\" Lin Li urged.\n\"I won’t say it, definitely a trap waiting for me, I won’t say it.\" Bai Bufan firmly chose to keep silent, repeatedly insisting.\nThen forget it.\nLin Li wasn’t expecting this shortcut to work; it was just a random attempt.\nThis probably isn’t sincere or even considered praise.\nAfter putting on shoes, the five of them headed to the nearby restaurant.\nLin Li occasionally introduced the roadside signboards to Chen Yu Ying and explained the difference between the white and yellow lines on the road, to help with task two.\nEvery little bit counts.\nLin Li also actively asked Chen Yu Ying if she found his knowledge impressive, though she said it was, his task still showed no movement.\nFrom the heart is the task’s real challenge.\nAs Lin Li was contemplating solutions, Bai Bufan suddenly grabbed his arm.\n\"Hmm? What’s up?\" Lin Li turned his head, puzzled.\n\"Where was the trap in the conversation just now? I analyzed it in my mind over and over. What were you planning to insult me with next? Please, tell me, I feel like ants are crawling on me.\" Bai Bufan had pondered it all the way, but no matter how he racked his brain, he couldn’t figure it out.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"I wasn’t planning to insult you.\" Lin Li honestly replied.\n\"Impossible.\" Yet Bai Bufan scoffed, first eliminating the correct answer, then urging: \"Quick, tell me, if I had repeated it again, how would you insult me?\"\n\"Bufan, I give up, you are also a Nezha fragment, Nezha has three heads and six arms, you have one head and two arms.\" Lin Li sighed.\n\"Was that the insult? The aggression’s alright, but the connection’s not great, what’s it to do with letting me call you son? Is it Li Jing...\" Bai Bufan started methodically analyzing.\nLin Li smiled, feeling relieved.\nDamn you.",

      "content": "Chapter 226: Chapter 189: Of course, I will consider my own issues\nThe mountain pavilion is still too close to Nansang. The signature dishes aren’t particularly unique in comparison, but the taste is okay, pretty good and not expensive.\n\"Boss, I’m paying in cash, it’s inconvenient to give change; can you waive the small amount?\" Bai Bufan stepped forward and said.\n\"Let me see, the total is 101, alright, I’ll waive the small amount, just give me one hundred.\" The boss looked at the receipt and saw Bai Bufan was about to pay in cash, so he nodded generously.\n\"The boss is generous!\" Bai Bufan praised.\n\"Exchanging a little money for a good reputation, it’s worth it.\"\nThe boss said with a smile, then watched Bai Bufan take out a pocket full of small change, smiling a bit less sincerely.\nAre you freakin’ kidding me with all this small change?\nAnd you’re still asking me to waive the small amount, isn’t that a bit much.\n\"If the total was 104, would you still waive the small amount?\" Lin Li asked upon hearing this.\n\"Sure, I’d waive it.\" The boss decided to be polite.\n\"Boss, grab a Coke then, add it to the bill from just now, thanks, exactly 104.\" Lin Li opened the drinks cabinet and took out a cold Coke.\nBoss: \"...\"\nDamn it.\nThese two pesky outsiders come here to beg.\n\"Speaking of which...\"\nAs the boss spoke, Lin Li put the drink back.\n\"A moment’s boldness traded for a lifetime’s introversion, the boss probably won’t waive the small amount for any customers again, you two are just...\" On the way to the nearby supermarket, Ding Sihan complained.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan high-fived, the shameless duo, unbeatable in the world.\n\"Impressive, right?\" Lin Li still didn’t forget to ask Ding Sihan.\n\"Impressive.\"\nNo need for system verification, just looking at Ding Sihan’s expression, you could tell she was reluctantly giving praise.\nThey arrived at the supermarket.\nOn the supermarket’s sign at the entrance it read—[Supermarket—Your Best Friend]\nThe girls went straight into the supermarket without a hitch, while Lin Li and Bai Bufan looked at each other.\n\"Now?\"\n\"Not suitable, right?\"\n\"Another day then.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nAfter making an unusual agreement, the two caught up with the three in front.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan each pushed a small shopping cart.\nFor some reason, one of the wheels on the supermarket cart always feels awkward to use, rolling along it lags behind the other three wheels.\n\"Why are there dumbbells in the snack section?\" While buying snacks, seeing a pair of dumbbells on the shelf, Ding Sihan said in surprise.\n\"That means someone made an important decision here. They put down the suffering and picked up happiness.\" Lin Li commented, somewhat missing Bao Wei, wondering if he was dead or not.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nIndeed.\nThere were many things to purchase, luckily before there was only one mule, but now there are two, carrying things back wouldn’t be too difficult.\n\"Hello, do you have a membership?\" At checkout, the cashier instinctively asked.\n\"No.\" Lin Li naturally wouldn’t have a membership for this local supermarket.\n\"So, would you like to get one, recharge and get...\" The cashier immediately tried to sell the membership.\n\"No need, thank you.\"\nMembership systems aren’t really a good thing.\nDamn it, two girls one cup and membership systems, the people pushing these onto others really deserve a beating.\n...\nAlthough preparing dinner right after lunch seems a bit too early, for a group of beginners, it’s just right.\nConsidering this is a good opportunity to earn heartfelt praise from everyone, Lin Li was extremely focused.\nHowever, Lin Li didn’t plan to cook dishes. For someone with no experience, even with a guide, wanting to make a satisfactory dish on the first try is quite difficult.\nHe set his sights on sweets, which are more likely to bring satisfaction and happiness.\nPlus, they’re relatively simpler to make.\n\"You guys cook, I’ll make a rock candy fruit as everyone’s dessert.\" When it came time to assign tasks, Lin Li said.\n\"Didn’t we buy a lot of candies and cakes with the snacks? Here, Lin Li, do you want a lollipop, if you do I’ll get one for you.\" Already with the apron tied, fully armed but only for washing vegetables, Ding Sihan, with a lollipop stick in her mouth, mumbled.\n\"How can a lollipop compare to my rock candy fruit? Besides, Ding Sihan, don’t you find lollipops weird? Eating a lollipop is like flavoring your own saliva before drinking it.\" Lin Li retorted.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nSwallowing a mouthful of sweet saliva, Ding Sihan remained silent.\nShe seemed to want to say something, then stopped, hesitated to speak, then stopped again.\n\"Lin Li! Today was supposed to be a beautiful day! Because of what you said, my day is ruined! What do you mean by drinking flavored saliva!\" Ding Sihan said through gritted teeth.\nShe seemed truly agitated since she was now chewing the lollipop rather than letting it slowly dissolve.\nLin Li responded with a funny face.\nWith the tasks assigned, Bai Bufan was responsible for deveining the shrimp. The kitchen quickly became busy, though Qu Wanqiu was clearly the backbone.\nLin Li went next to Ding Sihan, who was washing vegetables, and began to clean his own fruits and skewers.\nAfter a while, Lin Li stared at Ding Sihan.\n\"What’s up? Why are you staring at me?\" Ding Sihan was suddenly on high alert.\n\"Ding Sihan, do you know what uncomfortable means,\" Lin Li said with an evil smile, walked up, and grabbed Ding Sihan’s hair, using it to wipe her face, and then said word by word:\n\"When you’re wearing wet and dirty gloves, and your nose itches.\"\nAfter her hair was used to scratch her face, Ding Sihan’s nose itched: \"...\"\nBastard.\n\"Lin Li, do you know what uncomfortable means?\" Ding Sihan, who tried to itch her nose with her arm but couldn’t stop the itch, finally took a deep breath and smiled, staring at Lin Li.\n\"Go ahead.\" Lin Li was very curious.\n\"Watching yourself get minced.\" Ding Sihan took off her gloves, rubbed her nose comfortably, and reached for a kitchen knife.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Sorry, Xiaodingding, I sincerely apologize to you.\" Lin Li quickly slid to his knees, then added, \"And by the way, play safely with knives, as Uncle always says, safety first.\"\n\"You better mean it when you say safety is important.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Take your syrup and fruits and get out of the kitchen!\" Ding Sihan ordered.\n\"Alrighty.\"\n...\nHalf an hour later.\n\"Why do I smell something odd?\" Chen Yu Ying wrinkled her nose and asked, puzzled.\n\"It really seems like it.\" Qu Wanqiu nodded.\nEveryone turned to find Lin Li back at some point, looking serious.\n\"What’s up?\" Chen Yu Ying asked with concern.\nLin Li slowly took out a black ball from behind his back.\nThe source of the smell was that.\n\"What is that?\"\n\"Candied tangerine.\" Lin Li explained.\nThe kitchen fell silent for a moment, then everyone put down their tasks and gathered around.\n\"You call this lump of coal a candied tangerine?\" Ding Sihan couldn’t believe it.\n\"Show some respect, it’s not coal, it really is candied tangerine.\" Lin Li, seeing no one believed him, pressed a fruit knife against it, revealing the black surface beneath was still black.\nDarn.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Sorry, it might not be tangerine.\"\nLin Li couldn’t even convince himself.\nScratching his head awkwardly, Lin Li looked at the most experienced in the kitchen, Qu Wanqiu: \"Little Qiuqiu, take a look, my candied fruit turned out like this—is it the syrup’s problem, the tangerine’s problem, or the pot’s problem?\"\nAfraid Qu Wanqiu couldn’t analyze it well, Lin Li also brought over the non-stick pan covered in black.\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\n\"You’re not going to mention anything about yourself?\" Qu Wanqiu bit her lip, the sound of her voice trembling with laughter.\n\"Oh oh, Little Qiuqiu, is it my syrup’s problem, my tangerine’s problem, or my pot’s problem?\" Lin Li then asked again.\n\"That’s not how you should address yourself!! I’m saying it’s a personal problem!\" Qu Wanqiu scolded with a laugh.\n\"That can’t be, absolutely not.\" Lin Li firmly denied.\nHow could a Cultivator not handle such a minor thing?\nIt must be the things’ problem.\nFinding the candied tangerine not hot, Qu Wanqiu just picked it up regardless of cleanliness, squeezing it and hearing a crunchy sound.\nDing Sihan, seeing this, was the first to laugh.\n\"Hahahahaha—\" And laughter is infectious, Qu Wanqiu couldn’t hold back either, squatting on the ground laughing.\nShe didn’t forget to squeeze the candied tangerine.\nCrunch crunch.\nSqueezable toy.\n\"Stop laughing, Qu Wanqiu, it’s one thing for them to laugh, but you—I’m discussing how to save it with you.\" Lin Li was very serious.\n\"Lin Li haha, how on earth did you do it? To make candied fruit look like this haha—\" But Lin Li’s seriousness only made Qu Wanqiu laugh harder, \"You, you—\"\n\"Though making perfect candied fruit is hard, making it like this is even harder, right?\"\n\"Lin Li, I must say, you, you, hahaha—you’re really something, I truly admire you.\"\n[During this small team training, received heartfelt recognition and praise from other team members (1/4)]\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSuch things don’t require medicine.",

      "content": "Chapter 227: Chapter 190: Sadness Flows Upstream\nActually, making it like this is part of Lin Li’s plan, everything that’s happening is what Lin Li had calculated.\nYeah.\nDamn it, bullshit, even Lin Li can’t believe this himself.\nAren’t we bros?\nMind taking back that message?\nLooking at the system’s notification, Lin Li had mixed feelings—kinda happy, but also thinking happiness is unlikely.\nThis system task shouldn’t be completed in such a way...\n\"Sigh, Little Qiuqiu, I can see you seem to genuinely recognize me,\" Lin Li said coolly, looking down at Qu Wanqiu who was laughing while sprawled on the table.\nHis voice was flat, showing a semblance of hopelessness.\n\"Of course, I truly admire you, Lin Li, haha. You might not understand if you’ve never been in a kitchen, but to manage to make fruit look like this takes quite some skill, haha—is this carbonized? Hahaha—\"\nQu Wanqiu didn’t stop laughing.\nAfter giving Lin Li a thumbs-up, she turned to explain to Ding Sihan and the others.\nLin Li sighed, figuring if the face has already lost, it’s best to use it to its fullest. So he took back his carbonized orange, squeezed it in front of the other three, and said proudly, \"How about it? Impressive, right?\"\n\"Impressive.\" The other three were also laughing.\nBut this task seemed to be against him. When he wanted to grow flowers, they refused to bloom; when he took initiative, the task showed no response.\nMaybe if he pees on these flowers another day, they’d behave.\nThe grudge today, Lin Li must have held it yesterday.\nBut since the praise failed, he had used his lost face to its fullest, it was time to pick it up. There was no such thing as giving up in Lin Li’s Oxford Dictionary—\n\"Heh, you’ll regret laughing at me now.\" So when faced with ridicule, he simply glared back defiantly, \"I will definitely make a perfect candied fruit!\"\nQu Wanqiu reached out worriedly, seeming like she wanted to stop him but then relaxed a bit and said with relief, \"The B&B’s emergency facilities are well-equipped, so go ahead.\"\nBu Hao! That’s a boomerang!\nThat’s what he just attacked her with!\nDamn Little Qiuqiu.\n\"How about you devein the shrimp, and I’ll make the candied fruit?\" Bai Bufan, who was shelling and deveining the bought shrimp, said seriously, \"I think I can do better than you.\"\nLin Li walked over, plucked a hair, and silently used it to scratch Bai Bufan’s face.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"You shrimp-head guy, indeed very suited to handle shrimp heads.\" Bai Bufan wasn’t Ding Sihan, so Lin Li’s intent needed no explanation as he rubbed his nose with his shoulder while commenting.\n\"Precisely because I’m a shrimp-head guy, I can’t harm my kind. Good luck, poop-playing kid,\" Lin Li said lightly.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"What the hell is a poop-playing kid?\"\nLin Li snickered to himself and walked away.\nWait, Bai Bufan looked down; his deveining actions did seem like playing with poop.\n\"You son of a—!\"\n...\n\"Never thought that not only can’t you use Baidu for medical questions, but you also can’t use it for recipes?\"\nLin Li’s creation required no kitchen equipment, indeed didn’t need to be in a kitchen; a power source would suffice, as he whispered outside.\nSlight physical discomfort + Baidu = Prepared for cremation.\nLin Li + Baidu = Candied carbon.\nSo darn dangerous, this Baidu.\n\"Seems like it’s better to stick with basic operations honestly, no more trying fancy stuff.\" Lin Li sighed, putting down the supposedly best strategy to make delicious candied fruit, and started following the most basic guide step by step.\nBefore learning to walk, better not run.\nStirring the syrup with a spatula, Lin Li awaited it to reach the right state.\nThe system buzzed to life.\n[Venturing abroad to study, improving mecha piloting skills on the arduous path, leaving homeland, the three accompanying girls’ sorrow finally explodes, starting to cry silently.\nYou are at a loss, but as the world’s only male, perhaps the only way to help them temporarily forget their worries and regain joy is through your robust physique!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Six: Use physical contact and union to let the girls experience joy.]\n[Task Reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha Synchronization Index +10; Random Talent; System Currency * 50]\nLin Li: \"?\"\nNot until the syrup bubbled did Lin Li snap back to reality.\nAren’t we bros?\nWhy is there another one?\nThis task also involves that familiar progress bar.\nBut the main point isn’t that; it’s why are they crying?\nA bit concerned, Lin Li immediately unplugged and returned to the kitchen.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan’s eyes were red. Though their eyes were shimmering with tears, they resolutely refused to let them fall. Their trembling eyelashes seemed ready to sweep away their sorrows.\nAlthough they were facing the doorway, they turned their heads slightly.\nIt seemed they didn’t want Lin Li to see them crying.\nLin Li ought to ask what was wrong.\nBut he damn well saw the onions the two were cutting.\nTurning their heads wasn’t about avoiding Lin Li seeing them, but about trying to avoid contact with the onion vapors.\n\"What’s up? Did you finish the coal again?\" Chen Yu Ying asked curiously, wiping her tears with her arm upon seeing Lin Li return.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSystem, why don’t you open your damn eyes and take a look?\nWhere did this sudden sadness come from? Onion sadness?\nBut Lin Li had to admit one thing; at this moment, he did feel a bit of that sadness.\nWhat bullshit task is this, bringing joy through physical contact and integration?\nThe rewards are so stingy, and it’s just a talent reward. If there were an option to abandon the task, Lin Li would likely give it up.\n\"It’s fine. I came back to see if I could find an opportunity to make you happy with my body.\" Lin Li replied coolly to Chen Yu Ying’s inquiry.\nChen Yu Ying, Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nBut since it’s Lin Li, saying something perverted like this isn’t that unusual.\nIt’s unrealistic for the system to expect him to use that, that. But if it’s just about physical contact and integration, can tickling complete this task?\nLin Li approached the three girls, taking a glance.\nNo one had exposed their waist, and if he tickled them through clothes, the system definitely wouldn’t count it as physical contact.\nLooking down, Chen Yu Ying and Qu Wanqiu were wearing small sandals, so their feet were bare.\nDing Sihan was wearing pristine white socks. Lin Li suspected she might be gay, liking boys.\n\"Aren’t you going to make your candied fruit?\" Chen Yu Ying asked, squeezing her eyes shut tightly to regain clarity in her blurred vision, when Lin Li approached.\n\"I can’t stand seeing girls cry. Class President and Ding Sihan, leave cutting the onions to me.\" Having found a convenient excuse, Lin Li simply said.\nAt the moment neither Chen Yu Ying nor Qu Wanqiu was barefoot, making them lift their feet for him to tickle wasn’t realistic; he’d have to find an opportunity later on.\nBetter not let crying trigger any other tasks.\n\"Okay, I’ve cried enough, too.\" Ding Sihan cautiously set the small knife on the table and handed over the onion without hesitation.\n\"Alright, just be careful.\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit more polite.\n...\n\"Bufan, do you think looking up at a 45-degree angle can stop tears?\" Lin Li, with reddened eyes, mournfully said, \"Life is so fleeting.\"\n\"I, ha, don’t, ha, know.\"\nMaybe it was empathy, or maybe it was Lin Li who perversely moved the cutting board and onions over to Bai Bufan, almost using his face as the cutting board. Whatever it was, Bai Bufan cried even harder than Lin Li, sniffling through his words.\n\"Can you hum, move somewhere else to cut onions, Lin Li?\" Finally, Bai Bufan, who’d cried enough, couldn’t take it anymore.\nIn choosing his onion-cutting method, Lin Li picked the one with the most barrage comments between the simplest and most laborious options.\n\"No way, if everyone cries and you don’t, you’ll look out of place.\" Lin Li feared the onion juice wouldn’t reach Bai Bufan’s face, slicing the onions with such intensity that the pinging and slicing echoed like bursts of water, making Bai Bufan’s head buzz.\n\"My nose is itchy, my eyes itch, but my gloves are full of crap. Do you know what I’m thinking now?\" Bai Bufan was itching all over, gritting his teeth.\n\"You’re obviously thinking about us four leaving the kitchen so you can wolf down these shrimp shells like noodles, slurp them down, and then happily pat your stomach saying, ’Wow, this crap tastes great.’\" Lin Li rapidly replied.\nA long and complex sentence, but not a confession, an accusation.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You son of a—\"\nTheir words were colorful.\nAnd so, in the kitchen, Bai Bufan cursed while crying, and Lin Li cried while being cursed.\nThe moving dialogue between the two made the eyes of the other three girls in the kitchen redden—Lin Li was slicing with such vigor that the effect spread everywhere, even Qu Wanqiu couldn’t escape it.\nBut the corners of the three girls’ mouths remained uplifted.\nBringing Bai Bufan along was indeed the right decision.\nThe two could truly achieve a miraculous effect of one plus one being more than zero.\nScattered farts all over the place, gathered into one pile of dung.",

      "content": "Chapter 228: Chapter 191 Let’s Toast to Ourselves\nQu Wanqiu’s cooking skills are actually pretty good. With four newbies, she really managed to serve bowl after bowl of steaming hot dishes right at mealtime. They even looked presentable, and she even plated them.\nActually, among the apprentices, Ding Sihan is the most impressive. With a zero base, under Qu Wanqiu’s guidance, she managed to make four dishes and two soups all by herself.\nThey are scrambled eggs with tomatoes, scrambled tomatoes with eggs, tomato and egg stir-fried, egg and tomato stir-fried, tomato egg soup, and egg tomato soup.\n\"Lin Li, the drinks have arrived, go grab them, and you’ll get more snacks later.\" After the five sat down at the tatami-style ’table,’ Ding Sihan’s phone rang, and she bossed Lin Li around.\n\"Bufan, the drinks have arrived, go grab them, and you’ll get half more snacks later.\" Lin Li turned to Bai Bufan and said.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nOutsourcing, huh? Even acting as a broker right in front of me?\nBut Lin Li did it just reflexively; as she said this, she was already getting up and heading outside.\nLin Li brought the drinks back and distributed them to five people.\n\"This milk tea’s milk and tea flavors are so weak. Indeed, ordering milk tea from a shop you’ve never heard of is just a gamble.\" Ding Sihan remarked with furrowed brows after taking a sip with a straw.\nThe other two relatively professional girls nodded along.\n\"Maybe the shopkeeper likes cleanliness more,\" Lin Li said upon hearing.\n\"Huh? Why would loving cleanliness make the taste weak?\" Ding Sihan was puzzled.\n\"Before selling the milk tea, they washed it with water to ensure it’s not dirty when we get it,\" Lin Li explained.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"If it’s watered down, just say it’s watered down!!\"\n\"Can we start eating?\" Bai Bufan said as he reached out, only to have Lin Li’s chopstick tail tap his hand.\n\"Do you think you deserve to eat first?\" Lin Li sneered, then pointed forward before Bai Bufan could fight back: \"People don’t eat first; phones eat first.\"\nBai Bufan watched the three girls about to capture the fruits of their labor and settled down.\nWait, why did Lin Li say ’people don’t,’ why add an extra ’don’t’?\nDamn it.\n\"Alright, you can eat now.\" After phones were full, the girls finally issued the order.\n\"Let’s toast first.\" Lin Li raised the fruit tea in his glass.\n\"Cheers!\" The other four immediately understood and lifted their glasses to clink together.\nSometimes, effort is just for this moment of toasting.\n\"Today, we gather here to celebrate Lin Li’s seventeenth year and 340th day anniversary. On this special and important day, I’m deeply honored to deliver some speech...\" After the toast, leader Lin Li relievedly said.\nUnfortunately, no one paid him any attention.\nBai Bufan even started eating directly, deliberately knocking the bowl’s edge with his chopsticks while scooping rice.\n\"Ahem, let’s not celebrate this one, skip me; let’s thank the Ancient Greek god of wealth— Chen Yu Ying!\" Lin Li had to change the topic.\n\"Oh, oh!\"\nExcept for Chen Yu Ying, the three immediately chimed in and raised their drinks, clinking them together.\n\"Let’s also thank the Ancient Greek ruler of culinary arts— Qu Wanqiu!\" Lin Li spoke again.\nClear glass clinks came together.\n\"Why not call her the god of cooking?\" Ding Sihan subconsciously asked next.\nLin Li stared at Ding Sihan without speaking.\n\"Sorry.\" Ding Sihan realized and sincerely apologized.\n\"Alright, next, let’s thank the Ancient Greek god of... tomatoes and eggs— Ding Sihan!\" Under Ding Sihan’s threatening gaze, Lin Li could only change his statement.\nEveryone toasted again, and Ding Sihan reluctantly accepted it.\nBai Bufan eagerly rubbed his hands together.\nIt’s my turn, it’s my turn.\n\"Lastly, thanks to Bai Bufan who’s worked hard playing all afternoon... Alright, let’s eat.\" Lin Li said disinterestedly, then pouted: \"Tsk—\"\nStarted scooping rice, chopsticks knocking clank clank.\n\"Damn! How come it became like this for me? The format’s all wrong! Isn’t it supposed to be a god? Toast! Why aren’t we toasting! What do you mean by directly starting to eat, Lin Li! Show me some respect!\"\nBai Bufan punched Lin Li a few times angrily and roared.\nIsn’t this also a kind of boomerang?\nThe three girls across, who planned to complain about starting to eat, were completely amused by the two’s banter.\nOfficially starting to eat, Qu Wanqiu’s main dish flavors weren’t bad, and what Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan led wasn’t hard to swallow either.\n\"Let’s try this once; otherwise, with this efficiency of preparing dinner taking an entire afternoon, we’ll spend the whole National Day cooking.\"\nAfter acknowledging the taste, Chen Yu Ying sought everyone’s opinion.\nNaturally, no one objected.\nIt was just for novelty, and for Qu Wanqiu, it didn’t even count as new.\nAt this point, Lin Li slightly bent down.\nThe five wasn’t eating on chairs, but sat on a ground covered with mats, with Lin Li’s target under the table being the feet.\nDing Sihan wore socks, Qu Wanqiu sat cross-legged, only Chen Yu Ying straightened her legs still under the table.\nFair and slender, her toes round and healthy, without any nail polish, the nails were a faint pink, her skin delicate and white, you could see the blue veins within.\nPerhaps due to the owner’s joy, they slightly swayed left and right during the meal, revealing youthful vitality.\nBai Bufan was actually right; her tender feet had no calluses.",

Chen Yu Ying leaned back and lay on the mat, struggling and helplessly said.\nThe progress bar moved; although it didn’t rise quickly, it did move. Seeing this, Lin Li didn’t know how to evaluate the system’s grooves.\n——Grooves don’t count as evaluations; they’re fixed expressions.\n\"Class leader, these days those who are barefoot aren’t afraid of the shod, but are afraid of ones like Bai Bufan who have a mouth and ones like me who have hands.\" Lin Li continued with his right hand without stopping, explaining as he went.\n\"No way, what do you mean by ’ones like Bai Bufan who have a mouth’? You’re insulting me like this, you’d better wait for a lawyer’s warning!\" Bai Bufan, who didn’t expect to be involved in this, retorted, eyes wide.\n\"You foot fetishists are really dishonest.\" Lin Li shook his head disdainfully.\n\"Don’t speak so loudly about preferences!\nAlso, I only like 2D feet. In reality, I only like those that Sister Yu has after finishing a day’s farm work, sitting on the kang and taking off the black sweaty socks, revealing size 45 stinky sweaty feet. You know, family, women, as they get older, have more charm, just like fine aged wine, that captivating fragrance.\" Bai Bufan whispered in Lin Li’s ear.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDamn you.\nEven Bai Bufan knew these words were inappropriate for girls, so he only whispered to disgust himself.\n\"You’d be niche on a small website.\" Lin Li also commented back.\n\"Lin Li, stop tickling.\" Chen Yu Ying gasped, chiding.\nLin Li ceased his actions, letting go.\nIf tickled for too long, it becomes a punishment. The task is best completed with three people simultaneously, in small amounts, and multiple times.\nFinally pulling back her leg, Chen Yu Ying took several deep breaths, sat up, rubbed the tears from laughing at the corner of her eyes, and then tilted her head, glaring straight and fiercely at Lin Li.\nNot happy!\nLin Li and Bai Bufan knocked their heads three times in apology.\n——Of course, this had nothing to do with Bai Bufan; he was purely forced by the hand at the back of his head to knock.\n\"Class leader, sorry, couldn’t help myself, animal instincts kicked in.\" Lin Li’s face was full of remorse and guilt, his voice even carried a sob.\n\"Bad pervert...\" She muttered softly, seemingly aware that her glaring wasn’t really intimidating, Chen Yu Ying snorted and said, \"Go wash your hands and eat properly.\"\nHer legs resolutely crossed.\nThe scene seemed a bit silent.\n\"Do we really have to wash hands before eating?\" Lin Li’s murmur suddenly seemed distinct.\nThe room burst into laughter, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu started urging Lin Li to eat with his hands, while Chen Yu Ying, blushing, crumpled a milk tea straw wrapper and threw it at Lin Li.\nAfter washing his hands and returning, the first thing Lin Li did was look under the table.\nAll crossed.\nSo Lin Li’s undisguised disappointment was discovered and mocked again.\n\"My feet aren’t ticklish, Lin Li, why don’t you try?\" Only Bai Bufan wasn’t dismissive of Lin Li.\n\"I’m eating, don’t talk about disgusting topics.\" Lin Li looked disdainful.\n\"Can you be any more blatant in your favoritism?\"\n...\nThe food on the table was mostly finished — due to concerns about wasting if it tasted bad and having lots of snacks as backup, the portions were small, planned to barely fill everyone.\n\"Alright, the main course is over, now it’s the dessert everyone has been waiting for, right?\" Lin Li stood up, full of anticipation.\nOf course, he was the only one who looked forward to it.\nLin Li briefly left and then brought back a porcelain bowl filled with fruits coated in syrup.\nLin Li placed it on the table, everyone glanced at it, and the syrup had the dark brown hue beloved by Michelin three-star chefs.\nThough not charcoal, it didn’t stop everyone from showing a cautious expression.\n\"It’s really edible, there’s no problem, Qu Wanqiu, at tonight’s dinner I ate the most, I returned kindness for yours — you at least have to show some face?\" Lin Li attempted to prove himself, first looking at Qu Wanqiu.\n\"Lin Li, you eating my dinner is enough, and now you want my life? Do all good things go to you? No way!\" Having learned her lesson from the charcoal, Qu Wanqiu firmly refused.\nCharcoal can be played with, but not eaten.\nLin Li sighed, his right hand pressed on Bai Bufan, who was slowly trying to sneak out.\n\"Bufan.\"\nBai Bufan sighed, picked up a candied strawberry, bit off a piece with his molars, and began chewing.\nBefore swallowing, he convulsed and fell to the floor, extending a trembling finger at Lin Li: \"Help... call... ambulance...\"\nThen his neck crooked, eyes rolled back, and he died.\n\"Ambulance! Ambulance! Ambulance!\" Lin Li immediately shouted loudly.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nIs that how you call it?\nRevived by anger, Bai Bufan again raised a trembling hand at Lin Li, \"Quick, call 120...\"\n\"Got it! Right! Bufan! What’s the number for 120?\" Lin Li pulled out his phone and asked.\nThe dead Bai Bufan gave the middle finger.\nFinally, Ding Sihan showed kindness.\nTruth be told, her tomato scrambled eggs were a bit too salty, and she admitted it herself.\nBut just now Lin Li managed to complain while eating all the tomato scrambled eggs.\nThe dish led by Chen Yu Ying was the same, except Lin Li complained two sentences less than hers.\nThough after eating, the jerk pretended to gag and repeatedly expressed disdain, Ding Sihan was still quite moved.\nSo with a resolve to face certain death, Ding Sihan reached out and took one.\n\"It’s not really bad,\" under Lin Li’s expectant gaze, after taking a bite, chewing, swallowing, Ding Sihan shook her head and commented.\nLin Li was already satisfied, cheering as if he’d won the bid for the Olympics.\n\"Winwinwin!\"\n\"But it’s not good either, probably somewhere between good and awful, it’s really hard to eat.\" Ding Sihan finished her sentence.\nUnlike Lin Li and Bai Bufan, who when eating something bad immediately thought to share, Ding Sihan didn’t plan to lie.\nThe cheering abruptly stopped.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nIt turns out it’s really hard to eat?\nLin Li picked one up and put it in his mouth; the syrup indeed wasn’t cooked well.\nMmm.\nSlightly bitter.\nA whole lot of slightly.",

Lin Li got a famous blade, Si Ming!\nAlthough in Tokyo University, the best compliment for a good dessert is that it’s not sweet, but it shouldn’t be bitter either.\nLin Li kind of misses Bao Wei.\nWithout Bao Wei, he could only throw it in the trash can.\nFortunately, he didn’t make much.\nHe stepped on the trash can pedal, the lid opened, and Lin Li threw the garbage inside.\nAfter a brief silence by the trash can, Lin Li jogged back to the table, saying to Bai Bufan, \"Bufan, put your foot out.\"\n\"I’m really not afraid of tickling.\" Bai Bufan bravely extended his foot.\nLin Li stretched out a leg and stepped on it.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"What are you doing? Rewarding me?\"\nChen, Ding, Qu: \"?\"\nLin Li started to use force.\n\"Holy crap! What are you doing?!\" Bai Bufan, feeling some pain, retracted his foot and demanded an answer.\n\"The more I think about it, the scarier it is. I’ve discovered that if you step hard on a human’s foot, they’ll open their mouth, and how wide depends on how hard you step. I might have found a secret: humans possibly evolved from trash cans.\"\nLin Li covered his mouth, his voice both horrified and frantic.\nThe three girls seemed to be pondering.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYou damn...\n\"Lin Li, that time when you had a fever during the heavy rain as a kid, when your mom took you to the hospital, did she go to the wrong place? Did she end up at the pet hospital?\" Bai Bufan sincerely asked.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSuch aggression, to think this incident left a notable mark in Lin Li’s elementary school essay history.\nHe actually wanted to use it again in high school, but it wouldn’t score well.\n\"You’ve hurt my insecure, sensitive, and fragile self.\" Lin Li said with his head down, \"Thankfully, I have toenail fungus.\"\n\"What’s the advantage of toenail fungus... Huh? Damn you!!\" Bai Bufan looked at the feet rubbing against each other and shouted before huddling toward the bathroom, clutching his foot.\n\"Just kidding, my feet are fair and tender with no disease. I even trimmed my nails specially yesterday.\" Lin Li explained to the girls after Bai Bufan rolled away with relief.\n\"Who calls their own feet ’fair feet’?\" Ding Sihan found it inexplicably amusing.\nLin Li was about to respond when he saw the system notification.\n[Task three complete]\n[Do you want to use \"Random Reward Double Card (3/3)\"?]\n[You have chosen to use it.]\n[You have received the reward: Physical Improvement: Insight increase by 20%; Divine Sense enhancement by 200%; Random Artifact*1.]\nA refreshing sensation deep inside, like skating on clouds.\nThe reward doubled for Divine Sense, from 100% to 200%.\nNot too bad a doubling; using the \"Duck Blood Bottle\" from the [Warehouse] definitely won’t be so strenuous now, emotions won’t deplete before finishing oneself.\n\"The monthly exam rankings are out, by the way.\" Qu Wanqiu, looking at her phone, said, \"Xue Jian posted them in the class group.\"\n\"Ding Sihan, don’t look at your phone just yet. Want to make a bet with me?\" Lin Li looked at Ding Sihan, who was reaching for her phone, stopping and enticing her.\n\"Huh? Bet on what?\" Ding Sihan asked, a bit puzzled.\n\"Bet whether I made it into the top hundred of the grade! The stake is...\" Lin Li was ready to make this sure-win bet.\n\"No bet.\" But before Lin Li could finish, Ding Sihan declined uninterestedly, \"Every subject teacher praised you for your great improvement. You definitely made it.\"\nDarn it, dumb Ding Sihan got smarter.\nLin Li sat cross-legged and took out his phone too.\nPerhaps to protect students’ self-esteem, the list Xue Jian posted only had rankings without specific subject scores. Lin Li not only made it into the top hundred—he wasn’t even on the edge—with a total score of 1052 across ten subjects, ranking fourth in the class and 51st in the grade.\nAlmost made it into the top fifty.\nThankfully, it’s only freshman year; the difficulty for a comeback is indeed not high.\nChen Yu Ying ranked sixth in the grade, and ahead of her were those little geniuses from the first, second, and third competition classes.\nLin Li advanced nearly 400 places—a breakthrough star surely, and he wasn’t the only one in class four who made it on that list. This time, Bai Bufan, ranked 272 in the grade and also advanced over 150 places, was included as well.\nLin Li checked the artifact.\n[You have acquired the artifact \"Substitute Jade-faced Buddha\"]\n[Substitute Jade-faced Buddha: After refining, automatically triggers upon the owner’s death-inducing injury, swallowing the damage and protecting the owner for 3-60 seconds, and returns the previously input Qi Blood and spirit to the owner.\nOnce triggered, it is completely destroyed and disappears.]\nLin Li widened his eyes.\nWhoa, a Blade of Divine Fate!\nIn his life, Han Xin had two benefactors, one named Xiao He, the other Meng Lei.\nThe value of this artifact is almost absurdly high.\nIf in the Cultivation Realm, Lin Li’s \"Duck Blood Bottle\" in his hand was exposed, cultivators might scoff at it, even see it as a toy—after all, there are many things to resist such artifacts, many cultivators are not affected at all.\nBut this \"Substitute Jade-faced Buddha\" is definitely considered a BUG-level artifact, surely capable of inciting chaos.\nLin Li really needs such a backup artifact now.\nThough it’s rarely needed in modern times, the problem is that Lin Li has a beautiful lady waiting for him to take her hand.\nThe artifact can provide at least ’three seconds’ of protection at ’death’, which is enough time for Lin Li to click ’return’.\nIt’s like getting an extra life.\nUpon seeing this artifact, he instantly felt that the hard study in September was worthwhile.\nLin Li was in a great mood, even humming a familiar tune, though he himself didn’t know exactly what it was.\n\"Lin Li: How invincible—how lonely—@Wang Yuezhi\"\nLin Li hadn’t forgotten his agreement with Wang Yuezhi.",

Lin Li put himself in Wang Yuezhi’s shoes and was willing to understand the cold shoulder.\n\"You’re such a bad guy.\" Ding Sihan, knowing the inside story, pointed at Lin Li.\n\"Bai Bufan: How invincible—how lonely—@Zhou Baowei\"\nBai Bufan was already back sitting next to him, and he wasn’t a good character either.\n\"Zhou Baowei: ?\"\nIf it weren’t the class group chat with a teacher, Bao Wei might have replied with a few rude words.\n\"Lin Li, I also lost the bet.\" Chen Yu Ying hadn’t forgotten the lunchtime playful agreement she made with Lin Li, with the stake being a reasonable request the other would accept.\n\"I want to tickle your feet, class president.\" Lin Li answered without a hint of hesitation.\nHeartfelt intention.\nNo choice, the current task seemed to be either a massage or tickling.\nLin Li didn’t know how to massage, and it didn’t count as contact through clothes, so it was unlikely, at most a backup plan.\nThe first choice was tickling.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"Ah?\" Chen Yu Ying tilted her phone left, but her head tilted right, looking at Lin Li, filled with confusion.\nLin Li met Chen Yu Ying’s gaze with sincere eyes and confirmed again: \"Class president, please let me fully tickle your feet!\"\nXiaoding and Xiaoqu were also slightly puzzled.\nDid Lin Li have such a fetish?\nWhy wasn’t it noticeable before?\n\"Why?\" Chen Yu Ying asked.\n\"Because class president, I want to see you laugh. When you laugh, my world brightens up.\" Lin Li suddenly spoke sincerely, his voice emotional, \"Your smile is the sun.\"\nLoyalty! Earnestness!\nLin Li came from Dandong, craving light-axis dishes.\n\"Oh oh—\" Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu cheered immediately.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nShe was supposed to be shy.\nBut now she really couldn’t be.\nWhy could Lin Li, that naughty weirdo, transform affectionate words into cheeky banter? Cheeky banter is cheeky banter!\nWho taught you that the way to make a girl laugh is to tickle her feet! You deserve a beating!\n\"No way, too much, I don’t want to laugh, let your world stay dark.\" Chen Yu Ying hugged her knees and curled up, her head shaking like a rattle, weak, pitiful, and helpless.\n\"Is it too much?\" Lin Li looked at Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu.\nA father knows his daughters well, and the devoted two daughters firmly shook their heads: \"Not too much! Support! We also want to see Ying Bao laugh!\"\nSo Lin Li turned back to Chen Yu Ying, his gaze not honest but indeed very enthusiastic.\n\"Not fully, who knows when you’d stop, you naughty weirdo.\" Chen Yu Ying still refused but had already given in.\n\"This can be discussed! We can negotiate the tickling time.\" Lin Li said immediately, \"How about ten minutes?\"\n\"No, at most five minutes.\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head.\n\"Deal!\" Lin Li answered immediately.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nBoo hoo! She spoke too hastily!\n\"Three minutes!\" She quickly said.\nLin Li turned his head and whistled, pretending not to hear.\n\"Class president, extend your leg!\" Lin Li rubbed his ten fingers, grinning wickedly.\nChen Yu Ying’s lips pressed tightly against her teeth shining brightly, she hummed, then sighed, and slowly moved one leg towards Lin Li.\n\"Lin Li, let me find a feather for you!\" Ding Sihan got up excitedly.\n\"No need, if I don’t use my hands but a feather, wouldn’t I waste this opportunity?\" Lin Li waved his hand, honestly speaking.\n\"Oh oh, accidentally forgot you’re an all-out weirdo, sorry.\" Ding Sihan nodded and sat back down.\n\"Class president, it’s going to start.\"\nLin Li’s hand again clasped Chen Yu Ying’s ankle, smiling evilly.\nPerhaps the last time was too sudden, so there was no immediate reaction to the ankle being grabbed, but this time she voluntarily extended her leg. Besides, the ankle is quite a private part, and Chen Yu Ying felt a burning sensation at the spot being touched.\nFeeling a bit regretful.\n\"Hmm.\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice seemed a bit clingy and she didn’t look at Lin Li.\n\"Here we go~\"\nLin Li started tickling Chen Yu Ying’s sole.\nSince she was mentally prepared, Chen Yu Ying initially managed to cover her mouth, preventing sounds from escaping, but those who are ticklish know that’s almost impossible. Soon she \"hahed\" out loud.\nTime gradually passed.\n\"Lin Li, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it~\"\n\"Class president, not even a minute has passed, can’t stand it but will stand it!\"\n\"No, too ticklish, be gentle~\"\n\"Being gentle makes it more ticklish, like now?\"\n\"Haha~ then focus more on it...\"\n\"...\"\nOn the side, Bai Bufan, having a heated online argument with Zhou Baowei, listened to this kind of sounds, lifted his head in shock:\n\"This is damn obscene, right?\"\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu exchanged glances, their expressions equally strange, especially when Chen Yu Ying couldn’t laugh anymore and couldn’t speak, her voice was extremely tender and bashful.\nDing Sihan suddenly closed her eyes, then aunt-smiled and remarked softly: \"Now the sound and image are synchronized.\"\nNow it’s—imagination! time!\nQu Wanqiu blinked, suspecting Ding Sihan was thinking unapproved thoughts.\n\"But this sound is truly... Overall... Imaginative.\" Qu Wanqiu shook her head with a smile, undeniable.\nBai Bufan glanced up at Qu Wanqiu again, realizing it wasn’t his Feifei, he lowered his head and continued arguing.\n\"Thankfully Ying Bao turned off the monitor, I can’t imagine what her uncle would think hearing these sounds.\" Ding Sihan opened her eyes, saying amusingly.\n\"Boom—!!\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\nThe sudden loud sound startled all five present.\nThe five looked towards the sound origin at the door, where the slightly red-faced Chen Zhongping stood, eyes wide open.\n\"Just a bet’s penalty.\"\nIn the quiet atmosphere, only Lin Li quickly recovered, answering honestly.\nChen Zhongping glanced at the five properly dressed individuals, the boys on one side, the girls on the other, except for the foot part, the distance seemed safe, he relaxed a little and nodded.\nReason told Chen Zhongping, who heard the sounds just now, that it must not be what he feared, after all, there was the low talking and laughter of others, and he had basic trust in his daughter.\nBut the problem is, fathers don’t need reason at this time.\nNot confirming with a glance is impossible for peace of mind.\n\"Oh, it was the bet’s penalty, haha, I thought it was the bet’s penalty.\nNo problem, keep playing, but for penalties requiring physical contact, girls should do it to girls, boys to boys, keep some distance. Of course, since you’re good friends, it’s just a suggestion.\"\nChen Zhongping’s speech sped up, especially when Chen Yu Ying got up with a stern Xiaohai face.\n\"I’ve placed the things on the entrance’s umbrella rack, I’m leaving now.\"\nHe turned and departed.",

      "content": "Chapter 232: Chapter 193: You’re Next!\nThere were only four people in the room, Lin, Bai, Ding, and Qu, while outside the room someone was giving a lecture.\nBut it wasn’t Chen Zhongping lecturing Chen Yu Ying; from the tone of the voice, it seemed like Chen Yu Ying was lecturing Chen Zhongping.\nLooks like Chen Zhongping doesn’t have a high status at home.\nSure enough, a few minutes passed, and only Chen Yu Ying returned, still a bit miffed.\n\"My dad saw the weather forecast and said it might rain, so he came to bring us umbrellas. He has a spare key for the guesthouse, so he just let himself in.\nActually, he sent me a message saying he was at the door, but I didn’t notice. Plus, he really wanted to sneak a peek at what we were doing, so he just came in. Now he’s gone back, and he won’t do it again next time. He’ll definitely let us know first. Sorry for scaring everyone.\"\nChen Yu Ying stuck out her tongue and apologized.\n\"No big deal, I understand completely. I feel like I’ve dodged a bullet.\" Lin Li nodded in deep understanding.\nLin Li almost felt like he needed to apologize again; luckily, Chen Zhongping only glanced at him a few times and didn’t corner him for a ’private chat’.\nNo one really said anything about it.\nChen Yu Ying let out a long sigh of relief.\n\"There’s more.\" Chen Yu Ying continued with a mischievous glint in her eye, \"The five minutes are up.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"I can’t understand this! Shouldn’t it have been paused?\"\n\"There was no pause. You just didn’t scratch, but the five minutes are definitely over, so you can’t scratch anymore.\"\n\"Huh? Class Leader, do you hear yourself? How could I scratch? Was I supposed to squat on the ground and scratch your feet while you were talking with your dad?\nIf Uncle had seen that, I’d admire him if he could hold back from kicking me!\" Lin Li said with wide eyes.\nWouldn’t I be kicked like a ball?\nIf I became a football, Chen Zhongping might really surpass the national team.\nPerhaps Lin Li’s description was so vivid, everyone burst into laughter.\n\"So cool, I want to kick too.\" Especially Bai Bufan, who, after imagining the scene, couldn’t wait to join in.\n\"Doesn’t matter, over is over.\" Chen Yu Ying crossed her arms in front of her resolutely.\n\"Damn, you actually cheated.\" Lin Li shook his head in distress but didn’t insist further.\nHe had scratched for a few minutes just now, but the task bar still had at least 60 to 70% remaining, so even using all the remaining time, it would be impossible to complete.\nMoreover, with the recent interruptions, Chen Yu Ying probably didn’t want to be scratched any longer.\nHe would figure out the rest later.\nLin Li got up and looked at the chaos on the dining table and in the kitchen. It was time to clean up.\nThey still didn’t know how many days they’d stay, and with no maid to clean daily, they had to rely on themselves.\n\"What are we doing tomorrow? Since we’re in Shanting... Oh right, Ding Sihan, do you like playing in the water?\" Lin Li asked Ding Sihan.\n\"Playing in the water? Sure.\"\nAlthough Shanting’s beach wasn’t the typical hotel beachfront, walking around and collecting some small shells was still fun, so Ding Sihan nodded.\n\"OK, then you’re assigned to wash the dishes.\" Lin Li snapped his fingers.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nSeriously?\nThis was Lin Li hiding the dagger in the Yan Kingdom map. He wasn’t interested in tomorrow’s plans; he was after these vinegar-flavored dumplings!\n\"That’s not the water I want to play with...\" Ding Sihan said forlornly.\n\"Alright, let’s all clean up together.\" Chen Yu Ying said with a smile, standing up.\nThe girls washed the dishes, while Lin Li and Bai Bufan took charge of cleaning the cookware, especially Lin Li’s pot, which had turned black.\n\"What did you use to scrub it? How is it so clean?\" Bai Bufan asked in confusion, comparing his and Lin Li’s results.\n\"I used elbow grease.\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan with an expression indicating he was stating the obvious.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nNo comeback for that, indeed.\n...\nAfter everything was cleaned up, the five reconvened at the dining table to discuss plans for the next day.\nNo one felt the need to get up early in the morning; sleep in if they wanted to, and breakfast was optional.\nJust need to be awake before heading out for lunch.\nChen Yu Ying probably wouldn’t sleep in too late, so Lin Li planned to teach her how to ride a bike in the morning. As for where to get a bicycle, Lin Li saw a functioning one in the basement storage room, which could be used after a morning cleaning.\nAs for the afternoon, perhaps Lin Li’s earlier suggestion had some influence; they all agreed to check out the seaside at Shanting.\n\"Start the board game session?\" After roughly planning the next day, Lin Li suggested.\nDespite having a slow dinner, it was still only seven in the evening, too early for everyone to part ways and sleep.\n\"Sure.\" Everyone was fine with the idea.\nThe guesthouse had many board games, but in the end, they opted for the universally fun Monopoly.\nApologies to Three Kingdoms Kill; the environment just doesn’t allow me to choose you. Lin Li sincerely apologized to Three Kingdoms Kill in front of the board game shelf.\nCan’t steam it.\n\"OK, first let’s decide what the punishment for losing will be?\" As he spread the Monopoly board across the dining table, Lin Li spoke up.\n\"I’ll start. If I become the Monopoly magnate, I want to tickle the three of you!\" Lin Li pointed to the three girls opposite him.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t react much, but Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu were surprised and pointed at themselves: \"Us too?\"\n\"Why do we have to be tickled too?\" They genuinely wondered.\n\"Because of Xiaodingding and Little Qiuqiu, I want to see you laugh. When you laugh, my world lights up.\" Lin Li suddenly spoke earnestly, his voice filled with emotion, \"Your laughter is like a 60-watt light bulb.\"\nChen Yu Ying closed her eyes helplessly, as if she couldn’t bear to watch.\nDing Sihan, Qu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nGrass.\n\"Why is it that when it’s our turn, it’s just a 60-watt lightbulb instead of the sun?\" Ding Sihan took a deep breath, apparently focusing on the wrong point.\nLin Li was very reasonable: \"Hou Yi would get angry, Kua Fu would lose his way, you guys shouldn’t be so selfish.\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nIt made some sense, but not much.\n\"Why are you only tickling their feet? What about me?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"I’ll order you to do a hundred squats.\" Lin Li replied.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nNow when it’s my turn, it changes, huh?\n\"Don’t you want to see me smile? I don’t need to be the sun, nor a 30-watt to use so much electricity; six watts is enough for me.\" Bai Bufan was disappointed, but tried to persuade Lin Li to change his mind.\n\"When you smile, my world becomes a mini world, so I don’t want to see you smile at all, I just want to see you dead.\" Lin Li just sneered.\nBai Bufan could only shake his head and sigh.\nHowever, to Lin Li’s surprise, his proposal was actually approved.\n...\n\"I’m sorry, sir, I don’t know what to do, I really can’t pay this rent.\"\n\"Oh, beautiful lady, have you considered another way to pay?\"\n\"But I...still have a husband.\"\n\"I won’t let him know.\"\n\"Then...alright.\" Lin Li trembled as he reached out to unbutton his shirt, his face full of resigned determination.\n\"Yes, just like that.\" Bai Bufan grinned as he unbuckled his belt.\nIt was about to turn into a hilarious scene.\n\"You two are so sick, haha—who told you guys to play Monopoly like this, haha—\"\nOn the other side, the three girls were already laughing hysterically.\nDing Sihan was pounding the table, Qu Wanqiu was hitting the floor, while Chen Yu Ying tapped Lin Li’s hand that was sneakily reaching for the bank to steal money amidst the chaos.\n\"No stealing money.\" Chen Yu Ying protected the bank, glancing at Lin Li with a smile.\n\"Ah, damn it! Stealing money! Borrowing money! I’m borrowing money, I’m borrowing one million more from the bank!\" As his scheme failed, Lin Li said dejectedly.\n\"Lin Li, you’ve already borrowed seven million, one more million and you’ll be bankrupt,\" Ding Sihan said with a cheeky grin.\n\"Damn it, no wonder you agreed so readily, you were planning to trap me.\" Lin Li took a million from the bank, then paid the passage fee for this turn to Bai Bufan.\nAmong the five people present, he was the only one with negative assets.\nEveryone was targeting him.\nIt’s one thing for the three girls to target him, but Bai Bufan had also joined their ranks, using all the chance cards against him.\nHe just wanted Bai Bufan to lose, but Bai Bufan wanted him to lose the game!\nLin Li looked down at his own feet, feeling utterly pitiful.\nSorry, bro, you might suffer tonight.\nBlame Wu Min, if she’d helped me with three hundred thousand, maybe I could hold on a few more rounds.\nIt was Bai Bufan’s turn again, and only two pieces of land belonged to Lin Li, so this turn had nothing to do with him.\nBai Bufan paid Qu Wanqiu.\n\"Bu——\"\nLin Li, who was drinking water, almost choked on that fart noise and then started laughing openly.\nAnd the one Lin Li would laugh at without consideration was, naturally, only Bai Bufan.\nThe three girls across apparently respected Bai Bufan, just twitching their lips without laughing.\nFortunately, when you’re not eating something bad, a loud fart generally doesn’t smell bad.\nWith already thin skin in front of the girls, Bai Bufan blushed deeply, and after hurriedly paying the money, he looked at Lin Li: \"It’s your turn.\"\nLin Li didn’t pick up the dice; he took a deep breath, brewing for a long time.\nThen he apologized to Bai Bufan:\n\"Sorry, I can’t let it out.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Pfft——\" This challenge not to laugh was too hard, and the other side couldn’t hold it in any longer.\nLin Li is just too mischievous.\n\"Grass! Lin Li! Damn you!\" Bai Bufan was slow to react, then angrily jumped up and started hitting and kicking Lin Li, bang bang bang, making Lin Li scamper away, covering his head.\n\"Everyone agreed to let it go, and you bring it up like this?\"\n\"Hahahaha——\" The three girls, already on the verge of laughter, couldn’t hold back anymore.\nBai Bufan was hitting with a sense of satisfaction.\nThe three girls laughed until they swayed like flowers.\nOnly Lin Li felt wronged: \"But I really can’t let it out...\"\nOh dear, when the time comes, farts are sorely missed, how sad.",

      "content": "Chapter 233: Chapter 194: Bai Bufan at first glance is clearly an old ladybug\nThe night was deep outside the hostel, and occasionally a frog croaked from the back mountain.\nInside the hostel.\n\"Bai! Bufan! Do you know why spiders only have eight legs? Because nine is too many! If you dare to offend me again, I’ll exterminate your entire clan! Get off me!\"\nLin Li pounded on Bai Bufan who was sitting on his back, laughing, but his laughter was tragically pitiful.\n\"Stop tickling me, sis! I have paronychia! And nail fungus! Foot acne! I even have athlete’s foot!\"\nBai Bufan suddenly turned his head to meet Lin Li’s eyes.\nThe glint in his eyes was mischievous, but he didn’t speak, especially with the girls around.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWait a minute.\n\"Dammit.\" Lin Li realized and jokingly cursed, but because girls were present, he softly responded, \"Just kidding, I don’t want to.\"\nSatisfied, Bai Bufan turned back to continue his task.\n\"Stop, stop!! I was wrong! Uncle Chen, where are you? Save me! Shout for me! I love my life!\" Lin Li continued with his ’task’.\n\"Which Uncle Chen are you talking about?\" Bai Bufan chuckled scoldingly.\nAt this moment.\nBai Bufan was sitting on Lin Li, pinning down his legs, while Chen, Ding, and Qu each held a feather, tickling the soles of Lin Li’s feet.\n\"If you bet, you have to accept the loss. You made this rule yourself, don’t think of escaping!\" Bai Bufan was the happiest.\nRules were rigid, and so was Lin Li.\n\"Ah haha—\" Lin Li laughed weakly and intermittently, \"It’s so itchy, my feet are killing me...\"\n\"Stop talking weird,\" Chen Yu Ying’s amused voice chimed in.\n\"Oh.\"\nEven a Cultivator cannot take on four people, Lin Li learned this lesson through blood and tears.\nMonopoly is a capitalist’s game, not suitable for him. If he’d known, he would have played Three Kingdoms. Lin Li wanted to protect Dabaos’s smile.\nA whole night, a whole night of being hunted and blocked by this group, he didn’t win a single round.\nBut in the punishment round, he excelled with a grand name.\nNo wonder they agreed to it so readily; they planned to watch him suffer from his own traps.\nYet, as a Cultivator, it was impossible for Bai Bufan to truly restrain Lin Li, and Lin Li was also cautious about accidentally kicking the girls, so his lower body didn’t make any movements beyond reflexively retracting from the tickles.\n\"Beep beep beep, beep beep beep.\"\nThe three-minute timer went off, and only then did everyone stop, slightly unsatisfied.\nLin Li collapsed on the floor, clothes in disarray, hair a mess, like an innocent young man who had been mistreated.\nEven though he had been mistreated, Lin Li felt he had entered a Wise One mode.\n\"The world kissed me with pain, but I didn’t consent, isn’t this sexual harassment?\" He asked.\nNo one paid attention to Lin Li’s self-reflection.\nIn fact, when they began to punish him, Lin Li had thought if their pleasure from tickling his feet could accelerate their task progress.\nBut they consistently used feathers as an intermediary, quite disdainful of Lin Li’s precious feet, even though Lin Li said it was fine and even invited them, they only thought it was Lin Li acting irrationally.\nBai Bufan got up from Lin Li’s body, took a one-yuan note from his pocket, tossed it onto Lin Li, pretending to smoke a cigarette with two fingers by his mouth, and said blandly, \"Clean yourself up.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWhat?\nYou little...\nThat was pretty ruthless humiliation.\n\"Alright, thanks, bro.\" Lin Li first wiped the one-yuan note on his clothes, blew on it, and then put it in his pocket, struggling to get up and sit back in his seat.\n\"Up for more, Lin Li?\" Ding Sihan knocked on the table and said with a smile.\n\"No more, no more,\" Lin Li shook his hand with a relieved smile, \"If you guys continue, go ahead; I have to get up early tomorrow for exercise. It’s almost eleven now, I should wash up and prepare for sleep.\"\n\"Huh? Even during holidays, you work out and go to bed this early?\" Ding Sihan asked in surprise, then shrugged, \"If you’re not in, then let’s not play, it’s no fun without anyone to torment.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDing Sihan, you’re really going overboard with your words.\n\"Let’s call it a night then,\" Chen Yu Ying clapped her hands lightly and said, \"We still have makeup removal and skincare to do, and our room luggage is still not sorted.\"\nAgreed, the five of them stood up, tidied the board games away, and stored them back in place. The girls headed up to the third floor.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan also returned to the second floor.\n\"I’m going to the gaming room for a while; you’re not coming, Lin Li?\" Bai Bufan asked.\nIt didn’t make sense for Bai Bufan to go to bed so early.\n\"Yeah, I’m not going,\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Alright, if you’re going to bed early, you take a shower first.\" Bai Bufan said.\n\"Okay.\"\nThe shower didn’t take long, and to avoid any possible indecent exposure, Lin Li came out of the bathroom fully dressed.\n\"We could hear your laughter from the stairwell, what were you laughing about?\" Back on the second floor, Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan, who was rolling around on the floor, curious.\n\"I saw a brand-new Hell joke!\"\n\"Tell me,\" Lin Li immediately switched to study mode.\nNo hard work, no abstraction.\n\"Didn’t a wildfire recently break out in Los Angeles? I saw a comment—\n’Lao Mei lives up to its name, a grand gesture, burning Los Angeles at 4 a.m. to urge Lao Da to practice his game. We should also reflect on burning paper money. Tokyo University, slow down, wait for your people!’\"\nAnd so there was one more person rolling on the floor.\nThat’s hellishly good, it’s a relief Lin Li has no morals.\n\"You can go wash up,\" Lin Li suggested to Bai Bufan after laughing.\n\"OK.\"\n\"Why did you bring your own shower gel? There’s some in the bathroom,\" Lin Li asked curiously after seeing Bai Bufan pull out not only a change of clothes but also a small packet of shower gel from his suitcase.\n\"It’s not shower gel, it’s shampoo. I’m used to this brand. Last time during the autumn trip, I used the hotel’s shampoo, and it felt super itchy after. I couldn’t get used to it,\" Bai Bufan explained.\nSome people do experience a sudden increase in dandruff or itchiness when they switch shampoos.\n\"What brand?\" Lin Li inquired.\n\"霸王 (Bawang).\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Pretty niche,\" Lin Li remarked.\n\"Niche? Jackie Chan won’t lie to me. After using this, my hair will be so silky and bouncy,\" Bai Bufan retorted.\n\"I have research on this. I once researched what shampoo men use in the shower by observing 100 men with random interviews. 98 of them responded with, ’How the hell did you get in here?’ Your Bawang, I’ve never heard of even once,\" Lin Li shook his index finger, presenting his supporting evidence.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"And what did the other two guys say?\" But now, he was more curious about this.\n\"’Bro, I dropped my soap, can you pick it up for me?’\"\nBai Bufan: \"Damn.\"\n\"So did you pick it up?\"\n\"Of course not. By the way, Bufan, do you use soap when bathing? I’ve got too much at home and can’t finish it. You could help me use some.\"\n\"No thanks, I’m good,\" Bai Bufan left satisfied.\n\"Remember to knock when you get back. I just started a new game and I’m about to make my first purchase six times,\" Lin Li said to Bai Bufan’s back.\nBai Bufan didn’t look back and responded with a middle finger.\nA real man never looks back at incompetence.\nAs the sound of footsteps faded downstairs, Lin Li opened his backpack again and took out the \"Spiritual Spring\" wrapped in cling film.\nJust like unfinished Spirit Stones can be returned to the [Warehouse], the \"Spiritual Spring\" that hasn’t been exhausted can also be retrieved by Lin Li at any time. But while in the [Warehouse], it’s effectively frozen, not generating any Spiritual Qi or Spiritual Liquid.\nLeaving it at home is uncontrollable, and it might be wasted. Lin Li definitely decided to bring it along.\nAs for the \"Duck Blood Bottle,\" it’s been restored and is already in the [Warehouse]. Lin Li calculated that the cooldown with the duck blood situation is about a week or so.\nUpon arriving at the rental, the first thing was to materialize the \"Spiritual Spring,\" toss in a few empty Spirit Stone shells, wrap them with cling film, and put them into the backpack.\nCarrying the empty Spirit Stone shells is also quite simple.\nThe system doesn’t accept Spirit Stones without Spiritual Qi but as long as each shell stays at the \"Spiritual Spring\" bottom for two or three minutes and absorbs a bit of Spiritual Qi, transforming from ’empty shell’ to having a 0 to 0.01 change, it will be judged by the system as still useful, allowing it to return to the [Warehouse].\nLin Li’s [Warehouse] doesn’t have a slot limit.\nAfter completing this replacement, Lin Li materialized the \"Substitute Jade-faced Buddha.\"\nA thumb-sized jade Buddha statue placard.\nRefinement was unimaginably simple, unlike the \"Duck Blood Bottle,\" which required several lower-tier Spirit Stones to complete refinement. \"Substitute Jade-faced Buddha\" was refined almost instantly when Lin Li attempted it.\nThe link was established, and more information about this magical artifact entered his mind.\nThe protection triggered is indeed invincible, with a 3-60 second judgment time, naturally depending on the strength of the attack encountered during the protection—stronger ones will be shorter.\nAfter refining it, he can continue to ’refine,’ allowing it to devour his physical and mental energy. The purpose of this is that when the artifact breaks, it will fully feedback on him at that time, healing injuries and restoring energy.\nThis isn’t the Sword of Fate; it’s a Guardian Angel’s Plate!\nIt even restores health!\nSeveral minutes later, Lin Li’s expression looked a bit fatigued.\nThe devour process isn’t 1 to 1; absorbing even one-tenth effectively would be nice. The devour process requires Spirit Stones to assist, which seems to be the main Spirit Stone consumption for this artifact.\nBut it’s not a major issue. The Spirit Stone scarcity has been barely resolved, and he has extra physical and mental energy daily, so he can take it slow.\nBeing tired even helps him sleep better.\nAfter ensuring nothing was missed, Lin Li lay down.\n[Team training, demons coveting, attempting a night assault. As the person with the most experience in demon-slaying, you should step forward to annihilate them!]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task Three: Eliminate the demons attempting to harm fellow disciples right now, three in total.]\n[Rewards: Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption speed increases by 100%; System currency *50.]\nLin Li stood upright.",

It’s pretty creepy late at night,\" Lin Li commented.\n\"Just a mud mask, for skincare. If you don’t take good care when you’re young, you’ll age quickly later. Girls work hard, you know?\" Ding Sihan flipped him off.\n\"Well, my mom’s amazing. She hardly uses skincare products, yet she stays young,\" Lin Li shrugged.\n\"Does Auntie have any secrets? Can you tell me?\" Ding Sihan gazed at Lin Li with sparkling eyes full of hope.\n\"Lying about her age,\" Lin Li replied.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nYour mom.\nNo, wait.\nYour damn mom.\n\"She always claims to be 28. I’m almost 18 now; if she’s telling the truth, my dad, if alive, would be about to face execution by now,\" Lin Li added.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nDing Sihan was speechless.\n\"Is there anything I shouldn’t see on the third floor right now? Can I go up?\" Lin Li returned to the matter at hand, asking.\nNot directly going up is basic respect.\nDing Sihan patted the white mud on her face, scanned the area, and shook her head, \"No, come on up.\"\nAfter receiving permission, Lin Li went upstairs.\nChen Yu Ying was using a curling iron to style her hair ends. Seeing Lin Li, she waved curiously yet sweetly.\nSounds came from the bathroom; Qu Wanqiu must be showering.\nLin Li first went to the bathroom door: \"Little Qiuqiu, I’m outside the door now. If you’re coming out later, let me know in advance to scram because I don’t want to be held accountable.\"\n\"What’s wrong with you? Who needs you to be accountable!\" The showerhead noise inside temporarily paused, and Qu Wanqiu scolded with a laugh after hearing Lin’s words.\n\"No accountability needed? Then open the door. I’ve prepared my lewd eyes already. Just listening to you shower is enough for me to eat three bowls of rice.\" Lin Li spoke unabashedly.\n\"Hahahahahahaha get lost!!\"\nNot only Qu Wanqiu, but also Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan burst out laughing upon hearing this description.\n\"I’ve got goosebumps, Lin Li. How do you say things like this? It doesn’t sound like acting,\" Ding Sihan raised her head to prevent her mud mask from cracking due to facial tremors, struggling to hold back laughter.\nThis was Azusawa Maita’s classic line; Lin Li wouldn’t dare claim the credit.\nAfter solving the potential threat of Qu Wanqiu, Lin Li began exploring the third floor.\n\"So, what are you doing up here, Lin Li? It can’t be just... for entertainment, right?\" Chen Yu Ying paused what she was doing, asking with playful curiosity.\nLin Li said seriously, \"I’m hunting down a mosquito that flew up here. I have to kill it with my own hands.\"\nLin Li actually didn’t know if it was a mosquito; the system said it was a monster, cockroaches or flies probably count too, but mosquito is the most reasonable excuse.\nChen Yu Ying, Ding Sihan: \"...\"\n\"Well... good luck?\" Chen Yu Ying responded with a strange expression.\nSearching cluelessly would be difficult, but Lin Li is a Cultivator, with [Ear Divine Power], source’s ear, activate!\nEverything around became clear instantly.\nLin Li heard it!\nHe suddenly looked up in surprise, \"Ding Sihan, you said I was stably losing it!\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"You can hear that too?\"\nDing Sihan looked at Lin Li in amazement; she had just sighed in resignation, speaking very softly.\n\"Haha, I can hear eight directions now. Qu Wanqiu is still singing ’I love bathing, I feel so good, ow ow ow ow’.\" Lin Li replied smugly with a laugh.\nThen he slapped himself lightly, almost forgetting the task again.\nOnce more, he quieted down to start listening.\n\"Buzz——\"\nThe mosquito dodged Lin Li’s hand.\nBut it couldn’t escape the electric arc now reaching nearly ten centimeters.\n[Eliminate the demon currently attempting to harm fellow disciples three times (1/3)].\n\"Did you hit it?\" Ding Sihan curiously leaned over to look.\n\"Didn’t hit it, got away,\" Lin Li shook his head. There are two more to deal with, more time needed.\n\"Useless thing.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nLin Li was preparing to continue searching around the third floor using eight-directional hearing when suddenly pulled over by Ding Sihan.\nDing Sihan hid behind Lin Li, pointed ahead, and said with some disgust, \"Lin Li, there’s a bug, solve it. The window needs to be closed; too many bugs in this kind of place.\"\nLin Li followed her gaze, seeing in the corner two slender antennae gently swaying.\n\"How can you presume it’s a bug, it might be Lu Bu or a twin-tailed loli,\" Lin Li frowned.\n\"You’re really stably losing it.\" Ding Sihan spoke loudly this time, not needing [Ear Divine Power].\n\"Ding Sihan, do you have a newspaper?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Why do you need a newspaper? Who reads newspapers these days? Use a phone.\" Ding Sihan wondered and handed over her unlocked phone; newspapers are practically obsolete, who even reads them.\n\"That’s fine. But using a phone to swat bugs for the first time makes me a bit nervous.\" Lin Li took the phone, beginning to breathe deeply.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nJust got interrupted, almost forgetting what Lin Li was doing!\n\"Wait! Wait! Don’t! I’ll find you something!\" Ding Sihan quickly snatched her phone back from Lin Li, finally grabbing a takeaway hard shell packet, rolled into a stick, handing it to Lin Li: \"Use this to smack it.\"\nLin Li moved the clutter away; it wasn’t a cockroach but a centipede.\nKind of cute, these kinds of bugs eat and leave, nothing to fear.\nThough centipedes eat cockroaches, Lin Li didn’t hesitate at all.\nMoreover, moving the clutter, Lin Li sharply noticed a small spider too.\n\"Smack!!\"\n[Eliminate the demon currently attempting to harm fellow disciples three times (2/3)]\n[Exterminate the three demons currently attempting to harm fellow disciples (3/3).]\nThanks, and there’s even a buy one get one free. Your bugs aren’t half bad.\n[Task three completed.]\n[Would you like to use the \"Random Reward Multiplier Card (3/3)\"?]\n[You have chosen to decline.]\n[You have received rewards: Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption rate increased by 100%; System currency*50.]\nThis task’s rewards aren’t really worth doubling.\n[Swift actions and skillful methods! In just a moment, the attacking demons were all slain, and fellow disciples look at you with admiration!\nUnexpectedly realizing, the surroundings are a den of demons, teeming with demons, attacking incessantly.\nThe path of slaying demons and exterminating evil does not end here!]\n[Timed task triggered!]\n[Task three: Within twelve hours, slay thirty demons attempting to harm fellow disciples.]\n[Reward: Title: Breath of the Demons; Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption rate increased by 100%; System currency*50.]\n[Breath of the Demons: When equipped, greatly enhances perception of surrounding demons and reduces demons’ hostility towards you, even seeing you as a companion.]\nJust like the mosquito-swatting task before, a simple task followed by a slightly more troublesome one, with the quantity multiplied by ten.\nHowever, Lin Li roamed the third floor several times but neither saw nor heard any more.\nQu Wanqiu had also finished bathing, knowing Lin Li was outside; she dressed neatly, avoiding any mishaps when coming out.\nLin Li, whose extra energy was already absorbed by the \"Substitute Jade-faced Buddha,\" was about to collapse from exhaustion due to the [Divine Power of Hearing].\nPerhaps the previous task said three because there were indeed three on the third floor, and the task description did mention \"currently.\"\nNow, Ding Sihan had deliberately closed doors and windows, and turned on the bug repellents, making it impossible for new demons to invade and consequently, hard to find any more.\nUnless you open the doors and windows yourself.\nWait a minute.\nThinking of this, Lin Li laughed.\nHe knew how to complete this task.\nBait and trap enforcement, that’s it.\nBut oh those girls went too far, lucky he brought Bai Bufan along.\nBai Bufan, it’s really nice having you.\n\"All cleared, you can all sleep peacefully now, I’m heading downstairs.\" With the solution in mind, Lin Li said, \"Class rep, go to bed early; we have bike lessons tomorrow morning. Xiaoding, Xiaoqu, you two should hit the sack early too.\"\n\"I’ll try.\" Chen Yu Ying waved with a smile.\nDing Sihan, Qu Wanqiu: \"?\"\nSomething seemed off.\nBack to the second floor, Bai Bufan had already finished showering and was drying his hair.\nOnce the hair dryer was put down, Bai Bufan admired himself in the mirror, holding the comb from the guesthouse, constantly brushing his hair.\n\"Come here, handsome guy, a kiss.\"\n\"Bai Bufan, you are so charming.\"\n\"Wow, so handsome~\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThe footsteps were drowned by the sound of the hair dryer, unnoticed by him.\nBut understandable.\nGirls before removing makeup, boys after showering, both consider those moments their peak in looks.\n\"Ahem.\" Lin Li spoke up.\n\"What the hell Lin Li, when did you come, sneaky like a fucking ghost, are you human?\" Bai Bufan turned, visibly startled.\nLin Li smiled: \"When you were French kissing yourself.\"\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan also smiled, took out the hair dryer cord and wrapped it around his neck, then began to pull it to the sides.\nLin Li quickly moved forward to stop him, concerned: \"Don’t do that, it’s bad for the hair dryer.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Come on, dude, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about, it’s not like a girl saw it. Don’t worry, although I just recorded a video, I won’t post it in the group,\" Lin Li said, putting an arm around Bai Bufan’s shoulder, pulling him along.\nBai Bufan widened his eyes, seized Lin Li’s phone, checked it all over before finally breathing a sigh of relief.\n\"So why are we on the balcony?\" Bai Bufan asked upon handing the phone back, realizing Lin Li had already dragged him out onto the balcony, where he changed into balcony slippers and listened to the external air conditioning unit’s humming with confusion.\n\"Suddenly not so sleepy, wanted to chat with my best bud,\" Lin Li said warmly, leaning against the balcony railing.\nBai Bufan turned to leave right away.\nLuckily, Lin Li was quick-eyed and quick-handed, grabbing Bai Bufan back.\n\"Going where?\"\n\"Lin Li, you insane or what?\"\n\"Is chatting insane now? Bai Bufan, our relationship really has faded!\" Lin Li was upset.\n\"Chatting is fine sure, but let’s chat inside? At this time, in this weather on the balcony, isn’t it nuts?\" Bai Bufan responded, face full of bewilderment.\n\"Don’t you think a summer evening breeze, cicada chirping, starry sky scene is beautiful? Maybe tonight’s memory will be what you think of many years later, when you’re poor and cold lighting matches for warmth, selling them on the street in winter?\"\nLin Li argued, reasonably.\n\"Never mind why years later I end up selling matches on the street poor as dirt, let’s first analyze the scenic elements you mentioned.\"\nBai Bufan laughed in disbelief, pointing to the sky: \"Starry sky? It’s cloudy, you can’t even see the moon let alone stars.\"\nPointing at the air conditioner: \"Evening breeze? All I feel is the artificial warm air.\"\nFinally pointing to the hill outside the balcony: \"Cicada chirping? Dude, it’s October, the cicadas are all dead, all I hear are mosquitoes buzzing!\"\n\"What’s beautiful in your mother- \"beep\"?\" Bai Bufan concluded.\nLin Li scratched his head.\nHe was indeed a bit speechless.\n\"Wait a minute, you mentioned mosquitoes buzzing?\"\n\"Yeah, see, right here——\"\n\"Smack!\"\nLin Li moved swiftly, swiftly dealing with a mosquito flying beside Bai Bufan.\n[Within twelve hours, slay thirty demons attempting to harm fellow disciples (1/30)]\n\"See that? See that!\" Although Bai Bufan didn’t understand why Lin Li was so excited, he was more assertive: \"This is the result of us staying outside, feeding mosquitoes, is this what you wanted to see! Huh? Tell me loudly, Lin Li!\"\n\"Oh, it sure is, buddy, oh, it sure is.\" Lin Li smiled with satisfaction.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"",

After all, you’re the perfect kind of delivery guy.\"\nBai Bufan stared straight at Lin Li, his words harsh.\n\"Ah, right, right~\"\nLin Li draped an arm over Bai Bufan’s shoulder, pulling him away from the balcony door and leaning against the railing, while he slapped the second mosquito dead with a smack.\nCurse all you want, as long as you’re willing to keep feeding the mosquitoes, curse however you like.\nAfter all, the mission requires an attempt to attack fellow sect members by demons, and excluding himself, wasn’t he left with only Bufan?\nRemember, human rights are forever greater than animal rights. Bufan is man’s best friend, but just a friend!\nTurn the balcony lights up high so that in addition to mosquitoes, other demons attracted by the light might just want to violate Bai Bufan, helping to speed up the mission’s completion.\n\"I want to go back and use the air conditioner! Not bro, we just showered, if we sweat, wouldn’t that be pointless? Let’s go home, bro, let’s go home.\" Bai Bufan was still struggling in Lin Li’s arms, insisting on going back.\n\"It’s already October, and the weather is gradually cooling down. It’s everyone’s responsibility to protect the environment; for every minute we don’t use the air conditioner, a polar bear gets more habitat, and more underwear can be sold by people at the South Pole! Could you be any less selfish?\"\nLin Li decided to persuade Bai Bufan with positive energy.\n\"Polar bears have been using AC for tens of thousands of years; isn’t it finally my turn?\" Bai Bufan retorted, confidently defending himself.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nIndeed.\n\"Moreover, why are they preaching environmental protection to us commoners? Since childhood, I’ve heard ’no trade means no killing,’ but I’ve never even seen shark fins. Tell that to the big shots; if they fly private jets one less time, how much less emissions would there be?\"\n\"Old folks won’t like hearing such talk.\"\n\"And Lin Li, do you know the most absurd thing?\" Bai Bufan added.\n\"What?\"\nBai Bufan laughed, but it looked more like he was angry, pointing at the air conditioning unit humming loudly:\n\"You just said that our purpose of not using air conditioning is to protect the environment, but for heaven’s sake, could you turn off the air conditioner first before talking about protecting the environment?\nOur behavior of running the AC inside while standing outside is utter wastefulness, and should the polar bears drown because of people like you, they wouldn’t rest in peace.\"\n\"...\"\nLin Li scratched his head.\nWow, quite true indeed.\n\"You’re right.\" Lin Li nodded, being a sensible person.\n\"Then hurry up and go back, this place is remote, and there are way too many bugs.\" Seeing that Lin Li was listening to reason, Bai Bufan nodded and shooed away the mosquitoes in front of them.\n\"Don’t move!\" Lin Li’s sudden shout startled Bai Bufan.\n\"What? Is there something on me?\"\n\"I’ll deal with all the bugs; just don’t move.\" Lin Li concentrated on exterminating the mosquitoes, having come prepared with tissues so as not to dirty his hands too much.\nLuckily the place was remote, and it seemed this mission could be completed soon.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Why do I feel like... you brought me out here... just to watch me feed mosquitoes?\" Bai Bufan questioned.\n\"How could that be? Why would I do something so silly?\" Lin Li immediately waved his hand and extended his own: \"I got bitten too.\"\nLin Li naturally couldn’t wear the [Blood Crow Assassin] now, lest it include Bai Bufan in its range. So indeed, mosquitoes considered him a target too, and Lin Li had tried killing these mosquitoes, confirming they didn’t count towards the mission.\n\"Then why aren’t we going back?\" Bai Bufan was more confused.\n\"We can’t go back.\" After finishing, Lin Li turned his head, eyes filled with wistfulness and a smile on his lips.\nBai Bufan looked back, surprised.\nInside the room was Ding Sihan, who first found the remote to turn off the air conditioner, then walked to the balcony door, gave them a \"you fools\" look, sighed, shook her head, locked the balcony door from the outside, nodded to Lin Li, and left.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"No! No!\"\nIt was too late by the time Bai Bufan went to knock on the door.\n\"You called her?\" Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li in disbelief.\n\"Yeah, you made a good point earlier; it’s wasteful to have the AC on while we’re outside, so I asked Ding Sihan to turn off our room’s AC.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Then why did she lock the door?\"\n\"It’s tiring to keep holding onto you; this way, I can let you go and set you free.\" Lin Li released his grip, feeling relieved, \"Great, now the door can’t be opened from this side.\"\n\"Haha, hahaha.\" When people reach the ultimate limit of speechlessness, they burst into laughter. Without a phone on him, Bai Bufan couldn’t even call Ding Sihan to come back.\nBai Bufan gave Lin Li a thumbs-up.\nThen, not struggling, he leisurely leaned on the railing: \"Let’s chat then, it’s true we haven’t really had a deep conversation, Lin Li, so where should we start?\"\nResigned.\nWith the AC unit off, the balcony wasn’t as hot and noisy, as long as they didn’t sweat.\nAnd indeed, they hadn’t really had a night chat with Lin Li.\n\"I don’t want to chat, I want to play on my phone, do whatever you like, nothing to chat about with you.\" Lin Li leaned against the short side of the balcony, began scrolling on his phone.\n\"?\"\nBai Bufan, upon hearing this, turned his head, glaring at Lin Li.\n— he didn’t bring his phone.\nBai Bufan said, word by word:",

I don’t know what overly extreme thing I might do next.\"\n\"So the blood pressure is currently in junior high? What school? How’s its grades? I have some connections in Xiling, I can help it get into a good high school.\" Lin Li immediately took on the demeanor of an elder, prying into every detail.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nYou motherfucker.\nSensing that his phone might take flight within three seconds, Lin Li smiled, tucked it back into his pocket, walked to Bai Bufan’s side, swatted away a few mosquitoes, and looked at the back mountain outside the balcony:\n\"Chat! Let’s chat! What else can we talk about? Life, dreams, love.\"\nBai Bufan cracked his knuckles: \"My life is eating, sleeping, and jerking off. My love is jerking off. My dream is that I could also jerk off during the time for eating and sleeping. Alright, I’m done, now it’s your turn, Lin Li.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhat a speedy version.\n\"You truly have an insightful mind.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up and casually squashed a moth.\nAnimals that can think with their lower body all have insightful minds.\n\"Since you came over yourself, Lin Li, let me ask you, what’s the deal between you and the class monitor? Don’t give me that money-for-breakfast business you mentioned before, I don’t buy it.\"\nBai Bufan looked up at the third floor, then lowered his voice a bit as he teased with his eyes.\nLin Li chuckled, looked up at the sky, and under Bai Bufan’s expectant gaze, spoke: \"Wow, Bufan, look at that cloud, it looks like cotton candy.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Your topic shifts are still at an elementary level, aren’t they? How did your language skills improve this time? Did you cheat or something?\"\n\"Forget it, if you don’t want to talk, let’s just leave it. I get it, I never tell anyone about my ex either.\" Bai Bufan laughed, leaned over the railing, his flip-flop tip tapping the ground, looking a bit nostalgic.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWhen did this kid already betray his class?\n\"What the hell? You had an ex? Why didn’t you ever say anything, what happened?\" Lin Li asked, shocked and curious.\n\"Because she doesn’t exist, I can’t say anything.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou motherfucker.\n\"If I had one, I would have said so already, I wouldn’t be like some people.\" Bai Bufan sneered, pointing at the sky, imitating someone’s tone just now:\n\"Wow, Lin Li, look at that cloud, it looks like a Lin Li who’s repeatedly executed with castration for not sincerely exchanging true feelings with his brother.\"\n\"You’re fucked.\"\n\"How am I repeatedly castrated, am I not the immortal bird or what?\"\nAmused by Bai Bufan’s backhanded comment, Lin Li waved his hand:\n\"For the past month, the relationship between the class monitor and me went from classmates to friends, and maybe just friends if I could brag more. Other than that, there’s nothing else. Most of our private contact involves me asking her questions, and she helps me out. So what you’re asking doesn’t exist, I have nothing to say.\"\n\"Really?\"\nBai Bufan reached for Lin Li’s phone, and seeing Lin Li didn’t stop him, he swiftly scrolled through the chat logs between Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying, finding nothing indecent, he widened his eyes:\n\"So you’re using the class monitor as a study aid?\"\n\"Indeed, I’m pretty utilitarian.\" Lin Li smiled and nodded.\nMost of my behavior that seemed to ’forcefully get close’ in other boys’ eyes was actually tasks from the system.\nThe master really put me through a tough spot.\n\"Only utilitarian? I don’t believe you.\" Handing the phone back to Lin Li, Bai Bufan expressed his doubt, lowering his voice again: \"No way, you’ve been moving so deliberately today, and you say it’s just utilitarian? The class monitor didn’t even get mad, I even feel like you two are a thing.\"\n\"Just being a jerk, after all, I’m a pervert, not thinking as far as you do.\" Lin Li tapped the railing with his fingertips.\n\"But habits should be verbal habits... Yet the class monitor didn’t scold you after, nor was she particularly upset.\"\nLin Li frowned slightly.\n\"Forget it, I don’t get it either, but I think when you say it’s just utilitarian, you’re fooling yourself.\" Bai Bufan shook his head, as a complete outsider, better not to instruct Lin Li, an amateur.\n\"No kidding, who wouldn’t like a good-looking, cute, and rich girl with a great personality? But liking someone and liking someone is different. I think I’m still the former, plus, even if it’s the kind that leads to something more, it has to be mutual. I’m not confident that the class monitor has the same feelings, she’s nice to everyone, just the other boys in the class aren’t as shameless as I am to try and play with her.\nSo no matter what, it’s best to keep things as they are, why seek discomfort. But now that you mention it, I realize I’m a bit too comfortable.\"\nLooking towards the back mountain while swatting insects, Lin Li spoke slowly.\nBai Bufan looked at Lin Li, shook his head bewildered:\n\"Lin Li, what’s this inferiority complex of yours? I don’t know what you’ve been up to this past month, but the change is truly unbeatable. It’s incredible you managed to hold on. If I looked like you do now, I’d have caught an STD and died by now.\"\n[During this team training session, you’ve earned the genuine recognition and praise from other team members (2/4).]\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis compliment is quite something.\nEven if personal image charm increased by 20%, accounting for changes brought by exercise, it shouldn’t be to the extent Bai Bufan described.\nYet is this really genuine recognition?\nBufan’s rose-colored glasses for his brother seem a bit too strong, but this progress on the small task was a pleasant surprise.\nWait a sec.\n\"I’m a light sleeper, if you come back from gaming to do something to me, you’re dead.\" Lin Li took a half step back, said cautiously.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Dumbass.\"\n\"But being cautious is good too, after all, besides me, you have no rivals in the class, there’s plenty of time.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nLin Li: \"Ugh—\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Sorry, I just remembered your fart from last night and felt a bit nauseous, carry on, don’t mind me.\" Lin Li waved his hand to indicate he was fine.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You’re hideously ugly, Lin Li.\"\n\"Hmm, see.\"\n\"You’re disgustingly gross, Lin Li.\"\n\"Hmm, again.\"\n\"May your confession end up like my friend’s last one.\"\n\"Hmm? Details please.\"\n\"I said I liked you. She said thank you.\"\n\"I said I really like you. She said I really thank you.\"\n\"I said I really, really like you. She said sorry, the recipient is no longer your friend, message failed to send.\"\n\"This friend of yours...\"\n\"It’s not me, I’m telling you, it’s truly a friend.\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"But, Bufan.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Had I known your life was this entertaining, I’d have saved it for New Year’s Gala.\"\n\"I told you, it’s not me, it’s my friend.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"Say ’hmm’ one more time and see what happens? I’m getting mad.\"\n\"Oh.\"\n\"No.\"\n...\nOnce the conversation started, it flowed naturally, they chatted from the gossip Bai Bufan heard from fellow boarders to global affairs, ending up worrying about the nation and its people.\n[Task three is complete.]\n[Whether to...]\n[You have chosen to forfeit.]\nCompleting this task was never difficult, it was finished halfway through the chat.\nContinuing on was simply because they had more to talk about.\n[You have received a reward: Title: Demon Breath; Physical Improvement: Spiritual Qi absorption speed increased by 100%; System Currency *50.]\nHonestly, Lin Li was quite curious how things would turn out if the title were doubled, but he didn’t gamble on it.\nLin Li also tried out the title, it indeed allowed him to perceive these creatures like [Lightning Attractor], but perhaps being considered the same kind, wearing it made him feel these insects were approaching him, so Lin Li immediately took it off after testing, switching back to [Blood Crow Assassin].\n\"Damn, it’s almost midnight.\" Chatting until his throat was dry, Lin Li checked his phone and exclaimed in surprise.\nTime to sleep.\n\"I’ll ask Ding Sihan to open the door, let’s head back.\"\n\"Alright.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nThe night talk was pleasant, later it seemed all the mosquitoes disappeared for some reason, staying there felt really comfortable.\nLin Li typed on his phone.\nThen he laughed.\n\"Bufan, Ding Sihan won’t come, she told us to sleep on the balcony.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"",

That’s impressive!\nBai Bufan, who was watching Lin Li chat from the side, had a mournful expression, gathered a few leaves from the balcony, and handed them to Lin Li: \"Sad, Lin Li, eat more leafy greens, they’re good for your hair.\"\n\"Lin Li: ?\"\n\"Lin Li: You can’t be—\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Yes, it’s me, the really bad Ding Sihan.\"\nLin Li looked up and exchanged glances with Bai Bufan.\n\"No worries, I have a plan.\" Idea king Bai Bufan leaned over the railing again, took a look, and shook his head: \"Damn, the second floor is so high, well, my plan’s off.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"You mean your plan is utterly useless.\"\nBai Bufan: \"? Even this could work?\"\nBai Bufan then sighed, looked downstairs, and felt somewhat nostalgic:\n\"Lin Li, did you ever jump off the podium during elementary school PE? It was less than two meters high, but for me, who was just one meter twenty-three back then, it was quite high, but I couldn’t resist jumping up and down, even if my feet went numb.\nBack then, little me had big courage, but now I’m scared.\"\n\"Watch me.\"\nA dark shadow fell with the words, as Lin Li leapt up from beside Bai Bufan, grabbing the railing and hanging outside the balcony backwards, he raised a brow at the stunned Bai Bufan.\n\"Huh?\" Bai Bufan was stunned.\nLin Li laughed smugly: \"Luckily, big me still has big courage.\"\nHe relaxed his body, kept vertical, then let go, falling, Lin Li hit the ground with a dull thud.\nHowever, the ground was a lawn, as long as he didn’t sprain his ankle, even landing on his butt would only hurt for a few days at most.\nAnd Lin Li landed safely, his feet only numb for a little while.\n\"Awesome.\" Bai Bufan gave a thumbs-up to Lin Li on the first floor, \"I admit you’re a warrior.\"\nLin Li looked towards the task panel.\n[...（2/4）]\nTo be honest, Bai Bufan praised him right after he jumped, which did serve the purpose of receiving praise.\nThe number didn’t change, but judging by Bufan’s expression, it seemed genuine.\nSo does this \"4\" mean that everyone must recognize it once, and you can’t gather points from the same person?\nLet’s assume that for now, then there’s still Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying to go.\n\"Ding Sihan: What was that noise just now, did something happen.\" A message came in on the phone.\n\"Lin Li: Nothing much, my clothes just fell down.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: Why was the sound so loud just because your clothes fell?\"\n\"Lin Li: Oh, because I was still in them.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: ??????\"\n\"Ding Sihan: No?\"\n\"Ding Sihan: Huh?\"\n\"Ding Sihan: You jumped off the building? I was just joking! I’m already coming downstairs to open the door for you!\"\n\"Lin Li: Haha, love that comes too late is as worthless as grass, I don’t need you anymore.\"\n\"Bufan, keep strong!\" Lin Li shook his fist at Bai Bufan above.\n\"Unyielding!\" Bai Bufan responded, then watched Lin Li leave.\nLin Li came back.\n\"There’s a problem.\" Lin Li started.\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"I didn’t bring the inn’s key, I can’t get in through the front door.\" Lin Li smiled resignedly, resigned for real too.\nJumping like an idiot.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Could you think more when suggesting a plan?\" Lin Li questioned.\n\"Well, Ding Sihan is coming to open the door for me, you work hard and stay strong, I’m off to play games, bye~\" Hearing a sound behind him, Bai Bufan turned to look then waved to Lin Li.\n\"No, you stand right there, damn it!\"\n\"Bye-bye!\"\n\"You have withdrawn a message.\"\n\"Lin Li: Sister Ding, you’ve come down to the second floor, could you come down one more floor and open the front door, it’s urgent.\"\n\"But love that comes late is cheaper than grass,\" Ding Sihan leaned out from the second-floor balcony with a smile.\n\"Yet wealth does not bend, poverty does not change.\"\n\"Three kowtows on the second floor; six on the first, fair to all.\" Ding Sihan shook her head.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nGrass.\n\"Did you just jump down from here?\" Ding Sihan glanced at the height difference, curiously asked.\n\"Impressive, right? Not a scratch.\" Lin Li immediately ’reacted’.\n\"Oh, impressive,\" Ding Sihan nodded, though her expression said ’hard to judge’.\nThe system did not respond.\nLooks like this kind of praise doesn’t count.\nFortunately, the elder Ding has a kind heart and didn’t make Lin Li kowtow, he went downstairs to open the door for him instead.\nSince he hadn’t really sweated much, Lin Li went straight to his room, while Bai Bufan still went to the gaming room to play games.\nAfter completing two tasks, the system currency was already at 190, enough to buy another set of \"Lucky Charm\" + \"Random Quality Spirit Stone\", but after thinking it over, since the accumulated system currency was already 1450, and the third product slot was about to be unlocked, Lin Li decided to save it for now, since he wasn’t really lacking Spirit Stone at the moment.\nLying on the big bed, Lin Li closed his eyes.\nAnd the conversation with Bai Bufan began to replay.\n...\n\"Beep beep beep — beep beep beep —\"\n\"Bao Wei, turn off your annoying alarm clock!\" Bai Bufan irritably covered his head with the blanket.\n\"Wait, no.\"\n\"Bao Wei isn’t here.\"\nBai Bufan sat up sharply: \"Then whose Apple alarm is it?\"\nBai Bufan and the newly-awakened Lin Li exchanged a look. Lin Li, while turning off his own alarm, spread his hands: \"I dunno, maybe you miss Bao Wei so much you’re imagining things.\"\n...\n\"Lin Li, wake up, why are you sleeping here?\"\nFeeling his arm being shaken, Lin Li opened his eyes.\nChen Yu Ying held a steaming cup of tea in her hands, the steam softly swirling around her face, making it seem a bit dreamlike and lovely.\nIsn’t this much more pleasant than waking up to Bai Bufan’s face earlier this morning?\nBut Lin Li, being Lin Li, even though it was hard, still managed to step over Bai Bufan’s body to leave the room.\n——By ’leave’ it means stepping over him to exit the room.\n\"Good morning, class rep, what time is it?\" Lin Li shook his head to wake himself up.\n\"Eight thirty.\"\n\"I slept pretty late last night, and after exercising this morning, there wasn’t much to do, so I took a nap here.\" Lin Li finally answered Chen Yu Ying’s initial question.\n\"What happened last night, why did Sihan use my phone to send you those messages?\" Placing the hot tea on the table, Chen Yu Ying was a bit curious and indeed a bit puzzled to see those when she woke up.\nThe puzzled look was also cute.\n\"What happened—oh? Class rep, want me to show you my jump from the building?\" Lin Li suddenly suggested enthusiastically.\nMaybe he could get complimented for it.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"...\"\nAfter learning what ’jump from the building’ meant from Lin Li, Chen Yu Ying not only shook her head firmly but also gave him a slightly reproachful look:\n\"That’s too dangerous, you know Sihan was joking, if you jump like that, no matter how skilled you are, you might get hurt, don’t jump like that.\"\nLooks like no luck.\nInstead of being praised, he should just be grateful for not being scolded.\n\"Next time for sure.\"\n\"Let it be this time for sure,\" Chen Yu Ying stared at Lin Li.\n\"This time for sure then.\" Lin Li had no stance, smiled and nodded, then got up and stretched before asking, \"Class rep, do you want to have breakfast?\"\nYawning and stretching are contagious too. Seeing Lin Li’s actions, Chen Yu Ying also raised her arms, her fine curves showed.\nSo comfortable.\nThe only one who could outshine today’s Chen Yu Ying would be tomorrow’s Chen Yu Ying.\n\"I just placed an order for delivery, it’s almost here, and I was asking if you wanted any, but you didn’t reply,\" she said.\n\"What a shame.\"\n\"Not a shame, you haven’t had breakfast yet? I’ll just order another one.\" Chen Yu Ying said, taking out her phone again.\n\"No need, no need, I’ve eaten, it’s not me who’s regretting, it’s you, class rep.\" Lin Li spoke a bit quickly.\n\"Hmm? Regret what?\"\n\"Come with me and you’ll see.\"\nChen Yu Ying followed Lin Li to the door, and it wasn’t without reason Chen Zhongping came to deliver an umbrella, it must have rained for a bit last night, the ground was wet, but the weather was only cloudy now.\nBut this wasn’t what Lin Li wanted Chen Yu Ying to see, she found a scooter parked at the door compared to last night.\nLin Li took out a key from his pocket, with a dramatic gesture above his head, derder, the scooter was unlocked.\nLin Li looked at Chen Yu Ying and raised an eyebrow: \"Class rep, now do you see what you should regret?\"\n\"Lin Li, stealing a scooter is wrong.\" Chen Yu Ying said earnestly.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nClass rep, you’re the one who’s wrong here?",

      "content": "Chapter 238: Chapter 198: Wonderful, Lin Li Is Going to Become a Pillar\nPrejudice is a mountain impossible to transverse.\nBut Lin Li quickly noticed that Chen Yu Ying’s expression while saying this was teasing.\nTurns out, it was intentional.\nThen it’s okay. In that case, any mountain is just a piece of cake for Lin Li.\nRat poison can kill rats, so just feed the mountain some yam, and the mountain will behave.\nIf Yu Gong had had Lin Li’s intelligence back then, he wouldn’t have needed generations to move mountains. He was like an Old Deng with heirs, who didn’t need to worry about marrying and having kids, but what about future generations?\nYu Gong’s grandson, after hearing his grandfather’s vow, probably started apologizing to his younger brother, saying, \"Sorry, bro, you’re probably gonna be stuck for life.\"\n\"It’s a pity that you obviously had the chance to have freshly made breakfast on-site, but now you can only have takeout. That’s not stealing a bike.\" But you still have to go through the motions, Lin Li shrugged helplessly.\n\"Is this bike rented, or did you buy it?\" Chen Yu Ying leaned in closer, looked at the electric bike for a while, and curiously asked.\nToday’s electric bike was much smaller and looked fresher compared to the delivery bike Lin Li used before, without the big thermal box at the back.\nRiding it was much more comfortable, naturally a choice Lin Li made.\n\"I’m not Chen Yu Ying, of course it’s rented.\" Lin Li responded as if it were obvious.\nHearing her name from Lin Li instead of \"class monitor\" was still a novelty for Chen Yu Ying, causing her to blush inexplicably and give Lin Li a playful glare.\n\"Why rent an electric bike?\" she asked.\n\"Aren’t we going out today? We can’t really ask uncle to take us, right? It wouldn’t feel right. Having an adult around means we can’t have as much fun, and even if we kept him waiting, it would be time-restricted. So, it’s not as good as taking a cab. But with five people, we’d need two cabs, isn’t that wasteful?\nSo after my morning workout, I went to a nearby electric bike shop and rented this electric bike. That way, we only need one cab, and with an extra transportation option, any small issue can be resolved differently.\"\nLin Li explained.\nThe core reason, actually, is that no matter how fluently Chen Yu Ying learns to ride a bicycle, the task won’t progress at all. Lin Li’s ultimate goal in teaching her is to have her learn the electric bike.\nThe electric bike is the real mecha.\nBut what he said was indeed a secondary reason.\n\"Seems like that,\"\nAlthough it didn’t feel particularly necessary, Lin Li had already rented it; what’s done is done. It’s meant to have fun when going out, and it’s a harmless matter. So, with a smile, Chen Yu Ying nodded her approval to Lin Li.\nLin Li felt very satisfied, his lips curving up.\nThey chatted at the doorway for a while, and in just a few minutes, the delivery person arrived with the breakfast Chen Yu Ying ordered.\nAfter Lin Li took it, the two returned to the first floor of the homestay.\nChen Yu Ying leisurely ate her breakfast on the sofa, while Lin Li brought the bicycle, which he had already washed and tested in the morning, outside the homestay.\n\"Class monitor, did you bring socks that cover your ankles?\" Lin Li asked upon returning, looking at Chen Yu Ying.\n\"I did, why?\" Chen Yu Ying had brought both sandals near the entrance and a pair of sneakers.\n\"Give them to me for a moment.\" Lin Li snapped his fingers and held out his hand.\nThree seconds later, Lin Li stared widened eyes, feeling hurt as he questioned Chen Yu Ying, \"Why are you looking at me like that, class monitor? It’s hurting my feelings. I’ll modify them a bit and return them right away.\"\n\"Oh.\" She replied weakly, going up and down the stairs.\nSoon, Lin Li wrapped an ’armband’ around the sock cuffs, taped them together simply, and handed them back.\n\"What’s this for?\" she asked.\n\"I’m worried about your feet getting tangled in the bike pedals if you panic, and since the ankle and knee are the most vulnerable spots during a fall, having this double protection will save us some trouble,\" Lin Li explained.\nMany people have scars on their ankles, mostly from getting caught while riding a bike.\n\"Oh, I see.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nOccasionally, Lin Li’s attentiveness is unfamiliar.\n\"Too bad neither of us brought stockings; otherwise, we could cover both your ankles and knees—two birds with one stone. It’s a pity.\" Lin Li sighed.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nFamiliar now.\n\"What could thin stockings possibly protect, and covering ankles and knees is only two wishes, right?\" she questioned.\nLin Li gave her a condescending look and replied instantly, \"Because the third wish is to see you wearing them, class monitor.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nNow it’s unmistakably familiar.\n\"By the way, class monitor, even though I prefer black stockings, I’d accept white, yellow, green, pink, or purple as well.\" Lin Li continued his cheeky banter.\n\"I only have white ones; black ones are too embarrassing. Plus, I’m not wearing them for you. No color will change that.\" Lin Li was looking up at the ceiling, so despite the conversation topic, Chen Yu Ying didn’t feel uncomfortable.\nWhen Lin Li’s words go too far, his behavior becomes unusually restrained.\nThat’s a ’good’ way to be cheeky.\nManaging his cheeky remarks so as not to be genuinely disliked.\nTaking a bite of toast, she threw the remaining slices to Lin Li, saying, \"I’m full. There are two more slices; you can have them.\"\nLin Li caught them steadily, \"I had a hearty breakfast, too, but since you insist, I’ll keep them for the dog.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 239: Chapter 198: Wonderful, Lin Li Is Going to Become a Pillar - 2\n\"Is it for Bai Bufan?\" Chen Yu Ying asked instinctively.\n\"Hahaha—\" Lin Li couldn’t help but burst out laughing, \"Class monitor, that’s what you said, not me. I was referring to feeding the stray dog at the door.\"\nLin Li’s laughter made Chen Yu Ying’s face blush slightly. She turned her head and scoffed, \"I don’t believe it.\"\nChen Yu Ying swapped to Lin Li’s custom-made socks, put on her sneakers, and went outside. Without needing Lin Li’s guidance, she got on the bike and adjusted it to her most comfortable height.\nThe guesthouse was quite remote, and due to the holiday morning, there weren’t many people around. Even the roads were empty. For safety’s sake, Lin Li still chose a non-road section suitable for practice.\n\"Class monitor, first practice your sense of balance. Don’t pedal yet. Start by pushing off the ground continuously and then try to stabilize the bike. Don’t worry, I’ll be right behind you. If you can’t hold it, I can keep it steady.\" Lin Li followed closely next to Chen Yu Ying’s rear wheel and instructed.\nChen Yu Ying wasn’t heavy, and after a quick start, it wasn’t difficult for Lin Li to stabilize the bike.\n\"Okay.\"\nChen Yu Ying nodded, pushing off the ground with her legs to start.\nThe bike moved steadily forward until the force from pushing off couldn’t sustain the bike’s balance.\nShe did this two or three times.\n\"Learned it, what’s the next step?\" Chen Yu Ying looked back at Lin Li, then asked with some confusion, \"What’s wrong?\"\nBecause Lin Li’s eyes were wide open.\n\"Did you really grasp balance so easily?\" Lin Li exclaimed, \"Class monitor, did you learn any dance or something before?\"\n\"I did, learned quite a variety of dances, but I’m not proficient in any. It’s like being a jack of all trades but master of none.\" Chen Yu Ying replied.\n\"Class monitor, I suspect you’re being modest.\" Lin Li clicked his tongue, then suddenly thought of something and asked with interest, \"Class monitor, do you know ballet?\"\n\"Learned a little.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"Then we can exchange ideas someday.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nFacing Chen Yu Ying’s skeptical and slightly disturbed look, Lin Li chuckled softly, looked around sneakily to ensure there was no Bai Bufan before showing off a ballet pose and a large leap in front of Chen Yu Ying.\nAction breaks doubt!\nNow it was Chen Yu Ying’s turn to be wide-eyed.\nThe movements were very standard, there were indeed traces of training.\nBut do you really know how?\n\"Why did your family send you to learn this?\" Chen Yu Ying was shocked.\n\"I taught myself.\" Lin Li never relied on any system; all his achievements today are self-taught.\n\"Why did you want to self-learn this?\" Chen Yu Ying still didn’t understand.\n\"To see white socks.\"\n\"Cough, cough, cough—\" Lin Li’s answer almost choked Chen Yu Ying to death.\nWatching Chen Yu Ying cover her chest and cough lightly, Lin Li smiled and stepped forward to pat her back.\nAfter soothing her, Chen Yu Ying looked up, glared resentfully at Lin Li, and then rubbed her temples, \"Lin Li, I really can’t with you.\"\nSuch a reason.\nLuckily, it’s Lin Li.\n\"Alright, class monitor, let’s continue learning to bike. We’ll talk about the socks later.\nLater, you’ll start on your own, and when the bike is almost out of power, I’ll push you from behind. You just need to maintain balance and if you feel comfortable, try pedaling.\"\n\"Okay, but don’t mention the socks later either.\"\n\"That’s really annoying.\"\nHonestly, the hardest part of learning to bike is the sense of balance.\nOnce you grasp the balance between yourself and the bike, the rest of the learning is pretty straightforward.\nHaving long legs is great; when the bike wobbles, it won’t fall over. A quick push with the calf acts as a stand, not requiring support from Lin Li at all.\nLittle Lin Li was really useless when he was a kid, how could his legs be that short, useless garbage.\nChen Yu Ying only encountered a bit of difficulty when starting from a standstill and during bike turns; otherwise, she adapted very quickly.\nIn just over an hour, she was already able to ride the bike in circles in the open space, although the handlebars occasionally wobbled a bit, and whenever Lin Li tried to block her path, Chen Yu Ying would still hesitate and instinctively hit the brakes instead of turning.\nBut that’s just a matter of time; once you build confidence, it will be fine.\n\"Alas, it seems I won’t be able to see the scene where when you were learning to bike, you accidentally fell and started crying like a pear blossom in the rain while I stood on the side laughing mockingly and calling you a super-duper big dummy.\"\nNo longer needing to wait behind the bike, when Chen Yu Ying slowly circled back to him again, Lin Li sighed.\nChen Yu Ying remembered that Lin Li said this to her last time, so she proudly crossed her arms and tilted her head slightly to look at Lin Li, \"What should you say now?\"\n\"Class monitor! You’re amazing!\" Lin Li exclaimed with a face full of shock, admiration, and overly dramatic praise.\nThis was what he said when they were bantering before, \"At that time, you can only look shocked and say I’m awesome.\"\nHe actually remembered.\nBut it was too exaggerated, and instead, Chen Yu Ying couldn’t bear it.\nTaking her phone from the pocket of the pants she wore for biking, she handed it to Lin Li, \"Lin Li, record a video for me. I want to show my family that I can ride a bike now.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nLin Li naturally wouldn’t refuse.\nSince it was for her family, Lin Li followed behind Chen Yu Ying, recording without making any sound, otherwise, he might add some weird commentary.\n\"Ding Sihan and the others have woken up and are asking where we are.\"\nAfter Chen Yu Ying indicated she was done biking, the video stopped recording, and a WeChat message popped up on her phone. After glancing at it, Lin Li said.\n\"Let’s head back then. We’ve practiced enough for today; my butt is getting sore.\"\nChen Yu Ying got off the bike, did a chest expansion exercise, then crossed her hands upwards to stretch her body.\nThe beauty of the movements was compelling; somehow, obligatory viewing became a given, but because it was Chen Yu Ying, Lin Li averted his gaze instinctively after one look to avoid making anyone uncomfortable.\n\"Alright, let’s go back.\"\n...\n\"Yingying: ’Video’\"\n\"Yingying: Learned to ride a bike in one morning, you two still can’t, right? ’Proud’\"\nSeeing the message in the family group chat, Chen Zhongping carefully watched the video and immediately complimented her.\n\"Chen Zhongping: Impressive.\"\n\"Wife: Still not very skilled, right? Don’t go on the road, be safe.\"\n\"Yingying: Uh-huh, I know, just learning.\"\n\"Chen Zhongping: Yingying, what’s wrapped around your ankle, did you get hurt?\"\n\"Yingying: Said it’s a wristband for learning to bike to avoid getting caught in the wheels, but it wasn’t needed at all; there was no chance to get hurt, don’t worry.\"\n\"Chen Zhongping: That’s good, I thought you only wrapped it after getting injured.\"\nTeaching a daughter to ride a bike seems to be a common phase fathers experience.\nUnfortunately, I can’t even do it.\nPrimarily, there’s nowhere for me to use it, so Chen Zhongping never felt the need to learn.\nChen Zhongping watched the video again.\nSomeone has to teach biking; looking at the shadow, this person doesn’t have long hair.\nWho might it be? It’s so hard to guess.\nEvery time in the video when Chen Yu Ying started to wobble, the camera quickly moved closer, handling it pretty well,\nThe unnecessarily wrapped thing on the ankle was probably this guy’s doing too.\nIndeed, he has a bit of a human touch.\nBut.\nHe should have been the one to teach his daughter to bike, and this guy replaced him, that’s one crime.\nUnaware of the one crime, that’s a second crime.\nUnaware of the two crimes, that’s a third crime.\n...\nCan’t be written off! Can’t be written off!\nChen Zhongping terrifyingly discovered that Lin Li’s list of crimes was endless!\nStill need to find a way to encase this kid in a concrete pillar and make him a pillar of the country.",

      "content": "Chapter 240: Chapter 199: Oh no, Lin Li is about to be defeated\n\"Yo, Bufan, you’re awake too. Have you had breakfast?\"\nBack at the homestay, Lin Li greeted the disheveled Bai Bufan.\n\"Just woke up, not hungry yet. Besides, lunch will be soon, might as well snack a bit.\" Bai Bufan yawned as he said.\n\"There’s toast on the table you can eat, I left it just for you.\" Lin Li said.\nChen Yu Ying secretly glared at Lin Li, and said it wasn’t for Bai Bufan.\nMeh meh meh.\nThat was Lin Li’s response with his eyes.\n\"Not eating.\" Bai Bufan rejected at light speed.\n\"Then don’t.\" Lin Li was indifferent.\n\"Then I’ll eat.\" Bai Bufan quickly grabbed a slice and stuffed it into his mouth, hmm, definitely not poisoned.\nLin Li charged forward with a hand chop, shouting: \"Before Bao Wei died, he left me a pouch saying he observed Bufan has a rebellious streak at the back of his head, will surely rebel, must be dealt with first to cut the root of trouble, seems he was right.\"\n\"He didn’t even invite me to the feast when he died, true inhumanity.\" Bai Bufan ran around the homestay with toast in his mouth.\n\"How’s my outfit? Press 1 if it’s good, gouge your eyes out if it’s not.\" Ding Sihan stomped down the stairs, asking Lin Li in the middle of the chase.\nBlack cropped pants paired with a white chiffon top, tucked into the pants, the high-waisted design highlighting leg proportions, seems Ding Sihan knows how to show her strengths.\nYet Lin Li stopped the chase, sat on the floor, took a deep breath, gritted his teeth: \"Eyes, I’m sorry!!\"\n\"No need, dude! No need! Just press 1!\" Bai Bufan came up to block Lin Li at this moment, eyes tearing up.\n\"No, it’s got to be the eyes!\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nHehe.\nThese two guys really deserve it.\n\"Lin Li, you’re really something.\" Ding Sihan praised.\nLin Li ceased his act, cautiously watching Ding Sihan.\n\"Even though you have a mental illness, most of the time you can behave like a normal person, you’ve done well.\" Ding Sihan continued.\nLin Li was no longer cautious, nodding appreciatively: \"It’s all thanks to Bufan’s good teaching.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nThe few people who just woke up, considering the time wasn’t exactly early, all made the same choice as Bai Bufan earlier, none planning to have breakfast, opting instead for some snacks, planning to have brunch later.\n\"Just teaching cycling? So dull and boring to teach this.\" After Chen Yu Ying went upstairs, Ding Sihan transformed into a gossiper and asked Lin Li what they were doing outside. After getting an answer, she replied uninterestedly.\n\"What do you think I went out to do?\" Lin Li sneered.\nBefore Ding Sihan could answer, Bai Bufan inexplicably blurted out: \"When I grow up, I will become a gardener, working hard to nurture.\"\nThis was a bit too suggestive, so Bai Bufan didn’t get the jelly he wanted, instead, Lin Li gave him a big slap as a reminder.\nChen Yu Ying came down the stairs again, having changed back into a dress, although now it was a medium-length white dress with gray polka dots, not the same as yesterday’s.\nLin Li: \"1111.\"\n\"What’s going on? What are you 1-ing about?\" Chen Yu Ying asked in confusion after hearing Lin Li.\nDing Sihan glared at Lin Li with a black line across her face: \"Now you know how to press 1?\"\nUsing the sword of the previous dynasty to praise the officials of the current one, huh?\nLin Li heard, looked at Ding Sihan, said nothing, and started gouging his own eyes out.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nSilence speaks louder than words.\nThis time it was Lin Li’s turn to be chased by Ding Sihan.\nAnyway, they planned to visit the beach at Shanting, so ultimately they decided to have lunch a bit further away.\nAfter leaving the homestay, the three noticed the electric scooter at the door.\n\"This is my ride, so you just need to call a car, send me the address, I’ll ride there directly. Bufan, if you want to sit behind me, that’s fine too, I’ve checked, Shanting allows passengers as long as everyone has helmets.\"\nLin Li said coolly.\n\"Where’d you get this?\" Bai Bufan asked in surprise, touching the scooter, then sincerely asked Lin Li: \"I’m planning to get an electric scooter soon too, so can I ask where you usually keep it and the keys?\"\n\"Are you buying it? You’re just stealing, and you think you qualify to buy a scooter? You’re a bottom-tier scum in society, go spend a buck to ride a kiddie ride and ask what daddy’s daddy’s name is.\"\nLin Li sneered.\nAs for Lin Li, usually he preferred driving Rolls Royces and Bentleys, when going out with friends it was Porsche, and when taking girls it was Ferrari, but, well, he loved joking now.\n\"I’ll remember this sneer, Lin Li, when my true identity is revealed, you’ll bow and apologize to me.\"\nHaving been insulted, Bai Bufan did the classic crooked-mouth Dragon King covering his cheek after a slap gesture, speaking word by word.\nLin Li suddenly laughed:\n\"Identity reveal? Outside 10,000 people shout in unison: ’Let the God of War come forth!’, mother-in-law shocked: ’Who is the God of War?’, and at this time, you, the good-for-nothing son-in-law in their eyes, Bai Bufan, stood up, walked out under the astonished gazes of everyone.\"\n\"Yes, yes, exactly that feeling.\" Bai Bufan agreed, giving a thumbs up.\n\"Not done yet, just as you walk outside, at that moment, the 10,001 people shout in unison: ’Let the God of War come forth!’\"\n\"Crap! So I’m just the dog under the master’s command after all?\" Bai Bufan burst into laughter first.\n\"I’ll ride your backseat, even if I take the co-driver’s seat, it’ll still be awkward with just them left.\" Bai Bufan whispered.\n\"Alright, here are the keys for you, I’ll go ride with them.\" Lin Li immediately patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder, gratified.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Can you act like a human being?\"\n\"Better to ride.\" Lin Li knew what mattered.\n\"Screw you.\"\nHowever, although Lin Li had a sharp tongue, he was honest at heart, but Bruce would be breaking the law by driving, so it ended up with Lin Li taking Bai Bufan to the lunch spot.\n\"Lin Li, do you think our lives are like grilled sausages, lying around long-term, flipping occasionally, high in fat, prone to bursting under pressure, not very healthy, cheap, complex in composition?\" Passing a sausage stand, Bai Bufan asked.\n\"Wrong.\" Lin Li, riding the electric scooter, shook his head.\n\"Explain what’s wrong?\"\n\"It’s only you, not me. My life is shiningly bright right now, so don’t ask me, a Warrior of Light, such dark questions.\" Lin Li smiled brightly.\nThere’s even a pretty lady asking me to watch the sunrise.\nSo bright.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Crap.\"\n\"But, speaking of Warrior of Light makes me mad, there was this guy named Dagu, darn it, he borrowed my light, I didn’t know better as a kid, too naive, lent it out, and led to a life of darkness later on.\"\nBai Bufan sighed at this, the more he thought, the angrier he got:\n\"And that’s not all, another guy named Kakarot, took my energy too, great, adding insult to injury, my life utterly ruined.\nThese villains tricking kids are really horrible, rotten to the core.\"\nLin Li slightly decelerated, leaned closer to Bai Bufan for a sniff, then nodded:\n\"Indeed, you have the scent of discounted rolled egg fried rice with free trendy Chinese packaging material, black disposable liquid spoons, an unnamed boxed drink, plus a 0.01 yuan grilled sausage from following a shop.\"\n\"Damn, your words are so hurtful, especially since they’re all true, I want to jump off.\"\n\"Let me speed up, ensure your jump leads to death.\" Lin Li twisted the handle, the scooter picking up speed instantly.\nBai Bufan immediately clutched Lin Li’s waist, face full of fear.\n\"Slow down, damn it.\"\n\"When really letting you die, you’re unwilling.\" Lin Li laughed.\nDespite low driving experience, high Mecha index resulted in great skills, Lin Li slowed right away.\nSafety first, it’s the skilled swimmers who drown.\nFacing Lin Li’s sneer, Bai Bufan stayed silent, suddenly reaching forward to hold Lin Li tightly.\nDumbfounded, Lin Li: \"...\"\n\"Hmm~~ Big brother, if your girlfriend knew how close we were, wouldn’t she be angry, brother?\" Bai Bufan pressed his cheek against Lin Li’s back.\nThis final \"mua\" was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\nFear transferred to Lin Li’s face.",

      "content": "Chapter 241: Chapter 200: You Simply Don’t Understand the Joy\nIn order to prevent further panic and confusion, the two signed the \"Lin Bai Mutual Non-Aggression Pact\" on the electric scooter. The signing of this treaty marked the formal establishment of a good diplomatic relationship between Lin and Bai.\nThis demonstrated the harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.\nThis was not only a small step for Lin Li, but a giant leap backward for humanity.\nAfter arriving at the restaurant they had agreed upon that afternoon at the inn, the girls had already arrived and secured a table.\n...\nA predictable meal.\nThe girls already had their fill, leaving Lin Li and Bai Bufan to clean up the leftovers.\nTypically at a group meal, at the start: \"I want this, I want that,\" and everyone happily orders their food.\nBy the end: \"You ordered this, you finish it,\" and everyone frantically passes the buck.\nBut these three girls skipped the latter part altogether, only concerned with the killing but not the burial, treating Lin Li and Bai Bufan like Zhou Baowei.\nHowever, since the day’s schedule was leisurely, they weren’t in a hurry and could eat slowly.\n\"Bufan, eat more cucumber; cucumber can improve memory.\"\nAfter eating a bite of tasteless salad, Lin Li couldn’t understand why anyone would like such a thing. He picked out the cucumber and placed it on Bai Bufan’s plate, saying so.\nLin Li likes only one type of salad:\nAs everyone knows, salad means vegetables plus fruits.\nPotatoes are vegetables, and tomatoes are fruits.\nTherefore, fries + ketchup = salad.\nThis formula Lin Li learned from Zhou Baowei.\n\"You can’t fool me just because I didn’t study much. Who told you that cucumber can improve memory?\"\nBai Bufan, also full, tossed the cucumber back and questioned.\n\"It’s true, ten years ago I stuffed a cucumber into my deskmate’s butt, and now ten years later, he forgot everything from first grade except this incident, which he remembers vividly without forgetting a single detail.\nHe even told me he’d never forget this for the rest of his life.\nSee the effect? His memory improved dramatically.\"\nLin Li leaned in and whispered, providing an example to support his theory.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nYou damn...\n\"This way of enhancing memory is a bit off, wouldn’t you say! The way you put it makes it even harder for me to eat a cucumber... damn, I’ve come to realize, ’Lin Li’s deskmate’ is truly a hazardous occupation, a consumable, really.\"\nBai Bufan angrily flipped Lin Li the bird, then sighed sorrowfully:\n\"But you mentioning this reminds me of Baowei’s illness, I wonder when it will be cured.\"\n\"Oh, what illness, please tell?\" Lin Li inquired.\nIn fact, Lin Li knew better than anyone that whatever Bai Bufan uttered next would definitely not be humane, but at this moment, it took a saint not to ask. Playing along, Lin Li was willing to cater.\n\"He has a fear of bulls, every time I enter his rectum, he screams in fear, too embarrassed to see a doctor, I’m truly worried for him, not knowing what to do, alas.\" Bai Bufan sighed mournfully.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nHe was mentally prepared, but still not enough.\n\"The role of ’Bufan’s roommate’ might be a bit more dangerous than being ’Lin Li’s desk mate’, right?\" Lin Li heartfeltly reflected.\nThe two exchanged a look, realizing the similarly hazardous nature of their respective roles, and both grinned with relief.\n\"What are you two laughing at? Such perversion?\" Across the table, Ding Sihan put down her phone, looked at the two exchanging flirtatious glances and grinning lewdly, shivered, and said.\n\"Naturally, it’s the kind of content unsuited for children that sleazy men talk about from below.\"\nLin Li aimed to be honest.\n\"Sir, I noticed your cup is empty. Would you like another drink?\" The waitress, patrolling the store, noticed Lin Li’s glass was empty and approached to ask.\n\"Why would I want two empty cups?\" Lin Li asked puzzledly.\nWaitress: \"Eh?\"\nThe waitress.exe failed to respond.\n\"Eh... So, so, if you don’t need another drink, is there anything else I can help with?\" The waitress forcibly rebooted and politely inquired again.\n\"Can you help me pay the bill then?\" Lin Li sincerely asked.\nThe waitress.exe gave up running and logged out.\nBai Bufan felt that the waitress’s tray might hit Lin Li’s face at any moment, while trying to steer clear, yet eagerly anticipating the scene to unfold.\nDo it, do it, I want to see a river of blood.\n\"Alright, stop acting crazy in a public place, let’s settle the bill after we’re done.\"\nChen Yu Ying, her lips adorned with enticingly shiny gloss, cast an amused yet helpless glare at Lin Li, most certainly on purpose, and stood up.\nThe two had indeed eaten to their limits.\nAfter all, not everyone is Zhou Baowei.\nAt the counter.\n\"Our store is currently hosting a lottery event in collaboration with the zoo. Just by spending, you can enter for free, and your spending amount qualifies you for five entries. Why not give it a try?\"\nAfter scanning to pay, the staff pointed at the draw drum on the counter and said.\nIf it’s free, might as well give it a shot.\nLin Li was the first to step up, turned the drum, and after a while, a bead rolled out. When the staff saw the bead’s color, they congratulated, \"Congratulations, you’ve won the first prize.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nLin Li was slightly surprised.\nDo I really have such fortune?\nCould it be that I’ve exhausted my luck in such odd instances, which is why I keep failing infinitely when drawing \"random quality spirit stones\"?\nThis is not something that can be compensated for.\n\"What’s the first prize?\" But for now, Lin Li decided to enjoy his good fortune and asked.",

Wow, the winning rate is indeed high.\nSomething’s not right.\nLin Li squinted at the receptionist, \"Hey, can I ask what kind of prizes are in the pool?\"\nThe receptionist laughed heartily, \"From high to low, there are super grand prizes, special prizes, and other prizes in the pool.\"\nLin Li: \"What exactly are the other prizes?\"\nThe receptionist chuckled, \"First prize.\"\nLin Li: \"What about the second and third prizes?\"\nThe receptionist giggled softly, \"There aren’t any.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nFelt relieved.\nTurns out the luck wasn’t misused, it was just consistently effective.\nThe person running this store’s event is also a genius.\nLin Li suddenly thought of NASA.\nRumor has it that NASA initially labeled astronauts’ urination tubes as small, medium, and large. Whenever asked, astronauts would always choose large, often resulting in leaks and causing NASA headaches.\nSo NASA changed the labels to large, extra-large, and gigantic.\nThe problem was then resolved.\nIs the store owner from NASA? They certainly know how to comfort customers.\nNo wonder the first prize was just a half-price opportunity; it’s totally understandable now.\n\"Congratulations, you’ve won a special prize, a free ticket. You can exchange this coupon for a ticket at the zoo’s box office. However, during holidays like now, you’d need to call ahead to inquire if it can be used, but there shouldn’t be any issues,\"\nThe three first-prize winners turned their heads to look at Chen Yu Ying, who had won the special prize.\nIt was Qu Wanqiu’s turn.\nWhen that golden little ball rolled out of the drum, Lin Li, Bai Bufan, and Ding Sihan realized that people’s joys and sorrows are not connected.\nThe king of luck had been found.\nHowever, the receptionist explained, the so-called super grand prize was also free tickets, but just two of them, under the same conditions.\n\"So now we have three free tickets and three half-price tickets? Just get one full-price adult ticket for 30 yuan, and we can all go in? What’s the verdict, should we go?\"\nAs the five of them walked out with the coupons, Qu Wanqiu, the king of luck, asked.\nShe was already searching for videos of this zoo on her phone.\n\"We should call and check if we can use them first. We can ask when we get home tonight.\nIf they’re usable, we can check it out, but don’t expect too much from this zoo. It’s still having promotions during National Day, and we haven’t heard of it before, so it’s probably a small-town zoo. The chances of seeing rare animals are slim, but playing around wouldn’t hurt,\"\nLin Li analyzed after hearing the suggestion.\nThe group thought it made sense and decided to hold onto the coupons and decide later.\nLeaving the store, as per tradition, they all went to buy beverages.\nGirls are like this, they say they’re full, but they have a separate stomach for milk tea and coffee.\nRemembering the diluted coffee from the previous night, the five headed towards the nearest Luckin Coffee.\nIt wasn’t far, so Lin Li’s electric bike was left parked in front of the original store.\n\"Bufan, if you see an empty water bottle on the street, are you going to be an unsung hero or become a legendary soccer player?\"\nSeeing an empty bottle not far away, Lin Li turned to ask Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan waved his hand dismissively.\n— Let’s revise the knowledge point: Bai Bufan waving his hand isn’t a refusal, it’s more like ’no further words needed’.\nThose who watched the children’s channel’s ’Public Morality Contest, starting today’ series public service ads as kids are probably seventy or eighty by now.\nBai Bufan and Lin Li had never seen it, and they didn’t care much for public morals or deeds, so kicking was thoroughly enjoyable.\n\"I’m a legend!\" Bai Bufan exclaimed in shock after a kick actually sent the bottle into the trash can.\n\"Dumb luck,\" Lin Li scoffed.\n\"This was all calculated by me.\"\n\"Pft, just a fluke.\"\n\"Why don’t you try a fluke?\"\n\"Night City has no living legends!\" Lin Li, feeling a bit bitter and anxious, was ready to ’kill’.\n\"What do you all want to drink? Let’s order together?\" Ding Sihan turned around, interrupting the impending carnage.\n\"I don’t drink soy milk,\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"Lin Li, the place in front of you is Luckin Coffee, not Yonghe King. I asked what kind of coffee you want,\" Ding Sihan replied with an eye roll.\n\"Coffee is like soy milk too,\" Lin Li innocently said and asked back, \"Isn’t that right?\"\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"Cof—\"\nDing Sihan wanted to refute, but as soon as she opened her mouth, she found she couldn’t counter it.\n\"You’re something else.\"\n\"I’m not a big fan, I’ll stop by Mixue Bingcheng to get a fruit tea,\" Lin Li pointed towards the nearby shop.\n\"Alright, we have some time to wait here anyway,\" Ding Sihan nodded.\n\"I’m craving freshly squeezed orange juice; I’ll join you,\" Chen Yu Ying checked the drink menu and made her decision.\nBai Bufan, being Lin Li’s sidekick, required no words.\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu stayed to wait for the coffee, while Lin Li headed across with Bai Bufan and Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Wow, Renaissance! Lin Li, look, someone’s started selling the hottest item from the 18th century again, and it’s so affordable,\" Bai Bufan suddenly pointed at a small shop across the street.",

Soap must sell for 5 yuan!\" Lin Li declared righteously.\nNow that made sense.\nBai Bufan laughed it off.\nChen Yu Ying smiled helplessly.\nIt’s everyone’s duty to protect good deeds.\n\"Watch out, you two.\" Lin Li suddenly reached out and grabbed Bai Bufan and Chen Yu Ying’s forearms.\nA car with no manners drove by quickly, splashing a puddle accumulated around the three of them, sending dirty water everywhere.\n\"This driver should really lose a mom.\"\nLin Li’s mouth was never clean, it’s a pity he hadn’t mastered many cultivation spells yet, otherwise he would definitely make the driver fly.\nHe then turned to look at Chen Yu Ying, who was protected behind him. Only then did he let go and asked, \"Class leader, did your little white dress get splashed?\"\n\"Nope.\" Chen Yu Ying looked down and checked, smiling as she shook her head.\n\"That’s good then.\"\nThen Lin Li turned to Bai Bufan, who was protected in front of him, and asked, \"Bufan, were your little black legs splashed?\"\n\"Haha.\"\n\"Hahaha.\"\n\"Hahahaha.\"\nLooking at the spots of mud on his calves, Bai Bufan laughed happily and sincerely.\n\"You even protected me to the front, what do you think?\" he said, word by word.\n\"So even you know I protected you, and still got hit, such bad luck.\" Lin Li sighed, taking a coin Bai Bufan had given him yesterday from his pocket and tossing it lightly onto Bai Bufan: \"Clean yourself up.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nCould this even bounce back like a boomerang?\nIn the realm of rascals, Bai Bufan was considered experienced and knowledgeable.\nPreviously, in the path of unruliness, he and Lin Li were at most like frogs at the bottom of a well looking at the moon, but today upon hearing this, he should now see Lin Li as a mayfly gazing at the vast sky.\n\"Whew——\"\nBai Bufan took a deep breath.\n\"Honestly, Sanqiao really should send me a banner on an official level, after all, I just prevented a murder.\" He said.\nLin Li laughed.\nWho’s killing who in this murder case?\nSo hard to guess.\n\"Alright now, we both got shorts on, easy to clean. I got splashed too, let’s just consider it a sacrifice for others.\" Lin Li took the tissue that Chen Yu Ying fetched from her bag and handed some to Bai Bufan, then started wiping his own dirty leg while saying:\n\"As for the comment about that idiot driver we just saw, the only one breathing in his family is probably the grave robbers under his old grave.\"\nBai Bufan nodded in agreement: \"Still, I’m a bit envious of him, at least when he takes a selfie, it’s a family photo. Convenient for New Year’s.\"\nThe two were already quite unruly and dirty, and after being splashed, the unnamed driver’s family would be in for some serious trouble.\nChen Yu Ying, standing at the side, was taken aback by what she heard. This was what they said with her around, she couldn’t imagine the crude language if she weren’t there.\nStill, looking at her little white dress, her steps became a bit lighter without knowing why.\nIn a corner where Lin Li didn’t notice at all.\nTask Six.\n[By physical contact and combination, let the girls feel pleasure]\nIts progress bar increased by quite a bit.",

You guys walk slowly this way, once I find a good spot, I’ll come back and report to you?\" Lin Li, hearing this, pointed at his electric scooter, and gestured to everyone.\n\"Sure.\" The girls had no objections.\nThey originally wanted to take photos, let alone push the scooter aside, this was most suitable.\nBringing Bai Bufan along, Lin Li began to drive along the coastal highway.\n\"This is pretty awesome!\"\nLin Li shouted.\nUnlike driving an electric scooter in the city, due to safety reasons, Lin Li’s driving speed in the city was never fast.\nBut now, because the highway was like a straight line, with little curvature and slope, one could see far, especially going downhill, it was an unrestrained view, no worry of a car popping out from anywhere, the speed could be completely maximized.\n\"Bufan, hold tight, I’m going to speed up.\" Lin Li took off his helmet and hung it at the front of the scooter, letting the wind blow his hair back, licked his lips, and turned his head to shout.\n\"OK!\" Bai Bufan responded loudly, immediately took out his phone, \"Hello, is this 110? There’s someone speeding here!\"\n\"You son of a—\" Lin Li laughed and cursed.\nWith Bai Bufan, you always have to be careful of ricochets every moment.\nLin Li began to accelerate.\nThe sound of the wind was already audible by his ear.\n\"Oh! Awesome!\" Bai Bufan grabbed Lin Li with one hand and raised his other hand high, feeling excited too.\nSometimes happiness is that simple.\nIt’s just sitting and driving.\nBut it’s also sincerely feeling happy.\n\"Lin Li, do you know what word can fly when read forwards and eat when read backwards?\" Bai Bufan suddenly asked.\n\"Bee of course.\" Lin Li answered instantly.\n\"That’s such a clichéd answer, wrong! The correct answer is a level eight gale!\" Bai Bufan gave the right answer.\n\"?\"\n\"You son of a—\" Lin Li was taken aback.\n\"But that’s really good stuff!\" Then he laughed heartily.\nThe gale swallowed into the stomach.\n\"We’re not going fast enough now, at most level seven, keep going, I want a level eight gale!\" Bai Bufan urged.\n\"Got it!\"\nAt this moment, what limited their speed wasn’t themselves, but the limits of the electric scooter.\n\"Bufan, you should comb your hair back in the future!\" Lin Li saw Bai Bufan’s face in the side mirror and laughed, praising, \"You look so much better with your hair back than down, you look a bit like that Yan fellow now.\"\n\"Peng Yuyan, right, how could you forget that,\" Bai Bufan was not keeping it together from the praise, sniffling from a cold would even bubble up snot, returning the compliment: \"You’re not bad either, I’ve heard Daniel Wu is called Xiaolin Li.\"\n\"No, no, how could I forget Peng Yuyan, you’re that, that—\" Lin Li honked, as if he suddenly remembered looked delighted: \"Oh, I just remembered, it’s Pi Yan! Yeah, your face now looks like Pi Yan!\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You’re such a—\" Bai Bufan couldn’t hold back.\nReally shouldn’t believe Lin Li.\n\"Didn’t we sign a ’Mutual Non-aggression Pact’? Don’t touch my butt with your filthy hands!\" Sensing Bai Bufan’s revenge methods afterwards, Lin Li laughed and cursed.\nWait.\nIn the rearview mirror, Lin Li saw and sensed a hand on each of his shoulders from Bai Bufan.\nBu Hao!\n\"Are those your two hands on my shoulder?\" Lin Li swallowed a mouthful of saliva, lowering the speed of the scooter, asked in a trembling voice.\n\"You are asking the obvious, naughty.\" Bai Bufan patted Lin Li’s shoulder and smiled, nodding.\n\"Then what’s bumping at my butt?\"\n\"It’s my corn sausage.\" Bai Bufan smiled, \"Lin Li, don’t know if you’re afraid of cows? Let me test it—\"\n\"You son of a—\" Lin Li braked hard, turning around.\nDamn, it really was \"Bai Bufan’s corn sausage.\"\n\"Could you not steal things out of other people’s pockets, I’m really grossed out by people like you with sticky fingers.\"\nLin Li angrily took back the \"Bai Bufan’s corn sausage\" that Bai Bufan took from his pocket, said resentfully yet disdainfully.\nBai Bufan, immune to oil and salt, apparently didn’t listen.\nWith such high-speed patrol, they quickly found a great viewing spot.\n\"Bufan, get off first, walk over and claim that spot, don’t come back later finding it occupied.\" Lin Li said.\n\"Alright.\"\nBai Bufan nodded, got off, and began to press down his wind-blown hair.\n\"I’m going back to get the girls.\"\n\"No problem.\"\n\"Bufan, don’t talk to strangers, don’t take things from strangers, if someone asks about your family, just say your dad Lin Li is nearby...\"\nBecause he was leaving Bai Bufan here alone, Lin Li began advising on safety issues.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYour damn.\nBai Bufan laughed with anger.\nIs this talent? Thinking hard, but not matching his casual words.\nLin Li really ought to work in a morgue.",

If you put it in an elementary school math textbook, it could become a small torturous puzzle.\nThe Team A and B, pool maintenance guy, and chicken-rabbit farmer are all things every kid who has attended elementary math class has to appreciate.\nLin Li cursed them plenty as a child.\nEspecially the pool janitor who was filling and draining the pool at the same time.\nThinking about this, Lin Li started inexplicably speeding up and slowing down, imagining someone observing him to solve math problems, now looking all puzzled, enjoying it.\nFrom afar, he saw three people walking hand in hand along the pedestrian path next to the road railing.\n\"Here’s a fun fact: If everyone in the world held hands around the equator, a lot of people would fall into the ocean and drown, so damn, holding hands is really dangerous.\" Seeing the three greet him, Lin Li waved back with a smile.\nThe three girls chose to ignore him.\n\"Ding Sihan, could you move out a bit, I can’t bump into you properly there.\" Lin Li scratched his head and got straight to the point.\n\"Get lost.\"\n\"Lin Li, your hair is flying up!\"\nAs Lin Li got closer, Chen Yu Ying pointed at his hair and laughed.\n\"I just spent 2800 on this custom hairstyle. Does it look cool? Stylish?\" Lin Li stopped his electric scooter and brushed his hands back across his head.\nThen he heard laughter.\n\"Your laughter is really hurtful.\"\n\"Our laughter is like the sun and two sixty-watt bulbs. You said it yourself, how can it be hurtful?\" Ding Sihan retorted.\n\"If you look straight at a sixty-watt bulb up close, you’d get hurt too.\" Lin Li was good at arguing.\nQu Wanqiu stopped laughing and seriously nodded: \"Stylish, your hubby-stylish.\"\nLin Li: \"What is this?\"\nThen he turned to look at Ding Sihan, loudly whispering while pointing at Lin Li: \"Sihan, your hubby.\"\n\"Bullshit, that’s your hubby!\"\n\"Your hubby!\"\n\"Your hubby!\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDammit.\n\"Two good friends, fighting over me, completely tearing each other apart, all because of my damn charm.\" But it’s okay, Lin Li could always find a way to solve these problems.\nQu Wanqiu and Ding Sihan immediately made up and seamlessly raised their middle fingers at Lin Li.\nSee, in matters of resolving conflicts, Lin Li was a master.\n\"Doesn’t look bad, just rare to see you completely showing your forehead, very novel.\" Chen Yu Ying laughed and said.\n\"As long as it’s not bad, it’s fine.\" Lin Li was indifferent.\n\"Did you find a good spot to watch the sunset?\" Chen Yu Ying asked.\n\"I’ve already found a great spot, it’s got seating, directly overlooking the sea, with an unobstructed view, I’ve marked it already.\" Lin Li replied.\n\"Where’s Bai Bufan?\"\nAt this moment, Qu Wanqiu noticed no one was following Lin Li, and asked.\n\"Oh, right, where did Bai Bufan go?\" Ding Sihan exclaimed.\n\"Hahaha—\" Lin Li suddenly started laughing.\nAfter laughing, Lin Li pointed at Ding Sihan: \"Ding Sihan, your slow reaction of ’Oh right’ was too funny, it shows how much you miss home. I bet if Bai Bufan were to die, it’d take you three years to realize.\"\n\"He’d be stinking after three years, I’d still be able to smell it.\" Ding Sihan chuckled embarrassedly.\n\"I must tell him what you said; it’ll be a gift for him.\" Lin Li felt pleased.\nThen he looked at Qu Wanqiu and explained: \"He’s just my marker at the spot, like my marking territory.\"\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nWhat kind of analogy is this.\n\"If marking territory is like peeing, then Lin Li, what creature are you?\" she asked.\n\"Bai Bufan.\" Lin Li replied instantly.\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nDamn this Lin Li, his mental health is too good, even such attacks mean nothing to him.\n\"How far away is it?\" Ding Sihan asked.\n\"Walking, it’s about twenty minutes? I didn’t calculate the distance precisely, but with an electric scooter at full speed, it takes less than four minutes for a one-way trip.\" Lin Li calculated and then patted the scooter’s head, eagerly saying, \"Is there any dumb bird that wants to get on the car for a ride first?\nI’m telling you, riding a fast electric scooter here with the wind in your face feels amazing. Not experiencing it would be a shame. Bai Bufan and I just thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.\"\n\"Not that kind of enjoyment! Look at me normally! Damn you fujoshi!\" Lin Li squinted at Ding Sihan whose expression seemed off.\n\"Really? Then I want to try.\" Retracting her playful gaze, Ding Sihan eagerly said, \"But don’t drop me at the destination, you’ll have to bring me back.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Otherwise if you take someone else on the next trip, Wanqiu would be left all alone having to walk for several minutes, wouldn’t she?\" Ding Sihan asked back, \"That’d be pitiful, as if she’d been abandoned.\"\nQu Wanqiu scratched her head: \"Why am I automatically assumed to be the lonely one left behind?\"\nAfter speaking, Qu Wanqiu looked over at Chen Yu Ying beside her, nodded: \"Oh, it’s me.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nChen Yu Ying suspected that Qu Wanqiu was talking to herself on purpose.\n\"Ding Sihan, when you get on the scooter, keep your distance from my back. It’s the middle of summer, and you’re like a little furnace,\" Lin Li said with a playful smile.\nUnfortunately, Lin Li wasn’t the third brother; in the third brother’s cavalcade motorcycle performance, one bike could easily carry ten people to their destination.\nBecause Lin Li rented an electric scooter that wasn’t for delivery, it didn’t have a rear box, so the seat space was quite large. Plus, Lin Li intentionally moved forward a bit, so Ding Sihan could easily maintain a comfortable distance.\nIn fact, being a bit closer didn’t matter. They were just riding an electric scooter, and with their personalities, they wouldn’t care at all.\n\"Ding Sihan, we’re about to take off. You can grab the tail fin behind you or my clothes. But let me warn you, my clothes are worth three thousand six. Don’t pull too hard. Lastly, if you need to hug me, that’s an extra charge.\"\nAfter sensing Ding Sihan settled in, Lin Li turned his head to remind her.\n\"Just drive your scooter. I remember hugging you once as a kid in the haunted house,\" Ding Sihan scoffed.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Horrifying memories are attacking me.\"\nThe taillight lit up, and the electric scooter zoomed forward, accompanied by Lin Li’s wild laughter and Ding Sihan’s screams.\n...\nAt the destination, seeing the two of them coming from the road behind, Bai Bufan waved to greet them.\nThe two rode past him.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nThe tires kicked up dust, swaggering and bold.\n...\n\"One more lap!\" Ding Sihan quickly felt the pure joy of it. When Lin Li stopped, she patted his back heavily while holding her phone recording the sea and commanded.\n\"Roger that.\"\nThey returned.\n\"The breeze indeed feels pleasant, and the videos of the sea are much more fun. You guys should try it.\"\nAfter Lin Li, with Ding Sihan, reunited with Chen Yu Ying and Qu Wanqiu, who had been walking, she recommended:\n\"It’s a pity it’s illegal to sit sideways on the back like on a bicycle. Otherwise, selfies could have been fun too.\"\n\"I can see that, your hair is all ruffled from the fun,\" Chen Yu Ying laughed as she stepped forward to straighten Ding Sihan’s hair.\n\"Thanks, Ying Bao.\"\n\"Why don’t you straighten mine?\" Lin Li turned his head to ask.\n\"Because yours is a custom look worth two thousand eight, I wouldn’t dare to touch it,\" Chen Yu Ying chuckled.\nLin Li laughed and gave a thumbs up.\nThe class president, under his influence, was becoming more like a normal person.\n\"Then I want to try it too,\" feeling intrigued by Ding Sihan’s description, Qu Wanqiu raised her hand, intending to get on the scooter.\n\"Twenty yuan per lap, additional services are extra,\" Lin Li immediately announced.\nQu Wanqiu removed her hairpin, crouched down to examine Lin Li’s wheels, and looked up to ask, \"Lin Li, how much is one tire?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nUnder Bai Bufan’s influence, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu were also becoming more like Bai Bufan.\n\"Do you still charge now?\"\n\"No charge, no charge, get on.\"\nAnother five minutes later, Lin Li returned with Qu Wanqiu.\n\"Did you see Bai Bufan’s expression just now? He called us, and we didn’t even acknowledge him. He was completely stunned.\"\n\"Is there a possibility that he’s already cursing at you in the group chat?\"\nQu Wanqiu dismounted with a smile, waving her phone, \"There’s a sixty-second voice message.\"\n\"He wouldn’t send that kind of message in the girls’ group,\" Lin Li, well aware of Bai Bufan’s habits, exposed the lie and then turned to Chen Yu Ying:\n\"Class monitor, aren’t you going to try?\"\n\"Sure.\" Chen Yu Ying, without much thought, sat on Lin Li’s back seat, \"Do I put my feet here? It won’t bother you, right?\"\n\"Wrong spot, Ying Bao; you should put it in his mouth,\" Qu Wanqiu, while brushing her hair with a small hairbrush she always carried, corrected.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Ah—\" Lin Li opened his mouth wide in the next second, even making a sound on purpose.\nThe four of them fell silent for a while.\nChen Yu Ying, with a headache and in despair, covered her face with both hands on the back seat, as if she was the one embarrassed.\n\"I can’t stand Lin Li, he’s so gross! Hahaha—\" Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu, overwhelmed by Lin Li’s outrageous ’ah,’ clutched their stomachs laughing and squatted on the ground.\nSo, you want to mess with me?\n\"Hehe, we all know who the gross one is, so stop lying to yourself,\" Lin Li sneered, looking at Qu Wanqiu.\n\"...\"\nWait.\nWhy are the three of them all looking at me?",

      "content": "Chapter 246: Chapter 203: \"Joy, Joy.\n\"Am I the one fooling myself, unaware?\" Lin Li scratched his head.\nThe three people’s gazes seemed to be there to tell him the answer.\nWell, not seemed, they outright nodded, affirming that it’s the truth.\nSo that’s how it is.\nLin Li chuckled.\n\"Exactly, class rep, these protrusions on the sides are where you place your feet.\" A good man doesn’t argue with women, Lin Li said with a smile, bending over to point out the footrests on the scooter, then realized something, eagerly: \"Class rep, have you never ridden on an electric scooter before?\"\n\"Indeed.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nHer family owns many vehicles, both petrol and electric cars, but no electric scooters.\nShe normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to ride one.\n\"Then I got the first ride!\" Lin Li laughed wickedly.\nChen Yu Ying made a fist with her right hand and gently punched Lin Li’s back: \"Don’t talk nonsense.\"\n\"Let’s go.\"\n\"Okay.\" Chen Yu Ying grabbed both sides of Lin Li’s clothes with two fingers and nodded.\nThe scooter started up and began accelerating.\nThe top-tier electric scooter speeds up to ten kilometers in just two seconds.\n\"You can tell me if you’d like to go faster or slower.\" Lin Li straightened his back to give Chen Yu Ying more space behind him, slightly turning his head to add.\nThen he looked ahead and continued driving, clearly in a good mood, with his body slightly swaying.\nFeeling the wind is, after all, a pleasurable thing.\n\"Alright.\" Chen Yu Ying replied softly.\nAgainst the gentle sea breeze, her hair flew freely in the wind, as scattered rays of sunlight peeked through the clouds, embracing them without summer’s heat, just the right temperature.\nThe sound of the wheels rustling over the ground, combined with the waves crashing and the wind’s whimper, composed a unique symphony.\nWatching the vast ocean while feeling the breeze’s gentle caress, the mood was exceedingly joyful.\nChen Yu Ying had always been in a good mood, but now it was even better.\nMurakami Haruki said looking at the sea for long makes you want to see people, and seeing people too much makes you want to see the sea.\nWhat if you see both a beautiful sea and interesting people?\nPerhaps you’d want to laugh.\nSo Chen Yu Ying laughed.\n\"Even faster, Lin Li.\" Maybe it could be even more fun, so she said, the laughter rich enough that the roaring wind couldn’t blow it away.\n\"Alright! Vroom vroom vroom!\" Clearly an electric scooter, yet Lin Li insisted on imitating the roar of a motorcycle and transformed into a Le Di: \"All systems activated activated activated activated! And—this!\"\nQuite amusing.\nSo the wind increased, and the laughter deepened.\nPassing by Bai Bufan three times without entering, this time Bai Bufan habitually raised a middle finger, without shouting or waving.\nLin Li couldn’t believe what kind of mess his private messages would be.\nThere might indeed be a sixty-second voice message.\n\"I want to go even faster.\" said Chen Yu Ying from behind.\n\"We’re already at the limit, class rep.\" Lin Li said, making eye contact with Chen Yu Ying through the rearview mirror, smiling as he patted the electric scooter.\nThe ’Poop Suppression Talisman’ electric scooter wouldn’t allow it; otherwise, I would push it to break the limit, maybe even rename the ’Poop Suppression Talisman.’\n\"Oh, oh, then just stay like this.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, not too disappointed.\n\"Class rep, but I have another plan, care to try driving it yourself?\" Lin Li slightly slowed down, intrigued, \"Driving from the front is different from sitting in the back.\"\n\"But I don’t know how.\" Chen Yu Ying hesitated, then responded.\n\"Electric scooters are even simpler than bicycles because starting only requires you to twist the handlebar.\" Lin Li ensured there were no cars around, then slowed to a stop, stepped off, held the electric scooter, and pointed at the handlebar, explaining.\nDriving an electric scooter is no different from riding a bicycle; if you manage a bicycle, ’learning’ the scooter shouldn’t take more than a minute.\nThis kind of introduction accelerated the task’s progress.\n\"You can try twisting it a little.\" Lin Li enticed.\nHearing this, Chen Yu Ying curiously reached out, experimented with twisting a little, then immediately released as soon as she felt a forward motion, causing almost no movement.\nA bit novel, but Chen Yu Ying still shook her head: \"This, I’m a little scared.\"\n\"What’s there to be afraid of? If anything, I and the others on the road should be scared.\" Lin Li reassured.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nShe stared at Lin Li.\nThat statement seemed both right and very wrong.\n\"Class rep, don’t worry, I’ll be right beside you, let’s just avoid the main roads.\" Lin Li encouraged.\nJust now, Chen Yu Ying’s twisting caused a noticeable fluctuation on the task progress bar.\nSpeaking of which, when did this delightful task six increase so much?\nNo recollection, strange.\n\"But if the speed increased, you wouldn’t be able to keep up.\" Chen Yu Ying remained concerned; the speed here was entirely different from bicycles.\nThe worry is understandable, especially since learning the bike today.\nLin Li didn’t push further; having introduced the idea, he could let Chen Yu Ying try again later, naturally progressing.\n\"Then I have another plan, class rep, if you’re worried I can’t keep up, you could take me along. I could sit behind you, my arms are long, if anything happens, I could take over control, plus my legs are long, surely able to steady the scooter and prevent it from tipping.\"\nLin Li joked while extending his arm to show potential error handling.\n\"Okay.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nThe sea breeze softly blew, carrying the word to Lin Li’s ears.\n\"Eh?\"\nThe smile on Lin Li’s face seemed to be paused.\n\"Class rep, what did you just say?\" Unsure, Lin Li asked.\n\"I want to try it like that.\"\nChen Yu Ying didn’t look at Lin Li, but at the scooter, gently caressing the handlebar with her hand, eyes filled with anticipation.\n\"The way I just proposed?\" Lin Li asked again.\n\"Mm!\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, her voice becoming stronger.\nShe scooted her position forward with effort, almost sitting only on the tip of the seat. Her back straightened up, and she patted the spot behind her: \"This should be enough, right? Lin Li, come on up, my safety is in your hands!\"\nChen Yu Ying’s voice was filled with excitement as she looked ahead, showing undisguised anticipation.\nWas she really looking forward to such an interesting event?\nLin Li recalled their conversation during lunch, licking his lips with his tongue. Since she needed it, he had no reason to hesitate. So he nodded, \"I’ll give it a try first.\"\nLin Li swung a leg over and sat on the rear seat of the bike.\nHis arms were naturally long, and with Chen Yu Ying sitting so far forward, when Lin Li leaned to the right, he could easily maintain a few centimeters’ gap between their bodies while reaching out to grab the right brake.\n——The right brake controls the front wheel, the main braking component.\nIf both hands reached forward to hold the handlebars, the distance between the two of them would inevitably decrease again.\nJust the right side was enough, avoiding any excessive intimacy, and his left hand could conveniently hold onto the bike’s tail to stabilize himself.\n\"Theoretically, it should work,\" Lin Li concluded.\n\"Okay, I’m starting now, Lin Li.\" Chen Yu Ying extended her hands, trying to turn the handlebars. After getting used to it, she took a deep breath and spoke.\n\"Alright, start slow at first, you can go faster once you get used to it.\"\nHearing this, Lin Li placed his right hand back on the right handle, his feet hovering, ready to touch the ground anytime.\nThe space on the handlebar was only so big.\nEven though Lin Li tried to only grip the outer part, his thumb inevitably touched the back of Chen Yu Ying’s hand.\nCool and refreshing, very comfortable.\nThe handlebars twisted.\nThe e-bike darted forward.\nIt drove steadily, keeping a straight line without any panic or accidents, showing no signs of tipping over.\n\"Whoa——\"\nLin Li could hear Chen Yu Ying’s surprised and excited little cheer.\nFor no reason, he felt a bit happy too.\n\"See, I told you it’s easy, no need to be scared.\" Lin Li smiled and praised.\n\"I’ll speed up a bit more.\" Chen Yu Ying was eager to try.\n\"Alright.\"\nThe girl’s silky dark hair began to flutter with the acceleration, brushing and patting against Lin Li’s left cheek.\nTicklish.\nA pleasant fragrance, carried by the wind blowing against them, lingered all around Lin Li.\nThe e-bike still rode steadily, without any issues.\n\"You’re amazing, class rep,\" Lin Li loudly praised from the back, \"No problem at all. Can I let go and fully enjoy the thrill of being a passenger now?\"\nBeing a passenger felt indeed different from being the driver, it seemed the passenger might enjoy it a bit more.\n\"No,\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head, \"because now it’s a straight road and there’s no one around. If there were people, I’d definitely panic again.\"\n\"That makes sense too.\" Lin Li nodded, recalling that Chen Yu Ying indeed panicked earlier when there were people ahead, so he didn’t take his hand back.\nChen Yu Ying pursed her lips, gazing at the wide view, listening to the howling wind.\nBeing a driver felt indeed different from being a passenger, she thought it seemed being the driver might be more enjoyable.\nHer palms were slightly damp, she was indeed a little nervous.\nThe back of her right hand seemed a bit moist too.\nWas it Lin Li’s hand sweat?\nWas he nervous too?\nThe sound of breathing and heartbeats seemed unusually clear, the sound of the wind couldn’t cover them.\nYet unlike nervousness, Chen Yu Ying couldn’t distinguish whether it was hers or Lin Li’s.\n\"Lin Li, have you never been given a ride on an e-bike by a girl before?\" Chen Yu Ying suddenly asked.\n\"My mom has given me rides many times.\" Lin Li quickly replied.\n\"...\" Chen Yu Ying shot Lin Li an annoyed look through the right mirror and then rephrased her question:\n\"Lin Li, have you never been given a ride on an e-bike by a girl your age?\"\n\"That would be true.\"\n\"Then I’m taking your first time for that!\"\n\"Hahaha——\"\nLin Li laughed joyfully.\nTo think he would hear such words from the class rep’s mouth?\nWith a clenched fist in his left hand, he lightly tapped the girl’s butterfly wing bone, imitating her tone: \"Don’t say weird things, class rep.\"\nJust like before, the conversation was exactly the same, and their smiles were thick.\nThe howling wind found itself unable to blow their laughter away.\n\"Class rep, go faster!\" Lin Li snapped his fingers with his left hand, but due to inexperience, it made hardly any sound.\n\"Okay~\"\nThe handlebars were twisted to the limit.\nThe e-bike, carrying both, sped along the coastal highway.\n\"Splash, splash.\"\nThe waves crashed against the rocks, perhaps smashing a few black rocks into pieces, sending them into the boundless ocean.\n\"Thump, thump.\"\nThe heart pumped blood, perhaps waking up a few lively little deer, embarking on an unhesitant journey.\nLet them crash, let them crash.\n[Task Two: Share and teach Chen Yu Ying your Mecha driving insights, enriching her knowledge and improving her driving skills.]\n[Task Two completed.]\n[Task Six: Through physical contact and connection, let the girls experience delight.]\n[Task Six completed.]",

      "content": "Chapter 247: Chapter 204: Ant pincers are ant pincers, now is now\nLoaded with joy, the electric scooter sped along the beach.\nThe tension gradually faded, but the sweaty palms remained.\nJust as Chen Yu Ying said, when vehicles appeared on the road in the distance, especially when approaching head-on, even if they were far away and safe, she still felt a bit flustered.\nSeeing the vehicle starting to wobble, confirming that there were no cars following behind and that stopping would be safe, Lin Li immediately pressed the brake, causing the vehicle to stop sharply. He then stabilized it with his feet, stopping steadily.\nDue to inertia, his body lurched forward uncontrollably, but Lin Li grabbed the scooter’s rear tail with his left hand, keeping his stance stable.\nOnly the right shoulder briefly touched Chen Yu Ying’s shoulder for a few moments.\nNot sure what shampoo she’s using, but it smells so good and feels so smooth.\nWay better than Bai Bufan’s Ba Wang. I should interview the girls another day to see what shampoo they use.\nWith such thoughts, watching the vehicle pass by after exactly five seconds, Lin Li said jokingly, \"Class rep, you’re being a bit too cautious.\"\n\"My life is very important, you know.\" Chen Yu Ying stuck her tongue out lightly and said.\nLin Li waited for a second, hearing nothing, and blinked: \"Cough, cough, didn’t someone get left out?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"I feel like someone’s knee is pressing against my neck, I can’t breathe! I’ll start the Lin’s Life Matters movement.\" Lin Li was upset.\n\"Bleh-bleh~~\" Sticking her tongue out again, Chen Yu Ying retracted her hands, lightly wiping them on her shirt, got off the scooter sideway, and said to Lin Li, \"You take over driving, I’ve experienced enough.\nAlthough it was indeed great fun, encountering cars is quite scary; let me get more skilled before I try driving again.\"\n\"Sounds good, looking forward ’til then!\" Lin Li nodded with a smile, withdrew his right hand which had already turned warm from the earlier chill, and wiped it on his shirt.\nLin Li scooted forward, returning to sit in front, and honked the horn:\n\"Lin Li Express, restart! Let’s get some amazing fries at the dock!\"\nAs Chen Yu Ying got on, Lin Li twisted the handlebar and continued on.\nChen Yu Ying held onto Lin Li’s clothes with both hands, gazing at the sparkling sea in the distance.\n...\nWhen they returned to the spot chosen for sunset viewing, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu were already there, and Bai Bufan was standing stiffly at the edge of the rocky coast.\nSeeing Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying return, he sighed in relief as if rescued.\nThe two exchanged glances, Bai Bufan smiled, and Lin Li smiled back.\nJust when Lin Li was about to decelerate and park, he looked straightforward, accelerated anew, passing by without stopping.\n\"Keep sitting there like a prisoner\" — that was probably the look in Lin Li’s eyes.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Get your ass back here!\" Bai Bufan couldn’t hold it anymore and shouted.\nLin Li was naturally just joking, parked the scooter where it was visible by turning back and wouldn’t impede normal road traffic, then he and Chen Yu Ying got off and joined the three.\nSomeone’s phone was already playing music, and Qu Wanqiu and Ding Sihan were searching through some marine life remnants nearby.\nLin Li sat down beside them.\nOnly then did he check the system.\nDid he just complete two tasks at once?\nBecause his mind wasn’t on the system earlier, Lin Li hadn’t noticed at all.\nIt made sense to complete Task Two since Chen Yu Ying was getting more proficient at riding the scooter. But how was Task Six completed?\nDid Chen Yu Ying’s thrill and joy from driving count as his own?\nTurns out there was no need for tickling or massages.\nBoth tasks were asking if he wanted to use the \"Random Reward Doubling Card (2/3).\"\nTask Six’s reward was lackluster, with no doubling value, so Lin Li only doubled Task Two.\n[You have received the reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha Synchronization Index +10; Random Ability*1; System Currency*300.]\n[You have received the reward: Physical Improvement: Mecha Synchronization Index +10; Random Talent; System Currency*50.]\nIt’s like hitting the jackpot, the original prize of only 150 system currency doubled.\nAs soon as the 350 system currency was credited, Lin Li’s balance instantly rose to 540, which he hadn’t felt so affluent for a long time.\n[Random Quality Spirit Stone: 20 System Currency (Limit 1 per day)]\n[Fortune Charm: 150 System Currency (Limit 1 per day)]\n[Energy Crystal: 50 System Currency (Limit 1 per day)]\n[Unlock Refreshable Item Slot 4, Requires a Total Acquisition of 2100 System Currency. (1800/2100)]\n[Unlock Refreshable Item Slot 5, Requires a Total Acquisition of 2800 System Currency. (1800/2800)]\nAt the same time, acquiring these 350 system currencies allowed Lin Li’s total accumulated system currency to surpass 1500, unlocking the third item slot.\n[Energy Crystal: For use with any mecha, attach it and it will be automatically absorbed, restoring 50~100% of operational energy within three seconds depending on mecha quality.]\nAlthough unsure if there’ll be a chance to use it, buying one to let it collect dust in the [Warehouse] might be a good idea.\nCan always stock another one later, Lin Lin’s[Warehouse]rarely has just one item.\nLin Li had once refreshed B++ armor, one issue was being unsure if there was a way to charge mechas with modern devices, and now with this crystal, the problem could be solved.\nAlso, it should be able to charge real-life ’mechas’ too, like the scooter behind.\nBut Lin Li won’t test it, too wasteful.\n[You have acquired the talent: Cooking.]\nIs it really this talent? Came a little late, if it had arrived earlier, he might have wowed everyone with his cooking skills, instantly completing the praise task.\nNo wait, if he had gotten it earlier, who knows if the task would still activate.\n[You have acquired the active ability: Wind Control]\n[Wind Control: After use, for ten minutes, you will have the ability to control wind according to your current strength and abilities, can manipulate surrounding winds and airflows, or expend additional stamina to generate winds and airflows.\nAccumulates one use every eight hours, with a maximum of 3 uses stored.]\nSounds like a really cool ability.\nBut Lin Li didn’t have too high expectations. After all, the effectiveness of abilities depends on one’s own strength. The last ability with this description was [Healing], and to this day it can only slightly alleviate symptoms, just letting the pain fly away.\nThere are also two \"ability amplifiers\" in the [Warehouse], but there’s no need to use them right now.\nChecked the sunset schedule. The sunset time today on Shanting side is around 5:22 PM, which is about an hour and a half from now.\nThe girls are taking photos, and Lin Li doesn’t plan to join in. He gets up and walks over to Bai Bufan.\nHe’s skipping stones, not with stones, but with those bigger shells. In a way, it’s like returning the soup to the original flavor.\n\"Want to compete a bit?\" Upon hearing footsteps, Bai Bufan turned back and provocatively said.\n\"I can’t compare to you. In your past fifteen years, you’ve achieved nothing, your entire life is like skipping stones. In this field, you’re at the national top athlete level. Who can compete with you?\"\nLin Li shook his head, becoming a timid battle lizard.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nEven though the opponent surrendered, this groove-loving guy sure knows how to hurt with words.\n\"I’m devastated.\" Bai Bufan had to say.\n\"The past is the past, now is now—\" Lin Li made a grand gesture with his ant’s pincers, then apologetically comforted, \"Gold will shine eventually, I believe in you, buddy.\"\n\"You son of a... \"\nKinda touching—if he didn’t call him buddy.\nSometimes Bai Bufan envies cats because they can slap what they dislike or don’t understand without hesitation, but he can’t just slap Lin Li anytime.\nAfter all, he can’t win in a fight.\nBai Bufan squatted down, did his best to lift a heavy stone, and headed for the sea.\n\"He understands, he understands, I can’t live on! So he turns and heads into the sea!\" Seeing someone wanting to cosplay Qu Yuan, Lin Li not only didn’t save him but also set a BGM from the side, \"From now on, October 4th will commemorate Bai Bufan throwing himself in the river. If someone casts a spell, the target must be Bai Bufan!\nI’ll demonstrate first!\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nWhat a nutcase.\nBai Bufan walked to the seashore, but he forgot about jumping into the sea. He tried hard to throw the big stone into the sea, and with a dull splash, it made quite a splash.\nGetting splashed himself, Bai Bufan didn’t mind. He was quite amused.\nLin Li followed Bai Bufan’s side and threw a flat stone sideways.\nIt skipped three times on the water.\nBai Bufan sneered in contempt, casually picking up a stone from the ground, and it drew an arc on the water. Since the latter skips were too dense, it was hard to count, but there must have been over a dozen.\nThere’s something special, no wonder he dared to provoke him. Lin Li sneered, the fighting spirit surged within him.\nHe carefully picked a flat stone with a perfect arc. This was a treasure, and Bai Bufan was a bit envious he hadn’t picked it himself.\nPositioned himself, aimed, powered up, Lin Li gave it his all, and stumbled.\n\"Splash.\"\nThe treasure was wasted.\n\"Not fun, I’m going home,\" Lin Li fumed.\n\"Lin Li, I rarely take the subway, after all, crowded, crowded, you know what that means, right?\" Bai Bufan cheerfully asked Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Lin Li, you know what it means when smoke goes in and out?\"\nLin Li already covered his ears.\n\"It’s lung fog, buddy!\"\nNearby, Bai Bufan casually picked up another stone, and easily skipped over a dozen times, laughing heartily.\n\"Oh, Lin Li, too bad my album is full, can’t take any more photos for now.\"\nLin Li couldn’t take it anymore.\nOctober 4th next year must commemorate Bai Bufan—his own opinion doesn’t matter, let’s commemorate first and talk later.\n...\n\"What are you guys doing?\" Ding Sihan stepped on the pebbles and walked over to them curiously asked.\nHalf an hour passed, the girls have finished taking satisfactory photos, and these two guys were still frolicking by the sea, with laughter occasionally ringing out.\nSometimes including Bai Bufan’s screams.\nOut of her passion for animal protection, Ding Sihan decided to come and gather intelligence.\n\"See that plastic bag? We’re competing to see who can throw stones onto it without them falling into the sea.\" Lin Li pointed at a floating plastic bag in the distance and explained.\n\"Just that?\" Ding Sihan asked, puzzled.\n\"Yeah, come on, it’s super fun, seriously.\"\nLin Li nodded and tossed a small pebble at it, hitting on top but then sliding off, causing him to pat his thigh in frustration.\nBai Bufan followed right after him.\nLet’s just say Ding Sihan didn’t understand, guys most of the time aren’t picky, just getting stones to splash into the water is quite fun.\nOf course, sometimes they are very picky, like when looking for materials on small websites, sometimes browsing over seventy pages and not stopping until they find acceptable spell-casting material, preferring to do nothing while stark naked rather than compromise.\n\"Doesn’t feel like throwing stones is fun.\" Ding Sihan threw a few stones herself, then shook her head.\n\"How about trying to aim at Lin Li’s head?\" Bai Bufan suggested upon hearing this, genuinely hoping everyone could understand the fun of throwing stones.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nDing Sihan: \"!\"\n\"Just the thought of it sounds fun!\"\nSeeing the world from a different species’ perspective might genuinely reveal many new things. Inspired Ding Sihan began to bend down, searching for stones that could be fatal.\nNot lethal with this, let’s find another one.\n\"Just thinking about it makes me not want to think about it anymore.\"\nIt can only be said that individual joys and sorrows are not connected, Lin Li took the lead and left.",

      "content": "Chapter 248: Chapter 205: Love Brothers, Love Gold? Brothers Made of Gold!\nIt’s already past five.\nThe sunset hangs low on the western curtain, peeking through the gaps between two clouds, dyeing the sky red.\nThe five people returned to their viewing spots, waiting for the sunset to arrive.\nQu Wanqiu’s phone rang at this moment, breaking the silence.\nShe glanced down; it was a number marked by multiple people as a harassing call.\nJust as she was about to hang up, Lin Li took the phone, smiling and gesturing, \"Let me handle this.\"\nLooks like he’s about to pull a prank.\nLin Li turned on the speakerphone and answered.\n\"Hello, sorry to disturb you. Can I ask if you are interested in buying a house recently? We have a new development that’s on sale.\" Seems like a property seller.\n\"Sure, I’m just looking for a house,\" Lin Li nodded, expressing interest.\n\"Oh, really? Sir, do you have a purchase need?\" The person on the other end sounded excited, \"Then specifically—\"\n\"No, I’m looking for a place to jump.\"\n\"...Eh?\"\n\"I’m very upset because my girlfriend found out she’s been cheated on by her best friend. She’s been crying all morning, and I don’t know how to comfort her, so I’m helping her find a building to jump off.\"\n\"...Ah?\"\n\"Right, after that, the house prices should drop. Do you want to short-sell the developers with me? You provide insider information, I provide the girlfriend, we become big and strong, and create glory again!\" Lin Li continued without pause.\n\"Beep—Beep—\"\nThe call ended.\nEveryone laughed, and Lin Li felt a bit regretful that he couldn’t finish his words.\nBai Bufan suddenly spoke with some doubt, \"Wait a minute? The girlfriend got cheated on? Wouldn’t that mean you, Lin Li, are the one cheating! You’re quite clean-cut with your words!\"\nThe girls reacted and amusingly stared at Lin Li.\n\"Ying Bao, if you found out your boyfriend cheated, what would you do?\" Ding Sihan chuckled, turning to ask Chen Yu Ying.\n\"...I would turn a blind eye.\" Chen Yu Ying thought for a while before speaking.\nThen, amidst the surprised looks of everyone, she smiled somewhat shyly, \"Otherwise, the bullet might miss.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nHe thought the class president was the type to secretly cry when finding out her husband cheated, swallowing the bitterness like a Japanese Yamato Nadeshiko.\n\"So it’s for aiming.\" Lin Li scratched his head, feeling like 5.56 grew in his brain, itchy. No, single-eye aiming, should be a Magnum.\n\"Class president, you’ve really corrupted Bai Bufan, Ding Sihan, Qu Wanqiu now. You all use such twists.\" But Lin Li acknowledged.\nBai Bufan pointed with his left hand at Lin Li, who was to his right, looking disgruntled.\nLin Li’s ability to deflect blame is innate, just like girls have the inherent ability to love.\n\"So Lin Li, would you cheat if you got into a relationship?\" Ding Sihan asked again.\n\"I wouldn’t, but I could learn.\"\nAccording to online information, answering like this best showcases emotional intelligence.\nDespised.\nNo more abstractions, this time for real, truly considered a fool.\n\"Cheating... I guess I’ll never cheat in my life. Damn, cheating requires two people to like me simultaneously. This condition is too strict, where to find such two blind people.\" Lin Li laughed.\nThe disdain remained unchanged, the girls collectively sighed.\nBai Bufan widened his eyes, pointing at Lin Li and then at himself, \"If finding you means blind, then what’s finding me?\"\n\"Sorry, I feel a bit uncomfortable now. I’ll go jump off a building, you ask them.\" Lin Li suddenly gagged, looking pained, walking towards the sea while ’loudly whispering’, \"What karma from the past life is this, hope no one gets hurt.\"\n\"Damn!!! Lin Li, stand still! Jump off a building, huh! If you want to jump, you better hurry up!\" Bai Bufan got up and chased after him.\nThe two tried to kill each other.\nHopscotch is truly a magical thing.\nAs a kid, someone jumps hopscotch when upset, grown-up someone jumps hopscotch when upset too.\nAs a child, jumping hopscotch leads to growing up, as an adult, jumping hopscotch leads to shrinking.\nIt’s all just the difference between the xy-axis and z-axis.\nHopscotch, quite magical, right?\nAmidst the joyful noise, the sunset fades in the west.\nClouds stacked layer upon layer, the sunset spilling through the gaps, golden threads woven among them, sprinkling on the sea, gleaming, waves gently lapping at the rocks, producing a soft sound, playing a quiet melody for the sunset.\nSome dishes can be eaten by phone first, but certain sceneries are best viewed by the eyes; rather than recording in a phone, it’s better to remember in the mind.\nNo one bothered to take out their phones.\nWhen the sun was completely engulfed by the sea, albeit the afterglow hadn’t entirely faded, not far away, occasionally a few non-seagull sea birds were hovering low, their silhouettes were fleeting in the afterglow, adding a touch of brilliance to this tranquil scene.\nThe sea breeze gently blew, carrying the ocean’s unique aroma, softly brushing against the face, making one feel extremely comfortable.\nUntil the street lamps behind lit up, everyone snapped out of this pleasantness.\n\"How about we find another chance to watch the sunrise? Over at Shanting, seems like there’s a mountain great for watching the sunrise,\" Chen Yu Ying suggested.\n\"I don’t mind.\" Lin Li replied indifferently.\nIf climbing a mountain is solely about reaching the summit, it wouldn’t be that interesting.\nBut if your climbing buddies include a Wise One who understands wild plants and animals, a dog easily distracted by the surroundings, and girls with nice hips and legs who are willing to walk faster than you.\nLin Li felt he could climb a hundred mountains, a hundred!\nThe current setup is completely satisfying, rounding off.\nHowever, the other three people blinked, maintained a second-long silence, and then nodded, \"Sure.\"\nSeeing this, Chen Yu Ying somehow found it amusing.\n\"I was just saying, I can’t wake up early anyway.\"\nChen Yu Ying could guarantee that if they insisted, everyone would probably go.\nBut let it be, she would rather let them sleep peacefully.\nChen Yu Ying’s mood wasn’t affected by this at all, if anything, she seemed even happier.\n\"Shall we find a place for dinner?\" Lin Li got up and stretched, asking.\n\"Sure, we’ve already chosen the place just now, it’s this one, we posted it in the group earlier, just check.\" Ding Sihan also got up and dusted off.\n\"Gogogo!\"\nThe girls went to a suitable spot for catching a cab, while Lin Li and Bai Bufan rode electric bikes to the location.\n\"Speed up, speed up, speed up!\" Bai Bufan urged after getting on.\n\"Got it, got it, got it!\"\nBut after only half a minute, the electric bike gradually came to a stop.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Bai Bufan patted Lin Li’s shoulder, asking in dissatisfaction.\nLin Li turned his head, revealing a calm and serene smile like a Wise One.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nBu Hao!\n\"I’ve been speeding too much this afternoon, and the faster the electric bike goes, the quicker it drains the battery, so now it’s out of power.\" Lin Li said.\nMost electric bike battery indicators show the ’charge’ based on the current speed. For instance, while riding at ten kilometers per hour, it might still show four full bars, but increase the speed a bit and it quickly drops to one bar, very deceptive.\nPlus, Lin Li was unfamiliar with this electric bike and didn’t notice the battery was depleting.\nNow it stopped with only a single deceptive bar remaining.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"I still have a bit left in my power bank, about 1000mAh, would that work?\" Bai Bufan pulled out his power bank, looking ready to sacrifice for the greater good.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Bufan, how long have you been experiencing these symptoms? Don’t your parents consider having another child? Otherwise, your family can’t pass on the eunuch tradition.\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan with concern and said.\n\"You bastard.\" Bai Bufan laughed and cursed, then jumped off the bike as well, holding the back of his head and asked, \"So what do we do now?\"\n\"I’ll check the nearest location where we can change batteries... It’s one kilometer direct, and two kilometers by route, let’s push it there.\" Lin Li shrugged after looking at his phone for a while.\nThis type of bike can go to a swap station and change batteries directly, and the rental shop has no issues with it.\nAs for testing the \"charging crystal\" here, it’s too wasteful, Lin Li didn’t even consider it.\n\"Ah ah ah, regrets for not getting in the car with everyone! Lin Li, you useless thing!\"\nBai Bufan went to the back of the bike, grabbed the tail with one hand to push it forward, and raised his middle finger at Lin Li with the other hand, disdainfully saying, \"Can’t you save some battery?\"\n\"You wouldn’t be happy if you got in the car anyway.\" Lin Li laughed, then turned back to ask, \"If I drove slow this afternoon, there wouldn’t be no power left, plenty would be remaining by now, but Bufan, I’ll ask you one thing, if time were to rewind and you knew driving fast would run out of power, would you still drive like this afternoon?\"\n\"Of course, have to drive like that!\" Bai Bufan replied without hesitation.\nThough he complained, he certainly didn’t regret.\nSome memories are more precious than anything.\nThere’re always one or two winds in the world that fill my dreams.\nIt’s just pushing a bike.\nThe wind that swiftly passed by the feet of youth is more precious than Gold.\nOf course, if someone was really willing to use Gold, Lin Li wouldn’t mind letting them catch the wind under his feet.\n\"Wait a minute, ding! You and I just said ’drive’, didn’t we?\"\nBai Bufan suddenly realized the word he said and laughed, looking at Lin Li.\nAnd Lin Li looked back.\nWhen both had their mouths turned up, Bai Bufan:\n\"Streamer, streamer, your electric bike is really strong, but it eats too much power, are there other simple yet powerful transportation tools you recommend?\"\n\"Yes brother, yes, this powerful transportation tool is definitely not alone. There are nine in total, all current version level T0.5 strong transportation tools!\"\nAfter the dialogue with the AI ends, they laughed loudly under the streetlight.\n\"Speed up, speed up, speed up!\" Lin Li held the electric bike and started to accelerate, still muttering with a voice, \"Feiyangyang, put some effort, Pleasant Goat is out of energy!\"\n\"Feiyangyang received, Meiyangyang hold on!\"\nBai Bufan made gorilla-like sounds, bending forward to push the bike hard.\n\"Oo oo oo!!\"\nThe wind of youth blew past them.",

Cooperative!\nYouthfulness is precious, but going crazy after pushing for half an hour is quite stressful.\nIn front of the battery swapping station, Bai Bufan pressed his fist against his waist, gasping for breath.\nBai Bufan was worn out.\nLin Li was scanning codes and making payments at the station.\nLuckily, they had lunch until after two, so no one would be starved; the girls decided to wait until the two joined them before eating.\n\"Are you having kidney issues? Worn out like this.\" Lin Li, retrieving the fully charged battery and starting to replace it, looked at Bai Bufan and teased with a smile.\n\"How dare you besmirch someone’s innocence, you impudent brat!\" Bai Bufan widened his eyes.\n\"I can cure you,\" Lin Li said succinctly.\n\"Bufan wandered half a life without meeting a worthy lord; if you don’t forsake me, I wish to be your adopted son.\"\n\"Judging by your ailment, traditional medicine is ineffective; you need two cups of pesticide for immediate results.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nWhat do you mean traditional medicine can’t cure it and now you want to use pesticide? Such a quack!\n\"Your mom was a maid, hence you were born a thief mouse!\"\n\"Bounce back.\"\nAfter replacing the battery, indicating for Bai Bufan to get in the car, Lin Li started and said, \"Bufan, you really need to exercise, otherwise next time you’ll be the only one outpaced by the girls in the fitness test.\"\n\"Girls chasing me? Really looking forward to that.\" Bai Bufan pretended to be aroused from behind.\n\"You’re hopeless,\" Lin Li joked with a laugh.\n\"You have no idea; the only person who’s told me ’Bufan, please don’t leave’ in my life is the PE teacher during the fitness test.\" Bai Bufan said with misery.\n\"Have you ever had the most intense activity in bed be a midnight calf cramp?\" Lin Li asked, \"And when you’re at your most beastly in bed, do you sleep for over a dozen hours like a koala?\"\nBai Bufan: \"...Lin Li, I really need a truckload of bread people to deal with you.\"\nBut then Bai Bufan realized, punching Lin Li’s back, \"Don’t act like you’ve experienced other bedroom activities.\"\n\"Haha, the most intense bed activity I’ve done this life is realizing after lights off the blanket was upside down and spinning it with feet to find the long and short sides.\"\n\"...You really know life,\" Bai Bufan conceded.\nQuickly and accurately distinguishing the blanket’s long and short sides, there should be a special class for that; it’s too hard, especially when waking up fuzzy in the middle of the night.\nIt’s like a USB drive, can’t plug it in the right way, nor the wrong way, but then one reattempt, and it goes in.\nArriving at the destination.\n\"This place is nice.\" Lin Li said upon entering and seeing the three girls seated inside.\n\"You know it’s nice before eating?\" Ding Sihan laughed and asked.\n\"Yeah, the spot is great, set up four machine guns, and you can control the whole street.\" Lin Li marveled.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"Are you also Su Yu?\" Chen Yu Ying, knowing the reference, laughed and said.\nMaybe it was Lin Li’s jinx; this place’s taste was average, far from expectations.\nAfter dinner, they didn’t go exploring around Shanting; there were plenty of unexplored areas in the guesthouse, so they decided to go back first.\nDing Sihan originally wanted everyone to go to the cinema to watch a new movie.\nThen, after seeing the National Day slot, she voluntarily admitted she was joking.\nThe quality of movies has really been declining, both domestically and internationally.\nEspecially internationally, keep messing around with your damn political correctness.\nReturning to the guesthouse.\n\"I’ve asked about the tickets for Shanting Zoo; we can use them tomorrow. Do you want to go?\" Qu Wanqiu, just off the phone, asked everyone.\n\"I’ve seen visitor notes and videos; Shanting Zoo isn’t large and doesn’t have many rare animals, but it’s also not bad. You can interact with some animals; there’s some complaining about the high ticket price, but we’re getting in for free, so it’s cool to go and play.\" Ding Sihan, who was watching short videos of tourists complaining about the zoo, raised her head and said.\nChecking poor reviews is way more informative than positive ones.\n\"Then let’s go play, since it’s not big, we don’t have to wake up early like for an amusement park. You all can wake up naturally, and we’ll head there in the afternoon,\" Lin Li suggested.\nEveryone else had no objections, thus the decision was made.\n\"Continue playing board games?\" Ding Sihan looked at Lin Li, though mainly at Lin Li’s feet.\n\"Foot fetish is so gross,\" Lin Li shivered, waving his hand vigorously, \"Not playing, unless it’s Three Kingdoms Kill.\"\nUnfortunately, the girls were totally uninterested, especially after seeing the essay-length character skills.\nThey said they would give this lousy game a bad review.\nThat’s for life.\nThere’s a mahjong table in the guesthouse, and we planned to play a bit. But mahjong, counties aside, every town might have their own rules.\nThis kid Bai Bufan plays bishoujo mahjong—the kind that has clothes explosion when winning.\nQu Wanqiu is a total newbie to mahjong, so she teamed up with Ding Sihan.\nEveryone chose the simplest Hangzhou mahjong.\n\"This Swiss Bank card here has 1.5 billion dollars; tonight, I’m all in,\" Lin Li said arrogantly while the mahjong machine shuffled cards, tossing a card to the table.\n\"I hate when you mix English in your words, it’s really pretentious,\" Bai Bufan scoffed.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSometimes you really just want to ban this hero Bai Bufan.\n\"But,\" Bai Bufan nonchalantly tossed a card on the table as well, \"You think only you have money? Here, I have 1.5 billion dollars in the rural credit cooperative, I’ll follow!\"",

Cooperative!_2\nLin Li: \"?\"\nInitially, there was a moment of silence, followed by Ding Sihan’s uncontrollable laughter, which completely set everyone off, and they all started laughing. Lin Li pounded the mahjong table: \"Hahaha, damn, seriously, Bai Bufan, why the hell do you have money in a rural credit cooperative?\"\nVery impressive, but somehow not that impressive.\nLin Li finally understood why wealthy people choose to keep their money in those foreign banks that sound more prestigious.\nWhen you have your money in a rural credit cooperative, it’s a bit awkward when you need to pull out your card.\nChen Yu Ying patted Lin Li’s hand that was sneaking a peek at the tiles, suppressing a laugh and sighing: \"Lin Li, your little hands are really not that clean.\"\nDamn it.\nHer sneaky moves during the chaos were discovered again. How does the class monitor have such good vision? Why can she always catch her cheating instantly?\n\"Because I’m not like you, worshiping everything foreign. I trust rural credit cooperatives; they’re the best!\" Bai Bufan endorsed the rural credit cooperative.\nLin Li pressed his thumb against his chin, his body trembling with laughter; every time Bai Bufan repeated it, he wanted to laugh again.\nHowever, he nodded, acknowledging: \"You’ve convinced me. After today’s game, I’ll withdraw my money from the Swiss Bank and deposit it all into a rural credit cooperative.\"\n\"There’s hope for you yet.\" Bai Bufan was delighted; Lin Li suspected this guy might get a commission.\nBut then Lin Li realized he overthought it.\nBecause after the game, he lost all fifteen billion dollars.\nDamn, were these people cheating?\nOr is it the legendary beginner’s protection period? How come Qu Wanqiu, a complete newbie, can go out so quickly?\nGood news, his starting hand was almost a Tenpai, bad news, they’re not playing Japanese mahjong, so it’s all a waste.\nWhere’s the overwhelming storm of hellish tiles? Someone save me.\nLost only in dollars, the girls naturally didn’t acknowledge it because they no longer needed to be bound by tasks, and the punishment was different from yesterday. Lin Li’s face got covered with turtle drawings.\nBai Bufan saw this and quietly told Lin Li that now he had two similar heads.\nBut they’re not human heads.\nAfter they got tired of playing mahjong, it was still not too late, so they planned to each take a shower first and then watch a movie or show in the guesthouse’s home theater.\nLin Li let Bai Bufan shower first and went back to his room to let the \"Substitute Jade-faced Buddha\" absorb his excess energy and stamina.\nWhen Bai Bufan returned to the room after wiping his hair, he looked at Lin Li with a face full of resentment: \"It’s all your fault, I just went and took a huge dump.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Because every time I think of you, I have to go again,\" Bai Bufan explained to Lin Li.\n\"Damn you, get out.\"\nNot to be rude, but some guys, really, if they used their skills to flirt with girls instead of their buddies, their lives might have restarted long ago.\n\"I don’t mind that you’re a guy, why do you mind that I’m a guy?\" Bai Bufan, upon reaching this conclusion, got mad.\n\"Don’t mess with me, bro.\" Lin Li raised his middle finger.\n\"Then mess with me, bro,\" Bai Bufan always had a way, he could be flexible or firm, and could switch roles.\nLin Li: \"...Damn.\"\nBai Bufan: \"Right now?\"\n\"Your mom—\"\nEveryone knows that every beating Bai Bufan receives is never undeserved.\nWhen Lin Li finished showering and got dressed to go to the home theater, only Bai Bufan was there.\nThe home theater had soft sofas, recliners, and even massage chairs.\nGirls take longer with bathing and skincare, and they’re probably coming down together.\nWhen Lin Li entered, Bai Bufan was scratching the chandelier above, and when he realized what he was doing and saw Lin Li, his expression changed drastically:\n\"I was just itchy!\"\n\"How lonely are you, reaching for the chandelier—damn.\"\nCaught in advance, Lin Li sulked, slapping his own hand, as if he had reacted too late.\n\"Lin Li, why do you think there’s such a big hole up there in the ceiling?\" Bai Bufan continued looking at the chandelier, pointing to an area curiously asking.\n\"To prevent kids from accidentally swallowing it, that can be a breathing hole for the kid who swallows it.\" Lin Li’s answer was delivered instantly.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn you.\nAny kid who could accidentally swallow a chandelier nearly a meter in diameter must be a young Bo Gang.\n\"Mixing up formulas, zero points.\"\nLin Li turned on the set-top box and started checking what was available in the home theater.\n\"What are we watching later?\" Bai Bufan stopped studying the chandelier and went over to ask.\n\"Most likely a horror movie, watching horror movies together is an essential part of a team bonding event.\" Lin Li had silently tuned into the horror channel.\n\"I’m a bit sleepy; I might need to sleep first.\" Bai Bufan wanted to leave but Lin Li held him back.\n\"It’s not like you’re watching it alone, and when sleeping, you have your dad, me, next to you, what are you afraid of.\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"Lin Li, when my only support is you, I’d rather have none at all.\" Bai Bufan said to Lin Li, filled with emotion.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDamn, this bastard’s words are a bit hurtful.\n\"Also, once I’ve watched it, I can’t forget it for a while. What if it comes to mind when I get home? I’m alone in my room.\" Bai Bufan frowned.\n\"Honestly, put yourself in the shoes of the ghost who has been sleeping under your bed; I think the one more scared should be him, right?\" Lin Li described the poor ghost to Bai Bufan:\n\"Every time he sees your disgusting feet, he laments, ’Oh crap, that ghost who keeps jerking off on my rooftop all day is back; I won’t sleep well tonight again.’ \"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Your comforting is great, don’t do it next time, I still think we should watch something classic instead?\"\n\"’Shanghai Fortress’?\"\n\"What kind of classic is that!\"\n\"There are many movies considered bad at first, but later people discover they’re classics.\n’Shanghai Fortress’ is that kind of work; when it first launched, people found it bad; over time, they discovered it’s a classic bad movie.\nA notorious legacy is still a legacy, a classic bad movie is still a classic.\" Lin Li defended the fortress.\nThis, is this right?\n\"How about we watch a sci-fi movie? Lin Li, you know, in space, only then can you have boobs that don’t sag, that’s why I love sci-fi the most.\" Bai Bufan said sincerely.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThe artistic value of this sentence was so high, it fully expressed the crude romance of sci-fi.\n\"I also want to see boobs that don’t sag, but the girls probably won’t want to watch that.\" Lin Li said regretfully.\n\"Then let’s go for the horror movie.\" Given that, Bai Bufan had to pick the least smelly turd to eat from the pile.\nSure enough, when the girls joined them in the home theater, Lin Li asked, and the first answer was a horror movie.\nPerhaps because everyone was present, Chen Yu Ying didn’t object at all.\nThe voting rights must be exercised by humans, so it passed unanimously.\nBai Bufan shakily took out his phone and aimed it at the screen; Lin Li curiously glanced over, then couldn’t hold back.\nThis guy activated a Hello Kitty effect; everyone on his phone looked cute, and Bai Bufan even added bunny ears for them.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhat a genius.\nIt certainly made those characters look good, let them understand the consequences of scaring Bai Bufan.\nBut Bai Bufan didn’t consider one thing, when a face suddenly appears, the effect doesn’t react in time.\nWatching Bai Bufan hide in his arms and Chen Yu Ying snuggle into Ding Sihan, Lin Li scratched his head.\nThis isn’t right.",

Noticing him awake, she gave a small wave and smiled.\nLin Li glared at Qu Wanqiu, feeling frustrated.\nAfter responding, Lin Li turned his head to see that Bai Bufan had fallen asleep too.\nEven though it was difficult, Lin Li managed to get up without waking Bai Bufan.\nHe managed to get up without waking Bai Bufan.\nWhen he got to the bathroom, he happened to see Ding Sihan coming out from inside — typically, no one comes to the third floor just to use the bathroom.\n\"You’re awake.\" Ding Sihan greeted, and Lin Li nodded.\nAfter finishing in the bathroom, Lin Li saw Ding Sihan rummaging through snacks in the living room.\n\"Hungry?\" Lin Li asked while drying his hands with a tissue.\n\"Yeah, the restaurant tonight wasn’t good, so I didn’t eat much. The snacks aren’t satisfying either. Lin Li, do you want anything? I’m thinking about ordering some take-out.\"\nDing Sihan nodded and, after rummaging through the snacks on the table for a while, asked.\n\"Not for me, I’ve brushed my teeth.\" Lin Li wasn’t really hungry, so he declined.\n\"Alright.\" Ding Sihan didn’t insist.\n\"Wait, don’t order just yet!\" Lin Li suddenly called over.\n\"Ah?\" Ding Sihan jumped, \"What’s wrong, do you want something? What do you feel like eating, I haven’t decided yet.\"\n\"Ordering take-out isn’t healthy. Ding Sihan, let me make you a late-night snack.\" Lin Li said sincerely.\nHe had just remembered that for the genuine compliment task, if \"4\" requires one from each friend, he hadn’t received one from Ding Sihan yet.\nAnd now that he had gained the skill of \"cooking\", with Ding Sihan being quite hungry, it might be a good chance to earn that compliment.\nUpon hearing this, Ding Sihan swallowed a gulp of saliva.\nBut it wasn’t out of hunger, it was out of fear—\n\"Take-out at most makes me a little sick, but you would be the death of me, Lin Li, I don’t deserve this, do I?\" Ding Sihan exclaimed in horror.\nBitter memories were already resurfacing in his mind.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHow hurtful.\nBut he couldn’t blame Ding Sihan, after all, he had a record, so Lin Li simply replied sincerely, \"Xiaodingding, a gentleman changes every three days, you mustn’t look at me with the same eyes as before.\"\n\"But you also have to wait two more days, it hasn’t even been the first three days yet.\" Ding Sihan quickly shook his head.\n\"Trust me this once. The reason I messed up so badly yesterday was mainly to avoid upstaging Little Qiuqiu. It was intentional. I actually have some expertise in cooking,\" Lin Li argued logically.\nSeeing Ding Sihan still didn’t believe him, Lin Li continued to persuade:\n\"Look, you can watch me how I make the late-night snack later, and then you’ll know. If you think it’s inedible or not tasty, then don’t eat it.\"\n\"...Alright then.\" Ding Sihan hesitantly nodded.\nThe ingredients in the guesthouse were not lacking, and there were still quite a few leftovers from yesterday in the refrigerator.\n\"What are you doing?\" Seeing Lin Li close the fridge door carefully, even sticking his head on it, Ding Sihan asked curiously.\n\"Oh oh, sorry, I got caught up in observing the refrigerator light experiment again by accident.\" Lin Li scratched his head and said.\nAs a kid, discovering that the fridge light turned off when the door was pressed made him feel like a physics genius.\nDarn it, Lin Li suddenly remembered how Wu Min promised him a fridge as a birthday gift when he was a kid, and he was thrilled for a long time, feeling so happy.\nHe decided he’d also get his kids a 4090 in the future.\nAfter checking the ingredients, Lin Li took out his phone.\n\"Now what are you up to?\" Ding Sihan, watching him from the side, asked puzzled.\n\"Checking what dishes I can make with these ingredients, and how to make them.\" Lin Li answered honestly.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nDing Sihan turned and walked away, \"I’m ordering take-out!\"\nTurns out this guy was learning on the spot!\nStill want to die on your own!\n\"No, no, no! That’s not the issue!\" Lin Li quickly stopped Ding Sihan.\nThe talent gives technique and knowledge, while also directly bestowing proficiency to the body. Lin Li can now toss and stir-fry, knows how to distinguish and handle spices and ingredients... But indeed, knows nothing about recipes.\nLater, I should open up [Strong Memory] and memorize some recipes as a knowledge reserve. Checking each time really makes it hard for others to believe I can cook.\nAfter finding the right recipes for these ingredients, Lin Li immediately started preparing.\n\"Knock knock knock.\"\nFirst, begin processing the ingredients.\nDing Sihan, who was initially looking helpless, widened her eyes.\nBecause Lin Li’s cutting was too skillful.\nThe knife and fingertips had almost no distance, it always felt like he’d cut his fingers at any second. But Lin Li maintained this distance and cut the ingredients extremely quickly and neatly.\nEven more skilled and confident than Qu Wanqiu.\nIf the knife at the guesthouse was sharper, it would be even faster.\nHeat the oil, Lin Li started cooking.\n\"You really know how to do this?\" Ding Sihan had to believe after seeing this scene.\nLin Li tilted his head, appearing a bit smug: \"Xiaoding, when have I ever lied to you?\"\n\"Like dozens of times just today.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nSeems like that’s the case.\n\"Your sunny side up eggs are so silky. Mine always fall apart, I can only scramble them,\" Ding Sihan commented.\n\"It’s simple, you have to use the chicken’s.\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Get lost!\"\n\"Quack quack quack, anyway, you understand now, yesterday I was just playing dumb for laughs, didn’t show my true skills at all. It’s smoky in here, go wait by the dining table.\"\nLin Li said with a grin, full of confidence, his actions composed.\n\"Fine, now I’m a bit expecting it.\" Confident Lin Li was indeed dazzling, Ding Sihan nodded.\nAfter hearing Ding Sihan’s footsteps fade away.\nLin Li was no longer composed, sneakily looking around, quickly picked up a pair of chopsticks, dipped them into the pot, picked up some ingredients, blew on them, and after they cooled a bit, stuffed them into his mouth.\n\"Hmm, still not right.\"\nDamn, those bastards who write recipes, \"appropriate amount\", \"suitable\", what the hell do you mean?\nDo you have no idea about the skill level of the people reading your recipes?\nCan’t you just give a specific measurement?\n...\n\"Ahaha chicken soup coming up.\" Lin Li came out holding three plates, placing them in front of Ding Sihan.\n\"Let this scrambled egg be your main dish, don’t worry, considering it’s eaten just like that, I kept it light, it won’t be salty.\"\nLooking at the dish that looked and smelled delightful, Ding Sihan found it hard to associate it with the person who turned food into charcoal yesterday.\nIt looked and smelled like it couldn’t possibly taste bad, and Ding Sihan was no longer afraid, picked up the chopsticks: \"Then I’ll eat it.\"\n\"Of course.\" Lin Li nodded and sat opposite.\nAfter a tentative bite, Ding Sihan’s eyes lit up: \"Delicious!\"\nGiving Lin Li a thumbs up, Ding Sihan started to devour the food.\nLin Li wasn’t in a hurry, waiting for Ding Sihan to almost finish, cleared his throat: \"After the meal, you should know what you ought to do for the chef.\"\nDing Sihan nodded, then left.\nCame back two minutes later.\nA one-yuan coin was tossed onto Lin Li, Ding Sihan’s voice cold: \"Clean up yourself.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Why is this one yuan back in my hands again! You didn’t wake up Bai Bufan just to give you this money, did you? And why clean up again! What do you people take me for!\" Lin Li broke down.\nSo an annoyed Lin Li, this time he took the money without wiping it on his face, just put it straight into his pocket.\n\"Hee hee.\" Ding Sihan chuckled first, then gave Lin Li a thumbs up: \"Alright, alright\nThanks Lin Li, the late-night snack you made was very satisfying, Wanqiu can only be the kitchen king, you’re truly the Ancient Greece’s god of cooking.\nTop chef, god among gods, extremely mighty chef god, sixth generation of chef god, overwhelmingly dominant chef god! Master of all chefs! The most chef god man in the world...\"\n[During this squad’s training, gained sincere recognition and praise from other squad members (3/4).]\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Were you mumbling nonsensical stuff just now, didn’t sneak some insults in, did you?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 252: Chapter 208: Lin Li Is a Rotten Crotch\nMission accomplished, Lin Li was very satisfied.\nActually, the dishes I made aren’t really \"chef-god\" level, not that exaggerated, probably just the level of an ordinary cook.\nAfter all, in the eyes of the system, it’s just a talent that doesn’t make it onto the [panel].\nAs for making some fancy dishes now, I’d just mess it up.\nPerhaps another reason is that Ding Sihan never expected much from Lin Li.\nAs the saying goes, if hope is great, hope will be great; so if hope is small, hope will be small.\nAnd Lin Li’s performance naturally easily exceeded Ding Sihan’s expectations.\nRounding off, Lin Li also played the role of a man of contradictions.\n\"Didn’t secretly insult you, isn’t it all open insults?\" Hearing Lin Li ask this, Ding Sihan spread out her hands, appearing somewhat innocent.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nUnashamedly saying that calling myself a chef-god was intentional.\nWait a minute.\nSystem, you tell your dam, which part is she sincerely? Hmm? Speak!\n\"I wish you could deny this in another direction.\" Then Lin Li raised a middle finger.\nBut since I took the money, I have to do the job, Lin Li began tidying up the dishes on the table.\nThis made Ding Sihan feel a bit embarrassed, immediately sitting on the sofa, opening a bottle of drink, sipping it, and cheering Lin Li on.\nOh dear.\nReally Bai Bufan, huh.\nLin Li always felt that one day, Bai Bufan would be nicknamed Xiaoding Sihan.\nForget it, I shouldn’t be so unconfident about Bai Bufan, in the dog racing track, he’s been reigning for ten thousand years, almost monopolizing, if the state doesn’t intervene, it’s not so easy to be surpassed by newcomers.\nHayek’s invisible hand really ought to give Bai Bufan a slap.\nAs for Ding Sihan’s attitude like a lord, Lin Li didn’t care at all, after all, he often attacked Ding Sihan without reason, ending up here, serves him right.\nThis matter, Lin Li would forget after ten years or so, not taking it to heart to find a chance for revenge.\n\"Ding Sihan, go ask the class monitor if she wants a late-night snack, there’s still some ingredients left, just tell me on the phone.\" Completing a small task put Lin Li in a good mood, not forgetting he still needed Chen Yu Ying’s approval, so he said.\n\"Okay.\" Ding Sihan nodded at this, walked towards the home theater room but suddenly turned around after two steps, squinting at Lin Li, questioning: \"Lin Li, have I become a poison-testing eunuch? Have I become Bai Bufan?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nHow did this association come about?\nOh, she thinks giving her a late-night snack is my practice.\nThis misunderstanding is too deep.\n\"Ah Ding ah, don’t you think the first time is precious? When I become the kind of person who cooks for anyone who pays, it’ll be even more precious, right? So, why mind these things, you’ve gained.\"\nLin Li continued cleaning the dishes, saying with a smile.\n\"Apologize to the profession of cooking! Serving for money doesn’t count as being rotten!\"\nDing Sihan widened her eyes upon hearing this, she couldn’t understand why the words deviated here.\n\"Isn’t cooking for money being rotten?\"\n\"...Got it.\"\nDing Sihan covered her face and walked away.\nHumming an unknown tune lightly, hearing a door open, Lin Li turned around to see Chen Yu Ying walking over.\n\"Why did the class monitor come out? Aren’t you continuing to watch the movie?\" Lin Li asked somewhat puzzled.\nAfter all, contacting me by phone would be fine, and it’s okay if I bring it in later to eat.\n\"Curious to see you can actually cook, so I came out to take a look.\" Chen Yu Ying walked up to Lin Li, smiled, and spoke.\nThis is much more interesting than the climax and ending of a movie.\n\"So, you want to eat?\" Lin Li inquired.\n\"Can you make just a little bit? It’s not the right time to eat, and I’m not that hungry.\" Chen Yu Ying put her hands behind her back and tilted her head slightly, asking.\n\"Either way, I’m already rotten, so whatever works.\" Lin Li nodded with a sloppy tone.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nAfter Lin Li explained a bit, Chen Yu Ying helplessly glanced at Lin Li.\nThis guy.\n\"You really can cook?\" When Lin Li really started to make the late-night snack, Chen Yu Ying exclaimed in surprise.\n\"That’s right, it’s me.\" Lin Li said proudly.\n\"Then why did you say you couldn’t yesterday?\"\n\"To give Qu Wanqiu a chance to shine, I willingly hid my talent.\" Lin Li continued with this set excuse.\n\"I don’t think you were faking.\"\nDamn, Chen Yu Ying actually seemed smarter than that fool Ding Sihan.\n\"Well, truth is, I failed making candied fruit yesterday, and after reflecting deeply, I spent a whole night mastering it, just to impress you all.\"\nLin Li casually made up another reason, his tone and demeanor confident and flamboyant:\n\"You know, people like me, if I want to succeed at something, I definitely will.\"\n\"What about math?\" Chen Yu Ying asked.\n\"Math excluded.\"\n\"What about physics?\" Chen Yu Ying asked again.\n\"Physics also excluded.\"\n\"What about chemistry?\" Chen Yu Ying kept asking.\n\"Alright, alright, class monitor, just take my earlier words as nonsense, it’s really rude to keep asking, sit down and wait to eat.\" Lin Li gleefully said while flipping the pan.\nChen Yu Ying smiled and nodded.\nEven though she’s been debunking him, she actually thinks if Lin Li really wants to succeed at something, he probably would.\nA delicate Michelin-like late-night snack was quickly served.\n\"Tastes good, Lin Li, you’re impressive.\" After finishing, Chen Yu Ying gave her approval.",

      "content": "Chapter 253: Chapter 208 Lin Li is a Rotten Crotch_2\nHowever, there was no response from the task, which definitely isn’t just a false compliment, so it probably hasn’t reached the so-called ’from the heart’ level acknowledged by the system?\nGot it. The class monitor is not hungry enough.\nFind an opportunity to let her go hungry for three days, then let her eat this meal, she should truly acknowledge it from the heart.\nUnfortunately, Uncle Chen probably wouldn’t allow me to make his daughter so hungry.\nLin Li wasn’t in a hurry, he’d just find another opportunity later.\nAfter Chen Yu Ying finished eating, she very consciously carried her plate to the kitchen, ready to clean up by herself.\n\"Wait, wait, wait.\" Lin Li suddenly stretched out his hand to signal her not to rush.\nThen, under Chen Yu Ying’s puzzled gaze, Lin Li took out a one-yuan note from his pocket and threw it in front of her: \"Clean it yourself.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"This is a tradition, monitor,\" Lin Li said sincerely.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t understand, but respected it.\nAfter they cleaned all the dishes thoroughly together, they returned to the home theater.\nThe movie was still playing, but it was already near the end, as the background music had started playing, and the male and female leads were already embracing tearfully and kissing.\nBai Bufan and Qu Wanqiu were still asleep.\nLin Li, the warm-hearted guy, without further ado, went forward to cover Qu Wanqiu with a blanket and adjusted Bai Bufan’s neck position.\nThe breathing-impaired Bai Bufan instantly opened his eyes, glaring at Lin Li who was gripping his neck, and questioned, \"What the hell are you doing?\"\n\"I’m measuring your neck circumference because I plan to buy you a necklace as a souvenir of our decadent brotherhood, so never mind me, continue with your sleep, and by the way, feeling a bit dizzy later is normal.\"\nLin Li showed a kind smile.\n\"Who the hell taught you to measure neck circumference like that? If you want to kill me, just say it.\" Bai Bufan laughed angrily.\nLin Li: \"Oh, then I want to kill you.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYou actually just said it directly?\nNow you listen to advice, huh?\nOpening Lin Li’s hand, Bai Bufan sat up.\nWithin a few minutes, the male lead and the female lead started living happily ever after, and the credits started rolling.\nIt was already past midnight.\nAt least Lin Li should be going to sleep.\nWaking up Qu Wanqiu, the five of them returned to their respective floors.\n\"Damn, after this nap, I’m more awake now.\" Bai Bufan, back on the second floor, said while rubbing his shoulders.\nSo he decided to play some games since he didn’t need to get up early tomorrow.\nLin Li naturally didn’t go.\nAfter Bai Bufan left, Lin Li first checked the 「Spiritual Spring」, replacing the fully charged Spirit Stone with an empty shell.\nThen he opened the [Shop].\n[You have purchased 「Luck Amulet」 *1.]\n[You have purchased 「Random Quality Spirit Stone」 *1.]\nWith a wave of his small hand, Lin Li began to spend money lavishly.\nThe output of one 「Spiritual Spring」, after meeting daily consumption, has only a small surplus, but if nothing unexpected happens, he will need more and more Spiritual Qi in the future, so with more system currency now, he might as well create another 「Spiritual Spring」 for extraction.\nThree days have passed, and using the 「Luck Amulet」 won’t cause backlash.\nAfter sticking the 「Luck Amulet」 on himself, Lin Li immediately used the 「Random Quality Spirit Stone」.\n[You have obtained 「High-Grade Spirit Stone」 *1.]\n\"Eh?\"\nThe 「Luck Amulet」 still lost its activity and fell off, but the result was somewhat unexpected for Lin Li.\nHis fixed formula seems to have made a mistake.\nHowever, after pondering for a moment, Lin Li suddenly understood.\nThe 「Luck Amulet」 only increased the probability of obtaining higher quality rewards, but did not guarantee that he would get a 「Spiritual Spring」.\n——The 「Luck Amulet」 losing its activity is the best proof.\nIf it guaranteed the highest quality reward, then the wealth should still have surplus luck.\nIt was his wishful thinking.\nLin Li manifested the 「High-Grade Spirit Stone」, and its size was surprisingly smaller than the Low-Grade ones, but he could clearly feel its Spiritual Qi quality was far superior.\nSince he was idle, Lin Li began to use it to continue refining the 「Duck Blood Bottle」.\nThe quantity contained in the High-Grade is exaggerated compared to the Low-Grade, Lin Li’s current Spiritual Qi absorption speed has greatly improved, but after refining for ten minutes, only a small bubble appeared inside the Spirit Stone.\nConservatively estimated, its content exceeds at least a hundred Low-Grades.\nIn a way, it also solves Lin Li’s concern about insufficient Spiritual Qi stock in the future when needed.\nMoreover, charging the 「Spiritual Spring」 would be more convenient, as he no longer needs to replace the empty shells frequently, if this is used up, charging the 「Spiritual Spring」 for ten days to half a month might not be enough to fill it.\nNot too disappointed, Lin Li turned off the lights and went to sleep.\nThe next day, the fifth.\n[For one consecutive month, getting up before 5:00 AM to diligently practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, and by 7:00 AM, accumulating at least half an hour (29/30).]\nUnexpectedly, a month has passed so quickly and is about to end.\nTomorrow, I can complete the longest task I’ve experienced so far.\nAfter exercising, Lin Li did not rush back to the guesthouse but stood outside and activated [Wind Control]—the cooldown had accumulated once, and there would be a second time in a few more hours.\nAt the moment of activation, the surrounding wind seemed to connect with him, and Lin Li could perceive their existence and where they were going.\nShift.\nThe wind that should have been coming head-on was redirected to blowing upwards under Lin Li’s thoughts, causing his clothes to puff up with the incoming wind.\nGreat, in the future, I can secretly play around with skirts on the street (real version).\nAwesome.\nLin Li cultivates not just to make that previously encountered mother and son fly, but to blow girls’ skirts, no?\nChanging the wind direction isn’t difficult, but currently, Lin Li can only divide his attention to change the direction of two winds simultaneously.\nSubsequently, Lin Li began to try to generate wind by himself.\nWith a thought, the wind appeared out of thin air around him, blowing towards the nearby big tree.\nThe leaves began to sway, creating a rustling sound, and the tips of the branches trembled slightly.\nThis wind wasn’t small, capable of blowing exam papers on the desk into chaos and forcibly opening closed textbooks.\nThis is Lin Li’s current limit, and it cannot be sustained for long as it quickly drains stamina.\nOn the other hand, if it’s a gentle breeze, he can control it continuously with negligible consumption.\nMore useful than the current [Healing], if it can grow with his strength, then the future is promising, but there’s no hurry to use the 「Ability Amplifier」, there are only two in the [Warehouse], and who knows if there will be a stronger ability in the future.\nReturning to the living room, he made a simple breakfast with the remaining ingredients in the fridge, and after finishing eating, he activated [Strong Memory] to memorize recipes, driving test knowledge, and ballet music pieces.\nThe [Strong Memory] ability has a limit on accumulation, and not using it is a waste, so it’s just right to memorize these.\nAs for why to memorize driving test knowledge when the task is done, Lin Li thought since he has already learned so much recently, he might as well get his driver’s license directly when he comes of age.\nJust like yesterday, at around eight, Chen Yu Ying came downstairs.\nAfter Chen Yu Ying finished breakfast, the two continued to practice driving.\nTask completion is one thing, practicing driving is another.\nHowever, today there wasn’t much Lin Li needed to do, as Chen Yu Ying was gradually getting familiar on her own.\nAfter riding the bike for half an hour, she even actively asked Lin Li to bring out the electric scooter to the open space so she could try it out.\nWith yesterday’s experience and being off-road, Chen Yu Ying rode very smoothly on her own, even asking Lin Li to record a video.\n...\nChen Zhongping, who was also in Shanting, put down his phone, frowning.\nAfter confirming that his daughter was traveling by taxi, and that the electric scooter was just a means of transportation for Lin Li and Bai Bufan, he felt a bit relieved.\nBut yesterday it was a bicycle, today it’s an electric scooter?\nThe step is too big, not practical at all.\nThis refers to Yingying’s teacher.\nFrom this, it can be concluded:\nChen Zhongping thought: Were you there?\nAAAA Cement Wholesale: Big brother, yeah.\n\"Is it possible for my daughter to fall into your machine at your house?\"\n\"Is there a risk of her surviving?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 254: Chapter 209: Hello, I Need Property Notarization\nAfter the three lazybones got up at noon, the group of five went out to eat.\nIt should be a popular internet-famous spot; even at noon, it was still quite stylish, with luxurious decor and candles on every table.\n\"Bufan, do you know what burning candles smell like?\" Lin Li asked Bai Bufan as they sat down, having nothing else to do.\n\"It smells like paraffin,\" Bai Bufan replied casually while looking at the menu.\n\"That’s a first-level smell, but actually, you can smell burnt nose hairs. If you don’t believe me, go ahead and give it a try.\" Lin Li eagerly suggested, bringing the candle over.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn you.\n\"I believe, I absolutely believe. But take your candle and get away from me.\" Bai Bufan quickly shirked away.\nThe food at the popular spot was decent, just a bit pricey.\nAfter eating, everyone set off for the zoo.\nWhen they arrived at the zoo entrance, it might have coincided with the end of lunch break and the start of the ticket sellers’ shift, so there was a short queue at the gate.\nBut since they had already confirmed and reserved their prize tickets the day before, no one was in a hurry.\n\"Lin Li, the four brothers attack the zoo, the eldest fights the tiger, the third wrestles with the bear, the fourth strikes the snake, what is the second doing?\" Bai Bufan asked Lin Li in a whisper while they were waiting, having nothing else to do.\n\"The second brother stabs the ape,\" Lin Li snorted, dismissing the question as too easy.\nSuch a simple puzzle, you think you can stump me with it?\n\"Wrong, the second brother wrestles with the penguin,\" Bai Bufan chuckled as he gave the correct answer.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nCrap.\nThis simple puzzle actually stumped me.\n\"There aren’t even any penguins in this zoo, right?\"\n\"There are people who use QQ, though.\"\nThe queue wasn’t long, and soon it was their turn.\nAfter Chen Yu Ying negotiated with the ticket seller for a while, she got five paper tickets and signaled to everyone that they could go in.\nWhen the ticket seller looked up, Lin Li pointed at Bai Bufan, who was doing nothing behind them, and said:\n\"Sister, just to let you know, this monkey here is ours, not part of the zoo, so you need to help us get a certificate. Don’t let the security stop us on the way out, saying we stole a monkey, that’ll be such a hassle.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nTicket Seller: \"??\"\nBai Bufan: \"???\"\nDamn you.\nThis attack was beyond savage.\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu couldn’t hold back, they squatted on the ground laughing with their hands covering their mouths, and Chen Yu Ying leaned against the window with her arm on her forehead, trembling slightly.\n\"...Oh oh haha okay, you can bring it, I’ll help you prove it, as long as it’s been vaccinated, it’s best to show a health certificate, haha——\" The ticket seller couldn’t hold back after she reacted.\n\"Bufan, show your health certificate, and I’ll reward you with a banana later.\" Lin Li turned back with a grin.\n\"How come you even played along, sister! Damn it, Lin Li, I took my eyes off you for a second, and you pull this crap! You really deserve it!\" Bai Bufan rushed up to Lin Li, locked him in a chokehold, and forced him towards the entrance, gritting his teeth.\nYou really need to be on guard with this guy at all times, he’s too dangerous.\nThe zoo was quite accommodating in the end; they didn’t ask for Bai Bufan’s pet vaccine certificate and let him through.\n\"The zoo does have a limited variety of animals, even dogs are exhibited as animals.\" Lin Li commented as soon as they entered.\nUpon entering the main gate, the first enclosed area had dogs. Because they were dogs, the fences weren’t high, and there was no glass protection. There were several dogs, some near the fence, allowing passersby to pet them.\n\"But they’re so cute, rural dogs of this quality might cost a few thousand bucks each.\" Ding Sihan lamented.\nThe dogs here had pure coats and well-proportioned bodies, indeed looking good and well-behaved. Although they were called mutts, our ancestors surely didn’t play with fake goods.\n\"Wangcai, come here.\" Based on the display card, Ding Sihan squatted down and beckoned to a dog, making sounds, and it came over to her for some petting.\nThey seemed to have good temperaments.\n\"Woof woof, Yellow... The names of these dogs are too much like dogs.\" Qu Wanqiu commented after looking at the introduction card displaying other dogs’ names.\nLin Li was about to speak when he saw a hand covering his mouth swiftly. Bai Bufan first gave him a cold smile, then said, \"No dog named Lin Li? Now that’s the doggiest name.\"\nThe girls remembered Lin Li’s earlier antics and nodded in agreement, laughing out loud.\nLin Li remained silent, just looking at Bai Bufan.\nAs Lin Li stayed silent, the girls also turned their eyes to Bai Bufan, starting a second round of laughter.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWhat?\nLin Li didn’t even say anything, why are you looking at me and laughing!?\nHave I really established this dog persona that deeply?\nWhen Bai Bufan hopelessly withdrew his hand, Lin Li quickly moved next to the fence, squatted down, and extended his hand toward the mixed-breed dogs: \"Bufan, come here.\"\nWhen he saw most of the dogs running towards Lin Li, Bai Bufan was dumbfounded.\n\"Lin Li, come here.\" To defeat magic with magic, Bai Bufan quickly squatted and started calling out to a dog.\nNo response.\nNo worries, if the mountain doesn’t come to me, I’ll go to the mountain; if a dog doesn’t want to be at my beck and call, Bai Bufan will.\nSo, he ran over to the dog’s side.\n\"Bufan, spin around.\" Lin Li circled his finger in front of the mixed-breed dogs. Perhaps due to some zoo training, several dogs started turning in circles following his finger.\n\"Bufan, shake hands.\" The closest dog obediently placed its paw in Lin Li’s hand.\n\"Lin Li, spin around.\"\n\"Lin Li, shake hands.\"\nBai Bufan imitated but got no response.\n\"...\"\nCrap.\nDogs are angering itself to death, Bai Bufan was feeling devastated.\nSeeing this, Lin Li grinned smugly.\nNot everyone has a 50% affinity increase with spirit animals. Moreover, Lin Li had a \"Bai Bufan’s Sausage\" hidden in his hand.\nAlthough feeding is prohibited in the zoo, it’s not a big issue; Lin Li could even deceive dogs when he got mischievous.\n\"Mama, that dog named Bufan is so smart.\" In the zoo, crowded with families, a child being held exclaimed at Lin Li’s dog-training prowess.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nThe joys and sorrows of people do not connect; the four others, apart from Bai Bufan, laughed heartily.\n\"Bufan, kids’ words carry no harm, don’t take it to heart hahaha.\" When it comes to mocking Bai Bufan, Lin Li never holds back, he patted him heavily on the shoulder, winking and teasing.\n\"But mama, that dog named Lin Li is so dumb.\" At this moment, the child pointed at the dog Bai Bufan was calling to, who did not respond, and shook his head disdainfully.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nEh?\n\"Hahahahaha——\"\nThe girls burst out laughing, the three just standing up squatted down again, Ding Sihan even felt a bit of a belly ache.\nBai Bufan immediately cheered up, turning around to pat Lin Li’s shoulder: \"Lin Li, kids’ words carry no harm, don’t take it to heart.\"\n\"...\"\n\"How could there be no harm? That kid’s a boy, he must have harm. Moreover, since there’s harm, he ought to be spanked!\" Lin Li found an excuse.\nHe donned a serious expression, rolling up his sleeves, ready to relive his childhood classic game from 4399 — \"Crazy Beat Little Friends.\"\nThis world just gained another kid who needs the chance to fly!\n\"No need, no need, no need,\" Bai Bufan laughed heartily as he held Lin Li back.",

She seemed a bit awkward, nodded apologetically to the two, and then carried her child away.\n\"I feel like it’s time to start practicing trombone, while the sunk costs aren’t too high yet,\" Lin Li’s dog said wistfully, watching the mother and child leave.\n\"Indeed,\" Bufan’s dog nodded in agreement.\nThe two rarely reached a consensus.\n\"Woof woof.\" Perhaps it noticed that Lin Li’s sausage turned out to be a fraud, the dog named Bufan wagged its tail at the fence closest to Lin Li and barked twice.\n\"Why does this dog’s bark sound like this? It’s so strange.\" Lin Li frowned, feeling perplexed.\nBai Bufan pretended not to hear.\n\"Isn’t that how dogs bark? How else would they bark?\" said Ding Sihan, who was petting the dog, turning her head in confusion.\nLin Li: \"Isn’t that how dogs bark? How else would they bark?\"\nBai Bufan sighed.\nStill inexperienced, Ding Sihan.\n\"You’re mimicking my words — huh? Lin Li!!!\" Ding Sihan halfway through her confusion realized what trick Lin Li was up to, clenched her fist, and charged at Lin Li.\nChen Yu Ying once again became the pillar as Lin Li and Ding Sihan began to circle her like King Qin.\nChen Yu Ying folded her arms and sighed; she was used to it by now.\n\"Just kidding, just kidding, but the dogs I know don’t bark like that.\" Dodging around Chen Yu Ying’s shoulders, Lin Li tried to protect his life and said.\n\"You said it! But if you dare mimic me again, you’re dead!\"\nDing Sihan squinted her eyes, her hand reaching into her shoulder bag, presumably looking for a weapon.\n\"Are you there? Good morning. Good night. What are you doing? Reply to my messages. Come home early. What kind of breakfast does your boyfriend like? I’ll get him some too...\" Lin Li immediately started listing on his fingers.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nCan’t really retaliate; it indeed is a dog.\n\"I’ll spare you this time.\"\nSo Lin Li survived.\n\"The dog you’re talking about, do I happen to know it too?\" Bai Bufan came over and asked with a smile, \"Isn’t it called something Chen?\"\n\"I don’t think so, I remember it’s called something Tian.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nThe two exchanged a knowing smile.\n\"But, Lin Li, do you think to these animals we humans are some kind of tentacle monsters? We have abnormally flexible limbs, and despite the vast biological gap, some of us are very dangerous, but others are kind and have a unique stroking method that pleases them. Among these, there are even individuals that ’beep beep’ with them. What else could we be but tentacle monsters?\"\nBai Bufan mused, looking at the small fancy dogs rolling over for belly rubs.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThe last sentence really tied everything together. This group ought to eat dung and kill themselves.\nHuman reputation is tarnished by them.\nNot spending too much time here, after all, the identity of dogs is too sensitive. Bai Bufan and Lin Li didn’t want to hurt each other anymore.\n\"Putting aside the insulting nature, being a dog isn’t bad, carefree, and even getting praised for pooping in the bathroom. I’m envious.\" Bai Bufan said as they left.\nLin Li: \"I can’t put it aside, but you can try.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn you.\nAfter washing hands quickly at the nearby sink, the five continued their stroll.\nThis zoo might not be too luxurious, but it still has the basic types of animals.\n\"The deer here are a bit timid, they shy away from people, unlike the deer in Nara, which are very bold and will bite open your backpack if they smell deer cookies inside.\"\nAs they reached the Deer District and saw the deer gathering away from people, Chen Yu Ying remarked.\n\"Class President, you’ve been to Nara in Japan?\" Lin Li inquired, curious.\nDeer are interesting, deer should be learned from, Lin Li likes deer.\n\"Yes, my family took me there during the summer vacation after elementary school graduation. Wakakusa Mountain’s scenery is quite nice there, but maybe because it was a holiday, everyone around was speaking Chinese. I almost thought I hadn’t even left the country.\"\nChen Yu Ying joked with a smile.\n\"Damn and damn, this world is just a giant Swiss roll. Some people get Switzerland, while others get rural credit cooperatives. I’ve never even been abroad.\" Lin Li joked, shaking his head.\nNot to mention going abroad, Lin Li hasn’t even been on a plane yet; he’s only thrown one.\n\"Oi! Kid! The rest get a roll, not rural credit cooperatives. Apologize to the credit cooperatives!\" Bai Bufan immediately went for Lin Li’s collar, lifting it up roughly.\n\"I’m sorry, dear credit cooperative spokesperson.\" Lin Li laughed and admitted defeat.\nThen they saw Bai Bufan beginning to thump his pocket.\n\"What are you doing?\" Lin Li asked curiously.\n\"I resonate with you; this is my wallet, and I’m hitting it, trying to make it swell.\" Bai Bufan said seriously.\n\"Let me do it, let me do it.\" Lin Li’s eyes lit up, \"I’ll make sure it swells to the fullest.\"\n\"Forget it, forget it.\" Bai Bufan didn’t want to end up limping.",

I’ve never been abroad either, what’s wrong with the world having one more rich person like me? Can’t someone just randomly give me some money?\"\nChen Yu Ying, who was originally just listening to the conversation with a smile, suddenly noticed Lin Li’s intense gaze.\nAt first, she didn’t understand, but seeing him wink and gesture, after being confused for a moment, she finally got Lin Li’s meaning.\nThough slightly hesitant, she still walked up to Bai Bufan and threw a dollar onto him.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Line, class monitor, say the line.\" Lin Li urged from the side.\n\"Clean it yourself.\" Chen Yu Ying said unskillfully.\nBai Bufan: \"???\"\nWhat?\nHe bent over, picked up the dollar, put it in his pocket, scratched his head and murmured: \"Strange, isn’t this the money Ding Sihan took from me yesterday? Wasn’t it meant to be thrown at Lin Li, how did it end up with you, class monitor?\"\nAs they passed the Deer District, which housed the tigers, a group of tourists was queueing up.\nAfter looking at the introduction, it turned out you could take photos with the tigers, and kids could even sit on them.\n\"Come on, let’s take a look.\" Seeing a few people intrigued, Lin Li spoke up for everyone.\nLin Li’s family had photos of him as a child sitting on a tiger, but he couldn’t remember when it was taken.\n\"What if the tiger suddenly turns around and eats a person?\" Bai Bufan, having nothing to do, asked.\n\"Throw a dollar on it and let it clean itself up, no blood or pieces left, so the next person can take pictures without issue.\" Lin Li replied instantly with the standard answer.\n\"This dollar’s wasting its talents with me, it’s better with you.\"\nBai Bufan threw the money onto Lin Li’s face again, and Lin Li caught it steadily.\n\"For the sake of this dollar, I’ll tell you a way to survive, kneel and call it dad, because a tiger doesn’t eat its cubs.\" Lin Li said.\n\"That actually makes sense.\" Bai Bufan realized suddenly.\n\"Unfortunately, this method doesn’t work for you.\" Lin Li added.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because a tiger father doesn’t have dogs as offspring, you’re naturally at a species disadvantage.\" Lin Li finally finished flipping his Yan Kingdom map and smiled as he took out a dagger.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You son of a [BEEP]!\"\nIn front of the five was a family of three, their young child being held and looking back, while three girls were teasing the child, and the parents didn’t mind and even greeted them.\nSoon it was the family’s turn to queue up.\n\"Such a well-behaved child is really nice, it makes me feel marriage isn’t such a bad thing.\" Ding Sihan seemed nostalgic about the feeling of pinching the child’s cheeks earlier and sighed, \"What a pity most kids aren’t like that.\"\nMost children only bring despair.\nThough maybe even here there were kids who made people despair, people are always double standards.\nLin Li just thinking about having a kid like Bai Bufan makes him want to die.\nIf the kid was like him, well, it’s just not wanting to live.\nThinking this way, Sister Min is great, no need to elaborate.\nBut still.\n\"Putting kids aside, marriage is not a bad thing at all, there are too many benefits.\nFor example, then you’d definitely live together, and when food is ready, there’s no need to wait, successfully splitting the bill immediately, wow, just thinking about it makes me feel exhilarating.\"\nLin Li closed his eyes; it’s fantasy time now.\nEven at three or four in the morning, you can split the bill directly!\nNo need to watch anyone’s face!\nExhilarating!\nBai Bufan hearing this also closed his eyes; he felt exhilarating too.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nYou damn.\n\"Lin Li, with what you said, actually there’s no need to put kids aside, because if you have a child, you can register a new user too.\" Bai Bufan was good at finding connections.\n\"Oh, that’s quite sensible too, new users do have great gold potential.\" Lin Li learned.\n\"Exhilarating!\"\n\"Exhilarating!\"\n\"What’s so exhilarating?! Even if you are getting rural credit cooperatives instead of Switzerland, you can’t go to this extent!! Poor people aren’t allowed to write exhilarating tales! I’ve had enough! Shut up!\" Qu Wanqiu couldn’t take it anymore with these two.\nEven Bai Bufan, the coward, stopped when Qu Wanqiu mentioned credit cooperatives.\n\"Thanks a lot; you all suddenly made me feel marriage is all bad, just hearing your description makes life seem too bitter.\" Ding Sihan held her forehead; these two are truly living life.\nAfter the family of three finished taking photos, it was their turn.\n\"Excuse me, could I ask why that tiger is locked up alone over there?\" During the photo session, Lin Li noticed the tiger being isolated in the enclosure, sometimes whimpering, so he asked curiously.\n\"Oh, that tiger is in heat, but its condition isn’t suitable for breeding right now, so it’s isolated, it’s not abuse.\" Hearing this, the staff immediately explained.\nWithout an explanation, a short video later might bring the zoo a lot of backlash.\n\"I see.\" Lin Li nodded.\nDuring the photo shoot, Lin Li advised Bai Bufan to put his neck by the tiger’s mouth, saying it would make the photo more artistic, but unfortunately, it was rejected ruthlessly.\nThen Lin Li himself proved through action that you can touch a tiger’s behind.\nBut you indeed cannot touch its balls.\nLin Li asked himself; actually, the tiger didn’t refuse, but the keeper refused for it.\nTigers are good, but keepers are bad.\n...\n\"This zoo is really trashy.\" Lin Li shook his head helplessly.\nChen Yu Ying glared amusedly at Lin Li: \"You need to look for ticket scalpers outside the zoo.\"\nLin Li, this guy, had been asking the scalper for \"front row tickets to Lin Li’s concert\", only for the scalper to just look at Lin Li and lazily munch on grass, leading him to draw this conclusion.\nThe zoo was really wronged.\nFollowing the zoo’s designed route, they arrived at a shop selling zoo souvenirs, as well as some food and drinks.\nThe zoo was indeed not big; this shop being at the center meant an hour’s time, only half of it was explored, even considering the group walked slowly, bantering all the way.\nNo wonder there weren’t many people during the National Day holidays.\nThey walked into the shop, but damn, even the air conditioning wasn’t on.\nThe girls picked some keychains as souvenirs and went to the counter to pay.\n\"Bro, is that for sale? So cool.\" When at the counter, Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s eyes lit up because there were mecha-shaped animals in the display cabinet, seemingly able to transform.\nIt reminded Lin Li of Poisonous Snake Green Pepper, the most overpowering existence in \"Steel Frame Dragon\"; while others were still preparing their skills, it would turn its head for a super transformation, kneel, for an ultimate zodiac transformation, not even stealth could handle it, the most skilled existence.\nTurning its head, Poisonous Snake Green Pepper wasn’t scared but was upgrading; kneeling wasn’t wrong, but was starting the ultimate zodiac transformation.\n\"It’s for sale, this one’s 400.\" The salesperson glanced and nodded.\n\"What the heck? How much?\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s accents were startled out.\nBai Bufan gasped before pointing at another, inquiring: \"How about this one?\"\n\"Two heck.\"\nBai, Lin: \"...\"",

You vile beast!\n\"Wow, Mom, the peacock is displaying its feathers!\"\n\"Such good luck to see a peacock spreading its tail in October, come quickly and see.\"\n\"Come on, come on, come on!\"\nThe magnificent and giant tail fan immediately captivated all the nearby tourists, drawing everyone to gather around, phones out, capturing the moment.\nThe peacock was originally standing right in front of Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying, making their position the center of attention.\nIt was a bit crowded, and perhaps someone accidentally bumped her from behind, causing Chen Yu Ying to lean against Lin Li’s body.\nLin Li steadied Chen Yu Ying with both hands, then slightly turned sideways, letting her lean against the railing in front of them, while he stood behind, creating a comfortable space and blocking all the push from behind.\nThe power of the earth! As solid as a rock!\n\"Lin Li, how did you do that?\" Chen Yu Ying didn’t care about any of this; she just turned around, her eyes filled with obvious admiration and curiosity, eagerly asking Lin Li.\nLin Li now understood Wang Ziyi.\nThe gaze of an adoring girl is truly a life’s stimulant.\nHey? I wonder if this excuse would work if I got arrested at the Olympics?\n\"It’s a long story,\" Lin Li, his thoughts wandering too far, pulled back and began to reminisce about his past:\n\"A few years ago, when I went to London, I accidentally found Platform nine and three-quarters and got into Hogwarts. The Sorting Hat sorted me into civil engineering, and thus began my eventful life.\nThose Gryffindor and Slytherin students all mocked me, saying civil engineering wasn’t good, but I think civil engineering is quite good. It’s easier to find a job after graduation, unlike many professions where it’s hard to find work. I’ve seen many senior brothers complaining about how tough the work site is, and I thought if you can’t endure this hardship, you surely can’t do anything else either...\"\n\"Lin Li!\"\nAlthough it wasn’t grounded from the start, veering into civil engineering was too outrageous. Seeing Lin Li still intending to continue this story without stopping anytime soon, Chen Yu Ying called his name with amusement and a hint of displeasure.\n\"In summary, it’s magic! Magic! Equivalent to the little spell «Avada Eat Big Melon».\" Lin Li concluded with a laugh.\n\"I don’t believe it, there’s no such thing as magic. How did you actually do it, tell me.\"\nChen Yu Ying tried hard to widen her eyes, staring straight at Lin Li with a soft voice.\nBu Hao!\nShe’s acting cute!\nClass monitor, you doing this—\nLin Li: \"The password to my bank card is 129836.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nWhy suddenly tell me the bank card password?\nLin Li sighed again: \"Although it’s a bit embarrassing, since the class monitor wants to know, I can only tell you.\nI earned it by sacrificing my dignity.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Actually, I didn’t go to the bathroom just now, I went inside the Peacock Garden, and knelt before the peacock. I said, Brother Kong, there were many people outside just now, so I’ll kneel for you now, please do me a favor and display your tail later?\nThe peacock didn’t agree at first, but after hearing that I’m an adherent of Confucianism, a disciple of Confucius, part of the Kong family, it reluctantly agreed to my request.\nClass monitor, just hear it and don’t spread it; I need to save face.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nDoes Confucius really have this kind of face?\n\"...Lin Li.\"\n\"It was actually done by another staff member; he said he had a way, I don’t know exactly.\" Seeing the gradual disappointment in Chen Yu Ying’s eyes, Lin Li said with a smile.\nOf course, it was the ’Duck Blood Bottle’ that played its role at this moment.\nAt this moment, Lin Li’s ’Duck Blood Bottle’ still stored the lust from the tiger.\nThe ’Duck Blood Bottle’ has never been limited to absorbing human cultivators’ lust; high-intelligence spiritual beasts are also within its range of influence. However, the emotions absorbed have reproductive isolation— for instance, the emotions in the bottle right now can’t be transferred to humans.\nAnd since peacocks display their tails when they are courting or defending against threats, why not make it court or feel threatened?\nSo Lin Li originally had two plans, one of lust and the other of fear.\nBoth were easy to gather; the isolated tiger in the Lust Tiger Garden brimmed with it, and fear could be collected by scaring a timid animal in the zoo.\nAfter collecting the tiger’s lust, to avoid losing face if the peacock didn’t display its tail during the actual operation, Lin Li went to the Peacock Garden alone to experiment and succeeded; the inexplicable tail display the staff witnessed earlier was caused by Lin Li.\nAlthough he simply wanted to look cool, it was nice to complete [Task Five] along the way.\nThe rewards for Task Five were decent, but it was the last chance to double it, more suited for a month’s physical training or spending on a beautiful lady, so Lin Li didn’t choose to double it.\n[You have received a reward: Physical Improvement: Insight increase by 50%, Spiritual Qi absorption rate increase by 100%; System currency *100.]\n\"Is there really such a thing?\" Hearing this, Chen Yu Ying skeptically and surprisingly tilted her head, searching for the staff’s figures around, somewhat doubtful.\nBut didn’t pursue further.\nIt didn’t matter if it was magic or not.\nWhat mattered was that moment’s joy and excitement, a thousand times better, a million times more unforgettable than the peacock’s display.\nRecalling that moment, Chen Yu Ying’s lips could not suppress a smile.\nThe sorrows and joys of people and beasts aren’t connected, and now after displaying its tail, the peacock was full of question marks: \"?\"\nWho am I? Where am I? What am I doing?\nNever mind it! First mate! Then mate again! Finally mate!\nWas I born to mate! Mating forever!\nI’m going to the dock to mate!\n\"Ah! Ah! Ah!\" The peacock let out a call to attract a mate and was now all about escaping.\nWith no response, it twisted its body sharply, focusing on a few alluring female peacocks in the district.\nPanic panic panic panic panic.\nMate! Mate!\n\"Why is the peacock leaving?\" Seeing the peacock hastily departing, the tourists regrettably lamented.\nLin Li poured the remaining lust from the bottle toward the female peacocks it rushed to.\nBrother Kong, thank you. This is the last thing I can do for you.\n\"Class monitor, there’s no regret now, right?\" As the crowd dispersed, Lin Li said to Chen Yu Ying with a smile.\n\"Mm!\" Chen Yu Ying nodded heavily, then smiled sweetly, \"Thank you.\"\n\"Let’s thank the Sorting Hat and civil engineering.\"\nAfter giving a quick glance, Chen Yu Ying saw a message on her phone and said, \"Let’s go back to where the foxes are, Si Han and Wanqiu are back, asking where I am.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nLin Li nodded, \"It’s a pity they missed my magic.\"\n\"Yes, what a pity.\" Chen Yu Ying walked ahead, her light steps hiding tiny mischief in her eyes facing away.\nA few minutes passed.\nPeacock Garden District.\nThe staff, who had been pacing back and forth, confirmed that the two had indeed left, and after checking that no one was watching him.\nHe took a deep breath, drew a semicircle with his hand, pointing at the peacock, and lowered his voice: \"Display for me.\"\nNothing·happened.\nThe peacock glanced at him, where did this fool come from.\nStaff: \"...\"\n\"Oi! Peacock, display for me! Display for me, display for me, display for me!\"\n\"Ah ah ah ah! Ah! You beast! Dis! Play! For! Me!\"\nThe staff exerted all his means, yet there was no reaction.\nTruly strange, where exactly did it go wrong, didn’t I replicate that young couple’s actions perfectly?\nIs it a language issue?\n\"Open you tail for me!!\"\n\"私のために画面を開けて!\"\n\"Cluck cluck cluck display cluck cluck cluck!\"",

If you hear this broadcast...\"\nAt this moment, the broadcast resounded throughout the zoo, causing visitors to pause, and after hearing that it wasn’t related to them, they returned to their own activities.\nBut Lin Li: \"?\"\nHe opened his mouth wide, dumbfounded.\nDon’t disturb, I’m barbequing.\nAs for the other three girls, they were also stunned at first, but then looked at Lin Li’s dumbfounded expression, and uncontrollable laughter leaked from their tightly closed mouths.\nLin Li took a deep breath, smiled, and said: \"Lin Li is quite a common name, it might just be a kid with the same name who’s lost, no need to worry.\"\nHe took out his phone.\nIgnored Bai Bufan’s heap of messages.\n「Lin Li: Haha, you sent me so many messages, I just passed out from gluing and just woke up, where are you now?」\n「Bai Bufan: At the broadcast station, looking for a kid.」\n\"Damn!\"\nIt really is this bastard!\nWasting public resources, Bai Bufan is such a beast, damn it!\nThis level of birth behavior is comparable to calling him a monkey when entering the zoo.\nHeavenly Dao is cyclical, heaven spares no one.\n\"Let’s go! Pick him up!\" Lin Li said through gritted teeth with a darkened face.\nThe girls laughed as they followed behind.\nAt the broadcast station, Bai Bufan watched Lin Li’s arrival with a cold smile.\n\"Are you? Do you need our help?\" Seeing Lin Li and his group’s arrival, the staff at the broadcast station inquired.\n\"Hello, I’m the little friend, Lin Li.\" Lin Li smiled.\nThe staff looked up, seeing Lin Li who was at least a head taller: \"?\"\n\"Sister, actually, I’m only eight years old.\" Lin Li continued to smile.\nWu Min dares to say she’s twenty-eight to the outside, why can’t I say I’m eight.\nStaff: \"...\"\nLet the bullets fly into reality.\nHowever, afterward, both Bai Bufan and Lin Li, the little friend, were scolded by the staff at the broadcast station.\nBoth solemnly apologized and promised not to do it again next time.\nAfter all, they indeed caused trouble for the zoo officials.\nFortunately, Bai Bufan was sensible, he mentioned that it wasn’t urgent, so the broadcast station didn’t notify all staff to help find them, so while Lin Li and Bai Bufan annoyed the zoo, it wasn’t too troublesome.\nAs for why Lin Li also got scolded, it’s naturally because Bai Bufan wouldn’t let him leave.\n\"Just playing a hide-and-seek game to relive childhood, you’re really impatient.\" After the scolding, as the group left the broadcast station, Lin Li said disdainfully.\n\"And you have the nerve to bark? You seem like the type who’d play hide-and-seek with friends, but no matter if you’re the seeker or the one hiding, you’d go straight home.\" Bai Bufan said with a face full of resentment.\nLin Li was shocked by these words: \"Have you seen me when I was little? How do you know so clearly? Turns out we are childhood sweethearts?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Sweetheart, your horse! Did you really do that? Your family must have forgotten to hire a sage when you were born.\"\n\"They did, and the next day he died by accident.\"\n\"Fair enough.\"\nOnce everyone was gathered, the five of them continued to see the remaining animals in the zoo they hadn’t visited yet.\nThe zoo’s area isn’t large to begin with, even walking very slowly, it takes at most three hours to see everything.\nAfter watching an animal performance, the girls decided to leave.\nAs for Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\n\"How about we watch another one?\" Lin Li was still interested.\n\"I agree.\" Bai Bufan nodded, \"This performance was quite white and long.\"\nDing Sihan was speechless: \"What on earth do you two want to watch, I don’t even want to expose you.\"\nThe staff assisting with the animal performances were a few very good-looking young ladies.\nNo wonder there are so many fathers here at the animal performances.\nIndeed, it was quite a sight.\n\"Behind the animal performances is cruel training, I’m boycotting animal performances, hence I resolutely didn’t look at the animals at all, how is that wrong, I’m helping the animals!\" Lin Li felt wronged and righteously said.\nThen he got one approving look and three disdainful ones.\nQu Wanqiu suddenly wanted to laugh: \"What is Lin Li’s help equivalent to?\nWhen someone falls into a well, Lin Li would first come to help, and with Lin Li’s help, that person adapted to life at the bottom of the well.\"\nBai Bufan heard this and touched his chin, nodded: \"Indeed, that’s a spot-on summary, something Lin Li would do.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 260: Chapter 213: I Told You, I Never Left_2\nAwkward silence.\nI suddenly crave for ice-cold watermelon and begin tossing watermelons into the well. Oh, but only the ones that aren’t heavy.\nZoo exit.\nLin Li’s advanced notice seems to have worked. Bai Bufan wasn’t asked for ID while leaving the zoo, and there was no property dispute.\n\"Hello, could you give us your feedback on Shanting Zoo? Whether it’s shortcomings or strengths, or any suggestions, we’d love to hear them.\" Several staff members, holding tablets, were questioning each leaving visitor.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged glances and immediately approached the nearest staff member: \"We do, mate, yes we do.\"\nStaff member: \"?\"\n\"Could you please elaborate?\" he asked.\n\"We have both shortcomings and suggestions.\"\n\"Alright, I’m all ears.\" The staff member, hearing this, quickly went into listening mode.\n\"Shanting Zoo is actually nice, not as bad as online folks say. But I have a suggestion: you could launch an ’All-you-can-eat with cows’ event to attract visitors.\" Lin Li said enthusiastically.\nStaff member: \"... But we’re a zoo, not a restaurant.\"\n\"No, you misunderstood. I mean, since your cows are quite docile, why not let visitors pay a small fee to enter the cow area and eat grass together with them? Grass is limitless, and there’s little cost but lots of buzz, don’t you think?\"\nStaff member: \"?\"\nIs ’with cows’ not a noun, but a compound of a conjunction and an object?\n\"This buzz might really work... In this era of flow-driven businesses, it could indeed draw some attention. I’ll summarize it and report.\" The staff member considered seriously upon hearing this.\nYou can teach a child, after all.\n\"Me, me, I also have a suggestion: why don’t you find a dragon, I’m sure visitors will flood in.\" Bai Bufan, not willing to lag behind, quickly said.\n\"Dragons? They’re nonexistent; we can’t possibly manage that...\" The staff member replied awkwardly.\n\"There are dragons in this world. When I stay at home for ten minutes in my room, my mom asks if I’m a dragon because I can’t hear her asking me to hang clothes. Turns out if you stay home for ten minutes, you might evolve into a dragon. You guys should train one and keep it according to my thought,\"\nBai Bufan gestured with his finger and then told the staff member about his impressive discovery that might shake the biology world.\nStaff member: \"...\"\n\"Thank you for your suggestions, the exit is this way, have a nice day.\" The staff member maintained a friendly smile, pointing towards the exit, polite and sincere.\nHowever, the two forced a camaraderie on him, clearly having much more to say:\n\"Suggestions are done, now about shortcomings that you should improve.\"\n\"The exit is this way, please have a nice day.\"\n\"Your ticket resale isn’t available, I can’t purchase any second-hand tickets from your retriever either.\"\n\"The exit is this way, please quickly leave.\"\n\"Your keeper didn’t let me touch the tiger’s balls, I really want to, could you relay this suggestion?\"\n\"Please, I beg you, just leave.\"\nThe staff member sighed.\nApparently, today is not a good day to be out without checking the lunar calendar.\n...\nAfter tormenting the staff, the five of them grabbed dinner nearby.\nLater, they went to Shanting District to buy some things that could count as local specialties, rare to find in Xiling.\n\"Today’s ending, going home tomorrow, school the day after, life is so fleeting, why did my National Day holiday fly by so fast?\" Ding Sihan lamented.\n\"Indeed, I still want to hang out with everyone,\" Qu Wanqiu nodded.\nToday is already the fifth; they need to be at school by the night of the seventh for evening self-study. Sending everyone home again on the seventh isn’t realistic, especially when Bai Bufan hasn’t started his holiday homework at all. Even copying wouldn’t be possible in one evening.\nAs everyone knows, English is a subject with incomprehensible copied answers, while Chinese is a subject where one doesn’t want to copy after seeing the answers.\nSo playing for four days is truly the limit.\n\"There’s no banquet that doesn’t break up, but if you’re treating, I can stay longer.\" Lin Li said after hearing that.\n\"Lin Li, ’I still want to play with everyone’, the focus is ’play’, not ’everyone’, especially you, Lin Li, you go away.\" Qu Wanqiu smiled and turned back.\n\"Nice, the aggression level is rising, you can teach a child.\" Lin Li nodded with satisfaction, not feeling offended at all.\n\"Next long holiday that allows going far won’t be until the winter holidays for New Year, that’s so far,\" Qu Wanqiu expressed her sentiment after speaking against her will.\nGoing out with this group of people was really fun.\nEspecially since there are now these two jokers added.\n\"Not bad, there’s less than four months left until Liu Dehua thaws, it’s quite soon. Come New Year’s Eve, I’ll find you all to set off fireworks together.\" Lin Li said lightly, without much of the melancholy feeling\n\"You three are Xiling People, it’s convenient to hang out then. Bai Bufan and I are too far from you all,\" Qu Wanqiu said with emotion, \"We can’t always rely on Ying Bao to send a car to pick us up, can we? That would be too troublesome.\"\n\"No problem at all, just taking a car,\" Chen Yu Ying, who intended to say this at the beginning of the sentence, added.\n\"Leave it to me then,\" Lin Li patted his chest and said loudly, \"If all goes well, by then, I should have passed and got my driver’s license. During the holidays when my mom is at home, I’ll steal her car, perfect.\"\n\"Really?\" Bai Bufan’s eyes lit up when he heard this. He had no qualms about exploiting Lin Li.\nEven if it’s past midnight, he would dare ask Lin Li to drop him home first, and then make his own way back to Xiling.\n\"Can you really pass?\" Bai Bufan asked doubtfully again.\n\"For someone who’s in the bracket of 272, best show some basic respect to the rank of 51. Speaking at least requires respectful language, not everyone is like you, a slacker whose effort shows little progress.\"\nLin Li straightened his collar, speaking with arrogant tone.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"You’ll be doomed if you fail.\" Bai Bufan cursed.\n\"Agreed.\" Qu Wanqiu nodded along with Ding Sihan.\n\"It’s best to only have age mates in the car, I’d prefer sitting in one driven by you. Keep it up, you must pass by then.\" Chen Yu Ying also encouraged Lin Li.\n\"I won’t let you down.\" Lin Li nodded confidently.\nWith something worth looking forward to, everyone’s steps became a bit lighter.\n...\nThe girls accidentally shopped for another two hours before they carried large shopping bags back to the inn.\nThey were all tired from walking, after all, they’d already spent an afternoon in the zoo, and continued wandering in the evening.\nEven Cultivators get a bit worn out, let alone them?\nBai Bufan went to the bathroom first.\nCame out.\nLin Li: \"Clap clap clap clap! Bufan! Awesome!! Baby is amazing!\"\nDing Sihan: \"Bai Bufan! Congrats!\"\nQu Wanqiu: \"To actually go to the bathroom on schedule! How impressive.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"So good! Very impressive.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Wait, what are you all doing?\" Bai Bufan’s Adam’s apple moved, standing at the bathroom door, afraid to step out.\nThe girls shifted their gaze to Lin Li.\nImmediately spotting the culprit.\nFacing Bai Bufan’s doubting look, Lin Li shrugged: \"I fulfilled your little wish.\"\n\"What little wis—wait a moment.\" Bai Bufan squinted, he seemed to remember.\nSetting aside the nature of insult, being a dog isn’t bad at all, carefree, going to the bathroom to poop on schedule and being praised as ’baby is great’, I envy\nThis was the original sentence he said to Lin Li earlier in the zoo.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nGrass.\nBai Bufan gradually comprehended everything.\nDid this guy just tell the girls while he was in the bathroom, and they cooperated with him?\nBai Bufan found it hard to respond, not knowing what to say.\nLin Li keenly remembered such a sentence, it’s heartwarming but the method of fulfilling the wish seemed a bit off.\nI envy getting simple praise! Pooping was just an example!\n\"Thanks, but no need to do this next time.\" Lin Li had good intentions but next time, better not start, Bai Bufan had to swallow all those foul words.\nWait a second.\nDidn’t Lin Li say something about not leaving the insult nature behind?\nBai Bufan raised his head, squinted: \"Hold on, I’d like to withdraw my thanks first.\"\n\"Lin Li, I need confirmation, did you mean to insult me just now?\"\n\"What else?\" Lin Li looked puzzled, wondering why Bai Bufan would ask such a question.\nThen rolled away from the incoming slipper.\n\"So the starting point was bad too!\"\n\"Grass!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 261: Chapter 214: Food Safety Cannot Be Delayed\nBai Bufan wielded the extinguisher, chasing Lin Li around the room— the fire extinguisher sign in the inn was a bit outdated, and with a couple of letters missing, \"fire\" became \"people\".\nBut hey, at least it’s serving its purpose.\n\"Bad dog! Bai Bufan, you bad dog! Stop chasing, sit! Sit!\"\nLin Li’s insults sounded more like whining but were highly insulting nonetheless.\nTheir chase was uproariously loud, and the three girls present had no empathy whatsoever for this vile pet attack incident; they were laughing more cheerfully than anyone.\nWho the hell said women are naturally capable of love?\nShow some love already!\n...\n\"Whew—\" Lin Li came down the stairs and sat back on the mat, letting out a long breath.\nOnly Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu were left on the first floor; Chen Yu Ying was probably upstairs taking a bath.\n\"Where’s Bai Bufan?\" Ding Sihan inquired.\nLin Li sighed, \"This guy caught me off guard just now, and he gave me two choices: death or let him touch my butt.\"\nQu Wanqiu was already laughing, \"What did you choose, Lin Li?\"\n\"Of course, death,\" Lin Li said matter-of-factly.\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu’s laughter was boisterous.\n\"Anyway, he’s off playing games. Aren’t you going upstairs to rest? Or are you planning to watch me naked?\"\nEveryone was tired from the day, and although it was just nine o’clock, which wasn’t too late, no one wanted to do anything else together. Lin Li had come downstairs intending to take a bath, adding that he waved the clothing in his hand.\n\"Yu Ying is already in the bath. Sigh, I haven’t washed my hair in days; I have to wash it tonight. I’m somewhat envious of Tang Monk,\" Ding Sihan sighed and remarked upon hearing this.\n\"Why envy Tang Monk?\" Qu Wanqiu, who was next to them, didn’t understand.\n\"Because Tang Monk never had to bathe himself. Every time he got captured, the little ones had to obey their king and clean him up. How many baths did he take through the eighty-one tribulations?\" Lin Li speculated upon hearing this.\nWho knows if any demons were curious enough to pinch Tang Monk.\nIn any case, Bai Bufan definitely couldn’t resist.\n\"Exactly, during the stage where I found bathing troublesome, I used to be terribly envious,\" Ding Sihan snapped her fingers, acknowledging Lin Li.\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nCan that be considered a bath, or is it a food safety issue?\n\"Now that you mention it, no wonder Tang Monk had such smooth skin, and the Queen of the Kingdom of Women liked him. While others trudged through dust and grime, he bathed daily, making him stand out,\" Qu Wanqiu commented after her thoughts wandered.\n\"If the Queen of the Kingdom of Women could love anyone in the traveling party at first sight, she truly would be something,\" Lin Li frowned, looking at Qu Wanqiu’s sharp critique.\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nSeems plausible.\n\"Tang Monk was a heartbreaker; I feel he clearly had feelings but wasn’t brave enough. Why couldn’t he just take the Queen away?\"\nQu Wanqiu commented again, as girls tend to think differently when watching this sort of thing than boys do.\nIf Lin Li were Tang Monk, he would have had a clear conscience and five kids by now.\nUpon hearing Qu Wanqiu say this, Lin Li furrowed his brows deeply, incredulous that she would propose such an idea:\n\"Little Qiuqiu, they were going to India, to where even a White Dragon Horse would get pinched. You want Tang Monk to take the Queen of the Kingdom of Women there? Are you serious? As a pure love warrior, I can’t stand cuckolds.\"\nQu Wanqiu: \"?\"\nQu Wanqiu lowered her head and began to laugh suppressedly, \"...Sorry.\"\nLin Li’s \"even the White Dragon Horse would get pinched\" utterly broke her.\nThe funniest thing is, indeed, it’s something India could pull off; it’s not slander.\n\"Sihan, I’m done with my shower,\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice came from the third floor at this point.\nSkincare doesn’t need to be done in the bathroom, so when it comes to not including hair-washing, girls aren’t particularly slow at bathing.\n\"Class rep, is the bathwater still there?\" At those words, Lin Li quickly asked.\nThere was no response.\nLin Li surmised the class rep must have whispered \"pervert,\" just too quietly for him to hear.\nHe didn’t know if the prefix was good or bad.\n\"What are you two looking at me like that for? What? Haven’t you learned about water resource utilization in elementary school? Rice rinse water can be used for plants, laundry water can flush toilets, and bathwater can quench thirst; aren’t these basics?\"\nTwo gazes from nearby made Lin Li uncomfortable, and he retorted.\nDing Sihan, Qu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nHas some strange common sense slipped in; where is this common sense anyway?\nThis guy, still performing consistently.\nQu Wanqiu: \"Which elementary school? Tell me so I can dodge it.\"\nLin Li felt misunderstood; as a kid, any boy who didn’t guzzle shower water from the showerhead had great self-control.\nBesides, what’s wrong with a little homage to Durant?\n\"Sigh, I’m going to take a shower.\" Ding Sihan got up and stretched.\nThen she glanced at Lin Li, who let out a pitiful sigh, hit right on the head by a pillow.\nDing Sihan hugged her chest, looking at Lin Li with extreme disdain: \"Lin Li, I’m a bit hungry. Make me a snack, and I’ll skip brushing teeth and eat after my bath.\"\nSuch demanding attitude, Uncle Ding is indeed overbearing.\n\"I want some too!\" Qu Wanqiu, who had only heard but not witnessed this hidden culinary god, was also very interested.\n\"What a shame, although I really want to serve you, I used up all the fridge ingredients this morning for breakfast, can’t make it.\" You could tell Lin Li truly regretted, his mouth formed a sad Nike swoosh.\nAfter all, although Lin Li mastered cooking, he didn’t find cooking terribly enjoyable yet.\nAfter trying to make breakfast for himself that morning, he found ordering takeout still more convenient.\n\"Then I’ll have to order takeout.\" After checking the fridge and realizing Lin Li wasn’t lying, Ding Sihan said regretfully.\n\"Ugh, what a pity.\"\nDing Sihan and Qu Wanqiu went upstairs, while Lin Li also started taking a shower.\n\"Lin Li, the takeout has arrived, can you grab it?\" Ding Sihan called from the third floor as Lin Li finished showering.\nThey’ve mastered the lazy dog technique too.\nCheck what’s been ordered, and sneak a bite if it’s tasty.\nThree minutes later.\nLin Li, with a stern expression, thudded up to the third floor, holding the takeout in his hand, looking grim, questioning Ding Sihan, \"Ding Sihan, come on, tell your dad, what takeout did you order?\"\n\"Ingredients, probably for three or four people. The leftovers, you can have it for breakfast tomorrow.\"\nSitting in front of the dressing mirror with Chen Yu Ying, both holding hair dryers to dry their wet hair, Ding Sihan replied just like a rich lady commanding her pretty maid, sounding righteous and confident.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou damn well call ordering takeout this kind of takeout?\n\"Why don’t you just order ready-made snacks?\" Lin Li questioned.\n\"You’re too eager to serve us, I can’t let you down.\" Ding Sihan replied.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Xiaodingding, do you know what you have to do before winning a woman’s heart through her stomach?\" After a moment of silence, Lin Li asked.\n\"What?\"\n\"First, you have to clamp the proximal and distal ends of the arteries, or the blood will spill out.\" Lin Li smiled.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nSo it’s literally grabbing the stomach?\n\"Ying Bao can also eat, you’re not allowed to poison it.\" Feeling a hint of danger, Ding Sihan pulled out her lifeline.\nOnly a middle finger could express Lin Li’s feelings.\nBut it didn’t really matter much.\nAlready preparing to go downstairs, Lin Li thudded back to the bathroom door, pretended to peek inside, then turned back and asked, \"Class rep, you didn’t leave a drop, huh?\"\nChen Yu Ying picked up the hairdryer to cover her face and blew in Lin Li’s direction.\n\"... Pervert, ugh.\"\nThis time it was heard.\nDing Sihan: \"I left mine, do you want it?\"\nDing Sihan: \"Lin Li, turn around and respond to this before going downstairs!\"\nDing Sihan: \"Why are you running away!\"\n...\nCooking, honestly, preparing for one or five people isn’t much different, so Lin Li and the group enjoyed another late-night snack.\nTransferred one dollar of heritage onto Qu Wanqiu’s face, so the \"clean it yourself\" person turned out to be her.\nLin Li returned to the second floor.\nAfter burping, Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li: \"Lin Li, it’s still early tonight, let’s play some games.\"\n\"Not playing.\" Lin Li refused.\n\"Not just me, Wang Ze and Haoyang are here too. The four of us together are quite formidable.\" Bai Bufan continued to persuade.\n\"It’s not them you’re supposed to support.\"\n\"Then you support me.\"\n\"That’s more hopeless than seeing a giant head appear on the city wall.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Lin Li, we’re going home tomorrow, and we’ve never teamed up to play during our outing. Don’t you think that’s unreasonable? Plus, it’s just after ten; even if you have a good routine, playing until twelve then sleeping isn’t late.\" Bai Bufan reasoned sincerely, with heartfelt words.\nLin Li sighed and started to chant:\n\"Bufan, remember, it’s not about not playing, it’s about playing at a slower and more measured pace. Play in order, play with moderation, transition from high quantity play to high quality play, strive to achieve playing first to lead to playing later, achieving collective playing.\nHowever, you’re currently just high quantity playing. You need high quality playing for me to follow along later.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Did the midterm exams really knock you silly? You’re saying such things,\" Bai Bufan had a face full of black lines.\n\"What do you mean? What do you mean by ’saying such things’? What are you trying to express? Who let you into my room? I don’t know you! Get out!\" Lin Li retreated cautiously on the rug, pointing at Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nIf you want to trump up charges, you won’t lack excuses.\nSeeing Bai Bufan still wanting to persuade, Lin Li suddenly squinted, puzzled, and asked, \"Did something burn?\"\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan tried sniffing hard.\nLin Li quickly realized: \"Oh, turns out I farted.\"\nWith his nose still sniffing and the scent already in it, Bai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You bastard!\" Bai Bufan widened his eyes.\nSaying something burned after farting, is this a true sword burial?\n\"Just consider it fulfilling your request to me during that Monopoly game.\" Lin Li spoke innocently, \"Now it’s your turn.\"\n\"How is it my turn now! How can I release one now!\" Bai Bufan roared while covering his nose, \"And mine wasn’t smelly, you ridiculous guy, what did you eat, why so stinky!\"\n\"It’s already generous letting you smell it, and now you want the recipe? You greedy little cat.\" Seeing Bai Bufan eyeing his trade secrets, Lin Li immediately became alert.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nBai Bufan swiftly fled the scene, leaving only his angry shouts in the air:\n\"I’m craving your ’beep’ cat! That’s a ’beep’ recipe!\"",

However, because the previous BUFF effect is also in effect, the increase compared to the overall is decreasing, so Lin Li adapted faster than the previous two times.\nThis time, the time left for Tyson is really not much.\nYouth is fleeting, and strength changes.\nAs for the reward doubling, it hit the comprehensive recovery ability in the Physical Improvement category.\nThis ability can recover various recoverable values in the human body, covering aspects like Mana, physical strength, and Spiritual Power, making it quite useful.\nHowever, Lin Li most wanted the system currency to be doubled.\nHad I known, I would have saved it to use on the Beauty task, but Lin Li only expresses this regret verbally and doesn’t actually worry about it. He turned his gaze towards the system.\n[A month flew by swiftly, the Cultivation Technique has initially formed, the path to ascension lies beneath your feet, but do not become prideful, the foundation remains unstable, you must work hard to fully master it, understand it thoroughly!]\n[Time-Limited Task triggered!]\n[Task One: Master the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique within two months.]\n[Reward: Title: Fruit of Persistence; Physical Improvement: Qi Blood increased by 100% and physical strength increased by 100%; Medium-grade Spirit Stone*5; System Currency*200.]\n[Fruit of Persistence: Upon equipping it, your efficiency in focusing on a task will slowly increase; the longer you cumulatively focus on this task, the greater the increase, with no upper limit.\nWhen the title is removed, cumulative time is not reset.]\n[The path of the body, forging has shown its initial effects, but has never been practical; there are still shortcomings. Seek sparring or actual combat to fill the gaps!]\n[Task triggered!]\n[Task Two: Seek out accomplished Body Cultivators for related sparring and gain victory or recognition (0/10)]\n[Task Reward: Martial Arts related random ability*1.]\nTriggered two tasks at once.\nNot bad.\nJust on the third, Lin Li’s task bar was still filled with six tasks, but just now, it almost only had the Beauty task left.\nAlmost lost the goal.\nNow with two more tasks, it looks much better.\nLin Li originally thought the next Task One would require him to persist in the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique for a year, but now it seems that’s not the case.\nTo master the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique within two months.\nThis Cultivation Technique, over the course of a month, Lin Li has practiced the physical Chapters all once, and due to a shortage of Spirit Stones at one point, he’s practiced approximately three and a half Spiritual Qi Chapters.\nHowever, Lin Li doesn’t think this task will be completed just by finishing the remaining half Chapter of Spiritual Qi, otherwise, it wouldn’t specifically mention mastery.\nI fear it requires considerable mastery.\nSince that’s the case, although the task doesn’t require it, Lin Li will continue to maintain the habit of rising early to practice every day.\nThis habit is quite nice.\nBenefits of getting up early: More time, able to have breakfast, clear thinking conducive to reflection, good complexion, boost immunity...\nBenefits of staying in bed: Joy, Joy, Joy, Joy...\nOne must admit, both have lots of benefits.\nHowever, Lin Li worries that after enjoying himself again, he’ll be infatuated with this feeling once more.\nLin Li hasn’t forgotten his early days when he got the system and needed to rise early every day, groaning right on schedule; at that time, without his boss’s protection and encouragement, he would have long given up.\nOnce I succeed in cultivation, I’ll torch all helicopters around the world for him.\nNow, it’s barely a habit, so better not abandon it.\nPerhaps the best time to practice the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique is morning before seven.\nThe rewards for this task are also extravagantly rich.\nSpirit Stones, system currency, Physical Improvement all are great, and there’s one title in Lin Li’s opinion that’s heaven-defying — [Fruit of Persistence].\nThough it mentions the increase is \"slow,\" the phrase \"no upper limit\" is too eye-catching.\nAnd changing the title doesn’t affect this accumulation, unlike [Thunder Attractor] whereby removing it resets progress.\nIf I had gotten this title on the first day I received the system, perhaps my efficiency in practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique now would be overwhelmingly high.\nOf course, it might not surpass the 50% from [Light of Xiling].\nBut [Light of Xiling] is restricted to orthodox cultivation techniques, whereas [Fruit of Persistence] has no such limits.\nTake sleeping as an example, theoretically, deep sleep could also be considered focused sleeping, so wouldn’t equipping this title during sleep mean that my sleep efficiency gradually increases, sleeping five minutes equates to being awake for two hours?\nFocused learning, focused exercise, anything can increase efficiency.\nFocus isn’t difficult for Lin Li, just thinking about it makes the future look promising, itching to get this title now.\nWait a minute, Lin Li’s expression froze.\n——How does focused masturbation count?\nWhen masturbating, I’m quite serious, my mind filled with lust, highly concentrated.\nTheoretically, the efficiency of masturbation might also increase, but the problem is how this improvement gets reflected on me?\nDoes it make you faster, or make it more pleasurable?\nIf it makes you faster, those situations could be treated with medication...\nIf you’re neither weak nor premature, isn’t that incredibly wretched?\nAlthough Lin Li has studied, given early humans were more susceptible to predator attacks during mating, at a point in human evolution, premature ejaculation must have been an evolutionary advantage.\nBut this advantage isn’t needed now.\nSystem! Answer me! Speak!\nThe damned system remains silent today.\nAnyway, never mind, in the future when I get the title, I’ll just remove it during lewd moments.\nMoreover, considering this now is premature, I can’t obtain it anytime soon.\nAs for the second sparring task, it might not be as easy to complete as before with \"accomplished\" being some sort of filter criteria.\nIt also requires me to win, which means I can’t pretend like I did with Xiaozhou and throw the match early.\nCould I beat Xiaozhou now?\nDoes this task require sparring with ten people, or can I spar ten times with one person?\nIf I smash Xiaozhou ten times, will I complete the task?\nLet’s try it tomorrow.\nFor now, let’s try something else.\n\"Looks like you’re not quite an accomplished Body Cultivator,\" Lin Li shook his head in disappointment.\nBai Bufan, whose brain was still offline: \"?\"\nHe was sleeping soundly when suddenly Lin Li dragged him into an exhilarating body confrontation, leaving him begging for mercy. Afterward, Lin Li tossed him aside, looking at him with disdain.\nNot a buddy.\nAre you crazy?\nCollege seniors should be quite afraid of Lin Li, after all, not everyone can pass this kind of preliminary test.\n\"What time is it now?\" Bai Bufan’s muddled brain could only muster this question.\n\"It’s 6:30 in the morning.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Lin Li, damn it!\" Bai Bufan struggled to get up, trying to grab Lin Li.\nLin Li tried to rush out the door.\nHe didn’t succeed, the lodging’s quality was decent.\n...\nContinuing to study driving test knowledge with \"Enhanced Learning,\" I’ve boasted in front of them, so I can’t let everyone down, I must surely get that license.\nIf I really can’t get it, I’ll look for those certificate engraving services on utility poles and walls I’ve seen since childhood; Lin Li has always been curious about the process behind them.\nAfter Chen Yu Ying woke up and practiced riding the electric scooter with her in the morning, Lin Li returned the scooter to the store.\nThe crooked merchant claimed it had some wear from his riding and deducted five bucks from the deposit.\nThe tire tread was gone, couldn’t you just draw it back with a marker?\nA problem that could be solved with a marker; why replace the tire?\nWhen Lin Li walked back to the lodge, the other three were already up and had mostly packed their stuff.\nSince they were heading home in the afternoon, no one went out for lunch, and they didn’t treat Lin Li like a workhorse to keep making meals; instead, they ordered takeout together.\nThis time it was actual takeout, after Lin Li watched everyone order, leaving Ding Sihan quite frustrated.\nLunch ended.\nThe table was a mess.\nThis time, before Lin Li could speak, everyone instinctively looked towards Qu Wanqiu, who also pulled out that one yuan with a mischievous smile.\nAlthough it was quite baffling, that one yuan had become an unspoken rule among them.\nToss it at someone, and that person has to \"clean up by themselves,\" Bai Bufan’s most significant action.\nLin Li pointed at Bai Bufan, and Bai Bufan pointed at Lin Li.\nQu Wanqiu stood up and started to walk around the dining table.\n\"Throwing in a handkerchief now?\" Lin Li said with a laugh.\nStopped laughing.\nIf I hadn’t said that, would the note have landed on Bai Bufan’s head?\nAlas, there were no ’ifs’.\n\"Yeah! Yeah!\" Surviving Bai Bufan cheered happily.\n\"Serves you right for tossing it to me yesterday, self-inflicted!\" Qu Wanqiu said proudly.\n\"Oh man, how was I supposed to know we’d order takeout at the lodge for lunch, I thought last night’s supper was the last meal. If I knew there was lunch, I would’ve saved it to toss to Ding Sihan at noon.\" Lin Li said regretfully.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Lin Li, you deserve it!\"\nThe four cold-hearted people just watched pitiful Lin Li clean up the mess all by himself, small, pitiful, and helpless.\nActually, they could’ve just left without cleaning anything, and the lodge should have someone come clean it, but since it was a ’freebie’, doing that wouldn’t leave a good impression.\nFor their last activity in the afternoon, everyone took the remaining snacks and drinks and headed to the lodge’s family KTV.\nWith five people singing with no problem, no one needed to go easy on anyone; if someone went off-tune or cracked, they’d immediately become the target of everyone’s ridicule, the people around were just that mean.\n——The people around included Lin Li, Lin Li, Lin Li, and Lin Li.\nEvery time someone sang poorly, Lin Li would immediately mock them, imitating them with sarcastic and ironic tones.\nNot even sparing Chen Yu Ying, it was truly an unbridled attack.\nSo when it was Lin Li’s turn to sing, everyone would immediately focus intently, listening closely, nitpicking, just waiting for Lin Li to make a tiny mistake so they could mock him back.\nUnfortunately, Deep Blue gave Lin Li some points this round.\nHehe.\n\"Thunk——\"\nLin Li was pinned against the wall, as a teary-eyed Bai Bufan grabbed his collar and with a voice choked with emotion demanded:\n\"I’ve been wanting to ask since the autumn outing! Lin Li! Tell me! Have you been attending other morning classes behind my back?\"\nWe clearly agreed to go together, obviously...\nHowever, faced with the tearful Bai Bufan, Lin Li, the cold and heartless man, looked calm:\n\"So what if I did, so what if I didn’t.\"\n\"Between us, it’s already over.\"\nBai Bufan covered his eyes with his arm, his voice hoarse: \"You betrayed me! We clearly agreed! What does this mean for the promises we made back then!\"\nLin Li instantly switched to a broadcaster’s tone:\n\"It’s a saying, ’sea vow and mountain alliance’, when lovers swear to love each other, metaphorically indicating that love should be as everlasting as the mountains and the sea, from Xin Qiji’s ’To the Prostitute by the Southern River’——’Parting tears are few, but pledges are always distant’.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 263: Chapter 216: In Business, Lin Li Has a Gift\n\"What prostitute? What’s the price?\" Bai Bufan’s ears automatically filtered out the most important thing.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Are you sick?\" The two said in unison.\n\"No, how do you even remember these things? Are you preparing for a trivia competition?\" Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li in surprise.\n\"It’s just something you can remember with one glance.\"\nLin Li shook off Bai Bufan’s hand, straightened his collar, and started showing off again.\nJoining a trivia competition is not impossible; after all, I heard there’s a question bank for that. I didn’t know before and was amazed when I watched it, thinking everyone was so smart, all-knowing.\nBai Bufan was silent for a moment, then suddenly spoke: \"Alliance of mountains and seas.\"\n\"Fishing for the moon in the sea.\" Lin Li immediately responded.\n\"Flowers before the moon.\"\nDing, Qu, Chen: \"?\"\nWhy did these two start playing idiom solitaire from zero frames? They only realized it now.\n\"Boundless prospects.\"\n\"Do what you can.\"\nWhen Bai Bufan said this idiom, both of them laughed.\n\"Do whatever you want.\" Lin Li smiled.\n\"A nice idiom,\" Bai Bufan jojo-ed up, covering his face and laughed, \"Then I’ll respond—with do whatever you want.\"\n\"Did you really give an answer without thinking? What a formidable opponent, I’ve got it! Do whatever you want!\"\n\"You’re not bad either, but my idiom repertoire is stronger! Do! Whatever! You! Want!\"\nWatching the two who just started shouting one idiom, the three girls with microphones were silent.\nWhat on earth are you two so excited about!\nThese two seemed like they had started idiom solitaire just for this moment.\n\"This is a KTV, not a place for idiom solitaire. Can we do things that are actually meant for KTV!\" Ding Sihan shook the microphone in her hand and complained helplessly.\n\"Fair enough.\"\nLin Li nodded, then said to Bai Bufan, \"Dude, stop messing around, let’s sing a bit, your fingers are turning white from soaking.\"\n\"I’m messing with your dam, I’m just warning you not to steal my fruit platter.\" Bai Bufan immediately got into the groove, tapped Lin Li’s hand, and gave him a disdainful glance, \"Wang Gang can stay, the rest of you can take your sisters out hurry and change a batch for me...\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"What kind of KTV is this! Isn’t this a bit too unorthodox!!\"\n\"It’s a business KTV, the quickest way to success.\" Lin Li said as if it was obvious.\nA princess doesn’t just appear in Disney; she can be in KTV too.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan received a scolding (microphone amplified version).\nThen, the five continued singing. To prevent Lin Li from continuing his wicked mouth, Bai Bufan was ordered to sit next to him and keep watch.\nAfter all, no move is as effective as just reporting you.\nIf there’s a sign, it’s going to be attacked, so Lin Li can only helplessly behave.\nThe afternoon passed with song after song.\nThere were duets, solo performances, and group singing.\nWhenever Lin Li and Bai Bufan sang, they brought flair to the performance, swaying as they sang, calling it ’Double Swaying Dance.’\nAlthough it was silly, the atmosphere was high, so even when Qu Wanqiu and Ding Sihan sang, they would stand and sway a bit, not feeling shy at all.\nWhen it’s time to tease, tease; at this time, Lin Li would only cheer and encourage energetically.\n...\nChen Yu Ying’s phone rang, and Lin Li, holding the microphone, paused, leaving only the accompaniment in the room.\nChen Yu Ying answered the phone, stepped outside, exchanged a few words, then came back and nodded to everyone, explaining: \"My dad’s driving this way, should be here in about ten minutes.\"\n\"That’s really close, who is he preparing for?\" Lin Li sharply commented.\nChen Yu Ying blinked.\nIt’s really hard to guess.\nLin Li snapped his fingers: \"Since it’s about to end, ’An Unforgettable Evening’, let’s start!\"\n\"Okay~\" The other three slumped on the KTV sofa, though tired, all supported this decision.\n\"You guys are really delicate.\" Lin Li looked at them and laughed.\nIt’s already four in the afternoon, and they’ve been singing intensely for three or four hours; singing seriously, sometimes even getting up and swaying, so now everyone is pretty tired except for Lin Li.\nLin Li indeed was more hyped than them, but his Qi Blood was strong, and he recovered quickly. Even if he’s tired, a one-song break could let him sing three or four songs.\n\"Can still sing two songs, ’An Unforgettable Evening,’ one more...\" Chen Yu Ying put the phone on the sofa, headed to the song selection station, hesitated for a moment, then looked at Lin Li: \"Lin Li, have you heard ’The Summer Blown By the Wind’?\"\n\"Never heard of it, whose song is it?\" Lin Li shook his head and curiously asked.\n\"Guo Donglin and Jin Sha sang it, it’s an old song, pretty nice.\" Bai Bufan seemed to know, helping to explain to Lin Li.\n\"Guo Donglin can sing?\" Qu Wanqiu sat up straight, a little confused.\n\"Guo Donglin is Lin Junjie, Lin Junjie is Guo Donglin, isn’t that common sense?\" Lin Li glanced at Qu Wanqiu when he heard it, finding her naïve.\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nThis, is this common sense?\nWhose common sense is this?\n\"Alright then, never mind.\" Hearing that Lin Li couldn’t sing it, Chen Yu Ying looked down with some regret and continued operating the song selection screen.\n\"Don’t give up just yet, didn’t you remember? This song is just like cheating, I can’t sing it now, but I can learn, give me a minute to listen to half of it.\" Lin Li snapped his fingers and grabbed his phone, immediately heading outside.\nThree seconds later, the KTV door opened, Lin Li poked his head in and added: \"Turns out it’ll take longer, NetEase Cloud wants me to watch a 30-second ad first, so one and a half minutes.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nThis change of plan isn’t Lin Li’s fault for sure.\nSoon, Lin Li returned triumphantly, came to Chen Yu Ying’s side, confidently hit play, and reached for the microphone on the table, clinking it as if toasting with Chen Yu Ying’s.\n\"I’ve got it now.\"\n\"Mm.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, she believed him.\n\"[Remember yesterday_ that summer_the moment the breeze blew_ seem to overturn everything_ only loneliness willing to settle]\" Even though he only listened to it once, Lin Li replaced Guo Donglin, looked at the lyrics on the big screen, and sang beautifully.\n\"[Now the wind still blows_ autumn rain follows_ the heat in the heart doesn’t fade]\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice was very ethereal, giving a new feel compared to Jin Sha’s.\nHe looked at the lyrics, she looked at him.\nOccasionally, when he remembered the next line and didn’t need to look at the screen, he’d turn and look at her, and she would give a sweet smile.\n...\n\"Blue memories suddenly turn into sunny summer\"\n\"The warmth in the air isn’t far, winter doesn’t seem to linger\"\n...\n\"This summer blown by the wind\"\n\"This summer blown by the wind\"\nAt the end of the duet, the two exchanged a glance and tacitly changed the last word from ’that’ to ’this’.\nAs Lin Li clutched the microphone, the cold wind in the KTV followed his command, blowing wantonly in the room.\nThinking it was the air conditioner suddenly cooperating at this moment, Chen Yu Ying’s smile became even brighter.\n\"Wahoo!!!\"\nAfter the song ended, the three on the sofa immediately applauded for the duo.\n\"By the way, it’s already getting colder now, this summer, indeed officially ends, let’s toast one last time on National Day!\" Lin Li put down the microphone, took his drink from the coffee table with his left hand, and opened the front camera with his right.\nEveryone laughed and squeezed into the frame, capturing the moment of clinking glasses.\nThe group’s sing-along of \"An Unforgettable Evening\" ended, and they stood, quickly tidied up the trash, and left.\n\"Why have you been covering your butt?\" Lin Li asked Bai Bufan in confusion.\n\"It’s nothing.\" After a whole afternoon of singing, Bai Bufan’s voice was a bit hoarse, he shook his head and naturally let go of his hand.\nBut when he let go, his expression changed, immediately crossing his arms behind his back again, explaining, \"Just a habit of putting my hands behind, it feels comfortable.\"\nDamn, what’s going on?\nWhy does it feel like there’s wind blowing on my butt since we left the family KTV?\nNervously smiling, Bai Bufan felt a slight anxiety inside.\nMama Yinglong, save me!\n——After all, the Wind Control has already been activated, might as well not waste the remaining time.\n\"\"\"",

You definitely have the makings of a pillar.\" Seeing Lin Li so on board, Chen Zhongping didn’t hesitate to compliment him.\n\"Thank you, Uncle.\" Lin Li bowed slightly in thanks, then quietly glanced at Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Thanks, class president.\"\nBut Lin Li, passing this look, saw the same confusion in her eyes.\nEh? So it wasn’t the class president who put in a good word for him with her dad? Then why is Old Deng suddenly so nice to him?\nSeeing Lin Li politely thanking him, Chen Zhongping nodded approvingly.\n...\nReturning to the residential area, Lin Li went upstairs, used the key to open his home door, and saw Wu Min sitting on the sofa watching the living room TV.\n\"Back home?\" Wu Min inquired.\nLin Li looked down at himself already inside the house, thought about it, and stepped back out: \"I’m not back yet.\"\nWu Min: \"?\"\nThis was Lin Li’s vocal rebellion against the human habit of asking redundant questions.\nJust like when Bai Bufan came out of the bathroom, there was always someone who would casually ask, \"Having a meal?\"\nUtterly absurd, did they think Bai Bufan went to the bathroom to eat a meal, instead of, you know, using it?\n\"Sister Min, what’s for dinner?\" Lin Li re-entered, took off his shoes, and asked.\nEarlier today, Lin Li had already informed Wu Min that he would be back before dinner.\nSo there was definitely dinner prepared at home.\n\"Dongpo pork, garlic vermicelli shrimp, scallion oil fish, sweet and sour ribs...\" Wu Min immediately started listing the dishes.\nLin Li was a bit moved: \"Mom, I’ve only been away for a few days, there’s no need to make so much. I can’t finish it. It’s so sumptuous, it’s like I haven’t been home in four years.\"\nFeeling moved, Lin Li eagerly lifted the food cover.\nWow, a golden legend.\nOn the dining table was a whole plate of dried small shrimps!\nThat’s all.\nLin Li’s smile froze on his face. He returned to the living room to question Wu Min: \"Mom, where are my Dongpo pork, garlic vermicelli shrimp, scallion oil fish, and other dishes filled with motherly love?\"\nWu Min didn’t even lift her eyelids, focused on watching TV: \"That’s the menu from the community canteen today. If you’re hungry later, get there early. They cook less during holidays, go late, and it might be sold out.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"No cooking at home?\" Lin Li was incredulous.\nEven though he had announced he wouldn’t eat dinner at home in advance.\n\"Just me, why bother cooking? It’s better to eat something good out, especially when you’re not here, I might as well splurge.\" Wu Min laughed cheerfully.\nDon’t disturb me, let me think.\n\"Mom, I have a heartfelt question. Am I really your biological son? If I was picked up from a heap of trash, just tell me, I can accept it.\" Thoughtful Lin Li, heartbroken, said.",

I want a paternity test! I’m definitely a child you snatched from traffickers or an orphanage!\" Lin Li was unwilling to believe.\nWu Min sighed and looked at Lin Li, \"If you were adopted or bought from traffickers, why would I choose someone like you? Do I have something wrong with my head?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nEh?\nNot adopted?\nLin Li sat on the ground, trying to use everything he had learned to counter Wu Min’s absurd claim.\nDamn, I failed.\nMy mom’s words really sting.\n\"Hmm, no test needed, I must be biological.\" Lin Li conceded, perhaps his cooking skills but lack of love for it came from Wu Min’s genes.\nCarrying his backpack, Lin Li headed towards his room, but Wu Min called out to stop him.\n\"Lin Li, your deliveries are all in the sunroom,\" Wu Min frowned slightly, \"those backpacks, clothes, shields, and protective gear, what are you using them for?\"\nWu Min wouldn’t open Lin Li’s deliveries without permission, but these items weren’t discreetly shipped, so seeing the descriptions outside was normal for Wu Min.\nLin Li immediately posed with an air of arrogance over the world:\n\"These are my tactical gear. I’m planning a rebellion, to take over Nansang Middle School armed. If Principal Nansang can be Mr. Wang, then why can’t I be Mr. Lin?\"\nWu Min: \"...\"\nThis cursed child.\n\"I should’ve swapped for another child when adopting.\" Wu Min rubbed her temples in frustration, revealing a shocking secret as she waved her hand dismissively like swatting flies, \"Don’t waste too much energy on this hobby; what’s important now is your studies.\"\n\"Haha, you probably don’t even know your adopted child’s rank in this month’s exam, do you?\" Lin Li immediately became proud upon hearing this.\n\"If I didn’t know, you’d be getting scolded by me right now, Lin Li. You should understand how hard it is for me to hold back from scolding you.\"\n\"Hehe.\"\n\"Don’t get too arrogant, keep it up.\" In reality, Wu Min remained calm, having already bragged to relatives like the seventh aunt and eighth uncle, and siblings took turns boasting, \"Mom always believed in your ability. Aim for a 985 or 211 university.\"\n\"I don’t like drinking, I’m not interested in bar dancing.\" Lin Li waved his hand dismissively and dragged his deliveries back into his room.\nHe took out a crumpled one-yuan note from his pocket, placed it in the cabinet, and flattened it.\nThis note carries pleasant memories too.\nFirst, he went downstairs to have a meal and casually ate \"Bai Bufan’s sausages\" before returning to his room where he immediately opened all his deliveries.\nThere were many things: civilian-standard bulletproof vests, tactical backpacks, shields, isolation clothes, helmets...\nHe also bought weapons like tactical knives, fruit knives, iron rods. However, Lin Li had them delivered to a station instead of home, since if Wu Min saw these, she might really suspect he wanted to become an American-style boy at Nansang Middle School.\nThis scattered collection cost Lin Li over two thousand. This was already a result of exercising thrift.\nAs for quality... passable.\nAt Tokyo University, collecting these as non-professionals is considered a niche ’hobby’, which means high premiums for niche items; those of good quality have unit prices exceeding a thousand, which is normal.\nA top-tier exploration and attack-defense gear set requires at least a hundred thousand.\nAfter unpacking everything, Lin Li tested them by wearing or handling them.\nAlthough Lin Li had gotten much stronger, his frame was still on the slim side. The sizes fit but weren’t snug, yet given the limitations, they were passable.\nToday is the sixth, Sunday, and tomorrow begins a new week.\nLin Li continued studying driving test knowledge and awaited tonight.\nWhile working on questions on his phone, a message from Bai Bufan popped up.\n\"Bai Bufan: Lin Li, if you suddenly fell into a movie, which film would you wish it to be?\"\nLin Li laughed.\nLow EQ: Buddy, give me some film codes.\nHigh EQ: If you suddenly fell into a movie, which film would you wish it to be?\n\"Lin Li: ’Warhammer 40k: Space Marine’\"\n\"Bai Bufan: ?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: If you can use this, then you are this ’Like’ ’Like’ ’Like’\n\"Lin Li: I think the Emperor is still charming.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Then you are very loyal, you better really want to go, don’t just talk loyalty, when asked everybody backs out. Besides this film, anything else?\"\n\"Lin Li: You’ve got so many in your own cloud storage, why ask me? Haven’t you quit this crap?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: I’m quitting right now, Lin Li, I’ve discovered a very effective quitting method. As long as you use once when you feel like using, you won’t want to use anymore. It’s super effective! You should try it too.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWho let this genius out?\nWork hard, work when learning driving test knowledge, leisure time dedicated to refining Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique, time passes into late night, midnight approaches.\n[Update complete]\nPunctual update.\nLin Li immediately opened the interface, exceeding his expectations, was that the text still hadn’t appeared. However, as he expected, the illuminated button among three was once again the first one, which he guessed as ’Departure’.\nHe can go to that world again.\nLin Li stood up from his chair, took a deep breath, loosened up, then lay on the big bed.\nNot going tonight.\nThe preparations aren’t done yet; no weapons on hand, not to mention Wu Min is at home. Lin Li’s plan at least needs to wait until tomorrow when Wu Min goes to work, then he can go in the evening.\nIf not smooth, delay it.\nIt’s basically concluded now that each week there’s an opportunity to ’return to reality’, no need to rush.\nDelaying till the weekend this week is fine.\nEven if delaying causes waste of this week’s chance, Lin Li won’t feel regretful.\nNo joke, Lin Li still feels some trepidation about that world, even with armor that revives you, he remains cautious, better to prepare as much as possible.\nOpen [Marketplace].\nSpent 50 system currency to buy another \"Recharge Crystal\" upping inventory to 2, then utilized this week’s free refresh on its third slot.\n\"Random Quality Spirit Stone\" and \"Fortune Talisman,\" Lin Li won’t touch them for now.\n[You’ve refreshed to A+ Combat Armor (Lin Li Perfect Model): 1000 system currency, replace?]\nAnother Mecha.\nTwo Mechas even priced the same, the only difference is the last one was B++, this time is A+.\nLast time Lin Li could easily abandon, but this time he couldn’t.\nCurrently, he has 520 system currencies, still half missing, honestly speaking, accumulating five hundred system currencies in a week isn’t realistic, even when the next refresh opportunity comes, he couldn’t replace.\nBut after thinking for a moment, Lin Li chose to replace.\nBecause cumulative system currency has reached 2050, getting another 50 unlocks the fourth slot, providing one more choice.\nTend to wake early today, so Lin Li sleeps.\n...\nDespite no task binding, Lin Li still woke promptly.\nToday Lin Li chose to head to the community park to practice.\n\"Good morning, Grandpa Zhou.\"\nSeeing Lin Li, Zhou Youwei nodded happily.\nCunning remains cunning, being absent for several days really made morning exercise feel missing something.\nUsually when Lin Li is nearby, imagining practicing is combating him, it really energizes the effort.\nFocused over an hour passing, until feeling further practice would significantly diminish returns, Lin Li stopped.\nThe continuous drizzle over National Day cooled the weather, no longer making practice cause a sweaty mess.\nAnd regarding personal condition, the exhaustive fatigue like Bai Bufan is early extinguished, after focused practice, at most the breath is slightly heavy.\nStood firmly, stabilized breathing, Lin Li turned towards Zhou Youwei still practicing Tai Chi.\nClearly sneakily observing him but immediately averting gaze pretending not to watch when noticing his attention.\nStill sneakily learning, old trendy Korean style old man.\nPerhaps it’s time to attempt mission two.\n\"Grandpa Zhou,\" Lin Li stepped forward, inquiring earnestly.\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"Could we spar once again?\" Lin Li sincerely asked.\nZhou Youwei was stunned.\nThen Lin Li noticed Zhou Youwei seemingly trembling —— attention to detail after enhanced insight easily spots these small cues.\nDoes this excite him so much?\n\"Uh, Grandpa Zhou, if it’s not feasible it’s fine,\" Lin Li quickly added.\n\"Spar! Absolutely spar!\" Zhou Youwei immediately shouted and gestured, cutting off Lin Li, his eyes seemed a little moist:\n\"I’ve waited for this day... for too long...\"\nLin Li: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 266: Chapter 218: Lip Reading, Great! Lip Reading Must Be Learned\nLooking at the excited Zhou Youwei, Lin Li blinked.\nIs it really necessary?\nSo Xiaozhou has wanted to spar with me for a while already?\nWhy didn’t you say so earlier? Based on our sisterly relationship, I would definitely have laughed and refused—who in their right mind would fight an old man for fun? If not for the system, I wouldn’t have made such a ridiculous request.\nBut for the current Lin Li, this is definitely good news.\nA mutual pursuit, so to speak.\n\"That’s great, Grandpa Zhou. I was worried you wouldn’t agree. Shall we start now?\" So Lin Li was already eager to spar with the old man.\nIf a war eagle can endure an old lady, Lin Li can surely endure an old man!\nBut Zhou Youwei quickly calmed down and took a cautious step back.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"I need a bit of time to prepare, I... I need to get myself into the best condition,\" Zhou Youwei spoke carefully.\nAt this point, Zhou Youwei hadn’t realized Lin Li’s trap. He definitely couldn’t follow the other’s pace; caution was key.\n\"This... this serious?\"\nLin Li was confused, rubbed the back of her neck, and said quietly.\nZhou Youwei inwardly sneered. Flustered already? Sure enough, the cat’s out of the bag.\n\"How about this: let’s meet here at nine o’clock to spar, how about that?\" Zhou Youwei squinted at Lin Li, continuing to press forward.\n\"Sure.\"\nLin Li had no objections; she could just go grab some breakfast.\n...\nAt nine in the neighborhood park on a holiday, there were even fewer people than at six in the morning.\nLin Li didn’t cut it close and came down at eight fifty, only to find Zhou Youwei already waiting.\n\"Grandpa Zhou, should we start early or wait until nine?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Now.\"\nZhou Youwei nodded mysteriously.\nEverything was ready, just lacking criminal evidence against Lin Li.\n\"Alright, Grandpa, let’s clarify first: friendly sparring, stop when necessary, and if either side falls or admits defeat, they lose. Is that okay?\"\nLin Li stretched nearby, confirming while warming up.\nJust don’t let anyone get seriously hurt.\nHowever, Zhou Youwei appeared visibly healthy, and he hadn’t been short of breath for quite some time, suggesting he was taking good care of his body.\n\"Just start. I’m quite sturdy.\"\nStill using these distractions, are we? But this time, I won’t be fooled.\n\"Alright.\"\nLin Li stood in front of Zhou Youwei, posed in the Wing Chun stance, then, after a sound effect—\"Taiji, Lin Li!\"\nZhou Youwei: \"...\"\nThat familiar feeling of darkness before one’s eyes returned.\nIt’s back, all back.\nLin Li couldn’t help it; mainly, the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique taught more about health than combat, leaving actual fighting to intuition.\n\"Bring it on!\" Zhou Youwei shouted.\nToday is the day I reveal Lin Li’s true colors!\nHearing this, Lin Li made a loose fist and charged at Zhou Youwei.\nZhou Youwei smiled, just like last time!\nHehe.\nI bet your gun has no bullets!\nHaving anticipated Lin Li’s move, Zhou Youwei let his arms fall.\nLast time, he instinctively retaliated, giving Lin Li a chance to act hurt, but this time, with no hands raised, surely he wouldn’t fly off again?\nZhou Youwei’s eyes were filled with smugness, his lips curled in a smile, listening for the sound of a fist.\nWait a minute.\nWhy is there the sound of a fist?\nBu Hao! Lin Li’s gun seems to have bullets!\nWhen Lin Li’s hand landed on Zhou Youwei’s shoulder, Zhou Youwei’s eyes widened in shock—Lao Lin, are you serious?\nAnd Lin Li’s wide eyes were also full of shock—Xiaozhou, are you faking it?\nDamn, Xiaozhou, you’re pulling that sham again!\nWe’re so close and you’re still faking it with me. You’re being disrespectful! You’re shameless! You’re not being a good person!\nLin Li initially thought Zhou Youwei’s motionless stance was some Tai Chi move!\nNow it was clear; it was just fake behavior. Fortunately, for safety’s sake, Lin Li didn’t use her full strength from the start, and having the buff of body control made it easy to pull back the force.\nAlmost all power was pulled back.\nBut Zhou Youwei, already unsteady, still staggered back and plopped down on the ground after Lin Li’s wrist nudged him lightly.\n[Seek out a body cultivator with a certain level of achievement for sparring, and achieve victory or recognition (1/10)]\nThe task was unexpectedly partially completed.\n\"Grandpa Zhou, are you okay?\" But Lin Li’s attention wasn’t on this; she looked cautiously at Zhou Youwei, who was gasping for air, not daring to approach: \"...I practically pulled back all the force.\"\nShe looked around, searching for a camera to save herself.\nEh?\nDid there really seem to be a camera?\n\"No, it’s nothing.\" Zhou Youwei said darkly, standing up at this point.\nLin Li breathed a sigh of relief; there’s still some respect for elders.\nRealizing Lin Li was serious, Zhou Youwei perked up, started warming up, and was even more excited. If it’s serious, he wasn’t afraid!\n\"I wasn’t prepared just now, Lin Li, let’s go again.\"\n\"Grandpa, I’m not playing with you anymore.\"\nRecalling how one punch almost cost Wu Min his home and car, turning himself into a second-generation debtor, Lin Li was a bit nervous, waved her hand, and backed away.\nZhou Youwei: \"...\"\nI’ve gotten ready, and now you’re saying this?\n\"That was an accident! I wasn’t faking it!\" The familiar look on Lin Li’s face urged Zhou Youwei to quickly explain.\n\"Goodbye, Grandpa.\"\n\"Come back here!\"\n\"Happy National Day.\"\nLin Li ran even faster.",

Look at how you scared Xiaolin. After all your effort, is this what you wanted me to see?\"\nZhou Youwei: \"...\"\nCould it be... Could this also be part of Lin Li’s plan?\nZhou Youwei felt out of breath.\n...\n\"No wonder the reward is just one ability. Although the number of people required is a bit high, it’s still relatively easy to complete,\" Lin Li thought to himself after returning home.\nThe rule that you lose if you fall was decided by the two of them, yet the system recognized such a victory in the challenge.\nThat makes it simple; I just need to find nine more body cultivators who meet the conditions.\nAfter thinking for a moment, Lin Li began to search for nearby gyms on the map.\nIf those muscular guys aren’t body cultivators, then Lin Li doesn’t know what qualifies as one.\nActually, Xiaozhou could count, and probably the instructors or even students of taekwondo or sanda fighting classes would also count, but in this day and age, challenging gyms doesn’t seem popular. You can’t just show up at their door saying, \"Hi, I’m here to fight. Oh, I won’t fight those who haven’t achieved anything or those who’ve achieved too much. I’m looking for someone with moderate achievements.\"\nIf confronted by a few guys practicing Chen Hegao’s unrestricted fighting style, who might aim for the groin right away, that would be disastrous.\nIt’s still the gym guys who are easier to find and deal with.\nIf I encounter someone with a sharp head, it’s possible to win them over without a fight.\nBesides, Lin Li believes this is the mission’s purpose since he hasn’t even learned the official fighting cultivation technique yet.\nRiding his bike to the nearest gym, Lin Li saw a huge banner nearby that read:\n\"Reading is to calmly talk to idiots; fitness is to make idiots calmly talk to you.\"\nVery reasonable, Lin Li quite agreed.\n\"Hello.\" Upon entering, the front desk girl greeted Lin Li, \"Is it your first time here? Is there anything I can help you with?\"\nThe front desk was familiar with regular clients, and since Lin Li was looking around curiously, it was obvious it was his first time, so she asked.\n\"I want to apply for a card.\"\n\"Okay, may I ask which type of card you plan on applying for? Here, I recommend the annual card and lifelong card, which have the best value for money, plus you get personal training sessions as a bonus...\" Seeing a potential performance boost, the front desk girl’s smile grew even brighter.\n\"A single-use card.\"\nFront desk: \"?\"\n\"By the way, can I use the 9.9 yuan experience coupon from Meituan?\"\nThe opportunity for better sales slipped away.\nExperience, just experience. Applying for a single-use card, what’s that about!\nThe front desk nodded slightly helplessly: \"Just show me the QR code after the purchase is completed. The experience coupon is limited to a one-time entry; please be cautious when leaving.\"\n\"Thank you.\" Lin Li secured the wristband as proof and then pushed open the gym door.\nA DJ version of an English song Lin Li had never heard was playing, and it was quite catchy.\nThere wasn’t the expected sweaty smell; instead, there was a close-to-six-godly fragrance. Several muscular guys were working out, and after glancing at Lin Li, they returned to their routines.\nIn comparison with them, Lin Li, who had bulked up a bit, was slender like a bamboo pole again.\nIn front of the floor-to-ceiling mirror in the gym, several women wearing yoga pants and sports bras were posing provocatively amid their sweaty exertions.\nOda Nobunaga had already proven that instincts can’t be resisted.\nInstinct urged Lin Li to take a glance, and then Lin Li widened his eyes and looked a second time.\nWait a minute.\nDamn.\nAs everyone knows, yoga pants are exceptionally form-fitting.\nBut just now, when that woman squatted to take a photo, Lin Li somehow read her lips.\nThis is obscene, isn’t it?\nLin Li looked around at the bulky men again, and surprisingly, no one noticed this. Their eyes showed no lust, only a craving for muscles.\nIf Bai Bufan were here, he would definitely speak loudly to get her attention or act out as if playing basketball, then do a fadeaway shot, perhaps even knock himself down just to make this lip-reading lady notice him.\nAlthough he always blabbers about small breasts small breasts, who the hell cares? In any case, Bai Bufan is very honest.\nThe woman also noticed Lin Li, but after one look, she stopped paying attention.\nThough quite handsome and pleasant to look at, he wasn’t her type.\nJudging someone based on appearance is indeed too vulgar and one-sided; she prefers using a bank balance for evaluation, finding a beauty in numbers.\nThe most expensive thing on Lin Li seemed to be the phone in his hand, so he didn’t make the cut.\nShe took out a bottle of mineral water, pouring it over her head as if it were sweat, and continued taking pictures for her fishing activities.\nAnd Lin Li didn’t forget his mission. He first went to the equipment area and tried out the barbells and dumbbells but then frowned slightly.\nCompared to a month ago, his strength now was vastly different, but when compared to others, merely talking about the force exerted, it was far from reaching inhuman levels. Whether it’s Qi Blood or comprehensive recovery ability, it mainly improved his endurance.\nEven though there’s a [Power Charge] to assist, without formal training and unfamiliar with exertion techniques, Lin Li wasn’t confident about surpassing these muscle-bound guys in using the equipment.\nMost fitness moves can’t rely on just right-hand strength; they need full-body coordination, which could be compromised by the overly strong right hand affecting the overall movement.",

Not wearing white socks, no beard, not a buzz cut. Doesn’t look like someone from Nantong but rather a helpful big brother, so he nodded: \"Yes.\"\n\"For your first time, I’d recommend starting with this...\"\nZhai Kai earnestly began guiding Lin Li on how to work out.\nHe was genuinely helpful.\n\"...Thanks, bro, but, hey, can I challenge you a bit? I want to see the gap between us.\"\nLin Li nodded as he listened, and after the other finished speaking, he got straight to the point.\nKind of figured it out; let’s just try arm wrestling with the right hand only.\nUpon hearing this, Zhai Kai immediately took off his vest, then rolled up the loose legs of his shorts, forcing them into ’triangle shorts,’ revealing his muscular leg muscles, and began posing in front of Lin Li.\n\"Keep it up, with a few years of solid training, you might look like me,\" Zhai Kai said proudly.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis isn’t the kind of challenge I meant.\n\"Hey, can you touch here with your hand?\"\nNoticing Zhai Kai’s biceps were about the size of his head, Lin Li curiously poked the middle of Zhai Kai’s back.\n\"Can’t reach!\" Zhai Kai said proudly, \"This is the badge of honor in fitness, only real strong guys can’t reach it.\"\n\"Impressive,\" Lin Li acknowledged sincerely.\nZhai Kai then lowered his voice and handed Lin Li a bottle of Six Gods, \"You see that mosquito bite on the middle? Right below where you just poked. Can you scratch it for me and spray a bit of cologne too, thanks.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThe most helpless person on earth has been found, the source of the Six Gods smell in the gym has been located.\nMaybe, there’s no need to sprinkle itch powder on armless folks to speedrun Hell; gym beefcakes can achieve the same effect.\nAfter helping out a bit, Lin Li spoke up: \"Hey, can we arm wrestle?\"\nMight devices need full body strength, not Lin Li’s strong suit, so he wanted to try pure right-hand strength at arm wrestling first.\nLin Li felt he might have a winning chance here.\n\"Sure, I’ll spot you at a forty-five-degree angle,\" Zhai Kai gladly agreed, seeing Lin Li’s skinny arms and legs, he spoke confidently.\nLin Li stayed silent.\nThey went to the cafeteria table in the gym, there were a few guys nearby injecting themselves with tech.\nLin Li was a bit reserved, he checked the best way to apply strength in arm wrestling, then seriously posed, while the other side seemed much more relaxed, their hands casually laid on the table.\nTheir hands gripped each other, at a 45-degree angle, making it difficult for Zhai Kai to exert strength.\n\"Hey, when I say start, we’ll start.\" Lin Li took a deep breath, activated [Charge], and spoke.\n\"Okay.\" Zhai Kai was very relaxed, his body still wasn’t tense, but he did get slightly more serious, staring at their hands.\n\"Three—two—start!\"\n\"Whoosh—\"\nIn an instant, the opponent’s hand was pinned to the table by Lin Li.\n[...and achieve victory or recognition (2/10)]\n\"Champions! We’re the champions! We will we will rock you!\" Even this sneaky task could be completed? No wonder it’s my system! Pure Sword Tomb! Mighty Lin Li excitedly stood up and cheered, his voice thrilled.\nZhai Kai: \"?\"\nHe didn’t exert any strength at all!\n\"Where’s the one? Where was the ’one’ in the countdown just now?\" He asked, eyes wide.\n\"I’m the one.\" Lin Li explained.\nThe name of the group with three people and a dog hasn’t even changed yet, what else would I be but one.\nZhai Kai: \"???\"\nBirth!! Birth!!\nHere I am, giving earnest fitness guidance to this newbie, and this is the betrayal I get in return!\nZhai Kai’s darkest day.\nPeople are not what they were!

Let’s exchange WeChat, we can chat more in the future.\" A guy got up, leaned over, and asked Lin Li hopefully.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Don’t mess with me, bro.\"\n\"I know, if anyone’s messing, it’s you messing with me.\"\nThough this conversation had happened with Bai Bufan before, Lin Li couldn’t find it funny at all.\n\"Just joking, bro, sorry sorry, I’m not into guys...\" Lin Li immediately stepped back, sincerely apologizing.\nEven though he liked joking about being gay, jokes aside, he’d rather take a knife to the back than deal with that drama.\nIt’s fine for shields to clash, but spears against spears cause damage, so when encountering a real gay person in reality, Lin Li ran faster than anyone.\n\"Alright, nevermind, if you ever change your mind, feel free to find me.\" The guy still left Lin Li an option or rather a back door.\nLin Li smoothed the goosebumps on his arms.\n\"It’s nothing, he won’t do anything to you, who told you to call yourself number one.\"\n\"But that’s not important now, let’s go again, this time I’ll call it.\" Zhai Kai tapped the table with a bit of schadenfreude, and his gaze at Lin Li was somewhat unfriendly.\n\"Alright.\"\nNormally, having won once, Lin Li would act cocky.\nBut Zhai Kai’s muscles clearly told Lin Li this wasn’t a normal situation, so Lin Li nodded and sat down again.\n\"Bro, can we set a rule that the one whose hand gets pressed down is the winner?\" Lin Li asked before starting.\nIf the sparring rules could be set by himself, would the system agree?\n\"Huh? Why? No need, just do it normally.\" Zhai Kai frowned and then shook his head.\nIt was clear that he just wanted to save face, so Lin Li said no more and focused on his arm.\nIf he lost, so be it; if he won, it would be a chance to see if he could complete two tasks with the same person.\n\"Three, two, one, start!\"\nZhai Kai widened his eyes because he found out that his and Lin Li’s hands were completely stuck at a forty-five-degree angle, not flipping over as he expected to pin Lin Li’s hand to the table.\nAnd the stalemate only lasted a moment because neither the angle nor his body posture allowed for much strength exertion; when the explosive force disappeared, Zhai Kai could only watch his hand rapidly press downward, touching the table.\nHis opponent didn’t cheat this time, but he still lost.\nLin Li felt a bit regretful because no new task was completed; it seemed one person could only accomplish it once.\nBut fortunately, there were plenty of people in the gym.\n\"I’m still the champion! Next, please!!\" Lin Li stood up and continued his cheer.\nThe purpose of his loud shouting just now was to attract more people’s attention here.\nPlus, arm wrestling was something that attracted some attention in small circles, and quite a few people were already curious and turned their gaze here; hearing Lin Li’s voice, they came over.\n\"Wait a minute, again.\" Zhai Kai couldn’t sit still anymore, this time his unfriendly expression was gone, left with a bit of embarrassment; he got up and pressed on Lin Li’s shoulder, pushing him down.\nThen he first squeezed Lin Li’s right hand, especially the forearm muscle, then pinched the bicep, looking astonished and puzzled: \"Bro, how exactly are you producing that strength, is your hand solid?\"\nNo numerical value at all, where’s this strength coming from?\nUsing some enhancement?\nThen Zhai Kai continued:\n\"I let my guard down just now, let’s have a fair one this time, I’m a bit curious if your strength is really greater than mine.\"\nBy this time, some other fitness enthusiasts nearby also gathered around.\n\"Three, two, one, go!\"\nWhen they saw the two hands stalling in the middle, the onlooking muscular guys widened their eyes.\nZhai Kai’s arm girth was almost three times as that of Lin Li, who they perceived as a skinny stick, yet the two were in a stalemate; this scene was incredibly incongruent, not following the basic rules at all.\nWas it a show match?\nLin Li was also somewhat surprised by this result; doubling his power, his right arm could already reach such a level.\n—He didn’t need to double to even the play, Lin Li could totally win.\nLin Li hadn’t even reached his limit yet.\nFurthermore, the endurance enhancement brought by Qi Blood had been Lin Li’s biggest change over the past month, and the power increase was just a subtle effect of everyday training and the nourishment from Spiritual Qi.\nTo know, Lin Li over these months had only been training an hour every morning; apart from refining the Spiritual Qi from items like \"duck blood bottles\" and \"famous sword\", he used maybe a few dozen inferior Spirit Stones on himself.\nBeing able to win doesn’t mean needing to win.\nWinning didn’t provide any reward, and if Zhai Kai’s size lost, others watching might not dare to compete with him.\n\"Ah!!!\"\nSo Lin Li, while faking a ’power exertion’, watched his hand get pressed to the table, expressing deep regret.\nJust the self-discipline of being an actor.\n\"Bro, you’re still strong.\" Lin Li shook his ’fatigued’ hand and praised Zhai Kai.\n\"You’re the real deal, truly,\" face saved, Zhai Kai relaxed, chuckling and shaking his head, eyes on Lin Li’s hand: \"Your strength is genuinely surprising, especially compared with your physique, hard to imagine.\"\n\"Really, Brother Kai, you didn’t hold back, did you?\" The onlookers around were starting to get suspicious.\n\"Try it yourself if you don’t believe.\" Zhai Kai stood and vacated the seat opposite Lin Li.\nHe now needed others to acknowledge Lin Li’s strength, otherwise, however he described it, they wouldn’t fully believe.\n\"Let me try then.\" Zhai Kai’s words had an instant effect, and the next person sat down immediately.\n[Seek out accomplished body cultivators for related sparring, and achieve victory or recognition (3/10)]\nWith significantly less strength than Zhai Kai, Lin Li could win quite easily, but still purposefully struggled a bit before winning.\nThus, after his opponent lost, the next challenger took over immediately.\n...\nAs one loser after another stepped down, people realized, Lin Li was a powerful individual with a small frame yet an impressive amount of strength.\n\"What are you all doing?\" A voice came from behind as the crowd split, revealing a guy possibly even a tad bigger than Zhai Kai, donning a thin jacket, likely just entering the gym, and a regular.\nScratching powder on his back, he still had to behave.\n\"Brother Zhu is here, we’re arm wrestling, testing strength; this kid, his build is slim but his strength is incredible, unbeatable, if he bulked up, unimaginable...\" someone immediately introduced.\n\"Then I’ll give it a try as well?\" Brother Zhu seemed intrigued at these words and put down his backpack.\n\"Bro, is his strength greater than yours?\" Lin Li asked Zhai Kai in a low voice.\n\"About the same.\" Zhai Kai saved some face.\n\"Then just use that move.\" Lin Li squinted and smiled at the burly figure sitting across him, in the middle of taking off his jacket: \"Bro, I’ll say when to start.\"\n\"Okay.\" Brother Zhu nodded.\nZhai Kai also grinned.\nAnd showed no intention of warning.\nThey say having been through storms, one wishes to witness others soaking wet.\n...\n\"Three—start!\"\n[Seek out accomplished body cultivators for related sparring, and achieve victory or recognition (10/10)]\n[Task two completed.]\n\"We’re the champions! Bro! We’re the champions!\" The person in front became the last one for the task; Lin Li stood up with tears of joy, hugged, and patted Zhai Kai’s back, helping scratch his itchy spots.\nAs for Brother Zhu, he silently stared at his unresponsive hand, mouth corners twitching: \"...\"\nDamnit.\nHe looked up at the excited Lin Li and Zhai Kai.\nLin Li was a new face so it was hard to judge; this kid definitely seemed a bit sick, didn’t look like acting.\nZhai Kai, what the hell are you doing?\nDid your protein shake today contain no protein, just regular powder? You drinking too much condensed milk? What’s got you so excited?\nThe onlookers, seeing this for the first time, finally realized that Lin Li wasn’t just a strong person with a small frame and an impressive amount of strength.\nLin Li was a small-framed but mighty, incredibly powerful sword tomb warrior.",

      "content": "Chapter 270: Chapter 220: Biological Secrets Contain Natural Mysteries\nTask completed, Lin Li was quite relieved.\nAnd there wasn’t another derivative task popping up with ten times the difficulty.\nIn fact, Lin Li had even prepared to run around every gym in Xiling today, but it’s good that there wasn’t, saved a lot of effort.\nHe refused Brother Zhu’s good intention to stay and eat whole wheat wotou, after all, he said there was no wheat and no nest, afraid it might cause trouble if eaten, so Lin Li took off immediately.\nLet Brother Zhai eat it.\n[You have acquired the active ability \"Soul of Martial Combat\".]\n[You have acquired the derivative ability \"Soul of Martial Combat (Passive)\"]\nCan one ability really derive a new ability? This hadn’t happened before, Lin Li curiously checked the details.\n[Soul of Martial Combat: Designate a single type of melee weapon, in the next hour, you will master the use of that weapon in melee, cooldown time is 24 hours, during ability activation and cooldown, \"Soul of Martial Combat (Passive)\" will be inactive.]\n[Soul of Martial Combat (Passive): You will adapt more quickly to all melee weapons, and can use them more flexibly in close combat.]\nSo that’s how it is.\nThis looks way more impressive than [Empty-Handed Blade Catch], even just the passive it derives is enough to crush.\nAnd melee weapons, what’s the definition of this stuff?\nTo determine the definition, Lin Li rode his bike with his eyes on the ground.\nEasily, he found a disposable chopstick by the roadside.\nGetting a feel, Lin Li’s hand naturally held it in a reverse grip, like holding a dagger.\nBecause Lin Li’s mind suddenly felt certain, this was the most suitable stance for exerting force.\nHe swung the chopstick in front of him a few times, listened to the light whooshing sound, and Lin Li chuckled.\nApparently, chopsticks also fall under the influence of the ability.\nIt seems that the ability’s melee weapon means an extremely broad sense of melee, something like chopsticks that’s more suitable to be called a concealed weapon also counts.\nAfter tossing away the chopstick, Lin Li picked up a stone.\nThis part is quite sharp, convenient for hitting people, and holding it like this seems more fitting...\nThese guiding pieces of information just appeared in his mind.\nConfirmed, as long as you’re holding it, it’s considered melee.\nA rifle equipped with a bayonet would certainly be affected by this ability too.\nBut both the active and passive aspects of this ability stated that it would only enhance one’s melee weapon talent.\nThat is, if I really got hold of a gun with a bayonet, the information my brain provides can only assist in improving bayonet skills, not shooting or long-range aiming.\nBut that’s enough.\nThis definitely boosted Lin Li’s confidence in exploring ’reality’.\nSo why not enhance it further.\nWhen selecting to use the \"Ability Amplifier\", the only available target was the overall Soul of Martial Combat, with no distinction between active and passive.\n[You have used the \"Ability Amplifier\" on \"Soul of Martial Combat\".]\n[Soul of Martial Combat (+1): Designate a single type of melee weapon, for the next two hours, you will master the melee use of that weapon, with one chance to change the designated weapon during the period, cooldown time is 24 hours, during cooldown, \"Soul of Martial Combat (Passive)\" will be inactive.]\nThe time was doubled, and there was one more opportunity to change the designated weapon, making it more applicable, while the passive remained unchanged.\nStill satisfied.\nToo bad there’s only one amplifier left.\nHeading home, in preparation for a date with the beautiful lady, Lin Li continued to use Spiritual Qi to transform his Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body.\nCompleting the one-month body forging task provided 20 inferior grades, plus a superior one, Lin Li currently lacked nothing in terms of Spiritual Qi.\nThe maximum amount of electricity his body could store was greatly increased, and the distance for long-distance discharges had already increased to twenty centimeters — it was only ten centimeters in the mountain pavilion days ago, which was a change in just a few days.\nHe could feel that before long, the Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body could enter the next stage.\nAt that time, there should be another significant growth wave.\nIf there’s another chance, Lin Li will definitely go to Pingjiang, to let that thunder mage know who the real Thunder King is.\n\"Mom’s leaving first, won’t be sending you to school.\"\nAfter dinner, while finishing kitchen clean-up, Wu Min said to Lin Li in the living room.\n\"Okay, Sister Min, to be honest, I’ll really miss you,\" Lin Li replied tearfully.\nWhile choking up, he took Wu Min’s bag from the table, shoved it into her arms, and then pushed Wu Min to the door, opening it while making a ’please leave’ gesture.\nWu Min: \"...\"\nOnly his mouth would miss her.\nAfter flicking Lin Li’s forehead, and organizing her stuff, Wu Min left as well.\n\"Great, it’s freedom!\" Lin Li cheered at lightning speed.\nThe door opened again.\n\"Too bad, it’s loneliness.\" Lin Li teared up at lightning speed.\nWu Min was used to this, simply gesturing Lin Li to grab something she forgot from her room, and then left for real.\nLin Li wasn’t in a hurry to leave immediately, Wu Min might be spying on him, he only left for the station at five thirty, picking up the rest of his deliveries.\nThere wasn’t enough time and no need to unpack, Lin Li went to school for evening self-study.\n...\n\"Konchikuwa, Bao Wei,\" Lin Li greeted Japanese Zhou Baowei in the hallway when he saw those guys still piling on each other.\nZhou Baowei pretended not to hear.\n\"Wrong, Lin Li, Bao Wei doesn’t understand this anymore, you need to use another one,\" Wang Ze chuckled upon hearing that.\n\"Hmm? It’s updated again?\" Lin Li heard this, looked around to ensure no teachers were around, then took out his phone to check Bao Wei’s QQ Space.",

I did seven times their training amount, but it’s still useless,\" Zhou Baowei scratched his head and said.\n\"Which part of the amount?\" Lin Li’s sharp eyes instantly saw through the wordplay.\n\"The diet meals.\"\n\"Makes sense, you could eat seven servings a day, you’re this!\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\n\"Wrong, just one sitting. You know, those diet meals are actually quite tasty.\"\n\"You’ve earned two thumbs up then.\"\nAfter chatting with a few people in the hallway for a while, Lin Li went back to the classroom.\nBai Bufan was sitting at his desk, the window next to him was open, and the ceiling fan above was spinning with a creaky sound.\nWould the ceiling fan cut off his head if it fell?\nSince childhood, Lin Li has imagined such scenes and thought about how he would dodge and how far the blood would splatter.\nAlthough Lin Li wasn’t afraid of mosquitoes, having other little bugs flying around was annoying.\n\"It’s the end of September, and we can’t even turn on the air conditioning. Nansang is really stingy,\" Bai Bufan helplessly pointed to the stand-up air conditioner behind him that couldn’t be turned on.\n\"When your mind is calm, it naturally cools down. If you can’t stand this little bit of heat, won’t you break down when you’re delivering food after graduation?\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan with some disappointment.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Why is my future already doomed to be delivering food? Shouldn’t I be selling matches in winter?\"\n\"Sure, I respect your choice.\"\n\"Wait, that’s not right!\"\n...\nAfter evening self-study started, Xue Jian made his routine rounds and then called Lin Li and Bai Bufan out.\nIt wasn’t anything bad, it was just because they made it onto the school’s honor board, and since it was their first time, they needed to provide some words of \"what they want to say\" for the school records.\n\"Can we say anything?\" Lin Li hoped as he asked.\n\"You can’t mention anything related to gambling, drugs, or porn.\"\nLin Li: \"I want to say that silence is golden.\"\n\"And you?\" Xue Jian turned to Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nAt this moment, silence was more powerful than words.\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nXue Jian realized his silence and Bai Bufan’s silence were different.\n\"You two need to change yours.\"\nLin Li and Bai Bufan had no choice.\nAfter all, rules are rules, and they’re not newly set today.\nFinally, considering they both made it onto the honor board together, they decided to collaborate. Lin Li looked up, \"Teacher, can I write, ’Without Bufan, I wouldn’t have achieved today’s results’?\"\n\"That’s fine.\" At least it’s better than gambling, drugs, or porn, Xue Jian nodded.\nBai Bufan’s eyes widened, feeling a bit teary, then firmly nodded, \"Teacher, then I’ll write, ’Without Lin Li, I wouldn’t have made such progress’.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nNot wanting to spend more time with these two troublemakers, Xue Jian nodded and left.\n\"Good brothers!\"\n\"For a lifetime!\"\nThe two left behind exchanged glances, their brotherhood causing them to shed tears for each other.\nEvening self-study continued, and Lin Li, having finished both homework and pre-study during the holiday, pretended to study but actually began cultivating in the classroom by holding a Spirit Stone.\nAfter all, the transformation process of the Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body doesn’t show any oddities.\nBai Bufan was catching up on the homework specially reserved for tonight from the National Day.\nWriting while muttering:\n\"Domain, kingdom, class, order, family, genus, species, I see, in biological taxonomy, Kobe is class, Lao Da seems to have mentioned the anus many times, Father is delighted.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThanking both Bufan and Kobe, Lin Li started clenching his anus while drinking water for health.\n...\n\"I’m off, contact me through a message in a bottle if you need anything,\" as the evening self-study bell rang, Lin Li got up and said to Bai Bufan.\n\"Why so hurried? Where are you off to?\" Bai Bufan barely got out of his seat and saw Lin Li was ready to bolt, so he curiously asked.\n\"I have a date.\"\n\"With whom?\"\n\"Miss Beauty,\" Lin Li said as he walked toward the back door.\n\"Outside school?\" Bai Bufan glanced at Chen Yu Ying who was still at her seat, his voice slightly lower, \"Preparing to cheat so soon? Be careful or you’ll get caught.\"\n\"Beyond the planet.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nThe truth is always hard to believe. Ignoring Bai Bufan, Lin Li jogged to get downstairs, but suddenly remembered something, changing course toward the office.\n\"What’s up?\" Xue Jian was about to get up and return to the teacher’s dormitory when he saw Lin Li running over and asked in confusion.\n\"Teacher, did the honor board ’want to say’ text get reported?\" Lin Li looked at Xue Jian.\n\"Not yet, what’s up?\" Xue Jian shook his head.\nLin Li smiled, \"Can I change it?\"\nXue Jian: \"?\"\n\"...Sure.\"\nBai Bufan, who cares about your brotherly feelings.\n...\nRiding back home, Lin Li unpacked all the deliveries he received that afternoon.\nBaseball bat, steel rod, fruit knife, and dagger, and a bottle of pepper spray.\n\"This ability is quite something, I’m looking forward to situations where I’ll use it proactively. Will I really become a weapon master?\"\nLin Li mused.\nIn front of him, the paper mannequin he had just crafted was marred with deep cuts in vital areas.\nAnd good enough hits were all made by Lin Li, someone with no prior training.\nLin Li felt like there was a comprehensive weapon master in his mind. Each time he picked up a melee weapon, it would teach him how to use it, as long as he followed its guidance.\nWith enhanced bodily control, simple actions flowed smoothly and could entirely replicate the thoughts in his mind.\nWithout working at Da Run Fa slaughtering fish for a few years, it’s hard to have such fluidity.\nHowever, some high-difficulty moves, while comprehended by the brain, the body still couldn’t perform them yet, needing time to settle.\nMoreover, this target in front of him was stationary; real combat would be different, as the body would find it even harder to interpret and handle the brain’s instructions.\nBut it was already quite impressive.\nIf someone saw Lin Li’s actions, they would surely mistake him for someone from Changsha.\nThe act of stabbing Bai Bufan in the back tonight is probably also induced by this ability.\nJust wonder why suddenly there was the urge to backstab, darn \"close-combat spirit,\" causing him trouble.\nLin Li is good, close-combat spirit is bad.\nUnfortunately, the dagger and fruit knife in hand had limited techniques, but with a sword or saber, it could look more stylish.\nWith iron rods and baseball bats, the brain has many tricks.\nUnfortunately, even modern basic versions of these things cost several hundred, and most don’t have blades.\nBlade versions are even more expensive.\nThey are less cost-effective compared to buying a chainsaw and becoming the bald Qiang.\nLin Li chose not to buy a chainsaw because it was too noisy. He wanted to sneak in silently, avoiding gunfire.\nPutting the dagger back in its sheath, Lin Li returned to his room, turned on the air conditioner first, then wore a protective suit under his clothes, before donning the bulletproof vest, wrist guards, and other armor on his body.\nTruth be told, the final result was somewhat bulky, even slightly hindering movement, and quite hot, but this way, Lin Li felt safe.\nPurity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body was fully charged, with the \"Duck Blood Bottle\" containing one-third human lust, one-third fear, and one-third empty for emergency use.\nFinally, Lin Li took his cell phone, holding a tiny plastic box with a live ant inside, heading to the bathroom.\nPlacing disinfectant, alcohol, and other cleaning supplies next to him, ready to sanitize immediately upon return.\nAs he activated the stopwatch function on the backup phone placed on top of the washing machine, Lin Li clicked a button on the interface, still unexposed in the system.\nHis vision turned pale.\nMiss Beauty, I’m coming!",

      "content": "Chapter 272: Chapter 221: Lin Li Really Heartbroken This Time\nWhite light flashed and disappeared again. What Lin Li saw before him was a familiar scene, the ruins and rubble, only it appeared darker due to wearing a helmet.\nBut overall, the sky was much like last time.\nThe location where I appeared should be the same spot where I returned last time.\nLin Li quickly turned around, but good news, Beauty, who had been chasing me, was nowhere to be seen.\nTime in this world flows normally.\nThe time point of my return is inconsistent with the last time point.\nOh no, have I come back after a whole week and Beauty might have already gone far away?\nMight she have already turned into someone else?\nLin Li scratched his green-haired head; even if Beauty had met with misfortune, I hope the culprit spared me a thought.\nBut before searching for Beauty, Lin Li began to check his own condition.\nThe steel bar at his waist, the fruit knife in the tactical backpack, the dagger on the thigh, all these were there.\nLin Li loosened his grip, and the small plastic box was there too, but the ants inside were gone.\nThey weren’t dead, but missing.\nWere they left in the modern world? Or did they get ’disintegrated’ during the crossing?\nIf left in the modern world, does it mean only one living being can be carried across the two worlds by the system? Perhaps the virus in this world won’t use me as a medium to spread?\nAll these are merely speculations that need more evidence and experiments for verification.\nTaking out his phone from his pocket, it’s functional.\nMobile service is crap, can’t even cover signals in another world, what kind of carrier is it then.\nLin Li opened the wireless network, none were available, a complete blank.\nWhat do people in this world do without internet, do they not swipe TikTok?\nCompass function seems normal too? It can stably point in one direction; does this world have a similar magnetic field?\nLin Li opened the camera, started recording, then placed the phone in the pocket on his chest.\nRecording is necessary, but next time it’s better to buy a portable camera.\nThis time, I didn’t buy one because I’m broke.\n\"Hoo—\"\nTime to find Beauty.\nBut can’t act rashly. Don’t want to end up finding some hooligans instead of Beauty, ending up with a failed date and getting beaten.\nAs for how to search, sounds could lure nearby zombies out.\nLin Li’s idea was to first get onto one of the relatively ’tall’ buildings within the ruins, then throw things down to create noise, to see if it can attract nearby ’creatures’.\nThen search for Beauty’s figure among the ’crowd’.\nAfter all, even with preparation, Lin Li doesn’t think he can battle zombies for long without having actually chopped anyone before.\nNeed to take them down one by one.\n\"That building looks tall enough.\"\nHaving chosen a target, Lin Li took out the flashlight but didn’t turn it on, holding it cautiously as he started moving towards the building, while activating [Divine Power of Hearing].\nThe helmet was quite inconvenient at this time, limiting vision; better replace or modify it next time.\nBefore walking a few steps, Lin Li suddenly paused and squinted his eyes.\nSounds were coming from behind a fragmented stone wall.\nSome soft, some heavy, surely footsteps.\nAfter confirming this, Lin Li immediately ran to the nearest pile of debris, first listened and confirmed there were no other fellows hiding within it, then squatted down.\nThe lone footsteps approach, emerging.\nDirty hair, a hole in the head, half the cheek shaved off...\nIt’s Beauty!\nShe didn’t leave! Her heart has me!\nOriginally thought hunting for Beauty would take long and be dangerous, yet she now actively appeared before me, Lin Li’s excitement at the moment was palpable.\nIf Beauty regained her beautiful look before infection and let Lin Li hug and kiss her, Lin Li would be willing!\nShe seemed to be searching for something too, swaying her head and ’looking’ around with each step.\nPerhaps...\nAre she and I pursuing each other?\nThis unbelievable thought surfaced in Lin Li’s mind.\nCould it be during this week, she’s been looking for me in this area all along? Otherwise, why hasn’t she left this area for so long.\nLin Li couldn’t help but tear up a bit.\nWhat sincerity of love is this, the system didn’t lie after all, indeed it was love at first sight.\n\"Perhaps... she’s more worth cherishing than Xiaojing.\" Like Spiderman or Deadpool, the more tense or dangerous the situation, the more Lin Li said nonsense to keep calm.\nAlso known as Self-Imposed Calmness.\nForbid the entertainment of suffering, unless the suffering is one’s own.\nThen, Lin Li gripped the steel bar tightly, licked the corner of his mouth under the helmet.\nBesides fear of the unknown and combat, there’s a peculiar excitement.\nPeople are always chasing a thrill.\nLin Li didn’t rush out to meet Beauty but continued to keep [Divine Power of Hearing] activated to listen for a while longer.\nA minute passed, and Lin Li should be certain that within the range he could hear, the only sound came from the Beauty lady.\nThat’s good news.\nIt won’t be too easy to lure out other zombies later.\nBut Lin Li still didn’t go out.\nLin Li is not a straight man; he knows very well that no matter how old a woman is, she prefers surprises over routine. If he just walked out like that, how could he justify her week of waiting?\nWait a bit longer.\nWhen she walks a few more meters forward, he can suddenly appear behind her and present the steel rod in his hand as her gift.\nAt that moment, the Beauty lady would surely be very happy, maybe even so surprised she’d faint.\n\"Clatter... clatter...\"\nFor a moment, the only sounds in the space were the Beauty lady’s twisted legs and the friction of gravel on the ground.\nShe walked past.\nLin Li grinned maliciously and prepared to approach.\nShe turned her head.\nThree eyes met — the Beauty lady was missing an eyeball.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nNot a sister?\nDid you activate Conqueror’s Haki?\nHe hadn’t even made a sound, so why did she turn her head? Can zombies in this world smell scents?\nIf so, she should have noticed him when she walked past earlier?\nAs Lin Li’s brain was thinking, it seemed the Beauty lady’s brain was also thinking.\nPerhaps love transcends all, the Beauty lady recognized the person under the helmet as her drool-worthy Lin Li, and in the next second, let out a low growl and lunged at him.\nLin Li pulled out the steel rod and stuck it in his ear: \"According to universal law, no one is allowed to attack someone who’s cleaning their ear!\"\nThe Beauty lady was quite unethical, completely ignoring him, only wanting to hug Lin Li.\nThere was no other way, he could only give her the gift early. [Close Combat Spirit], designating weapon, steel rod, start!\nNo need to hesitate, even a lion uses its full strength to catch a rabbit. If worst comes to worst, he could retreat and wait for cooldown, so Lin Li straightforwardly used this ability.\nTwo hours, that’s enough.\nAs for the designated weapon, although there were more powerful daggers and fruit knives nearby, their attack range was too short. Lin Li preferred something long and thick.\nAs soon as he activated it, Lin Li felt like the steel rod in his hand was a part of his body, and a flood of information a thousand times richer than usual poured into his mind about how to wield the rod in ways that would incapacitate or even kill the opponent.\nAnd a sense of confidence that as long as he thought about it, he could achieve it!\nIs this the difference expertise makes?\nThe Beauty lady charging at him was now all vulnerabilities in Lin Li’s mind.\nSo Lin Li stayed in place, activated [Power Accumulation], and as the distance between them closed, when his mind signaled \"it’s now,\" his body moved, and the steel rod swung in a big arc, slicing through the air with a roar.\n\"Madam, eat Lao Lin’s stick!\" Lin Li suppressed his voice in a low growl.\n\"Crash!\"\nLin Li didn’t aim for the arm; he went straight for the fatal neck. The steel rod easily pierced the surface rotting flesh and struck the cervical bone.\nThe powerful gift sent the Beauty lady flying into a wall, then falling unconscious to the floor.\nHe actually took her out in one strike.\nBut honestly, the Beauty lady was a bit off-putting.\nHer head was now between Lin Li’s legs, sneaking a peek between Lin Li’s thighs.\nLike she was in heat, it was really, really off-putting.\n\"Beauty lady, off you go!\" Lin Li smiled slightly.\n\"Whoosh—\"\nLin Li made a big kick, sending the Beauty lady’s head rolling at his feet flying away, and then he discovered something both terrifying and heart-wrenching.\nZombies’ skulls are also quite hard.\nGrass!\n\"Hiss—ha—hiss—ha—my big toe!\"\nBut Lin Li quickly put his foot down because he discovered the Beauty lady’s headless body was still moving, seemingly trying to stand up.\nDamn it, can zombies this patch even play without nerfing?\nNot finishing her off would be something only idiot villains do; Lin Li would be someone who even scrambles other people’s eggs if he had to sentence nine generations.\nSo seeing this scene, Lin Li didn’t hesitate and charged forward, unleashing his wild instincts, bursting into action, going at it with the rod!\nAfter implementing the words above—\nLin Li had completely smashed her chest open, and those nauseating and mysteriously colored organs spilled all over the ground, even something that might be called a heart broke, and the Beauty lady finally stopped moving.\nNow she should be dead beyond dead, right?\nLin Li still didn’t let his guard down; who knows if zombies in this world even have the concept of death. Even if she revived and stood up now, Lin Li wouldn’t be surprised, just curse the system’s mom.\nNo movement.\nShould be dead.\nNow finally he can get to business.\nLin Li took a deep breath, lifted his foot, covered it:\n\"Hiss—ha—hiss—ha—my big toe!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 273: Chapter 222 Beauty Lady Was So Moved That She Couldn’t Say a Word\nNo choice, the skull is really hard.\nLin Li is only wearing regular sneakers.\nHopefully, one kick won’t give him an ingrown toenail.\nYour mom’s head, like a ball, gets kicked to the department store; the department store sells balls, selling your mom’s head.\nThis universally heartwarming little nursery rhyme, Lin Li still remembers and can sing. In hindsight, it seems childhood was indeed too immature, this kick must hurt a lot.\nLin Li arrived in front of the lovely lady forced into separate action, took a fruit knife from his backpack, and started to prepare for himself.\n\"Mm, ugh, mm.\"\nDuring this time, Lin Li felt his stomach churning several times.\nIt was indeed disgusting. The only consolation was that there was not much of a rotten stench in terms of smell, but the scene was really too unbearable to look at. It felt like just one more glance would make him sick.\nTherefore, Lin Li instinctively reached out to tighten his mask further, but his peripheral vision noticed that his gloves seemed to be even more miserable now, so he silently retracted his hand.\nHis hands now felt comparable to Sister Yu’s feet.\nWho would dare lick them?\nHe should pray that the plastic gloves don’t leak like plastic bags; otherwise, Lin Li would definitely have a problem with them.\nThe fruit knife, at any rate, was brand new from the factory. Even if it’s not expensive, at least it’s still sharp now, so in less than half a minute, Lin Li disassembled the entire arm of the lovely lady, including both the upper and lower arms.\nThe first thing Lin Li removed was the lovely lady’s right hand, so in case an emergency arises when holding hands with all ten fingers of the left hand, his free dominant right hand can better handle it.\nBut since he was already there, Lin Li simply borrowed the other hand as well to use as his backup hidden energy source.\nAfter all, when Lin Li asked the lovely lady’s opinion, she didn’t voice any disagreement.\nTrying to hold her hand, the lovely lady’s hand was small and soft, as soft and falling off the bone as pig trotters stewed for a few hours.\nDamn.\nLin Li suddenly realized that, in his memory, including with Wu Min, he had never interlocked fingers with the opposite sex before.\nThe lovely lady was the first.\n\"How can one have it both ways in this world, not failing Xiaojing, nor failing you?\"\nHolding one woman’s hand, he was thinking of another woman in his mind.\nHe really was a scumbag.\nHe suddenly somewhat understood Bai Bufan’s harem philosophy; it would be great if he could see Xiaojing and the lovely lady harmoniously together—that’s something Lin Li truly looked forward to.\nHis thoughts were drifting too far again. Returning to reality, he held the lovely lady’s right hand, hung the left hand around his neck like a scarf, and looked around.\nNow, he had to wait for the sunrise.\nJudging by Lin Li’s experience, this slightly bright sky should see a sunrise in at most one or two hours.\nBut in this world, Lin Li didn’t know if his common knowledge was valid.\nLin Li could stay in this world for a maximum of five hours. As soon as five hours pass, he would immediately return to reality.\nFighting zombies can’t get in the way of his schooling.\nAlso, one can infer that the time he can spend in this world is also limited—because the description of the hand-holding sunrise task specifically highlighted \"even though currently, one can only stay briefly.\"\nOtherwise, as long as he never pressed the second button, wouldn’t he just stay in this world forever?\nAs for how long this time is, to test it would require waiting for the weekend; he has to study tomorrow.\nYou can watch a sunrise anywhere, but Lin Li once again set his eyes on that ’tall building’ he noticed earlier, estimated to be 3.5 stories high.\nStaying on the ’road’ between this building, it’s best to avoid wasting stamina with [Divine Power] on all the time; if he fails to notice a zombie’s approach and encounters love at a corner, the battle alone would be enough to trouble Lin Li.\nBesides, as the saying goes, the higher you stand, the farther you can piss. A wide view helps Lin Li further explore this world; he can’t just wait idly before sunrise.\nWith the plan set, Lin Li immediately tiptoed towards the building.\nAfter entering the building, Lin Li turned his flashlight to the lowest setting to look for the stairs up.\nHe would pause to listen and observe his surroundings with every step.\nThe most he could hear was his own deafening heartbeat.\nThis exploration into the unknown darkness, especially the real-life version, was indeed a bit scary... quite thrilling, especially when some steps triggered the noise of dislodging a few pebbles on the stairs.\nJudging from the flashlight’s illumination, this building looked like a low office building. Inside, there were quite a few desks and things that should be computers.\nScaring himself.\nNot anxious to explore too much, he led the lovely lady’s hand to the fourth floor, and nothing happened; there were no living beings inside the building.\nLin Li was crawling at the moment.\nThe fourth floor only had walls on the west and south sides that barely qualified as walls, with only a shallow layer of broken stones at the base as coverage in other directions.\nFrom the tactical backpack, Lin Li took out a high-tech ultra-HD high-power-night-vision sniper monocular.\nThe name was just that long when he bought it, twelve bucks and nine cents. Whether the technology was legit was unknown, but the merchant’s heart was probably very black; Lin Li knew it was trash when he found it light and flimsy upon handling.\nJust a plastic shell plus a broken lens, damn it, it didn’t even come with return shipping insurance, and the shipping cost to return would exceed the item price.\nAll one can say is you get what you pay for; it’s useful but not much.\nAt the northwest side of the view boundary, there was a zombie slowly moving.\nTo the east, by the street corner next to the adjacent building, there were also two zombies swaying idly.",

      "content": "Chapter 274: Chapter 222 Beauty Lady Was So Moved That She Couldn’t Say a Word_2\nAlthough it was already considered high ground, the low buildings still blocked the view, which is why Lin Li spent ten minutes cautiously checking the surroundings for all visible zombies.\nIf only there was a drone.\nLin Li truly felt the equipment gap now.\nHe really needed to find a way to earn some money.\n\"Believe me, I will definitely give you a better life.\" Lin Li patted the beautiful lady’s hand, comforting her.\nIdle as he was, he placed his tactical backpack aside and used the beautiful lady’s hand to scratch his back like a back scratcher while contemplating.\nCan I bring things from reality to this world, and take them back when I return?\nIt should be possible... Lin Li remembered that last time when he returned, the soles of his slippers were covered in dust.\nCould he make some money by exporting things from this world back to reality?\nIn reality, there are many quick and easy ways to make money, which are documented in detail in the \"Criminal Law\".\nA classic dumb question: The defense in prison is so tight, how do the inmates get in? The answer: They exploit legal loopholes to get in.\nThe people inside do speak nicely, but Lin Li didn’t want to associate with them.\nHe’s so handsome, talented, humorous... too many good traits, he’d be afraid of getting bullied.\nBetter to make money with dog trading.\nBut if he can only take inanimate objects, what should he bring?\nSomething easy to cash in, high return, exists in reality, and won’t draw attention when converting to cash.\nTheoretically, the rebar embedded in the wall in front of him could also be sold, but the efficiency is too low. Moreover, the scrap metal collector might smile on the surface, but three minutes later the Demon Suppression Bureau would come asking about the rebar’s origin.\nBesides, he’s not a sports student; breaking rebar with bare hands and bringing it back to reality would be a bit challenging.\nGold.\nWhen Lin Li set the filtering criteria again, gold, the absolute standard answer, already appeared in his mind.\n\"This world has rebar, there are scrapped cars on the roads, and the items in the building are very familiar, it feels like this world’s tech tree and resource tree are very similar, so gold should exist.\"\nPlacing the beautiful lady’s hands on the rooftop, Lin Li, carrying a flashlight, went downstairs and began exploring the building.\nSince he had confirmed beforehand there were no living creatures inside, Lin Li became much bolder.\n\"Xingsheng Trading Company.\"\nBrushing off the dust from the papers, Lin Li softly read the words on them.\nHe wasn’t surprised by the Chinese characters.\nWhat’s wrong with speaking some Chinese, aren’t cultivation techniques in the cultivation world also just traditional characters?\nPoor means to set aside disputes, while being rich means it’s inherent since ancient times.\nThis implies that this world has been East University territory since ancient times.\nThe text was a business document, with no real meaning, so Lin Li spent nearly half an hour carefully researching the building.\nNothing valuable was found.\nThe drawers were all opened, containing only messy papers and notebooks.\nOccasionally, a hidden gem—a drawer with a rotten hand clamped inside.\nHe couldn’t find anything valuable, even the poorest companies shouldn’t be like this; this building must have already been ransacked, but judging by the accumulation of dust, the last looting happened quite some time ago.\n\"I wonder if this world still has any survivors now.\" Lin Li sighed.\nHaving gained nothing, Lin Li returned to the top floor and could obviously feel the sky getting much brighter, especially in the east.\nIt seemed sunrise was not far off.\nLin Li set his mind straight.\nDon’t miss the sunrise for exploration, losing the task would be unworthy.\nIn the meantime, organize thoughts.\nThe place with the most gold, aside from under Zhang Jiao’s control, would be gold shops and banks.\nEspecially gold shops, banks keep their gold in safes when not publicly displayed, even if found, might not be able to open; but gold shops don’t have that issue.\nBased on the building density and the situation, this area before the zombie crisis shouldn’t be underdeveloped, there surely existed more than one gold shop and bank.\nAnd even if the buildings were looted by survivors, during the apocalypse, gold can’t be traded for food, having no significance in survival stages, they’d only treat it like trash, so there’s a large chance the gold is still waiting in the ruins for me.\nNow the issue was Lin Li wasn’t familiar with this ’city’, no city map before the zombie outbreak.\n\"Beautiful lady, why aren’t you even a little bit vain, where’s the jewelry on you?\" Lin Li inspected the beautiful lady’s hands, finding only decayed flesh and no adornments, shaking his head in disappointment:\n\"Love is not possession but fulfillment, if you keep this up, I’ll go for someone better.\"\nThe beautiful lady remained silent, just waving her hands, probably hoping Lin Li wouldn’t leave.\n\"Okay, I’ll give you another chance, let’s watch the sunrise together.\"\nPlaying ultra-realistic house alone was pretty fun, Lin Li cheerfully taped their hands together with the beautiful lady’s, never to be separated.\nThis was because Lin Li wasn’t sure about the system’s nature, whether it would force him to keep holding hands throughout the entire sunrise to complete the task. To be safe, tying them together, he wouldn’t have to maintain constant attention.\n\"Uh...\"\nAfter waiting a few minutes on the rooftop, faint zombie growls could be heard.\nLin Li’s eyes narrowed instantly, saving energy by turning off the [Divine Hearing],and then crawling to the wall edge to peek.\nThe sounds were getting clearer, not only because of [Divine Hearing]being turned on but also because zombies were getting closer, and seemingly more than one.\nSure enough, first a zombie twisted its body and appeared running, then after a few seconds or teen seconds, emerged more than a dozen.\nThe sounds they made seemed to also attract nearby zombies to come towards here.\nLin Li curled up on the rooftop, brows furrowing.\nHis situation suddenly became much more dangerous.\nAs a kid, Lin Li played the \"ground is lava\" game where you absolutely can’t step on the ground, now the downstairs really was dangerous lava.\nWhat triggered their riot? If they’re chasing something, why hadn’t he noticed at all?\nOr is it just this world’s zombies’ daily madness?\nLin Li peered out again, noticing a few zombies seemingly noticed the beautiful lady (the body), slowly approaching her, standing in front of her.\nThey didn’t touch the body, just glanced at it, uninterestedly continuing to move around slowly nearby, while a few stayed put slightly swaying, dazed.\nWhy is this group of zombies as inexplicable as little fairies?\nThe sky was already showing faint light, tearing the ink-black darkness hovering over the city’s ruins.\nSunrise was near.\nKicking down doubts, Lin Li shrunk into the corner between two walls, tightly holding the beautiful lady’s hand, appreciating the sunrise.\nThe light began as a faint grayish-white, then gradually brightened with time, taking on orange-red colors, casting an ambiguous and eerie brilliance on the desolate buildings.\nA bit tragically beautiful.\nWandering zombies appearing creepier under the orange-red light.\nIt was the most unreal sunrise Lin Li had ever seen in his life.\n\"Do you like it, madam?\"\nThe beautiful lady didn’t speak, but gave a thumbs up, then started tapping 666.\n\"As long as you like it.\"\nLin Li and the beautiful lady hand in hand, leaned on each other, watching the sun rise high.\nListening attentively.\nNot expecting zombie sounds, but—\n[Task 4 completed]\n[You have received rewards: Random Ability*1; Random System Item*1; 100 System Currency.]\n[What a wonderful morning, magnificent scenery, comfortable environment, beautiful companion.\nModern beauty is truly intoxicating.\nYour relationship with the beautiful lady has rapidly deepened while holding hands, so much so that she was moved to silence, but you can feel her desire to take things further with you.\nSo, modernity is all about indulgence, go enjoy it, extend the beauty, and have a wonderful day!]\n[Mission Triggered!]\n[Mission 2: Deeply kiss the beautiful lady on the forehead, say some sweet words; hold hands and shop with the beautiful lady for at least one hour, and outfit her with a new set of clothes; cook and enjoy a sumptuous dinner with the beautiful lady; engage in an intense bedroom exercise with the beautiful lady.]\n[Mission Rewards: Physical Improvement: 10% increase in attractiveness, 50% enhancement of lower body physical strength; Random System Item*1; 200 System Currency.]\nLin Li: ᓖ뮤?",

      "content": "Chapter 275: Chapter 223: So, You’re a Model Enthusiast Too?\nNo, wait a minute.\nLin Li rubbed his eyes, then closed them, and opened them wide again.\nDid this three times.\nNot seeing things.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis damned system, do you even see what kind of tasks you’re issuing?!!\nWhat do you mean the beautiful lady is too excited to speak? If she actually talked, you wouldn’t be happy! Heating up, which eye of yours sees our relationship heating up, huh? My ass?\nAnd is this even one task? Isn’t this four tasks?\nFour tasks but only one reward, seems like you also want to hang from a streetlight!\nSystem! Open up the mic for your dad! Speak!\nAfter cursing wildly in his mind, Lin Li started taking deep breaths to calm himself down.\nThat’s enough cursing, now with the tasks issued, it’s time to think about how to complete them.\nHonestly, although the system wants me to engage in bed exercises with the beautiful lady in the last sub-task, Lin Li actually doesn’t find this very difficult to complete.\nHolding hands with the beautiful lady watching the sunrise was no problem, so hugging the beautiful lady on the bed doing intense squats could also count as bed exercises.\nSo it’s possible to complete, worth a try.\nLin Li suddenly felt a jolt in his heart.\n\"Damn!\"\nLin Li suddenly crawled to the south wall.\nThe beautiful lady seems a bit confused now, and damn it, I still have to kiss her forehead!\n\"Where’s my head? Where did I kick my head to?\"\nLin Li widened his eyes and started searching.\nFortunately, after the morning, visibility improved a lot, and given Lin Li’s terrible aim comparable to the national soccer team, he quickly found that the beautiful lady’s head was only four or five meters away from her body.\nGood to find it.\nBut now the problem appeared before Lin Li again.\nThe road isn’t what it used to be.\nThe zombies in this world apparently aren’t afraid of sunlight, as it doesn’t make them retreat whatsoever.\nAnd now, a few zombies, either walking or standing, are gathered around both the lady’s body and her head.\nAlthough some zombies have slowly moved elsewhere over time, as they lose their target, there’re still those few who refuse to move.\nFeels like they were shut-ins when alive and hate moving around.\nEspecially the head, it’s under the foot of a slow-moving zombie, moving along with the pace.\nIsn’t this just adultery in front of her husband?\nStop walking, you bastard!\nHaving the beautiful lady in his arms, is this jerk going to kick it away?\nIf I don’t come up with a solution soon, it’ll be more troublesome if it gets kicked two miles away.\nAnd Lin Li felt that what he needed might not just be the head.\nIn that little hand-holding shopping task, there’s also a requirement to give the beautiful lady a whole new outfit.\nAn outfit, theoretically speaking, for the whole body, which means I also need the body leaning against the wall.\nEven more of a headache.\nLin Li furrowed his brows, and to make matters worse, Lin Li had been in this world for over two hours, now the effect of [Soul of Close Combat] had worn off, no longer the master of steel bars, his combat power had greatly decreased, adding insult to injury.\nGiven the situation, let’s look at the rewards first.\nLin Li checked the system rewards.\n[You’ve acquired the passive ability \"Bloodthirsty\".]\n[Bloodthirsty: You’ll become more sensitive to blood, and blood will excite you. The more blood in your field of vision or in contact with your skin, the more your abilities will increase, up to 20%.]\n[You’ve acquired the \"Historical Purchase Opportunity\" *1]\n[Historical Purchase Opportunity: Use to specify any product refreshed in the [Mall], you’ll have an opportunity to purchase it at 1.5 times the price, rounding up the tens digit (for instance, an original price of fifty requires eighty system currency to purchase).]\nIf it’s an increase all-around, then it’s a useful passive ability.\nAs for the \"Historical Purchase Opportunity\", it’s somewhat of a chicken rib. Lin Li, wanting to say something he bought too few of now, might be the \"Ability Amplifier\", but it isn’t even a purchase at the original price, meaning buying an \"Ability Amplifier\" costs 150 system currency, feels a bit of a rip-off.\nLin Li looked at the [Mall].\nHistorically accumulated system currency had already reached 2150, unlocking the fourth product slot.\n[Random Quality Spirit Stone...]\n[...]\n[Repair Crystal: 50 system currency (limited to 1 per day)]\n[Unlockable refresh product slot 5 requires an accumulated 2800 system currency. (2150/2800)]\n[Repair Crystal: Use on any mecha, attach to the mecha and it will be absorbed automatically, depending on the quality of the mecha, repair its damage between 50~100% within three seconds.]\nIt seems it can’t resolve the current situation.\nBut buying one anyway, so someday when I get a combat mecha, whether it’s out of power or damaged, there’s a solution.\nAfter checking the gains, Lin Li continued to ponder the current predicament.\nConsidering my battle power now, rushing to grab the body and head and run isn’t a good idea.\nFighting is also not feasible.\nNot to mention [Soul of Close Combat] has expired, even if it hadn’t, the zombies not in my field of vision around Lin Li now are surely much more than when I first arrived. After dealing with the rivals around the lady, more rivals would come to bother me.\nThe \"Distant Pouch\" has limited range.\nAlthough my strength has increased considerably, and the range should have extended, even if it’s reachable, the items \"Distant Pouch\" can bring back have volume limits.\nI can only get the beautiful lady (from fragment to fragment).\nLin Li crouched down, picked up a piece of rooftop debris, then threw it high to the ground.\n\"Plop.\"\nThe sound successfully attracted the attention of the zombies below, they all looked to where the stone fell.\nThe few closest to the sound moved toward its source, then began looking around.\n\"Ugh...\"\nWith almost a 360-degree look around if Lin Li hadn’t pulled back his head quickly, he would’ve almost made eye contact with one of them.\nThis method is also very risky.\nRecalling how the beautiful lady once precisely turned her head when I attacked her, Lin Li stopped throwing.\nI’m not at the end of my rope yet.\nLet’s look at the cultivator’s means, Lin Li took out the \"Duck Blood Bottle\".\nWhether zombies can be affected by the \"Duck Blood Bottle\", Lin Li has yet to test.\nSpecially prepared emotions inside for today’s adventure, but during the battle with the beautiful lady, it was over in a flash, with no chance to use.\nAs the \"Duck Blood Bottle\" was refined, its casting distance reached fifteen meters, and Lin Li was at a high enough position to use it.\nOnly fear and lust were inside the bottle.\nWell, fear, go!\nFeeling the decrease in emotions inside the bottle, Lin Li raised an eyebrow, successful.\nIt seems zombies were categorized as human cultivators or demon beasts in human form by the \"Duck Blood Bottle\".\nAnd the zombie Lin Li instilled with fear instantly let out a much louder howl, then ran forward trembling.\nThe effect was immediate.\nMoreover, it seemed his movements attracted attention from other zombies, and several others not affected actively chased in the direction he fled, an unexpected surprise.\nLin Li immediately continued distributing the fear from the bottle to the zombies present.\n\"Ah Ah——\"\n\"Ugh Ah——\"\nA series of roars sounded, and the zombies started scattering due to fear.\n...\nFear ran out.\nAfter all, only a third was stored in the first place, and these zombies are somewhat brainless, only knowing how to run forward when scared, resulting in a few remaining within the vicinity of the beautiful lady.\nOnce fear dissipates, zombies won’t doubt their emotions, but will stop moving.\nOnly lust remains in the bottle now.\nLin Li was actually quite curious about its effect.\nInduce lust into the body.\nThe next second.\nLin Li’s pupils quaked, o.o turned into 0.0.\n——the damned zombie started taking off its pants!\n\"Baby, don’t look.\" Lin Li immediately covered the beautiful lady’s elbow.\nThe zombie was engaging in self-love.",

      "content": "Chapter 276: Chapter 224: Lin Li and all the beautiful ladies wish everyone a Happy Lunar New Year\nAside from defying the heavens, Lin Li was at a loss for words to describe the scene before him.\nPants down right in the middle of the street, this zombie really had no sense of shame.\nThe pose was quite classic, body slightly leaning back, lower body thrust forward, loose head tilted upwards gazing at the sky,\nwith a certain kind of beauty in it, as if a person from the homeland was reaching for the sky.\nBut logically speaking, shouldn’t a male zombie in heat attack a nearby female zombie?\nWhy so self-reliant, solving it on his own?\nDamn it, you self-righteous jerk! Even boys can rely on others sometimes! Don’t take everything upon yourself!!\nLin Li found himself tearing up for this dashing sight.\nOf course, what’s more, unsightly was that being a zombie, most of the body’s parts were actually decayed. It seemed it no longer had this ability, resulting in the zombie’s clenched fist merely grabbing a pile of rotten meat.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThis really was a bit inappropriate for children.\nLuckily, the lovely lady should already be an adult, so in her company, he could legitimately and legally watch.\nNot only watching, Lin Li sneakily took out his phone to record the scene in front of him.\nPosting it on a niche website would definitely land it in the curiosity section, sitting at the same table as Sister Yu’s preferences.\nThe nearest zombie looked towards that \"sunward\" zombie with an emotionless face, showing nothing, while Lin Li continued to guide confidence into his own body.\nThis was a female zombie.\nBecause her movements after going into heat were markedly different from that guy’s next to her, she instantly sat down, legs apart, hand directly penetrating her own body.\nThe fun thoughts quickly ended as Lin Li’s brows furrowed.\nGiven the current situation, it would be better if the zombies went into heat to attack other opposite-sex zombies, at least moving away from their original positions.\nNow, he could only try to generate fear himself and instill it to drive away other zombies.\nIn this environment, generating fear wasn’t difficult.\nHonestly, if not for the Substitute Jade-faced Buddha providing maximum protection, just having Lin Li stay on the rooftop under these circumstances would generate a lot of fear.\nBut now, due to having the resurrection armor, the threshold for fear had been raised, requiring him to dance on the tightrope and take risks.\nAfter all, fear and risk are inversely proportional.\nActively seeking appropriate danger was, according to Lin Li, the most suitable method for the moment.\nHe thought it through and acted, preparing to head downstairs.\nYu Guang noticed the system interface, remembered something, and his body slightly paused. He then tentatively switched his title, replacing the daily worn [Blood Crow Assassin] title, which was kept for situations other than practicing, with [Breath of the Demon].\n[Breath of the Demon: When worn, greatly enhances perception of nearby demons and reduces their malice towards you, possibly even regarding you as a companion.]\nOnly then did Lin Li head downstairs.\nLin Li cautiously walked to the first floor and then stopped, his gaze filled with disbelief.\nBecause Lin Li realized he could sense the zombies outside the door.\nThe effective range of this title was very short, only a few meters ’nearby.’ While on the upper floors, it was too far, but now that he was closer, Lin Li immediately gained perception.\nHe could roughly determine the zombies’ positions behind the wall, as well as their general movements.\nBut Lin Li was a bit puzzled.\nHe hadn’t really expected this title to be useful; since he was here, he had to try it out.\nThe \"Duck Blood Vial\" had already determined that zombies were classified as human cultivators, and it couldn’t take effect on demonic insects.\nMeaning it couldn’t work on demons.\nSo the current situation was, were zombies considered both human cultivators and demons?\nWere zombies really that flexible?\nHowever, for him now, it was good news; since the title was effective, the malice from these beings towards him should be significantly reduced now?\nLin Li licked the corner of his mouth with some anticipation.\nHe had to test it out somehow.\nAnd he needed fear anyway.\nThus, Lin Li cautiously approached the broken doorway of the building. Just outside the door stood a zombie that he couldn’t see from the rooftop due to limited vision.\nHe pointed the \"Duck Blood Vial\" at himself, keeping the maximum effective range of [Breath of the Demon], and poked his head out of the doorway, deliberately knocking on the wall to make a sound.\nThe other party noticed immediately, turning its head, and their eyes met.\nSince tension and fear were absorbed, Lin Li was very calm at this moment.\nReduced malice didn’t mean none, nor was it guaranteed. If this zombie had any intention of attacking him, Lin Li’s hand holding the metal rod inside the door would immediately retreat and counterattack.\nThe zombie withdrew its gaze and continued to stare blankly.\nIt really considered him as one of its own!\nLin Li’s eyes widened.\nDamn, all along it could have been considered kin? In that case, I owe Beauty a bit of an apology, for we could have watched the sunrise hand-in-hand, without having to act separately.\nBe more cautious in the next life.\nAt this point, in Lin Li’s view, counting the nearest one on the street, there were only four zombies left in total.\nSo Lin Li stepped out, extended a hand to hook over this zombie’s shoulder, sincerely locking eyes with it again, and seeing it made no move, he slowly led it into the building.\nOnce he reached the area with Beauty’s head and body, that zombie left the effective range of [Breath of the Demon]. Now was not the time to experiment with how zombies would react under such circumstances.\nIf they attack at that time, it will be very troublesome.\nThen, Lin Li transferred all the emotions he had just absorbed from himself onto the furthest zombie, and watched as it trembled with fear and ran away. Through repeated guidance, he successfully made it leave his sight.\nVery good, now on this street, there’s only myself, Tao Zhe’s public zombie, Dou Dizhu’s female zombie, and the beauty with a baby-like sleep.\nLin Li began to cautiously approach.\n\"Are you completely focused when self-touching?\" Lin Li’s initial caution wavered when he discovered that neither of the couple looked his way after he made a noise by stepping on a stone, allowing him to be a bit bolder.\nJust as expected, they were very focused.\nVery good, Lin Li acknowledged this dedication to their activity.\nYou two are deserving of the title ’King and Queen of Intimacy.’\nWhen the distance shortened to the range where the title influence kicked in, Lin Li’s tension completely eased.\nWait a moment.\nUpon getting closer, Lin Li sharply noticed a gold bracelet on the wrist of Dou Dizhu, who was supporting herself on the ground!\n\"Hello, I’m a student, could you give it to me?\" Lin Li stepped forward to ask.\nNo refusal.\nThat means giving.\nGood person.\nOnce a bracelet is on, it’s generally hard to remove, but Lin Li knew a life hack: all you need to do is lather some soap water on the forearm, then chop the hand off, and it comes right off with a flick. You can try it if you don’t believe it.\nHowever, Lin Li didn’t do that because he was worried that after attacking her, she wouldn’t see him as harmless anymore.\nCombat must be avoided, so Lin Li took a mini plier from the tactical backpack behind him.\nJust as well to test if this bracelet is real gold.\nAfter all, gold is inherently soft and easy to snip.\n\"Snap.\"\nNot only was it easily cut, but the inside and outside colors were consistent, unlike a gold-plated bracelet.\nAnd Dou Dizhu seemed completely indifferent to the small incident beside her, continuing her activity with full concentration, though her hand speed had slowed, probably because her desire was gradually waning.\nI also need to hurry up.\nThrowing the snipped bracelet into the side pocket of the backpack, Lin Li tossed the beauty’s hands that were hanging around his neck and in his hand beside her body, then jogged off to retrieve her head from not far away.\nTime to start a romance!\n\"Before meeting you, I never thought about marriage; after meeting you, I never thought about anyone else.\"\nLin Li gazed tenderly at the beauty’s face and began to express his feelings.\n\"I’ve always been a staunch materialist, except for you; with you, I hope there’s an afterlife...\"\nThe celebrities’ famous quotes Lin Li memorized for his Chinese exam before the monthly test came in handy at this moment.\nBefore his memory improved, Lin Li’s favorite celebrity was Wozzky Shude, who had many sayings that perfectly fitted Lin Li’s essays and was his kindred spirit.\n\"...\"\n\"Even if you are black, I’m willing to be your tampon.\"\nA somewhat intoxicated Lin Li, immersed in his fervent and reckless expression of love, almost hysterical.\nAs everyone knows, determining if a black woman is pregnant doesn’t need a pregnancy test stick; just check if the cotton on the tampon is still there.\nSo being a tampon is a dangerous job, and that’s what makes this line touchingly humorous.\n\"....\"\nAfter frantically exhausting his supply of romance lines, Lin Li felt he should have met some of the system’s ’some’ requirements.\nNext, should he kiss?\n\"Gulp.\"\nLin Li’s Adam’s apple bobbed slightly.\nLooking at the beauty’s head, even though he was wearing a protective suit and mask, Lin Li found it a bit difficult to proceed - as for removing the mask and protective suit, that was absolutely out of the question for Lin Li, as he’d rather abandon this shitty task.\nHolding the beauty’s head, Lin Li somewhat understood Old Eight.\nIf not for life, who would willingly eat shit?\nLet’s do it, brothers!\nLin Li leaned in, and with a swift motion, brushed against it.\n[Planted a deep kiss on the beauty lady’s forehead... (1/4)]\nFortunately, the system was somewhat humane.\nIn a shallow joy, Lin Li suddenly heard slight footsteps behind him.\nWait, [Demon Breath] didn’t react.\nIt’s not the two zombies handling credibility!\nWith that thought, Lin Li turned around and looked back.\nThus, still with his mouth attached to the beauty’s forehead, he locked eyes with a masked human-like figure.\n\"...\"\n\"Hello, I’m not a pervert.\"\nHugging the head in his arms tightly, Lin Li said.",

      "content": "Chapter 277: Chapter 225: Good Brothers! Happy New Year! A Lifetime of Happiness!\nThis figure that suddenly appeared, only made a sound when approaching this close, making it hard to discern gender, but from the details of the eyes barely exposed, Lin Li believed it should be a woman,\nHer gaze first looked at Tao Zhe and Dou Dizhu nearby, and then locked onto Lin Li, who was holding Beauty’s head.\nFrom the exposed eyes, it could be seen that her shock was no less than Lin Li’s.\nAnd in the next moment, she raised her hand, and what she was holding was aimed at Lin Li.\nTime to bolt.\nLin Li let go, Beauty’s head fell to the ground, white light flickered, and he returned to the modern bathroom.\n\"Phew—\"\nLin Li took a deep breath.\nThe thing she was just holding and aiming at him looked a bit like a gun barrel.\nThough just a bit, Lin Li did not plan to gamble.\nIn this apocalyptic world, human nature is the most scrutinized, who knows if she might attack him in the next moment?\nHe only has one revival armor, and to get another one after using it, who knows how long it would take, wasting it here would be a huge loss.\nLin Li was already relieved that this person hadn’t ambushed him from afar.\nCalming his emotions, Lin Li looked at the backup device on the washing machine.\nThe stopwatch software was still timing.\n\"0.01.03.77\"\nOne small... no wait, Lin Li widened his eyes, how has it only been one minute and three seconds?\nHe took his phone from his chest and checked the time. Since it was set to auto-adjust time when online, the phone now showed it was ten forty-two in the evening.\nIt was indeed Monday night now.\nBut he indeed had estimated that he was in that world for about three hours.\nDoes time flow differently in the two worlds? One minute in reality being a few hours in that world?\nBut this time, going there was a whole week apart from the last time. At this rate, shouldn’t that apocalyptic world have undergone great changes? At the very least, a year or two should have passed?\nBut both times he arrived, except Beauty moved, other scenes hadn’t changed much.\nIt couldn’t be that Beauty had been waiting for him for a year or two.\nTemporarily suppressing the confusion about time, Lin Li began to check himself.\nThere was a mirror in the bathroom, so Lin Li could see clearly. His clothes and backpack now were far less dirty than they had been just moments ago.\nThe traces of clotted blood and rotten flesh had almost completely disappeared, leaving only some dust from crawling on the ground.\nEspecially his hands, this change was most apparent.\n\"Did nothing related to zombies come back? Gone without a trace like ants?\"\n\"No, it should have stayed in the original world, unable to be brought over.\"\nLin Li squatted down, found the ant on the bathroom floor, and it was still alive.\nThat means when he crossed over, it was with the small box around it, but it alone wasn’t brought back.\nLin Li placed the backpack on the shower floor, and the first thing he checked was the pocket next to the backpack.\nThe broken gold bracelet was displayed intact within.\nAnd the bits of blood and flesh originally clinging to it were also gone.\nIt seemed to fit his expectations, anything related to zombies couldn’t be brought back to reality, staying instead in the original world.\nBut that wasn’t entirely a bad thing, it was exactly the part Lin Li was most worried about.\nLin Li immediately relaxed, took off the layers of protection, and began cleaning the protective gear.\nThe fruit knife without traces of flesh, looked almost brand new.\nThe steel rod was left by the ground when he kissed Beauty, and wasn’t brought back; it was just bought for 108, now gone like this, hopefully that so-called sis—or possibly bro—doesn’t steal it.\nBracelet, oh bracelet, you better be pure gold, or I’ll be angry.\nHe sprayed it with pre-prepared disinfectant, and after confirming there was no blood or flesh remaining, Lin Li tossed the clothes into the washing machine.\nIt was time to rinse, freshen up, and sleep.\nAfter freshening up, Lin Li returned to the couch in the living room, his right hand entered a paralysis state accumulating [Charge] counts, while his left hand played with the bracelet.\nSo far, it hasn’t faded.\nThen he picked up his phone and began watching the videos he recorded.\nEverything was there, the footage was very clear, if posted on foreign internet, it might be considered top-tier CG by experts—a domestic release wouldn’t pass censoring.\nClicking on more information on the video, the filming time showed it was shot tomorrow, location unknown.\nSpeaking of which, if this video were uploaded online, would it generate traffic, could he earn money with it?\nForget it, better not attract any unnecessary attention.\nJust stick to making money in a straightforward way.\nThe bracelet wasn’t too thick, but if it were pure gold, its current value might be around seven or eight thousand, even with depreciation in resale, five or six thousand would be certain.\n\"Before returning from that world next time, be sure to put the device in airplane mode and leave a timing device there, to officially confirm the time flow between the two sides next visit,\" Lin Li muttered to himself.\nHe opened the system, and like before, the third button lit up.\nNo text, no pressing it.\nYawning, now Lin Li’s body was only left with fatigue, time to rest.\nAlthough he didn’t do much, the tension for several hours, and hours of [Ear Divine Power] activation, left Lin Li mentally and physically exhausted.\n...\nTuesday.\n\"According to unofficial histories, Zhou Yu was not angered to death by Zhuge Liang. He wasn’t so fragile. After being intellectually crushed by Zhuge Liang, Zhou Yu felt his heartbeat become irregular, and immediately sought treatment from the famous doctor Hua Tuo.\nHua Tuo, after examining him, said the issue wasn’t serious, stating: ’No major concern, just a fit of rage, take this medicine today, you’ll be well by dawn tomorrow.’\nZhou Yu nodded and followed the medical advice, but the next day died due to excessive urination from the medicine.\nThe people of the Wu Kingdom discovered this and thought it more dignified for Zhou Yu to be recorded as having been angered to death, so later generations recorded it that way.\"\nBai Bufan’s voice arrived fashionably late.\nDamn, where does Bai Bufan get all these obscure Three Kingdoms anecdotes, they’re endless!\nReturning to his seat, he distributed breakfast.\n\"Why are you so happy?\" Seeing Bai Bufan grinning, Lin Li asked in surprise.\n\"It’s nothing.\" Bai Bufan started slurping his noodles, unable to suppress a grin, and even asked with a smile, \"Lin Li, why do you look so gloomy?\"\nLin Li shrugged helplessly, if you hugged and kissed Beauty last night, you’d be gloomy too.\nBut Bai Bufan’s joy seemed a bit off; his normal state today should be crying out in despair.\nBut under Lin Li’s relentless questioning, Bai Bufan just kept denying everything.\nEven hiding it from his brothers, Bai Bufan really needed some spanking.\n\"Bao Wei, what’s Bufan laughing about?\" Lin Li had no choice but to ask his roommate, Zhou Baowei.\n\"I don’t know, I’m puzzled too, it’s inexplicable.\" Zhou Baowei shook his head.\nLin Li and Zhou Baowei exchanged a glance and looked at Bai Bufan: \"Bufan, Shang Yang can be divided by five, do you want to be divided by two?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nAs a famous political thinker from the Warring States period who proposed the theory of horse-splitting, Shang Yang is a rare existence that can be divided by five besides integers ending in 5 or 0.\n\"Cough cough, don’t do anything yet, I’ll talk, I’ll talk.\" Seeing that he was about to be dismembered, Bai Bufan coughed a few times, then hurriedly lowered his voice and explained:\n\"I just heard a theory—\nOn the first day of every new school week, you should wear happiness on your face to confuse those around you, making them think that you’ve achieved some progress in life, causing others to feel pressure invisibly, or even give up in despair, so you can win at the starting line.\nJust like flipping through the exam paper ten minutes early during tests.\"\nLin Li, Zhou Baowei: \"?\"\n\"Bufan, talking through your butt is just for fun, if you really want to fart, it depends on your mouth.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\n\"No, it’s effective, you see, weren’t you two just anxious?\" Bai Bufan argued his point.\nUpon hearing this, Lin Li and Zhou Baowei squinted their eyes.\n...\n\"What are you guys happy about?\"\n\"What exactly are you laughing at?\"\n\"Speak up you three! What the hell are you laughing and laughing at?\"\nWatching Wang Ze getting increasingly anxious.\nThe three of them, Bai, Lin, and Zhou, laughed even more happily.\n...\n\"What are you laughing at? Why are you so happy?\"\n\"No, what the hell are you four idiots doing?\"\n...\nMany diseases can be contagious.\nThe Chinese representative stood on the podium, ready for early reading, but when she saw that half the boys in the class had strange smiles on their faces, she got scared.\nDamn, Class 4 of Grade 1 is haunted.\n...\n\"The honor roll has been updated.\"\nWhen they came back from their run, everyone saw the honor roll had changed color.\nWhen Lin Li noticed this, he immediately glanced at Bai Bufan.\nThe two immediately hooked arms.\n\"Come on, let everyone witness our sincere brotherhood.\" Lin Li was full of sincerity.\n\"Okay!\" Bai Bufan nodded heavily.\nThe two of them went to the honor roll.\nLin Li was ranked first on the progress chart due to the largest improvement.\n\"Lin Li: Bai Bufan is right.\"\nLin Li smiled.\nThis was his \"thoughts to say\" that he changed without involving anything illegal.\nIn this way, it matched Bai Bufan’s \"Without Lin Li, I would not have made such progress,\" achieving a subtle backstab.\nNo choice, the more aggressive Xue Jian wouldn’t agree.\n\"You backstabbed me?\" Bai Bufan instantly grabbed Lin Li’s collar.\n\"I, I didn’t, I don’t know how it happened... maybe Old Jian changed it himself.\" Lin Li stammered.\n\"It’s fine, the change is good.\" Bai Bufan immediately let go, smiling.\nLin Li’s heart skipped a beat, and he hurriedly searched the honor roll for Bai Bufan.\nFound it!\n\"Bai Bufan: With Lin Li’s excellence, I don’t know what to say, but my progress does have his contribution, so I’ll recite a poem ’Friendship.’\nI remember the virtuous friends of the past, the bonds enduring through the years. Sharing the beauty of forest and spring waters, the friendship remains long and wide. The love between father and son is not this sentiment, the kinship with friends can compare.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nHow come Bai Bufan’s changed too?\nWait a minute.\nLin Li squinted his eyes.\nAs an expert in acrostic poems, Lin Li immediately saw that this guy’s lousy saliva poem was also an acrostic!!\nI, Am, Lin, Li’s, Father, Dear.\nRealizing this, Bai Bufan’s collar was instantly lifted by Lin Li.\nWhile Bai Bufan continued smiling, he looked at Lin Li, word by word, and said: \"Bai Bufan is right, thank you.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nNo, what about the honor roll review? Xue Jian’s review? What were they all doing! How could they trust that Bai Bufan could spew poetry from his mouth? There must be a trick!\nNow it’s done, indeed achieving a subtle backstab, but the problem is this time the backstab was Bai Bufan backstabbing himself.\nDamn, found a stealthy way for this guy to attack me!\n\"When did you talk to Xue Jian?\" Lin Li hollered in disbelief.\n\"Half a minute after you left the office.\" Bai Bufan showed a harmless smile.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhat else could he say?\nLin Li: \"Good! Brother!\"\nBai Bufan: \"For! Life!\"\n...\nWishing everyone a Happy Lunar New Year! Happy Year of the Snake! Good! Brother! For! Life!\nIt’s the end of the month, if you have monthly votes, you can cast them, I’ll try to keep updating during the holiday.",

      "content": "Chapter 278: Chapter 226: The civil attack has succeeded, now it’s time for martial prowess!\nEvening study session.\n\"What kind of damn tree is a function? Better watch out, or once I get the chance, I’ll chop it down in a heartbeat.\" Bai Bufan scratched his messy hair, speaking somewhat irritably.\nDamn it, this sneaky little textbook sure has a good sense of intellectual property protection; I can’t even steal a bit with my brain.\n\"Even if you chopped it down, you’d still have to differentiate it,\" Lin Li, next to him, said with a cheerful grin.\n\"...Crap.\"\nBai Bufan was rendered speechless and laid his head on the desk in defeat, then glanced at Lin Li, \"Seriously, how come you don’t wail like a banshee when facing math anymore?\"\n\"Because I now find math to be quite simple,\" Lin Li replied with a disdainful smile. \"When it comes to the midterm, being 51st will just be a stepping stone for me. The road downhill is noisy, but luckily, I’m climbing up.\"\nHaving improved his comprehension by 40% and reinforced his foundation last month, Lin Li indeed found attending classes no longer difficult.\n\"Damn, you’re showing off again. They say Asians have a knack for math, where’s my talent gone?\"\nLin Li: \"Differentiate it.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Attention, everyone!\"\nBefore Bai Bufan could continue ranting, Wang Ze, Xie Wenjing, and Chen Yu Ying walked in from the classroom door.\nAfter reaching the podium, Wang Ze knocked on the blackboard, prompting everyone to look up at them.\n\"We just finished a meeting with the school and the student council and wanted to talk to everyone about the sports day,\" Wang Ze said, waving a blue folder in his hand.\nThe student council at Nansang Middle School was pretty useless, at least as far as Lin Li was concerned, as its only necessity seemed to be checking early reading in corridors and inspecting hygiene before evening classes.\n\"Boo—\"\n\"They lack skill but have quite the authority, making a big deal out of small things—\"\nSince Wang Ze was speaking, the boys in the back row couldn’t help jesting.\nWang Ze glared at a few of them and continued:\n\"The tentative dates for the sports day are the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of this month. It’s tentative because it would be quite troublesome if it rains. Current weather forecasts aren’t always accurate, so we’ll reassess a week before. If conditions are ideal, the dates remain; if not, they’ll be adjusted to the 28th, 29th, and 30th at the end of the month.\"\n\"The Nansang school sports meet emphasizes everyone’s participation. The school doesn’t want it to be just a stage for athletic students to showcase themselves, so besides traditional competitive events, there will also be a variety of fun activities.\nFor example, tug-of-war, three-legged races, caterpillar walking, ping pong relay, and many other events.\nThe school has stated that all first-year students must participate in at least one fun activity unless they have a special reason, which needs to be explained to and approved by Old Jian.\nNow, regarding competitive events, each class can send a maximum of two people per event.\nIn addition, besides group relay events like 4x100, any individual can only participate in a maximum of two competitive events.\nThe final class ranking for the sports meet will be based on a points system.\nFirst place in fun activities earns four points, second place three points, third place two points, and participation earns one point; first place in competitive events earns twelve points, second nine points, third seven points, fourth to eighth five points, and participation earns three points. Additionally, breaking a school record gives an extra five points.\nAs you can see from the points system, the school is encouraging everyone to participate as the baseline participation score is quite high.\nCompetitive events will only be held during the sports meet, while fun events will be spread out over next week’s afternoon self-study classes and later recess periods; look for specific announcements.\nOh, and besides the honor certificates, the top three classes will receive some material rewards from the school, probably snacks or something, although the specifics are unclear.\nBut that’s not important. Whether for class honor or to create more beautiful high school memories for ourselves, let’s all try to participate as much as we can. At the very least, let’s try to get all those participation points that are like a free gift.\"\n\"I, for one, won’t eat food given with contempt, but I won’t refuse a gift!\" Zhou Baowei said proudly.\nWang Ze personally experienced how annoying interruptions can be; no wonder characters in comics often roll their eyes quickly.\n\"Okay, Bao Wei is signing up for the 3000 meters...\" Wang Ze took out his paper and pen to start recording.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\n\"Wait a second!\"\n\"Hold the bag and shut up. Everyone take a look at these two lists being passed around without us wasting too much time explaining each one. Boys sign up for competitive events with me, girls with Xie Wenjing, and for fun events, see the class monitor.\nFun events are first come, first served. Latecomers should coordinate with other classmates and the class monitor. That’s pretty much it. If there’s anything else you’re unclear about, feel free to ask me after class.\"\nAfter Wang Ze finished speaking, the three of them returned to their seats, and the classroom instantly became lively, with everyone starting to whisper.\nLin Li shifted his gaze to the system.\nSure enough.\n[The sect martial contest is imminent. After training the body for over a month, becoming strong and fit, the time to bring glory to the sect is today. If not now, when?]\n[Task Triggered!]\n[Task 3: Do your utmost to participate in the sect martial contest and secure at least three first-place titles for yourself or your sect, with at least two being in formal competitions.]\n[Task Rewards: Physical Improvement: 10% increase in image charm, 50% enhancement in martial arts talent; Random Artifact*1; Low-Grade Spirit Stone*10; System Currency*150;\nIf individual contribution ranks first among all sect disciples, there is a 50% chance for the above rewards to double when received (minimum double on one item) (team events will share contribution among team members).]\nThe task has arrived.\nGet three first-place titles?\nIt seems the formal competitions in the task description refer to competitive events, so of those three first places, at least two need to be in competitive events, with just one needed for fun activities.\n...\nWhen the bell rang, Lin Li approached Wang Ze.\n\"Wang Ze, sign me up.\"\n\"Competitive events? And you’re the first one? What do you want to sign up for?\" Wang Ze nodded, paused his busy work, pulled out a piece of blank paper, and asked, looking up.\nAll the text on his notebook that contained enclosed spaces was filled in black.\nSpent the entire evening study session doing that; Wang Ze will remember this for life.\n\"3000 meters, 1500 meters, and the 4x100 and 4x400 relays,\" Lin Li said.\nWang Ze, who was about to start writing, stopped, raised his head again after hearing this, and stared straight at Lin Li: \"Lin Li, are you... serious?\"\n\"Serious.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"I can’t guarantee spots in the 4x100 and 4x400 relays since registration might be high, and we’ll need to filter through PE classes. But as for the 3000 meters and 1500 meters, you dare to sign up, and you’ll get to go.\"\nWang Ze looked at Lin Li with a complicated gaze:\n\"Damn, I’ve been wracking my brain about finding someone willing to do long-distance running. Even counting me, we were still short one person.\"\n\"Didn’t expect you to step up. Lin Li, Lin Li, you might be an unknown quantity in intelligence, but you’re kind-hearted. I acknowledge you.\" Wang Ze patted Lin Li’s shoulder heavily:\n\"Willing to sacrifice for our class, you are the real hero. Don’t worry, Lin Li, if I can’t find another willing participant, no matter your placement, I’ll lap around you at the track!\"\nFaced with Wang Ze’s sarcastic tone, Lin Li smirked:\n\"You think you can lap me? Look, I’m telling you, for this event, I’ll at least secure bronze, defend silver, and aim for gold. If you’re participating too, just watch how I climb to the top, one step at a time, while trailing behind me.\"",

Even if he breaks them, it won’t cause any issues like getting dissected for research.\nUnlike other events, like the shot put record, which is said to be set eight years ago by a senior who was already at the level of a third-level athlete in his freshman year.\n14.93 meters.\nA third-level athlete in their freshman year doesn’t sound all that impressive and indeed isn’t rare just from the title alone. Some athletes in certain events can even be first-level athletes during freshman year.\nBut in the shot put event, when a freshman’s body hasn’t fully developed, throwing a five-kilogram shot put that far is extremely extraordinary, must be gifted—hard work can hardly make up for it.\nBut for Lin Li, practicing his technique and using \"Power Accumulation,\" it’s not out of the question.\nIf he uses the \"Limit Break Talisman,\" Lin Li believes he’d be more than steady.\nThe problem is, breaking such a record would be too stark a contrast with his physique. The school’s PE teacher would definitely start watching him, and in such events, once you make a move, you can’t control the results. Unlike running, where you can adjust your speed by checking your watch at any time.\nIn shot put, you can only control the strength at the moment of release. But if the force is too weak, you can’t break the record. If it’s too strong, Lin Li will risk getting blown to pieces, with a piece here, a piece there.\nSo Lin Li isn’t even considering this event.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nWhat did this guy just babble about?\nSomething about being tough as copper, guarding silver, and meddling with gold.\n\"But since you said it, I also hope you meddle with gold rather than linger on it,\" Wang Ze knows what to say at this time, \"I’ll be right behind you supporting you, looking forward to the day you show the world what you’re made of.\"\nWang Ze’s thought process was quite fast.\nLin Li immediately denied: \"I’m showing the world on behalf of everyone. I’m very modest, I don’t show off.\"\n\"No, you show off, everyone else doesn’t.\"\n\"You show off.\"\n\"You show off.\"\n\"You guard silver.\"\n\"I meddle with gold.\"\n\"Then let’s start.\"\n\"...\"\nAfter a while of baffling conversation, Wang Ze interrupts, curiously asking, with concern:\n\"Lin Li, I know you’ve been working out lately. Although your mental toughness is still crap, your physical abilities are now like gold-plated crap, but don’t pretend to be Zhou Baowei.\"\nThe three thousand meters isn’t a joke. During training, even doing eight laps of four hundred meters with thirty seconds of rest in between feels like I’m going to die, it’s exhausting. Don’t get carried away, or being lapped would be embarrassing, and you’d lose your picking-right forever.\"\n\"Even if my face swelled up, it wouldn’t be as big as Zhou Baowei’s.\" Lin Li missed the point.\n\"Seems like it.\" Wang Ze nodded after hearing that and agreed.\n\"You two need to stop messing around.\" Nearby, waiting to sign up for tug-of-war, Zhou Baowei rolled his eyes like he was interrupted.\n\"Don’t worry. I have it all planned out. During PE class, when I run, you’ll see for yourself. If it doesn’t work, I’ll switch events.\" Wang Ze meant well, and Lin Li responded.\nThere are plenty of events, no need to rush. Even if the usual state doesn’t work, using a \"Poop Suppression Talisman\" would surely secure it.\n\"Alright, then we’ll run together then.\" Wang Ze didn’t say much more.\nLin Li nodded, then asked Wang Ze:\n\"By the way, Wang Ze, do you know any student-athletes who can steadily break school records? Still in school?\"\n\"Yeah, a senior in the third year. I tell you, he’s mega impressive...\" Wang Ze immediately wanted to share.\n\"Really? Can he challenge massive challenges like Lao Ai?\" Lin Li interrupted, eyes curious.\nWang Ze: \"Who’s Old Ai? Deng Ai?\"\nThe uneducated can’t even get the jokes, sighed Lin Li, giving Wang Ze a look as if he were looking at a dimwit, and waved his hand:\n\"Never mind, keep talking...\"\n\"My senior currently holds third-year records in triple jump and long jump; he broke these last year and the year before. And you see, his record as a second-year is already two centimeters more than the third-year record now.\nJust say if he doesn’t make a mistake, this year’s third-year record will surely be refreshed by him.\nHeard that university admission is secured as long as his culture score doesn’t drop below 350, securing entry. If he gets 500, he can enter top schools, so envious.\"\nWang Ze continued introducing, eyes sparkling.\nThat’s what we student-athletes should aspire to be.\nLin Li frowned slightly.\nA formidable opponent.\n\"Is he good at sprinting? Will he join the relay?\" So Lin Li asked.\n\"It depends on how you define ’good.’ He doesn’t mainly train sprints, but he might join, after all, it’s all track events. We usually train together, even if it’s not a sprint specialty, I doubt there are many in his class who run faster than him.\nHmm?\nIf he can steadily break two records, then my position as the top member of the sect becomes uncertain. If his class’s relay race ranks higher than mine, I won’t be Nansang’s number one.",

We have training in the afternoon, and if we skip it for this, our coach has a foul mouth and would directly curse us out. But why are you asking? We’re not competing against the seniors.\" Wang Ze looked a bit confused.\nThe school is different from the system; there’s no so-called individual ranking. So, typically, different grades have nothing to do with each other.\n\"Oh, nothing, just asking.\" Lin Li laughed it off, but his eyebrows relaxed a bit.\n\"Class president.\" Lin Li raised his head and looked back.\n\"Hey.\"\nChen Yu Ying, who was surrounded by people signing up, stood up and pushed through the crowd, managing to lock eyes with Lin Li. She asked, \"What’s up?\"\n\"I’m versatile and have a heart willing to turn to ashes for our Xue Sect. Tug-of-war is something I naturally wouldn’t refuse, and any other fun events that lack participants can also count me in.\nBy the way, if any event requires a pair, just put Bai Bufan and me together.\" Lin Li spoke up.\n\"Ah, oh, OK.\" Though a bit odd, Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"I haven’t agreed yet?\" Bai Bufan, who was nearby planning to secure a project that wouldn’t be embarrassing to lose, widened his eyes upon hearing this.\nChen Yu Ying looked at Lin Li, signaling him to handle it.\nGot it.\n\"Hold on, I’ll ask now.\" Lin Li nodded and pulled Bai Bufan outside.\nProblem solved.\nThree minutes later, the two returned, and the disheveled Bai Bufan nodded, \"Asked him, Bai Bufan has no objections.\"\nThen Bai Bufan looked at Zhou Baowei, \"Also, Bao Wei, we tried it, and even if your face swelled up, it still wouldn’t be as big as yours.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nHow can you two just casually roast yourselves like that?\n\"I’ve taken note, once the final results come out, I’ll let you know all the events you’re participating in.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"Alright.\"\nLin Li nodded, snapping his fingers, and considered it done. He wasn’t intent on participating in every single fun event.\nAfter all, being the Sect’s top priority task is just an additional task. It doesn’t matter if it isn’t completed.\nDo I really need to outsmart a senior from grade twelve? No need, and it’s not like everything doubles, so why waste effort?\n\"Lin Li, are you joining any competitive events?\" Chen Yu Ying, who saw Lin Li hovering around Wang Ze, was curious.\n\"Yes, tentatively the 3000 meters and 1500 meters.\"\n\"What? Those sound exhausting like long runs, are you really going to run them?\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit surprised.\n\"Exactly, class president, make sure to send me off when the time comes.\" Lin Li patted his chest.\n\"...You mean bring you water.\" Chen Yu Ying laughed.\n\"Is it the kind of water that can pass down three bowls of rice? Then, more, more, I love drinking it, Miss Chen.\" Lin Li winked.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nWhy did this guy bring up bathwater again?\n——The three bowls of rice thing is what Lin Li said during National Day when Qu Wanqiu was taking a bath on the third floor, clearly still referring to bathwater.\nSlightly blushing since there were people around, Chen Yu Ying just cursed him in her heart for being a super perverted officer and didn’t respond to Lin Li, sitting back down to continue registering everyone.\n...\nThe evening self-study ended, and school was over.\nLin Li left quickly.\nAfter going home to change, he picked up a gold bar that no longer resembled a bracelet and headed toward a gold and silver recovery shop a considerable distance from his house.\nChanging clothes was to avoid any trouble that wearing a school uniform might cause. The store being far away was for the same reason.\nRiding his bike, he arrived.\nThe shop wasn’t big, just two rooms, and the decor was quite old-fashioned. The sign wouldn’t even light up, making it quite inconspicuous at night.\nOnce inside, Lin Li saw there was already a customer, and the boss was talking with her. Lin Li wasn’t in a rush, so he just waited aside.\n\"Boss, can you increase the amount a bit? I checked before coming, and the gold price is 628 now, so why is your buyback price only 401? That’s too low.\" The woman complained.\n\"How many times do I have to tell you before you get it? If yours was pure gold, I could also give you over 600, but this is K gold with so many imperfections. I can only offer this price. If you accept, I’ll take it; if not, you can take the gold back; stop dragging this out.\" The boss seemed to have been haggling with the woman for quite some time and was too impatient to continue.\n\"Oh, it’s not that I don’t want to sell, boss. Just add a bit more, just a bit more. There’s so many grams; you’ll definitely earn enough.\" She insisted.\n\"Sigh,\" the boss sighed, \"Miss, could you give me your mom’s WeChat, please? Thank you.\"\n\"Why?\" The woman was puzzled.\n\"So I can add your mom.\" The boss said.\nWoman: \"?\"\n\"Damn!\" Lin Li, who was standing aside, covered his mouth and squatted, unable to hold back his laughter.\nAnd he even said thank you; how polite.\nThe woman, who hadn’t reacted immediately, blushed visibly like a tomato, then anger overtook her, pointing at the boss with trembling fingers, \"You, you, you don’t respect women!\"\n\"Respecting women is inherently difficult. If you want me to respect you, you have to tell me what defines a woman, right? Come on, tell me, can a woman be defined?\" The boss took a step forward, exuding confidence.\nWoman: \"?\"\nLin Li: \"!\"\n\"Can’t say anything? That’s right! Women cannot be defined. If I can’t select them, how can I respect them?\" The boss was expressionless, pointing at the door, \"Selling or not selling? If not, take your stuff and leave.\"",

Guo Nan is so disgusting!\" The woman angrily took her K gold and left.\nLin Li believed that if he checked the local Xiaohongshu tonight, he would definitely see a diss post about this gold shop.\n\"Bad luck.\" The shop owner looked disdainfully at the departing woman and then turned to Lin Li, \"I’m sorry you had to see that. Boss, what are you here to sell?\"\nWhen doing business, they truly treat each other as bosses.\n\"Gold too.\" Lin Li took out the gold bracelet from another world.\nThe shop owner took it, glanced at the clipped bracelet, and before verifying it himself, said, \"Have you already shown this to other shops? If you’re planning to compare prices, forget it. I can only offer the regular price here.\"\nHe probably thought the cut Lin Li made was a mark left by another shop.\n\"Not at all, you’re the first one, and I’m sticking with you, boss! Even if I lose a bit, that earlier scene was worth the price of admission,\" Lin Li said firmly, \"We’re abstract boys helping abstract boys, it’s our innate ability to love.\"\nBoss: \"?\"\nThe boss gave Lin Li another look, then walked to the transparent workbench, \"I need to cut it a bit, is that okay?\"\n\"No problem.\"\nAfter getting permission, the boss nodded, cut open another section, looked at the cross-section, then sprayed it with a blowtorch for a while.\n\"No color change, it’s pure gold. Your gold weighs 13.23 grams, you must have weighed it yourself before bringing it here. Today’s buyback price is 612, can you accept that?\" After confirming the quality, the boss offered a quote.\nDamn.\nLin Li’s brain worked rapidly.\nA total of—\nThen Lin Li realized he couldn’t calculate it.\nMan, so many decimals, and not even a whole number, mental math can’t do any of it.\nFortunately, the boss had already pressed the calculator, and the mechanical voice echoed in the store: \"612 times 13.23 equals 8096.76.\nDamn!\n\"Boss, just give me eight thousand one, the rest is on me, all my treat, guys!\" Hearing that number, Lin Li waved his hand, quite generously.\nBoss: \"?\"\nBoss: \"Give me your mom’s WeChat too.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Sorry boss, accidentally mistook you for Bufan, just give me eight thousand ninety.\" Lin Li realized belatedly.\nBufan doesn’t sound like a good creature.\nThe boss waved his hand, \"No need, let’s go with this price, how do you want the money?\"\n\"By hand, forget it, boss, give me a bag, preferably black.\" Lin Li thought for a moment and said.\n\"I meant WeChat or Alipay.\"\n\"Oh, oh, either works.\"\n\"Alipay then, give me your code.\"\n\"Beep.\"\n\"It’s sent.\"\nNot everyone’s life is all about failure; there will always be countless successful transactions.\nLooking at the balance showing over eight thousand more, enough for over twenty fleshlight models (Granny Liu mold), Lin Li felt as if he was being massaged by Xiaojing, so satisfying.\nIndeed, people get bad when they have money.\nSuddenly wanted a massage from Xiaojing, but sadly, whether it’s Light Duke Xiaojing or Tianhong Xiaojing, he didn’t know where they were now.\nLife, oh life, so fleeting, so fleeting.\nLin Li rode his bike home and immediately started updating his gear on Taobao based on previous experience.\nThis time, Lin Li didn’t hold back at all.\nCounting his savings, leaving two thousand for basic living expenses and emergencies, the remaining sixteen thousand was spent clean in just over half an hour.\nAlthough it was an immediate bankruptcy, there was nothing to feel sorry about; it was all necessary investment.\nPreviously uncertain if he had a way to earn money, Lin Li didn’t dare spend too much at all.\nNow making money from the beautiful ladies has been verified as feasible, if lucky, he might break even in one day next week.\nThe future looks bright!",

Maybe that’s what we call perspective.\"\nOn Wednesday, the geography teacher had to attend to something and didn’t come to class. After a delightful self-study session, as the bell rang, Bai Bufan said with a smug look.\n\"Indeed, when the teacher is late, we never make him stand as punishment. Clear distinction,\" Lin Li nodded in agreement:\n\"Whoever said our generation is the lost generation? Judging by this, we are the most promising generation! So kind-hearted.\"\nBai Bufan couldn’t match Lin Li’s shamelessness and couldn’t continue the conversation.\nIf everyone in this generation were like him and Lin Li, even the Great Qing’s revival would be hopeful.\nThe next period was P.E. class, and the two headed to the playground together.\nWhen they gathered at the designated spot at the sound of the preparatory bell, Wang Ze came over with the P.E. teacher.\nAfter Wang Ze returned to the group, You Jun, the P.E. teacher, tapped his backside with the attendance register in his hand and then said to everyone:\n\"Wang Ze has already discussed with me. Since the sports meet is approaching, using the P.E. class time to train is quite necessary. At his suggestion, I’ll only take up the first ten minutes of this class. The rest of the time, it’s up to you.\"\n\"Yay!\" Everyone cheered excitedly upon hearing this.\n\"Wang Ze is awesome.\"\n\"Truly worthy of being a sports student!\"\nNowadays in P.E. class, there are metrics to meet. Generally, if half the period is free activity time, it’s considered a lot. Sometimes there’s none at all.\nBeing the hero of the moment, Wang Ze wore a rather forced smile, hiding his accomplishments and name.\n\"Boys will test for 1000 meters, girls for 800 meters, and then it’s free activities,\" You Jun continued.\n\"Wang Ze is awes—huh?\"\nThe cheers died down, leaving only a deathly quiet.\nThree seconds later, Wang Ze could feel countless resentful glances behind him.\nBut he was powerless.\nJust when he was coming over with You Jun, he had miserably asked, \"Old You, if you dump this on me, what about my parents?\"\nHowever, facing such a question, You Jun merely patted Wang Ze on the shoulder:\n\"On the road to growth, you always have to lose something. Those who aren’t willing to let go of anything can’t change anything.\"\n\"Old You, why not use yours?\"\n\"My parents are still useful.\"\n\"Damn.\"\nAs for the coach and P.E. teacher who could double his training load anytime, Wang Ze could only smile and endure.\nThe wails of the crowd could not change You Jun’s decision. He said loudly:\n\"Wang Ze leads the way, let’s start with a slow lap to warm up, then boys stop at the starting line, girls stop at the 200-meter line.\nAfter all the boys finish 200 meters, Wenjing, you give the ’run’ command to the girls and signal to me. I won’t come over, I’ll time you at the finish line instead.\"\n\"Okay,\" Xie Wenjing nodded.\n...\nStart the slow run.\n\"Wang Ze, don’t start running just yet; I have something to ask you,\" Lin Li shouted from behind.\n\"No chance, buddy, no chance,\" Zhang Haoyang answered for Wang Ze.\n\"I need to poop.\"\nMeanwhile, Bai Bufan beside him was visibly starting to get nervous.\nOne already feels like pooping before a physical test.\nThis time, the test was too sudden, and Bai Bufan hadn’t emptied the load that morning.\n\"I feel it’s about to come out,\" he said with a strained voice.\n\"Poop, poop,\" hearing this, Lin Li shouted towards Bai Bufan’s butt.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You idiot, that’s not the kind of ’about to come out’ I meant! If it really comes out, you’re screwed!\"\n\"Bao Wei didn’t bring his backpack out, so I can’t give you his glasses case,\" Lin Li shrugged, indicating he was helpless too.\nNo way to waste a \"Poop Suppression Talisman\" on him; it’s like feeding 50 system currency to a dog.\n\"Damn it! Why is this so sudden!!\" Bai Bufan kept wailing.\nLin Li ignored it and reached out, \"Bufan, lend me your watch.\"\n\"What are you planning to do with my watch?\" Instantly stopping his wailing, Bai Bufan was very wary.\n\"I’ll use it to check the pace for each lap; I’m planning to run 3000 meters straight,\" Lin Li explained.\nEven though running 3000 meters might not result in as good a time as just running 1000 meters, Lin Li didn’t care about that. What mattered was finishing the test; after all, this wasn’t like the college entrance exam where it counted towards grades.\nEven if he ran it in his usual four and a half minutes, there would be no penalty.\n\"Damn, are you crazy? Alright then, just be gentle with my watch.\" Bai Bufan was shocked but handed over his watch to Lin Li since he was serious.\nHe was planning to take it off anyway.\nPoor students often have more stationery, and those not good at sports often believe having a watch on their wrist is extra weight, making running more of a torment.\n\"A young fellow who’s teachable; may the wind be at your back for the entire run later.\"\n\"Thanks for the encouragement.\"\nLin Li accelerated to the front of the group, telling Wang Ze about his plan.\nWang Ze nodded upon hearing, \"Sure, I don’t mind. We sports students automatically get excellent marks in physical tests.\"\n\"Dirty PY deal.\"\n...\n\"Do some stretching if needed. Alright, everyone get on the track,\" You Jun signaled the boys at the starting line after both boys and girls were ready.\nUsually, this was when Lin Li would be anxiously squeezing into the innermost lane, always feeling that spot was the best for starting.\nBut the confident Lin Li of now wouldn’t have such anxieties, so he confidently squeezed into the innermost lane.\nSqueezing is good for your health.\n\"Run!\" You Jun pressed the timer.\nThe crowd flowed out like a stream, with Wang Ze leading the charge, followed naturally by others good at sports.\nLin Li wasn’t in a hurry at all, running right behind Bai Bufan.\nBut after merely five seconds, he already felt this guy was too slow.\n\"On your left,\" Lin Li raised an eyebrow back at Bai Bufan as he overtook him.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWatching Lin Li speed away, Bai Bufan’s eyes widened.\nThis guy pretends to be Captain America... is he planning to keep himself in his own circle?\nLin Li started as a happy superhero.\nZhang Haoyang, overtaken! Zhou Baowei, overtaken! Qin Zeyu, overtaken!\nWang Yuezhi... that’s not possible, once a son, always a son. Father-daughter drama is forbidden.\nAlmost effortlessly, Lin Li quickly followed behind Wang Ze, becoming the second among the boys.\nThe Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, terrifying indeed.\n\"Lin Li, keep it up~\"\nAt the 200-meter mark, among the waiting girls on the side, Chen Yu Ying looked at Lin Li’s ranking with some surprise in her eyes, but was not stingy with her praise.\n\"Alright, you keep it up too.\" Lin Li waved with a smile.\n\"Damn, Lin Li, you’re behind me?\" Wang Ze turned his head upon hearing the voice, surprised to find the footsteps behind him had always been Lin Li’s?\n\"Wang Ze, your butt is really tempting.\" Lin Li dodged the question.\nWang Ze raised his middle finger, then slightly increased his speed.\nLin Li followed closely.\nAt the last 200 meters of the thousand meters, several boys good at sports, like Qin Zeyu and Chen Tianming, had already overtaken the two of them.\nAfter all, everyone had different goals; there were still more than two kilometers to run. It wasn’t possible to sprint at this point.\n\"Fourth, fifth.\"\nDuring the physical test, the results are not scored, just ranked.\nLin Li then checked his watch himself; the first thousand meters took three minutes and forty seconds.\nTo be honest, this was the fastest thousand meters Lin Li had ever run in his life.\nFifteen hundred meters, five minutes and forty seconds.\nThe record for the 1500 meters at the Nansang high school sports meet is 4 minutes and 33 seconds, not a very high record.\nTwo thousand meters, seven minutes and thirty seconds.\nThree thousand meters, eleven minutes and twenty-eight seconds.\n\"Damn ha——ha——Lin Li ha——you mother ha——\" After finishing three thousand meters, Wang Ze took a few steps forward, rested his hands on his knees, turned to look at Lin Li behind him, and panted heavily, \"Really kept up ha——la?\"\nEven in the end, when Wang Ze started sprinting, he couldn’t shake off Lin Li.\n\"As long as you have legs.\" Lin Li, also panting, gave an OK sign.\nThis time, it truly wasn’t an act.\nIn fact, Lin Li’s panting now was deliberately exaggerated.\nThe feeling of having no iron taste in his throat at the end of a long run was something Lin Li experienced for the first time.\nIf Lin Li hadn’t intended to surpass Wang Ze from beginning to end, he could have overtaken him after the 1500 meters.\n11.28.33, the watch froze on this time.\nThis speed wasn’t slow, averaging less than four minutes per kilometer. Lin Li, in the past, couldn’t run a thousand meters in under four minutes.\nA university student’s physical test for three thousand meters in twelve minutes is full marks. In the first-grade segment, if there are no sports students involved in this project, this result is very likely to be first, and lead greatly from second place.\nAs for the school sports meet record for the men’s three thousand meters, it’s ten minutes and thirty-two seconds. There’s still a huge gap.\nBut that’s normal, hasty warm-ups, hasty attire. Wang Ze surely wasn’t treating this as a competition. If he could approach the school record, that’d be shocking.\nLin Li was quietly happy that Nansang wasn’t a sports-focused school.\nMoreover, the school sports meet records were relatively low, definitely not the limit for those sports students. It has to do with the level of the participants and how seriously they took it.\nIn the publicly announced athletics records of Nansang Middle School, there are also records of different grade students who’ve created better records at city and provincial-level student sports games, all much more exaggerated than school sports meet records. Some even reached first-class athlete standards at grade one, perhaps impossible to replicate, as if entering a Zone state.\nThe reason that heavy rain could ruin someone’s sports dream is because the environment really matters.\nLin Li was in no hurry; speaking of which, he hadn’t even tried his best. In tasks from Beauty Lady, there’s a task to strengthen lower body muscle strength, isn’t there?\nThe lower body must cover the other two legs, and this kind of direct intensity buff should markedly enhance his running speed.\nThe core goal is first place, the secondary goal is to break records.\n\"No, Lin Li, how have you been training this semester? I’m really curious, could you teach me?\" After catching his breath a bit, Wang Ze sincerely inquired, \"You Jun really needs to learn from you.\"\n\"My method is quite lively, donating once at the hospital nets at least three thousand, can You Jun afford it?\" Lin Li retorted.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nWhich method are you talking about?\n\"The method from Journey to the West, not the method of licking and sucking!\"\n\"Oh, sorry, a misunderstanding.\"\n\"You better have misunderstood. So, tell me, how did you train?\" Wang Ze was genuinely curious.\nLin Li went from being one of the last in the sports class to keeping up with him in three thousand meters in just a month?\nThough he’s not a long-distance specialist, this doesn’t add up, does it?\nAlso, why is this guy looking in better shape than me?\nWang Ze was now full of questions.\n\"Do 100 sit-ups every day, 100 push-ups, 100 squats, and run 10 kilometers, rain or shine, for three years straight. Go on, train, this is my greatest treasure, all handed to you.\"\nLin Li didn’t hold back, sharing his secret with Wang Ze.\n\"Are you a One-Punch Man too?\" Wang Ze saw right through it and gave a thumbs up: \"Normal people train like Saitama, keeping their knees and ankles healthy, is this way.\"\n\"Well, maybe I was born with the sacred body of a sports student?\"\n\"Alright, then Lin Li, you just enter these two events. I feel with more training, you’ll be secure for first place. If there are no experts, eleven minutes and a half is already enough for first.\"\n\"Tsk, let me see if I can recruit another strong man, so I can leave this out, run my specialty event, and grab another first.\"\nWang Ze pinched his chin, thinking.\n\"What about the relay, do we need someone to run the 100-meter now?\" Lin Li hadn’t forgotten about it.\n\"Alright... eh? You’re recovered? Running now?\" Wang Ze widened his eyes.\n\"Walk to the 100-meter starting line and you’ll be more or less ready, it’s just a 100-meter run.\" Lin Li nodded.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\n\"Recovered so quickly? Did you take some drugs?\"\n\"I’m fully recovered too, Wang Ze, you’re truly not up to it.\" At this moment, Bai Bufan got up from the grass and walked over, looking down on Wang Ze, who hadn’t caught his breath.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nThis prick Bai Bufan is truly shameless.\nThis guy ran only a thousand meters, rested for nearly ten minutes, still looking dead, yet came to mock him.\n\"When are you ( ) going to ( )?\" Wang Ze from the top lane of Nansang said such.",

      "content": "Chapter 283: Chapter 229: Actually, I’ve always disliked it.\nBai Bufan ignored Wang Ze’s swearing and curiously asked, \"So, how did Lin Li do in the three-thousand-meter run?\"\n\"Eleven minutes and twenty-eight seconds.\"\n\"That’s really like ferrous sulfate,\" Bai Bufan exclaimed.\n\"What does ferrous sulfate mean?\" Wang Ze didn’t understand.\n\"That’s how uneducated people are, talking to you guys is seriously like talking to a brick wall,\" Bai Bufan said disdainfully, \"Ferrous sulfate, chemical formula FeSo4, translated to Chinese it means ’inconceivable’, got it, Zhang Yu Wang?\"\nIt feels so good to mock someone about their knowledge, Lin Li, I understand you now!\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nYou call that a Chinese translation?\nAlthough he hadn’t quite processed it yet, he decided to first drag his crippled body to kill Bai Bufan.\n...\nRan a simple 100 meters.\nLin Li in terms of sprint explosiveness didn’t have the relative composure he had during long runs.\nBut Wang Ze didn’t demand too much, just confirming Lin Li didn’t run slowly would suffice, as long as during the sports meet he wasn’t left far behind on the track, since the school sports meet was ultimately just a fun event, and results were secondary.\nConfirming the spot, Lin Li was a lot more relaxed too.\nAnd Lin Li was confident; given some time for targeted training, even in sprinting, his speed would greatly surpass that of ordinary people.\nRight now, Lin Li was still missing techniques.\nOnce that’s made up for, at least he wouldn’t be the one dragging the class down.\nAs for whether he could take first place, that would depend on the performance of the other three teammates and the opponents, and there’s no use in forcing it.\nBai Bufan had been watching from the side and seeing them ’selected’, he approached and greeted them, \"Shall we go then, to check over there... Tianming, what are you looking at so intently?\"\nLin Li turned around at these words, and Chen Tianming, who also just finished running, was staring into the distance.\nFollowing his gaze, it was the class of seventeen.\nWho is he looking at, it’s really hard to guess.\n\"Tianming, how’s the chatting with your Qiaoqiao going, any progress?\" Wang Ze immediately went up and wrapped his arms around Chen Tianming’s shoulders, curiously getting in on the drama.\n\"What progress, we’re just really good friends, just chatting a bit more.\" Chen Tianming said shyly.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nWhen a girl acts coy it’s called being coy, when a boy acts coy it’s called goofing around.\nDisgusting.\nLin Li clicked his tongue, suspecting there was something more in this ’really good friends’.\n\"Have you told her you like her? Weren’t you planning on it by National Day?\" Wang Ze continued to inquire.\n\"...No, I chickened out, I’m afraid of rejection.\" Chen Tianming replied, withdrawing his gaze with a guilty heart.\nWang Ze frowned, just about to encourage him, when Bai Bufan nodded empathetically, \"You should chicken out, you must think thrice before doing such things, I confessed to my goddess before, and she told me to piss off right in front of me... Sigh, it was devastating.\"\nLin Li glanced at Bai Bufan, had this guy confessed again?\nNope, something’s fishy.\nWang Ze hadn’t realized this point yet and instead paused his encouragement of Chen Tianming, comforting Bai Bufan:\n\"Bufan, most likely that’s just a joke, there’s still hope, you won’t just give up like that, right?\"\n\"It’s not possible anymore. When I checked, I accidentally peed on her shoes, and that day my face was as red as the setting sun, surpassing any sweet talk, but it didn’t surpass her slap.\"\nBai Bufan looked up at a forty-five-degree angle at the sky, not wanting the tears in his weathered eyes to fall.\n\"I even said sorry to her, offered to let her pee on my shoes to even the score, but she refused, girls, sigh, truly incomprehensible.\"\nChen Tianming’s mouth twitched uncontrollably.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\n\"Pee——Eh? Bai Bufan! How dare you mess with me!\" Wang Ze realized, and went up to choke Bai Bufan’s throat.\n\"Ugh! Wang, Wang Ze, if you choke me more, I’ll, I’ll pee on your shoes!\" Bai Bufan struggled intermittently.\n\"Ignore Bufan, the idiot,\" after dealing with Bai Bufan, Wang Ze put his hand on Chen Tianming’s shoulder and spoke slowly:\n\"Tianming, you need to understand, even Internet Explorer (IE) has the courage to ask if you want to set it as the default browser, and you’re telling me you don’t have the courage to confess to the person you like?\"\nUpon hearing this, Chen Tianming’s eyes widened slightly, he pursed his lips, seemingly gaining a bit of courage.\n\"Wang Ze, what you said makes——\"\n\"Wang Ze, have you ever agreed to that request from Internet Explorer?\" Lin Li’s somber voice drifted over.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nChen Tianming: \"?\"\n\"Eh? Haha, um... Well, I will agree when I get back!\" Wang Ze scratched his head awkwardly, then said with a forced smile.\n\"In this world, besides the ’I people’ and ’E people’, there’s IE people: slow to react, unloved, already eliminated by society, abstract in appearance...\" Bai Bufan’s somber voice followed closely, \"Tianming, which one are you?\"\nChen Tianming: \"???\"\nYou all are fucked.\nChen Tianming’s throat moved, and whatever slight courage he had immediately vanished.\nClearly, he had become a first-class master at playing the quitting drum.\n\"Haha, I think it’s better not to, there’s no need, there’s no need, it’s really good to keep it as a secret crush now. If Qiaoqiao really knows I like her, and she’s not ready, it will be awkward interacting with her in the future,\" Chen Tianming found a reason for himself.\n\"Actually, your secret crush is quite obvious; the reason it hasn’t been pointed out is that the other party doesn’t like you,\" Lin Li spoke.\nChen Tianming: \"?\"\nNo way, why are you coming after me?\nStacking murder descriptions doesn’t need to be stacked like this.\nAs Chen Tianming turned to glare death at Lin Li ready to argue, Lin Li spoke to explain: \"I’m not attacking you; these words were said by Hayao Miyazaki, I’m just reciting a famous quote.\"\n\"Oh, oh.\" Chen Tianming nodded, then found it hard to criticize Lin Li.\nA few seconds later:\n\"Does Hayao Miyazaki speak Chinese? You’re not fooling me, are you?\"\nLin Li didn’t respond to that dumb question.\nThe four of them headed to the shot put field on the playground, where girls and some boys were selecting participants for jump rope.\nJump rope involves two people swinging a long rope while others jump in one by one until everyone is jumping together.\nIt was a bit of distance, and the four didn’t have much to talk about for a while, so they started chatting again about why Nansang didn’t have gym clothes and athletic shorts, missing out on a good view.\nThe main discussion excluding Chen Tianming.\nAs for Chen Tianming, he was silent.\nHalfway through, Chen Tianming suddenly stopped in his tracks.\nThe three looked at him, slightly puzzled.\nChen Tianming: \"So funny, Hayao Miyazaki really puts on airs, honestly, I’ve always kind of disliked his films.\"\nLin Li, Bai Bufan, Wang Ze: \"?\"\nWhat’s he babbling about?\nChen Tianming continued muttering, \"I reckon that guy’s senile too.\"\n\"His films are really getting more mediocre; I didn’t say it before because I was considering old ties.\"\n\"Not even as good as Makoto Shinkai’s, haha, an old guy who won’t die becomes a thief!\"\nChen Tianming spoke more impassioned, filled with righteous indignation.\n\"...\"\nThe three exchanged looks, realizing, and then, in unison, looked down at their shoes, their features twisted with suppressed laughter.\nChen Tianming’s resentment was so thick it could summon a special-grade curse spirit.\nThe four walked a little further.\nChen Tianming stopped again:\n\"Who has Hayao Miyazaki’s QQ? I really have to tell him, trust me this time, Qiaoqiao is really different.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 284: Chapter 230: Lin Li is really kind-hearted\nThese days, you can even see someone trying to smear Hayao Miyazaki online.\nLin Li didn’t pay any more attention to the special-grade curse spirit Chen Tianming. He approached the big rope jumping area, got a clear view of the situation, and then shouted:\n\"Ding Sihan, stop your legs!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThen, while Ding Sihan was in a daze, Lin Li sprang forward, hugging his head, jumped as the rope hit the ground, and swiftly escaped.\nBehind, cutting in line, Ding Sihan, who followed to jump, got hit on the leg.\n\"Haha, loser.\" Lin Li turned back, planted his fists on his hips, pointed at Ding Sihan and laughed loudly.\n\"You messed up my rhythm! And you have the nerve to bark? I’ll show you who’s useless! I’ll show you!\" Ding Sihan, furious and embarrassed, chased after Lin Li and began to kick.\n\"My school uniform and pants are custom-made, eighteen hundred! Eighteen hundred!\" So Lin Li clutched his rear and ran.\nEighteen hundred, got dirty.\nThe two of them returned to the big rope jumping area.\nNansang’s setup for this event used the \"figure-eight rope\" format, where all contestants enter and exit the rope circle sequentially on an \"8\" shaped route. The winner is determined by the number of successful completions within three minutes.\nThe rule is two people to swing the rope, eight contestants, but now there are many people watching to see who jumps well, deciding who to let in.\nLin Li naturally blended in with the crowd, almost flawlessly, though he constantly worried about the rope hitting his head, so every jump was head-hugged.\n\"How are you jumping so well?\" Ding Sihan hesitantly asked from behind.\n\"Obviously, it’s a talent, it couldn’t possibly be because back in elementary school I’d always say to my buddies that jumping rubber bands were a naive game only sissies played. But then every day after school I’d immediately join the kids in my neighborhood, singing ’First in jumping rubber bands, twenty-one, two, five, six, two, five, seven, two, eight, two, nine, thirty-one,’ right?\"\nHa—, ha—.\" It was so long, Lin Li was almost out of breath saying it.\nLin Li suddenly realized, long complicated sentences are surely a kind of language deep-throat.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"You’re really impressive, Lin Li. You seem quite suitable for this event.\" Chen Yu Ying came over and said.\n\"I’m good with anything, after all, I’m an all-around player. I’m the cornerstone of Class Four, ready to be moved wherever needed! Loyalty! Just waiting for the class leader’s command, no matter the event, I’ll immediately defect!\" Lin Li saluted solemnly on the spot.\nChen Yu Ying was already used to it, nodded: \"I’ll see, Lin Li, are you good at other events? Like this stepping stone river crossing, everyone seems awkward walking it.\"\nLin Li looked in the direction Chen Yu Ying pointed, seeing three bricks on the ground.\nThe so-called stepping stone river crossing game required contestants to use these three bricks as footholds, moving from the start line to the finish line, with no part of the body touching the ground, or else having to start over.\nNansang’s approach here was a relay race, with a fifteen-meter route, six people responsible for three parts forward and three parts back, calculating total time spent.\n\"This is simple.\"\nLin Li nodded confidently, stepped forward, weighed the bricks, and then began to ’cross the river’.\nThe standard way was to have each foot on a brick, then move the third brick forward before proceeding, repeating the process.\nLin Li started this way too, his speed not fast, seemingly adjusting.\nBut after only a few meters, Lin Li put one brick aside, using only two bricks—lifting one foot, pulling out the brick behind with his hand while the other foot was coming down on the brick ahead.\nThis method was very fast but required certain skills, the other side Bai Bufan was also trying this event, his eyes widened.\nLin Li could walk, why couldn’t I walk — so Bai Bufan tried it as well.\nHmm.\nStepping on his own hand still hurt.\n\"Simple.\" After easily finishing, Lin Li stood up and snapped his fingers.\n\"So the third stone is really extra?\" Chen Yu Ying covered her slightly opened lips in surprise and remarked.\n\"Not extra, I’ve already thought of how to use it.\" Lin Li waved his hand. He’s a pro, with tricks up his sleeves.\n\"What use?\"\n\"When the time comes, I’ll stash it in my pocket, whoever is in front of our class team, I’ll toss it at them.\" Lin Li reasoned without reason.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nIs that how bricks are supposed to be used?\nWell.\nBricks seem to be used this way.\n\"The school won’t allow that,\" Chen Yu Ying said with a smile.\n\"Why not? Others need three bricks just like Bai Bufan because they’re useless, while I spare one, shouldn’t I be free to throw it?\" Lin Li was getting angry.\n\"If others quit the competition, they’d spare three bricks. Lin Li, who do you think they might throw at?\" Bai Bufan lazily spoke from the side, not forgetting to aim at Lin Li’s head with a brick in hand.\nAlso a turn a blind eye situation.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nMakes sense.\n\"I support all school rules! Student safety is the utmost priority!\" Lin Li exclaimed seriously.\nThe girls burst into laughter.\nLin Li then tested other fun projects they could try.\nAll achieved good results.\nTo get these results, it comes down to Lin Li believing his physical control ability improved 100%, and his understanding increased by 40% with these two buffs, the latter speeding up comprehension of essential points of fun projects, and the former quickly turned his ’theoretical experience’ into practice, making failure nearly impossible.\nListening to the girls’ constant exclamations and generous compliments, Lin Li’s little tail was almost showing in the sky.",

In that case, when I arrange for the classmates who aren’t great at sports to participate in a fun event for our class, we’ll need to rely on you as much as possible for victory, Lin Li,\" said Chen Yu Ying.\n\"No problem, leave it to me.\" Lin Li patted his chest.\n\"I lost my wallet, Lin Li. Can you help me find it?\" Bai Bufan suddenly chimed in.\n\"No problem, leave it to me.\" Lin Li understood immediately.\n\"Then why aren’t you giving it back to me, you thief!\"\n\"... What a cold joke.\" Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan only reacted a moment later and laughed as they spoke.\n\"By the way, did the class president participate in any competitive events?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"I joined the two hundred and four hundred meters, but it’s just to make up the numbers. Getting a participation score is good enough.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded and replied.\nChen Yu Ying’s athletic performance in their class: among the girls, she could be considered at the tail end of the first tier during running.\nJoining to make up numbers was a modest way to put it, but it indeed would be hard to achieve a good ranking at the sports meet, depending on the level of her peers.\n\"And long-distance running? For the women’s 3000 meters, who’s up for it?\" Lin Li asked.\nNansang Middle School’s girls also have a 3000-meter event. For girls to participate in this requires even more courage than boys.\n\"Currently, only Wanqiu is confirmed,\" said Chen Yu Ying.\nAlthough Qu Wanqiu was lazy, she was indeed the best runner among the girls—Xie Wenjing was an athletic student, but her specialty was shot put, not running.\n\"What, I’m not alone in this battle!\" Lin Li gestured for Qu Wanqiu to come over, then extended his hand in camaraderie.\n\"Did you wash your hands?\" Qu Wanqiu glanced at Lin Li’s hand, hesitating.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWhat kind of dragon-born Little Qiuqiu was that?\nSo, instead of a handshake, he showed the international middle finger.\n\"3000 meters! 3000 meters! It’s driving me crazy!\" Wang Ze seemed to hear Lin Li discussing the 3000 meters and walked over dejectedly, shaking Lin Li’s shoulders wildly.\n\"What’s going on?\" Lin Li asked, shaking along with him.\n\"No one in the class is as eager as you to run long-distance races. Why won’t anyone even join just to make up numbers? Lin Li, quickly use your foolish energy to infect everyone to become fools too?\" Wang Ze’s words were harsh but had a point.\nLin Li was about to express that he was helpless, but the idea king suddenly had an idea.\n\"Wang Ze, if I can find someone to run the 3000 meters for you, what will you give me in return?\" he asked.\nWang Ze answered, \"My passionate and sincere love.\"\nLin Li walked away.\n\"No, no, no, Lin Li, if you can really find someone, from now on you’ll be my sworn father. When you say east, I won’t go west; I will follow your lead,\" Wang Ze quickly changed his tune.\n\"A man’s word is unreliable, don’t speak such nonsense. Here’s the deal, if I find someone, you owe me ten reasonable small favors,\" Lin Li waved his hand and said.\nUpon hearing ’small favors,’ Chen Yu Ying suddenly felt a tickle on her sole.\nLin Li wouldn’t be interested in boys’ feet too, would he?\n\"First, tell me what kind of favors you’re thinking of?\" Wang Ze asked cautiously towards Lin Li, who was known as the sword grave.\n\"Like helping me buy drinks or helping me deal with Bufan, or Bao Wei,\" Lin Li said without considering anything about feet.\n\"That’s it? Sure thing! Dealing with Bufan and Bao Wei doesn’t even need you to ask, I’d gladly do it!\" Wang Ze immediately relaxed.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"I feel like you guys are being a bit rude, I protest,\" he said.\nIgnoring a bun is what dogs do, and humans ignore Bai Bufan.\n\"Deal!\"\n\"Who are you going to ask? I’ve asked everyone, and no one was willing.\" With the deal sealed, Wang Ze asked curiously.\nCould it be Lin Li had some secret on a buddy he didn’t know about?\n\"I’ll just say this up front, I can’t participate in this, seriously.\" Bai Bufan immediately backed ten meters away, maintaining a safe distance from Lin Li—so far away that without shouting, he couldn’t be heard clearly.\nOne thousand meters was already taxing for him, and three thousand meters was like a death sentence executed repeatedly.\n\"I’m not counting on you, useless. Class president, don’t go yet, you’re a necessary witness.\"\nLin Li disdainfully spoke, first reminding Chen Yu Ying beside him before looking at his target—the one who occasionally looked at him with a gaze too intense to ignore:\n\"Yuezhi, come over here!\"\n\"What for?\" Wang Yuezhi unwillingly came over, looking warily at Lin Li.\nThings were fine when he was jumping rope with Chen Yu Ying, and then that dog Lin Li came, and took Chen Yu Ying away to play other fun events.\nSo annoying.\nWang Ze was surprised to see Wang Yuezhi. Although he said he’d ’asked everyone,’ he really only asked the people he knew. Wang Yuezhi was unfamiliar, and his running was average, so Wang Ze didn’t think it necessary to ask.\nCould this guy be a hidden long-distance enthusiast?\n\"I’m going to assign you a running errand task.\" Lin Li said with a gentle smile.\n\"Go ahead, I’ll do it.\" Wang Yuezhi nodded.\nHe’s not someone who can’t afford to lose. The main bet was something that Chen Yu Ying remembered clearly, and Lin Li was still decent enough not to make him call him ’dad’ in front of Chen Yu Ying, at least not embarrassing him publicly.\nThe bet back then was not only about calling ’dad’ but also included three non-demanding running errands, something Wang Yuezhi hadn’t forgotten.\n\"See, you heard it, right? Wang Yuezhi agreed, so just fill his name in for the 3000 meters and 1500 meters slot.\" A young one you can teach, no need to say more. So Lin Li immediately and cheerfully said.",

You live up to the name!\" Wang Ze clapped happily!\nWang Yuezhi: \"Huh? What are you guys talking about—\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\nWait a minute.\nWhat the heck were these two just saying?\n\"—Cough, cough, cough!\"\nWang Yuezhi suddenly spat out a mouthful of saliva into the air. Fortunately, Lin Li, accompanied by Chen Yu Ying, dodged quickly, leaving everyone unharmed.\nIgnoring his own breath, Wang Yuezhi stared wide-eyed at Lin Li, as if an eight-magnitude earthquake had struck his pupils, and said with a trembling voice, \"Lin Li, are you seriously calling running 3,000 meters and 1,500 meters an errand task?\"\nIt was clear that Wang Yuezhi was really shocked, especially since hearing a curse word from him was pretty rare—especially in Chen Yu Ying’s presence.\nAs for Chen Yu Ying, she was now standing just behind Lin Li, her head bowed, struggling not to laugh, and took the opportunity to sneakily punch Lin Li lightly.\nLin Li was truly mischievous.\n\"Errand, run, leg, run and leg, no matter how you look at it, if 3,000 meters isn’t an errand task, then what is?\" Lin Li made a running motion on the spot, swinging his arms and lifting his legs, looking completely justified as he spoke.\nThe words are cheeky, the logic impeccable.\nWang Yuezhi: \"...\"\nHe wanted to curse.\nNo, Lin Li was not human; he wanted to curse a beast.\n\"No, no, no!\" Wang Yuezhi hurriedly waved his hands, saying that running 3,000 meters would be the death of him, \"We originally agreed on three reasonable errands, but this is already excessive.\"\n\"If during recess, I ask you to go to the school store and buy me a bottle of water, is this task too much?\" Lin Li asked almost without thinking upon hearing that.\n\"That’s not excessive, I can definitely accept that,\" Wang Yuezhi nodded.\n\"Then there you go! Counting the distance up and down the stairs, the round-trip distance from our classroom to the store is about 2 kilometers. If that’s the case, weren’t you supposed to do three errands for me? Just right, these three errands can be split into the 1,500-meter race, the first 1,500 meters of the 3,000-meter race, and the second 1,500 meters of the 3,000-meter race. Perfect!\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"???\"\nWait a minute.\nStop arguing, let me think.\nIs this right? This isn’t right, is it?\nDidn’t this guy plan all of this from the start?\nLooking at the dazed Wang Yuezhi, Lin Li thought his logic was flawless.\nThen why was Chen Yu Ying secretly punching him in the back this whole time?\nDarn it, the class president was actually hitting him for Wang Yuezhi.\nLin Li wanted to dye his head green.\n\"No, no, no, no!\" Suddenly seeing the light, Wang Yuezhi grabbed at what seemed like a life-saving straw, reconnecting his brain, and quickly denied it again: \"Lin Li, if I help you buy something from the store, there’s no rush, we have twenty minutes during recess. This can’t be compared with a race!\"\n\"Exactly, exactly, exactly.\" Lin Li wagged his finger in front of Wang Yuezhi: \"Yuezhi, we didn’t expect you to get a good ranking. Our goal is purely to earn basic participation points, just to free Wang Ze.\nSo you really don’t need to hurry. Just treat it like going to buy something during recess; forget twenty minutes, you could run for twenty hours and it wouldn’t matter, as long as you finish. Isn’t this easier than going to buy something?\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"?????\"\nWait again.\nStop arguing, let me think again.\nHey? Now it does seem to be purely an errand task?\nSeeing that Wang Yuezhi seemed to want to refute, Lin Li slightly frowned: \"Yuezhi, the reasoning has been explained to you in detail. This was the bet between us buddies from the start; you can’t be a sore loser, right? What do you think? You’re not thinking of backing out, are you? Well, that’s okay too...\"\nWang Yuezhi raised his head, looked at Lin Li, then glanced at the witness Chen Yu Ying, and suddenly felt he was being a bit too unreasonable, so he quickly countered:\n\"Who said I was backing out! Fine! I’ll run! I’ll run, isn’t that it!\"\nDamn.\nA second after speaking, Wang Yuezhi regretted it.\nWhat nonsense had he just spouted.\nBecause with Chen Yu Ying present and heating up impulsively, Wang Yuezhi just gritted his teeth and said: \"But Lin Li, remember, from now on, all of this is over; I owe you nothing anymore!\"\n\"OK! I believe you! Wang Ze, you hear that! You’re free!\" Lin Li gave Wang Yuezhi a thumbs up, then turned toward Wang Ze.\n\"Thanks, godfather! In the future, you can call on this godson whenever you need to deal with Bufan and Bao Wei!\" Wang Ze was grateful to tears!\n\"Wang Yuezhi, we’ll be cheering you on.\" Standing just behind Lin Li, Chen Yu Ying politely said to Wang Yuezhi at this time.\nAfter all, we definitely have to go watch Lin Li run and cheer for him, just saying a few extra words is no big deal.\nWang Yuezhi: \"!\"\nHey?\nCheering for me?\nHehe.\nGlug, glug, glug.\nAfter chatting with Wang Ze, Lin Li was surprised to see the suddenly goofy Wang Yuezhi being dazed on the spot. What happened?\nWhere do these pink bubbles come from?\nThough unsure why, a happy ending was reached for everyone.",

He then quickly turned his head to make sure Chen Yu Ying couldn’t hear, and swiftly said to Wang Ze:\n\"I’m the mediocre horse; give me Tian Ji.\"\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nWhat the hell.\n\"However, I must admit, this is indeed the wisdom of our ancestors.\" Lin Li sighed.\n\"Hehe, I don’t quite agree.\" Bai Bufan, who was nearby, said with a sneer, \"Tian Ji’s horse racing sometimes appears extremely foolish.\"\n\"Oh? Brother Bai, why do you say that? Do you have a brilliant insight?\" Lin Li asked curiously, looking at Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan took a deep breath.\n\"In third grade, I had a fight with a classmate, and neither of us backed down, so we arranged a showdown. I called my sixth-grade brother. He then got his eighth-grade brother, so I called my cousin from ninth grade. Unexpectedly, he brought his eleventh-grade brother.\nWe thought we were doomed to lose, but luckily, my cousin had learned the Tian Ji’s horse racing story by then.\nIn the end, it was me from third grade facing my classmate’s eleventh-grade brother.\"\nBai Bufan’s voice was magnetic and deep, seemingly full of stories, abruptly ending at the last line.\nLin Li and Wang Ze laughed until their stomachs hurt.\n\"So, what was the result, Bufan?\" Lin Li squatted and laughed as he asked.\n\"Two to one, we won.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nEven as the victor, he didn’t display any arrogance; instead, his eyes revealed sadness. Perhaps that’s Bai Bufan’s way.\n\"I wasn’t asking about the match; what was your personal outcome?\" Lin Li pressed on.\n\"I don’t know about that. I have no memory of what happened after that day.\" Bai Bufan replied.\n\"Still so modest, still concealing your achievements and reputation!\" Wang Ze sighed.\n\"Or perhaps you woke up in the hospital, right?\" Lin Li suggested, showing understanding.\n\"That’s why I said!\" Bai Bufan suddenly lost his composure, angrily said: \"Tian Ji never considered the inferior horse’s feelings! Isn’t an inferior horse still a horse? Inferior horses have rights too! Tian Ji, that guy, is the most horseless!\"\nReasonable and well-supported, it’s hard not to agree.\nTian Ji was indeed too selfish.\nWith only forty minutes in a class, soon the bell rang for the end of the class.\nAfter helping Wang Ze and Chen Yu Ying return the tools taken from the equipment room, the group went to the snack shop to buy water.\n\"I’ll speak to Teacher Xue later about using the class fund to buy a long rope and other necessary tools for fun activities, otherwise borrowing and returning them each time is a hassle and inconvenient,\" Chen Yu Ying said, \"Lin Li, you might need to lead this since you’re good at leaving campus.\"\n\"No problem, just let me know the specific needs,\" Lin Li responded casually, then fell into thought.\n\"What are you thinking about, would this trouble you?\" Chen Yu Ying noticed and asked.\nBut no matter the trouble, she had to get Lin Li to help her.\n\"Nope, it’s not a trouble. I’m just pondering on which shop could help forge a fake receipt because I’m planning to buy a... no, a 13,999 yuan rope for everyone to jump with. Although such a rope is hard to find, our Class Four should train with the best equipment!\nAs for me, it’s okay to be a little tired or suffer a bit,\"\nLin Li’s words were firm and powerful.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"Hakelin... you, this guy, are truly thinking about everyone in Class Four...\" Wang Ze, beside Lin Li, was captivated by his charm, \"Could you lend me, uh, the rope once you buy it?\"\n\"The class fund doesn’t have that much money,\" Chen Yu Ying laughed and scolded.\nNansang Middle School’s class funds are not much, and all expenditure details are publicly displayed, making it clean and clear in this internet age, avoiding any worrying matters.\n\"No 13,999? Then what about 9,999? I can’t buy a 1TB rope, but I’ll accept a 256GB one?\" Lin Li, unwilling to give up, asked again.\n\"Using TB, GB as units, would it still be a rope? Are you not even willing to pretend, Lin Li! You, this guy! Having such thoughts now, Lin Li, your life is pretty much ruined.\" Ding Sihan acted as Chen Yu Ying’s mouthpiece, her little mouth firing off words like a machine gun.\n\"What do you know, Xiaoding? If I don’t take it, how will the class monitor take it? If the class monitor doesn’t take it, how will Old Jian take it? If Old Jian doesn’t take it, how will Commissioner Smith take it? You can’t be so selfish. I’m truly doing it for everyone!\" Lin Li defended himself.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\nRuined.\nChen Yu Ying sighed: \"Lin Li, you’re not allowed to take the civil services exam in the future, and also no accounting.\"\n\"You can rest easy about that. Don’t forget, class monitor, the sorting hat has already placed me in civil engineering.\" Lin Li waved his hand.\nChen Yu Ying thought for a moment: \"Then, if you become a contractor in the future, you’re not allowed to delay paying the workers.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Why speak such serious words to me! Do I look like someone who’d delay workers’ wages?\" Lin Li got angry.\nFaced with Lin Li’s questioning.\nXiaoding nodded.\nXiaoqu also nodded.\nChen Yu Ying not only nodded but also laughed and said: \"Hmm.\"\nAt Lin Li’s moment of despair, only Old Wang shook his head.\nHowever, Lin Li wasn’t moved, but instead squinted at Wang Ze: \"Wang Ze, why did you shake your head?\"\nIt’s either kicking someone when they’re down or hiding knives in honey.\n\"I think you won’t become a contractor and will spend your life being owed wages. Why would you have the qualification to owe others?\" Wang Ze explained.\nDamn.\nKnew nothing good would come out of this guy’s mouth.\n\"Sigh, misunderstanding is the fate that such excellent individuals like me must endure.\" Lin Li sighed sadly.\nSoon, the five of them finished buying water and started returning to the classroom.\n\"Lin Li, what are you sneakily watching?\" Ding Sihan noticed Lin Li’s gaze and asked.\n\"Recently, I’ve been researching people-reading techniques to enhance social skills. I was observing what you guys are drinking, because this can reveal some social habits.\" Lin Li began analyzing: \"For example—\"\n\"People who like milk tea have lots of girlfriends.\"\n\"People who like baijiu have lots of stories.\"\n\"People who like red wine have lots of lovers.\"\n\"Really? Then what about mine? Vita Lemon Tea, what’s that?\" Ding Sihan looked at the drink in her hand and asked.\nLin Li revealed a smile indicating she finally took the bait:\n\"Pees a lot.\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"What about mine, rock sugar pear?\" Qu Wanqiu asked.\n\"Pees a lot.\"\n\"What about Wang Ze’s iced tea?\" Qu Wanqiu pointed to Wang Ze, who responded with a ’man’ toward Lin Li.\n\"Pees a lot.\"\n\"What about Ying Bao’s real fruit drink?\"\n\"Pees a lot.\"\nQu Wanqiu: \"...\"\nIn a way, Lin Li is rare in treating everyone equally.\n\"I’m not deceiving you guys, if you don’t believe me, try it yourselves,\" Lin Li said innocently, seeing everyone silent.\nDrinking too much really does result in peeing a lot, what I said was clearly correct?\nWhat’s with all their expressions?\n\"Lin Li! What kind of ridiculous people-reading technique did you learn! You can only say this one phrase! Go away!\" Qu Wanqiu picked up her rock sugar pear and threw it at Lin Li.\nLin Li caught it and threw it back to Qu Wanqiu, then looked at Wang Ze: \"Wang Ze, do you want to throw something too?\"\nWang Ze raised a hand to indicate it wasn’t necessary.\nThrowing meat buns at a dog, it won’t return. Girls throw things at Lin Li, but Lin Li feels bad taking it away. Hell, if he throws it himself and gets it back, Wang Ze will take Wang Haoyang’s surname.\nSeeing her long-range attack ineffective, Qu Wanqiu ran up to kick Lin Li, muttering:\n\"Make you pee a lot! Make you pee a lot!\"\n\"Hold on, this uniform is custom made for me! One thousand eight hundred! One thousand eight hundred! And I’m saying you guys, not me, are the ones peeing a lot!\"\n\"Hey! Stop kicking! Stop kicking!\"\n--\nIt’s the beginning of the month, asking for monthly votes, while participating in this month’s monthly vote raffle!",

      "content": "Chapter 288: Chapter 232 I am fully prepared!\nThe last minute of evening self-study.\nTonight, there was no teacher on duty, and the discipline committee couldn’t be bothered to manage, so the class had already started to make a ruckus.\n\"Lin Li, let me ask you, you’re lying in bed, on your left is a GAY, on your right is an unparalleled beauty, at this moment, who will you turn your back to?\" Bai Bufan asked.\nAn absolute dilemma.\nLin Li heard this, pinched his chin, and fell into deep thought.\nIn the end, he made up his mind, looked at Bai Bufan, and nodded: \"An excellent shooter can deal damage while enduring the hits.\"\n\"Makes sense.\" Bai Bufan acknowledged, worthy of being the trusted shooter, \"Only a shooter with such awareness deserves my support.\"\nPeople who can’t let go of anything can change nothing.\nWang Ze’s virtual parents are like that, so is Lin Li’s virtual swallow.\n\"Great, support, quickly help me take the GAY’s damage.\" Lin Li rarely felt Bai Bufan’s existence was also valuable.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Then I won’t support anymore.\"\n\"Ring——\"\n\"Let’s go, Lin Li.\" As soon as the class bell rang, Chen Tianming, who was closest to the back door, stood up and waved at Lin Li.\n\"What are you guys going to do?\" Bai Bufan was curious upon seeing this.\n\"I met Tianming on Tantan, so we’re planning to meet up for a run.\" Lin Li stood up too, there wasn’t much to bring home tonight, so he didn’t even bring his bag.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Can you not say something like that, what if Qiaoqiao accidentally hears it on the second floor and misunderstands! Tantan, Momo, Soul, Jimu, she mentioned some girls’ dating site, I never knew about it, I never pay attention or know!\" Chen Tianming said irritably.\n\"You mean, she’s on the fourth floor, and three seconds after class ends, she can appear in our second-floor hallway, is that right?\" Lin Li countered.\nAnd listing site names while saying you don’t know, isn’t that a bit unconvincing?\n\"Who knows?\" Chen Tianming nodded.\n\"Reconsidering.\"\nLin Li has always been a good child who corrects his mistakes, heard and nodded, looked at Bai Bufan, and explained again:\n\"Bufan, Tianming and I didn’t plan to meet for a run, we’re just preparing for the sports event together at the playground tonight.\nIn the pre-event preparation stage, we’re contacting each other, using hands or bodies to help each other stretch and enjoy the joy under the night sky.\nThen, we really get to business, panting ’ha—ha—’ as we start running around the field, with the pace quickening, our bodies sweating, skin rubbing against each other softly.\nPerhaps passersby might shoot us strange looks, but we don’t care, continuing to immerse in this outdoor joy.\nUntil the end, exhausted and panting heavily, drenched from head to toe, we reminisce about this training session, finding what is commendable and what we didn’t do well.\"\nBai Bufan: \"!\"\nChen Tianming: \"?\"\n\"You managed to describe running in such an ero way, you’re incredible! Damn, if we really run into Qiaoqiao tonight, well, let’s just pretend we don’t know each other, thanks.\" Chen Tianming widened his eyes, impressed, and started regretting agreeing to train with Lin Li.\nBut as the saying goes, once you’ve agreed, the lights go out, it’s all the same, so tonight, let’s just run with Lin Li:\n\"Let’s go, let’s go, don’t waste time, I must achieve a good position in the sports meet, so Qiaoqiao can further see my charm.\"\n\"Bufan, are you coming or not?\" Lin Li, being pulled, asked back.\n\"I... I’ll pass.\" Bai Bufan chuckled, \"My aspiration is to become a person knowledgeable in astronomy and suffering from paralyzed legs like Hawking, no need for sports, just call me when you have a real outdoor exposure.\"\n\"...When will you start exercising?\" Lin Li asked in frustration, \"What about your plan to surpass me?\"\n\"I’ve always been disciplined, I believe persistently being undisciplined is a form of discipline in itself, asking me to train now is making me undisciplined.\" Bai Bufan explained earnestly.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nFor Bai Bufan’s own good, Lin Li decided to force him to act like a man.\n\"Elbow, follow me to the playground.\"\n\"What for?!!\"\n\"Tonight, you’re going to move, even if it’s just a walk around the playground, it’s better than lying dead in the dorm.\"\n\"If you’re all going, I’ll join too, I’m burning my calories!\" Zhou Baowei decided to follow the trend upon seeing this.\nA guy like Zhou Baowei, well suited for driving a Volkswagen in the future.\nArriving at the playground, it turned out there were quite a number of people tonight.\nProbably many, like Chen Tianming, are thinking of the upcoming sports meet, intending to train properly in these next half a month before the event.\nEveryone preparing for sports, concern for an aging population can be saved.\nBut, like Wang Ze, those sports students who already have daily training typically won’t show up, after all, overtraining can be counterproductive.\nPity those little couples, their home ground suddenly occupied, not knowing where to relocate their ground.\nNansang isn’t large enough to fully hide sneaky couples, and no one knows if behind the podium, a few couples might be sneaking kisses.\nLeaning against the railing under the spectators’ stand, after warming up, everybody began jogging.\nAfter jogging a lap while chatting together, everyone started running at their own paces.\nThere’s no point in running the whole course together, it won’t have any training effect.\n...\n\"Hah—Hah—Hah—\" Lin Li sat on the ground beneath the bleachers, gasping for air in big gulps.\nSweat dripped from the tips of his hair, soaking the back of his uniform. He propped his hands on his knees, panting heavily, feeling like a fire was burning in his throat, the breathing even carried a scorching sensation.\nThis feeling, it’s been a while.\nThe time on the watch stopped at nine minutes and thirteen seconds.\nThis was Lin Li’s effort-driven result for the three thousand meters he just ran.\nIn the night, no one would notice a strong level-three athlete, a near-level-two athlete born quietly, missing by just a few seconds.\nBroke Nansang’s first-year record by nearly a minute and a half.\nGoing to a higher-level middle school athletics meet would be considered an absolutely outstanding performance.\nIf I secretly smeared a little blood on myself, using \"Wind Control\" to ensure a tailwind throughout, adjusted my running posture and breathing, Lin Li thought that within a few days of training or even the next run, he could finish in nine minutes, maybe even eight and a half.\nThis also proved that systematic training was not as aggressive as systematic stat-boosting, I still underestimated my limits.\nAfter confirming his current stage’s limits, Lin Li’s task was simple—control the final result to ten and a half minutes, no more no less, just broke the record by a few seconds, then determine his running speed per lap based on this result and spend some time adapting.\nMeanwhile, recently, he needed to create an image of himself being diligent with training to everyone in the class, and that the result on the day was due to a bout of extraordinary exertion which he couldn’t replicate.\nAs for the fifteen hundred meters, no need to test it, Lin Li already broke the Nansang first-year fifteen hundred record in the first fifteen hundred of the three thousand just now, taking only four minutes and twenty-five seconds.\nIf he just ran the fifteen hundred, breaking it by half a minute would be a piece of cake.\n\"Lin Li, do you need some tissue?\"\nA clear and elegant voice like a stream in the night breeze, with a hint of concern and gentleness, Lin Li looked up, his gaze moved from a pair of white sneakers upward, passing the long legs—damn school pants, don’t bother me here, get out!\nThe school pants wouldn’t listen to Lin Li, so his gaze finally settled on Chen Yu Ying’s face.\nChen Yu Ying stood in front of him, holding a pack of tissues, slightly bending over to look at him, her long hair tied into a ponytail for exercise, strands of hair fluttered gently in the wind, a few even clinging to her porcelain skin due to sweat.\nThe light from the track field cast a soft halo around her from behind.\nDoesn’t Shanghai already have an Oriental Pearl, how come Xiling has one too?\n\"Heh, class leader, are you giving alms to me?\" Lin Li, the atmosphere-ruining king, sneered.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Uh-huh, I’m giving you alms.\" After a second of confusion, Chen Yu Ying nodded vigorously.\n\"?\"\nLin Li: \"...No, no, class leader, you should say that’s not what you meant.\"\nChen Yu Ying shook her head, firmly said, \"No, I am giving you alms.\"\n\"Then I don’t need it! Take it away!\" Lin Li got angry, his tone extremely firm, but he had already taken the tissues and swiftly started wiping his sweat.\n\"Class leader, are you guys here to run too?\" After wiping his sweat, Lin Li asked lazily.\n\"Yeah, I just finished running, Wanqiu and Si Han are still at it.\"\n\"Then how come I didn’t see you?\" Lin Li was puzzled.\n\"Too many people on the inside lane, fewer outside, I was running on the sixth lane, but I saw you, darting around like a big black rat, running so fast,\" Chen Yu Ying explained.\n\"Class leader, with your language proficiency, I don’t think you should use such basic metaphors; you should say, ’Lin Li’s silhouette cuts through the moonlight, clothes fluttering like clouds, toes touching the ground as if stepping on stars.’\" Lin Li corrected Chen Yu Ying’s basic mistake.\nIn return, he got a playful response.\n\"Lin Li, you can’t squat for too long right after running, it leads to poor blood circulation, you should get up and do some stretching or walk slowly,\" Chen Yu Ying advised.\nIt’s actually meant to match the pre-exercise warm-up, this is known as the post-exercise cool down.\n\"Okay.\"\nThough Lin Li thought he didn’t need this step, he nodded without dampening the mood.\nChen Yu Ying’s cool down exercises were quite hardcore, lifting a leg effortlessly onto the fence, stretching to over 150 degrees, then slowly leaning forward to further stretch her muscles.\nAlmost a full split, the class leader’s flexibility was indeed great, she must have learned many dance forms before, evidently having a strong foundation.\nSeeing Lin Li lift his leg, and place it on the highest point of the fence, Chen Yu Ying, noticing the purpose, spoke to stop him: \"Lin Li, you’re a long-distance runner, your muscles are very tired now, doing splits can easily cause strains and joint injuries.\"\n\"Class leader, don’t forget, I’m a master of ballet too! Skilled at this!\" Lin Li replied confidently, pressing his body down, also easily achieving a major angle.\n\"Alright, impressive.\"\nSeeing this scene, Chen Yu Ying blinked her eyes, complimenting him.\nYet, what kind of yearning for tights did Lin Li have that he taught himself to this level?\nBut before Chen Yu Ying could figure out an answer, she saw Lin Li’s expression change, as he brought his leg back down to stand on both feet again.\n\"What happened? Did you strain yourself?\" Chen Yu Ying asked with concern.\n\"I was fully prepared for the splits, how could anything go wrong,\" Lin Li smiled confidently, shaking his head.\n\"Then what is it?\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit puzzled.\n\"But my pants weren’t prepared for it.\"",

Take it away!\" Lin Li got angry, his tone extremely firm, but he had already taken the tissues and swiftly started wiping his sweat.\n\"Class leader, are you guys here to run too?\" After wiping his sweat, Lin Li asked lazily.\n\"Yeah, I just finished running, Wanqiu and Si Han are still at it.\"\n\"Then how come I didn’t see you?\" Lin Li was puzzled.\n\"Too many people on the inside lane, fewer outside, I was running on the sixth lane, but I saw you, darting around like a big black rat, running so fast,\" Chen Yu Ying explained.\n\"Class leader, with your language proficiency, I don’t think you should use such basic metaphors; you should say, ’Lin Li’s silhouette cuts through the moonlight, clothes fluttering like clouds, toes touching the ground as if stepping on stars.’\" Lin Li corrected Chen Yu Ying’s basic mistake.\nIn return, he got a playful response.\n\"Lin Li, you can’t squat for too long right after running, it leads to poor blood circulation, you should get up and do some stretching or walk slowly,\" Chen Yu Ying advised.\nIt’s actually meant to match the pre-exercise warm-up, this is known as the post-exercise cool down.\n\"Okay.\"\nThough Lin Li thought he didn’t need this step, he nodded without dampening the mood.\nChen Yu Ying’s cool down exercises were quite hardcore, lifting a leg effortlessly onto the fence, stretching to over 150 degrees, then slowly leaning forward to further stretch her muscles.\nAlmost a full split, the class leader’s flexibility was indeed great, she must have learned many dance forms before, evidently having a strong foundation.\nSeeing Lin Li lift his leg, and place it on the highest point of the fence, Chen Yu Ying, noticing the purpose, spoke to stop him: \"Lin Li, you’re a long-distance runner, your muscles are very tired now, doing splits can easily cause strains and joint injuries.\"\n\"Class leader, don’t forget, I’m a master of ballet too! Skilled at this!\" Lin Li replied confidently, pressing his body down, also easily achieving a major angle.\n\"Alright, impressive.\"\nSeeing this scene, Chen Yu Ying blinked her eyes, complimenting him.\nYet, what kind of yearning for tights did Lin Li have that he taught himself to this level?\nBut before Chen Yu Ying could figure out an answer, she saw Lin Li’s expression change, as he brought his leg back down to stand on both feet again.\n\"What happened? Did you strain yourself?\" Chen Yu Ying asked with concern.\n\"I was fully prepared for the splits, how could anything go wrong,\" Lin Li smiled confidently, shaking his head.\n\"Then what is it?\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit puzzled.\n\"But my pants weren’t prepared for it.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 289: Chapter 233 Shocked! Such a thing actually happened at Nansang Middle School! Zhou Baowei’s Withdrawal Scandal!\n\"But my pants are not completely prepared.\"\nThe tone instantly changed, the laughter vanished, and Lin Li’s voice had a tinge of melancholy, as he clasped his hands in front of himself, protecting the crucial area.\nJust now there was a ripping sound, at least Lin Li himself heard it quite clearly.\nIf Lin Li’s original stance was described as \"beautiful,\" now it had turned to \"stubborn.\"\nHis melancholy was not just faint, it was quite consuming.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Pfft—\" When she realized what Lin Li was talking about, she couldn’t help but laugh out loud.\n\"Then this school uniform of yours, costing eighteen hundred, isn’t as good quality as the original,\" Chen Yu Ying said, trying to hold back her laughter.\n\"I can only say that money doesn’t necessarily...\" Lin Li instinctively wanted to spread his hands to talk, but noticed Chen Yu Ying’s gaze moving, and immediately recoiled in horror, \"Class president, are you trying to sneak a peek? Are you a pervert? Mr. Savior, are you there? Come help me, please.\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"I wasn’t trying to take a peek.\" Chen Yu Ying pouted.\n\"Because you’re watching openly?\" Lin Li looked at the supposedly corrupted by birth Chen Yu Ying and speculated.\n\"I am not like you!\"\n\"Class president, you know, I’ve always trusted you, but... Your gaze has no credibility at all!\" Lin Li pondered first, then pointed at Chen Yu Ying’s eyes and sharply commented.\n\"I just wanted to have a laugh, that doesn’t count as perversion.\" Chen Yu Ying simply didn’t deny it and responded seriously.\n\"... Easier said than done, fine, take a look, take a look, take a look, have a good look, might as well let go of my dignity!\"\nLin Li decided to abandon the sinking ship, not only did he loosen his hands, he even deliberately approached Chen Yu Ying.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nNow it was Chen Yu Ying who covered her eyes, retreating while laughing bashfully and angrily scolded, \"What are you doing, Lin Li, I don’t want to look!\"\n\"Look! Why not look!\" Lin Li was domineering.\nActually, after checking, it was just a small tear in his pants, with plenty of threads connected. It was hard to see the underwear through this tear, and normal people wouldn’t notice. Plus, Lin Li was wearing plain black underwear today, making it even less noticeable. So really, there was nothing indecent to be seen.\n\"I don’t want to look!\"\n\"You have to look!\"\n\"I am not a pervert.\"\n\"Then I am a pervert!\"\nThe weak, pitiful, and helpless Chen Yu Ying was soon forced against the wall by the powerful, hateful, and ruthless Lin Li with nowhere to retreat.\nJust as Lin Li was grinning maliciously, preparing to commit some misdeed, a gentle voice came:\n\"Lin Li, what are you guys looking at?\"\nLin Li froze upon hearing this.\nHe looked up and saw two people in the stands, both of whom he had seen before. One seemed to be called Xue Jian, and the other seemed to be his wife.\nThe two of them were sitting in the middle row of the stands, with Xue Jian staring down at Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nBu Hao!\nBecause the sports field was occupied by those preparing for the games, the young couples who usually strolled on the track had no place to go and had to relocate.\n—That was Lin Li’s earlier deduction.\nNow, reality proved, that deduction was correct, and the stands were one of the ’refuges’!\nWhy didn’t he make a sound?\nThis silence is way too conspicuous! That’s the second time! Old! Man! Xue!\nHuh? Xue Jian’s face looks kinda dark.\nOh, got it, Lin Li remembers that it’s nighttime now, it must be due to the night, that’s normal.\nDamn.\nEven he didn’t believe himself.\n\"Teacher, it’s forbidden to date on campus. As a teacher, I hope you lead by example! Maintain campus atmosphere, starting with you and me!\" Failing to convince himself, Lin Li decided to counter Xue Jian first!\nXue Jian: \"?\"\nThis impudent child.\n\"Us as a couple living our lives is not called dating, Lin Li,\" Xue Jian’s wife said with a smile.\n\"Hello, madam, I was just joking,\" Lin Li greeted Xue Jian’s wife politely, half-bowing.\n\"Madam, how do you know my name?\"\n\"The Anti-Pornography Vanguard Dog is somewhat known,\" she replied.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nXue Jian’s wife asked curiously, \"By the way, didn’t the Vanguard Dog come?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Hahaha, he’s here, he’s... running around, maybe,\" Lin Li said, unable to hold his laughter.\n\"So Lin Li, what were you trying to show Yu Ying?\" Xue Jian followed up, not forgetting his purpose for speaking.\nDarn it, didn’t manage to shift the topic.\nLin Li looked at Chen Yu Ying, \"We were looking at... Class President, what were we looking at?\"\nChen Yu Ying quietly snickered, displaying an air of unconcern, having no intention of helping.\nEvil woman.\nLin Li’s heart felt completely shattered.\n\"Looking at what?\" Xue Jian pressed.\n\"Looking at...\" Lin Li suddenly pointed to the pitch-black night sky, thinking of an idea, \"Looking at the dark sky hanging low, seeing the sparkling stars accompanying~\"\n\"Fireflies fly~ Fireflies fly~\"\n\"Who are you missing~\"\nLin Li suddenly burst into song, ending the final line by looking at Xue Jian, performing emotionally.\nXue Jian: \"?\"\n\"Tonight the wind is beautiful, the night is gentle as well. Yes, teacher, that’s what I was looking at, and I hope the class president takes a look too, you and madam should look more, it’s wonderful, you’ll love it.\nOh dear, my brain, teacher, I suddenly remembered my mom is having a second child, I have to go see if I’m going to be a brother or sister, bye! Wishing you and madam a happy evening!\"\nWith that, Lin Li swiftly fled.\nAs for leaving Chen Yu Ying alone to face Xue Jian, Lin Li felt no psychological burden.\nBuddies before baddies, anyway, the class president surely won’t die, she has immunity as a good student.\nNo wait!\nHe was also now ranking 51st in the year, top five in the class!\nHe should also be a cherished student to the teacher.\nWhen Lin Li sneaked back, sure enough, Chen Yu Ying wasn’t interrogated at all and was chatting amicably with Xue Jian and his wife.\n\"Lin Li, why are you back?\" Xue Jian asked, seeing a sneaky Lin Li.\n\"Teacher, I’m a good student now too, is there any special treatment?\" Lin Li asked hopefully.\n\"In tomorrow’s class, you get priority to ask questions,\" Xue Jian nodded.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nEven among good students, there’s a difference.\nHe wasn’t teacher’s precious, but his punching bag.\n\"Then, teacher, I really have to go, I’m really rushing to see if I’ll be a brother or sister.\"\nHe couldn’t change his own gender, and with Wu Min having a second child, he couldn’t possibly be a sister, so Lin Li smartly corrected himself this time.\nTime to really slip away this time.\nWhen Lin Li slipped to the entrance of the sports field, he saw the Anti-Pornography Vanguard Dog laughing wildly, and curiously asked:\n\"Bufan, what happened?\"\n\"Hahaha, Lin Li, let me tell you—\" Bai Bufan was just feeling troubled not finding someone to vent to, and upon hearing this, came over immediately to share.\n...\nGood news has to be shared.\n\"Hahahaha Bao Wei, have you heard?\" So when he saw Zhou Baowei sitting by the flower bed outside the sports field, Lin Li immediately rushed over to share the fun he just heard.\n\"Just now there was a person on the sports field, while running, tripped his right foot with his left foot, then knelt down and did a roll in front of a girl from another class, as if he was bringing New Year wishes early! Hahahahaha!\" Lin Li laughed heartily while patting Bao Wei’s back.\nZhou Baowei: \"Hahaha.\"\nLin Li’s fake smile was as natural as breathing. He inquired with innocence purer than Ding Zhen, \"By the way, Bao Wei, I heard from Bufan that you’re going through withdrawal procedures, why is that?\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nThis guy isn’t even pretending anymore.\nWhat was unknown was whether calories were burned tonight, but Zhou Baowei’s dignity was definitely burned away, causing his hands to clench.\n\"Lin Li! You better die for me!!\"\n\"Die I will, just don’t tear my clothes, I’ve already lost a pair of pants today! I can’t lose my shirt too!\"\n--\nBeginning of the month, asking for monthly votes, reached eight thousand, might combine Chapters later, trying to hit ten-thousand subscriptions, asking for monthly tickets (pleading).",

      "content": "Chapter 290: Chapter 234: Time flies like an arrow, days and months pass like a shuttle\nMoney isn’t everything, but without money, you’re nothing.\nWhen Lin Li returned home and saw the parcels placed at his doorstep, he couldn’t help but sigh at this truth.\nNot even 24 hours had passed since he placed the orders last night, and some of the packages had already arrived today, delivered right to his door—no need to go to the post station and pick them up.\nThis is the power of money.\nHe decided that he wouldn’t save the cardboard boxes for selling as waste. Instead, he would throw them out with the trash later, letting someone else earn that money. The initial prosperity would lead to subsequent prosperity, Lin Li’s greatness speaks for itself.\nAfter amusing himself for a while, Lin Li began to unpack the parcels, revealing the remote weaponry he had prepared for himself.\n—Composite bow and slingshot.\nThe former isn’t a slingshot but a composite bow designed to shoot steel balls, or simply a steel ball bow.\nThe main body is made of alloy, shaped like a bow, with a mechanical middle connected to a long tube that looks like an arrow but is actually a ’magazine.’ Up to sixty steel balls can be loaded at once, and each time the bowstring, made of rubber bands and steel strings, is pulled and released, a steel ball is automatically fired.\nA laser sight can also be installed at the front end to increase accuracy.\nAlthough both are used to launch ’steel balls,’ this composite bow far exceeds a slingshot in terms of power, accuracy, and ease of operation.\nLin Li also bought a slingshot because it is small, portable, and can be kept as a backup for emergencies.\nAfter all the parts were installed, Lin Li weighed it briefly. It felt quite heavy, but fortunately, his physical strength had improved significantly, so he could handle it.\nTaking advantage of the night, Lin Li headed downstairs, first looking to ensure that the mother and child he’d previously encountered weren’t out walking tonight, and then started testing the power.\n\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\"\nWithin forty meters, unopened soda cans could be shot right through, but beyond forty meters, only a hole could be made.\nThis kind of power could really injure someone; if hit on the head, it might swell into a small lump.\n—But that’s conditional on hitting the target.\nIn reality, despite the high price of seventeen hundred yuan per bow, the accuracy still couldn’t be considered high. Even with the scope, at a forty-meter distance, the small size of the soda cans meant an accuracy rate barely above fifty percent, with a spread radius of about forty centimeters.\nMoreover, holding it with one hand for too long would become strenuous, making it difficult to steady with the left hand.\nThough understandable, buying cheaper would result in worse range, accuracy, and handling.\nThat’s the end of training for tonight.\nThe elder collecting trash tonight will be secretly pleased; several boxes and a pile of soda cans neatly arranged next to the garbage bin.\nAfter cleaning up the trash and retrieving whatever small steel balls he could find, Lin Li headed back upstairs with the composite bow.\nThe power barely met Lin Li’s expectations.\n\"If only it could be modified to use better materials and workmanship, reducing weight while increasing power and accuracy,\" Lin Li mused to himself, weighing the steel ball bow in his hand. \"But modifying it is troublesome; who should I find? I can’t possibly do everything myself, can I?\"\nPlastic turned iron, glue turned weld—a little jail time every day; you supply nitrate, I supply charcoal—at least eight and a half years tomorrow; you make the guns, I make the bullets—death row meals with company...\nThese rhymes aren’t just for show.\nAfter all, Lin Li lives in the place with the strictest gun control.\nWhy do Americans perform poorly academically? Because skipping class is essential for survival.\nWhen that usually bullied, quiet classmate who only listens to music on MP3 or MP4 but gets along well with you suddenly says, \"You better not come to classes tomorrow,\" you should really skip class.\n—Because tomorrow they’ll be listening with an MP5.\n\"But just because I can’t encounter it here doesn’t mean I won’t in that world, better to experience it ahead of time,\" Lin Li continued to muse.\nIt’s necessary to legally experience firearms.\nThere’s no guarantee that he won’t find similar weapons in that world.\nYesterday’s encounter evidently meant there were survivors in that world, and at least one of them was nearby.\nWho knows, they might have such weapons, and the thing that once pointed at him could indeed be a type of gun.\nGetting familiar ahead of time can only be beneficial.\nHowever, after checking, Lin Li found that not only Xiling but the entire Nansang had no gun experience centers. The closest legal place to experience live firing was a shooting club in another county in Pingjiang City.\nAlso, the cheapest gun is priced at 220 yuan for ten rounds; to truly enjoy shooting, he’d likely spend close to a thousand.\nBut money isn’t a big problem; it’s just a matter of a bracelet. Such a meaningful act as shooting a pistol is worth even selling the pots and pans for Lin Li.\nHowever, this weekend, due to a one-day shift, school ends Saturday afternoon with evening self-study early Sunday night. Without staying there overnight, time is too tight, and staying isn’t necessary.\nSo tonight he can only resort to alternatives and practice with other pistols first.\nThe bathroom also serves as a shooting range, and perverts are the targets!\nDone shooting.\nTime for sleep.\n...\nLin Li’s schedule for the rest of the week is pretty packed.\nEvery morning, he continues practicing the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, extending the exercise time from an hour to eighty minutes, because Lin Li believes this is the maximum time to maintain 100% efficiency, practicing an extra twenty minutes to achieve the task requirements as soon as possible.\n—These days, he’s been practicing the Spiritual Qi Chapter, successfully completing it once, but the task has yet to be fulfilled, just as expected.\nTherefore, Lin Li decided to re-interpret the entire cultivation technique; now that his comprehension has increased by 40%, new insights might emerge.",

in English class, continue standing at the back with Bai Bufan on the left and right; in PE class, continue joining forces with Wang Ze to beat up Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei...\nIt’s truly a wonderfully exhilarating student life.\nHowever, it’s not that Lin Li slacked off without exam tasks; rather, as a member of an average class, the content teachers explained was often broken down into the basics to accommodate people like Bai Bufan who can’t take care of themselves.\nThe lectures were very basic.\nAlthough basics are important, under the assistance of Enhanced Memory and improved comprehension, Lin Li’s basics are already solid as a rock, so listening to these is indeed pointless.\nThese days, Lin Li is actually more serious in after-school pre-study than during class.\nOf course, Lin Li still has basic respect for the sciences.\nAfter all, math initially felt unnecessary to listen to when it was about ’1+1’; glancing outside the window at the sparrows pecking on the wires then returning to find the formulas covered the entire blackboard, the dreadful course that heard Xue Jian utter the whispers of ancient gods.\nAlthough mostly relaxed, Lin Li believes scoring higher than 51 in the next midterm shouldn’t be difficult, given the advantages.\nAfter school in the afternoon, go practice the fun events chosen to participate in during the big recess.\nBecause Lin Li is so versatile, most of the fun events were picked by Chen Yu Ying for him; Lin Li doesn’t mind, it doesn’t take much effort, and even if botched, no one cares; in the end, it’s about fun and entertainment.\nAfter evening self-study ends, continue preparing for the running appointment with others.\nHowever, Lin Li started choosing to run the outer track instead of the inner track, and every time passing by Ding, Chen, and Qu, if there weren’t others around, he would perversely say something like \"I’ve surpassed you,\" or \"It feels good to surpass you.\"\nIt can only be said that Lin Li is still alive thanks to their high \"perversion threshold\" for him.\nNo need to bring paper; they have it, and Lin Li shamelessly doesn’t need any.\nThere are more and more people on the playground now; now, after class, more people walk to the playground than to the dorms, Lin Li can even see Wang Yuezhi running on the track.\nWorking hard for his father’s errands, huh, Ha Yuezhi, you... truly an admirable son.\nExcept for Wang Yuezhi, Lin Li’s sharp eyes also didn’t miss any couples in the audience stands this time.\nPlus, now running on the outer ring, seeing old couples was uneventful, seeing young couples, Lin Li would shout, \"Teacher, you’re here to catch dating again,\" when passing by.\nThen happily appreciated the young couples fleeing in panic.\nWith Lin Li’s efforts, the love stink gradually disappeared from the Nansang playground at night.\nDamn, there’s still the stink of sweat.\nOnly when passing by beautiful girls did it smell a bit fragrant.\nAfter simply adjusting his running posture and breathing rhythm, Lin Li improved his best 3000m score to eight minutes and forty seconds within a few days, approaching a level-one athlete.\nEvery night after exercising and returning home, besides practicing slingshot and steel ball bow to improve shooting accuracy, he continues with cultivation, transforming \"Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body\" while further refining the \"Substitute Jade-faced Buddha\" and \"Hidden Passion Vessel.\"\nNow, the items stored in the resurrection armor should be enough to unleash a massive attack when ’dying’.\nBeing able to revive with full health is best, but Lin Li will keep ’feeding’ it regardless.\nAs for the driver’s license, everything needed to memorize has been memorized, just waiting to register after coming of age; Lin Li is confident he can pass the written test steadily.\nSunday.\n\"Hoo——\"\nLin Li exhaled a breath of turbid air and placed \"Superior Spirit Stone,\" still more than half full, back on the \"Spiritual Spring\" to continue charging.\n\"Purity and Righteousness Thunder-Controlling Body\" has progressed from initial to minor completion.\nTested a bit.\nThe home-bought portable power output, even at maximum power and with Lin Li’s inner electricity fully stored, could no longer make Lin Li feel uncomfortable, as if the body could completely withstand such a level of current.\nLin Li believes his current self, even if licking the electric wire directly—probably still get injured.\nBut definitely won’t be fatal.\nControl over electricity is more adept as well; prior, charging a phone with fingers needed continuous testing and interval finding, and was unstable, but now Lin Li can fix his output power and method at an effective point.\nIncluding the output body part, now controlled very finely.\nThough requiring full concentration, at least absolute control is achievable.\nThe discharge range extended to one meter, and when Lin Li carved open the insulating protective layer at the bottom of the newly bought steel rod for easier grip, powerful arcs could appear from the top of the rod.\nThough using it as a medium weakens the direction control and output range, it’s undoubtedly an unexpected means against enemies.\nAt first, sparks could only make noise with paper scraps and couldn’t even move them; now, they can give paper the scorched browning effect Michelin three-star chefs love. If Lin Li channels all stored electricity in one go, he can pierce multiple layers of paper.\nAfter cultivating for nearly one and a half months, finally came spells with some power.",

The pill mildly adjusts the user’s body during this time.]\nLin Li raised an eyebrow slightly; just like the \"Health and Disease Removal Pill\", it’s for low-level cultivators or ordinary folks, considered one of the most lackluster types of pills.\nHowever, the price is quite friendly, four system currency per piece, and it’s not even limited in purchase.\nBut as for its usefulness... it’s quite redundant for Lin Li.\nSome people eat to live, and some people live to eat.\nThis has been documented in history:\n\"Give me liberty, or give me death,\" is a famous quote by Patrick Henry of the United States in 1775.\n\"Swallow undisturbed sparrows know not the ambition of a swan,\" from \"Historical Records: Henry’s Family\".\nLin Li quite appreciates the desire for delicious food.\nEating something delicious makes people happy.\nIf you could still eat and drink normally after consuming the Grain Avoidance Pill, that would be fine; but if you weren’t hungry at all during the period, or couldn’t eat anything, Lin Li felt it would even be more harmful than beneficial.\nBecause it would easily make others notice something unusual.\nThe effect of this Grain Avoidance Pill is estimated to be determined by the amount of activity during the period of taking it. If it’s for a month, it’ll be too easy to notice.\nLet’s just hope you can eat and drink normally after consuming it.\n[You have received \"Grain Avoidance Pill (Bottle)\" *1.]\nLet’s buy a bottle first.\nFirstly, because Lin Li has a hoarding mentality, he’ll start by storing it in the [Warehouse]; although Lin Li personally doesn’t need it, in an apocalyptic world, it would still have value, so exchanging a bottle is not a loss, it might come in handy.\nThe system update has been confirmed, Lin Li is ready to go.\nThe gear was sorted out nearby when Lin Li didn’t go to school during the day, so he quickly got dressed.\nWith the last experience, some supplies were abandoned, replaced with new ones. Considering the different time flow, this time Lin Li wants to see how long he can really stay in that world.\n\"Lin Li: I’m not feeling well. If I don’t go to school tomorrow, please ask the teacher for leave on my behalf.\"\nLin Li sent a message to Bai Bufan.\nAfter all, his hypothesis lacks enough practical support, so Lin Li had to prepare a Plan B in case he didn’t return in time.\n\"Bai Bufan: ?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: What about my breakfast?\"\nLin Li laughed out of anger.\nBai Bufan seemed like the type who, when asked by the girlfriend \"Guess who I met in the hospital,\" would respond with \"Never mind who you saw, check out this polar bear that looks like an AirPods.\"\nThe focus, damn it, is on breakfast, huh?\n\"Bai Bufan: Can you stop being so selfish and deliver my breakfast before you ask for leave?\"\n\"Lin Li: Bai Bufan, do you know how disgustingly annoying you are? When your real mom first perceived you, she was so nauseated she wanted to puke and felt the urge several times in the following months.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: ?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Who’s mom wouldn’t feel like puking? Plus, we agreed to only include virtual moms, not real ones. You broke the rules, penalty of two hundred bucks!\"\n\"Lin Li: ’Wu Bai photo’, demand three hundred from me.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: ’Wu Bai photo’ (just stolen), demand two hundred from me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Lin Li: Not saying more, feeling unwell. Resting, remember tomorrow.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Okay, wishing you okay ’palm together’ ’palm together’ ’palm together’\"\n\"Bai Bufan: But how come you’re suddenly unwell? During evening study class, you seemed fine, and there hasn’t been a swine flu outbreak recently?\"\nAnthropomorphism always comes last, but Lin Li didn’t reply.\nSince according to his hypothesis, no matter how long he was there, only a few minutes would pass in reality, so replying later upon return wouldn’t be too late.\nIf his hypothesis was wrong, Bai Bufan would definitely notice his absence and help with the absence request.\nEverything’s ready, Lin Li clicked ’Go’.\nA flash of white light, and as the vision cleared, Lin Li raised the slingshot crossbow in his hand, aiming forward.\nEmpty.\nA glance around, the figure he saw last time he left has disappeared. Tao Zhe is nowhere in sight, and Dou Dizhu is divided between his head and body, seemingly a bit dead.\nIt seems a battle might have happened here after he left.\nThe steel rod he left last time was probably taken away.\nThat guy assumed that things left on the ground were unclaimed.\nSetting a timer, adjusting the body camera on his chest, Lin Li began reviewing the experiment results.\nConfirmed new information: one condition for what he could bring along seems to be the main force holding it should come from himself.\nWhen Lin Li arrived, he had a chair leg resting on his shoe, ’placing’ it on him, but the chair wasn’t brought over.\n——Because the primary force holding it came from the ground.\nTaking out a small plastic box from his pocket.\nInside was a dead ant and a disassembled ant leg.\nWhat was in reality has all been brought over.\nLin Li reached into a side pocket of his backpack, taking out a just-placed pack of pork jerky.\n——Because this expedition wouldn’t be brief, Lin Li packed some food and water, and also some ingredients for the Beauty Lady mission.\nWhether it’s the ant in the box or the pork jerky, they are dead things that were once alive.\nNow, in reality, he can bring these things to this world, but not the zombie meat and blood from this world back to reality?\nThe conditions for carrying things seem a bit inconsistent, differing between worlds?\nBut Lin Li didn’t dwell long on this issue, as thinking alone is meaningless, needing more experimental samples, and for Lin Li, it is after all good news, being slightly careless doesn’t matter.\nWhat he needs to accomplish now is completing mission two while looking for Gold, so Lin Li took out a snake-skin bag with abrasion resistance, extra thickness, and a friction layer at the bottom.\n——Beauty Lady’s body was too heavy and cumbersome for Lin Li to carry all the time, so he brought this bag for convenience in dragging her later.\nOne tug achieves apocalypse-speed, with tangible achievements.\nThen Lin Li looked around.\nWait.\nThere was a small problem.\n\"Who the hell stole the head again?!\"",

No!\"\nLin Li dragged the bag quickly forward and reached the head.\nHowever, on his way there, Lin Li was also paying attention to the second floor, staying vigilant.\nWho knows if this head is like a bait, dropped intentionally to lure him.\nBut the other party made no extra movements, behaving honestly and even didn’t poke her body out.\nPerhaps she felt embarrassed.\nSo he picked up the head; luckily, the beautiful lady’s chin and upper jaw were still there.\nAs long as the mouth is intact, it’s fine.\nAffectionately patting the beautiful lady’s skull, Lin Li tossed it into the bag, dragged it into the building, and began to look for the stairs.\nAfter finding them, he started going upstairs, but halfway, Lin Li stopped and called out: \"Hello, I’m coming up?\"\n\"Okay.\"\nWith permission granted, Lin Li formally dragged the beautiful lady up to the second floor.\nThe masked survivor was still standing by the wall, very close to the edge, with vigilant eyes, seemingly ready to leave through the large breach in the wall at any moment of danger.\nLin Li decided not to get any closer.\n\"Hi, I’m Bai Bufan.\" To show sincerity, Lin Li introduced himself first.\n\"Sudan.\" The other party nodded.\nA steel rod was tossed over, and Lin Li caught it with his empty right hand steadily.\n\"This steel rod is yours, returning it to you,\" Sudan said.\n\"No need, I have new ones. It’s yours.\" Lin Li shook his head, threw the rod back, while pointing to the weapon at his waist.\nThen followed a brief silence.\n\"I think we both have a lot of questions for each other. Let me reveal a secret of mine first, which indeed needs some pre-explanation.\n— I’m not from your world; I came from another world.\"\nLin Li started off with a bombshell.\nAfter all, Lin Li felt there was no need to hide this point.\nSudan saw him disappear right in front of her eyes, and Lin Li felt he couldn’t act like a native without inconsistency, so better to speak the truth.\nThis way, it would be much simpler when asking for information about this world.\n\"Not from our world...\" Sudan murmured, sounding a bit surprised, but accepted it quickly; maybe only like this could the bizarre scenes she had witnessed be explained:\n\"So... do you also speak ’Gaiwen’?\"\n\"Gaiwen? Sort of, we call it Chinese, but we have other languages too, like... How are you?\" Lin Li shrugged.\nSudan: \"...\"\n\"I’m fine, thank you. And you?\" she responded.\n\"Damn.\"\n\"Hmm... perhaps saying ’fuck’ would be more appropriate here?\"\n\"FUCK.\"\nLin Li couldn’t hold it anymore, damn, where the hell did I end up, is this still an alternate world, doesn’t this feel like home?\n\"What do you call this planet, Earth, Blue Star?\" Lin Li continued to ask.\n\"Mingyuan.\"\n\"Alright, that does sound a bit cooler than ours.\" Lin Li expressed his approval.\n\"...I think yours sounds nicer.\" Sudan shook her head.\nThen Lin Li asked Sudan some questions about this planet’s background.\nIt’s like a parallel world. While the languages here are basically similar, with Earth’s major languages existing in different federal states, the history of the planet from the past to now is entirely different.\nSudan’s descriptions of Mingyuan Star’s history had no equivalents that Lin Li could match in his mind. The city beneath their feet was called ’Cloudlight,’ belonging to the ’Cloud Kingdom’ with a population of seventy million.\nAnd thus, many idiomatic expressions related to cultural references were completely misunderstood between them.\nAs their mutual understanding of each other’s backgrounds deepened, they gradually became less wary of each other, putting down their weapons in tacit agreement and moving closer for better communication.\n\"Without Genshin Impact, without Kobe, someone like me with such juvenile jokes would surely have a hard time surviving in this world,\" Lin Li said heavily.\n\"Genshin Impact...? Is it some supernatural deity?\" Sudan asked, full of confusion.\nLin Li’s eyes slowly turned to Sudan, thinking: you’re the one who asked.\nWith a broadcasting tone, he began to chant:\n\"Genshin Impact is a new open-world adventure game independently developed by miHoYo... You will play as a mysterious character known as ’Traveler’... concurrently, gradually uncovering the truth of ’Genshin Impact.’\"\nPerhaps it’s because this world had no Genshin Impact that it turned out this way.\nIt’s utterly terrifying when thought deeply; miHoYo never denied saving the world.\nSudan: \"?\"\n\"So it’s actually a game? Then... it must be very fun, right?\" Sudan said politely, seeing the earnest look on Lin Li’s face.\n\"So what year is it based on your calendar here?\" Lin Li returned to the main topic.\n\"1435.\"\n\"How did Mingyuan Star become like this? Could you explain these zombies to me, especially whether their bites can turn the living into zombies?\"\nLin Li looked out towards the ruins and asked.\nAt his words, Sudan also looked out at the world outside the building, her gaze shifting from a look of dumbfoundedness to one of slight sadness:\n\"How did it become like this? Two years ago, without any warning, the zombie plague broke out. Without contact, without biting, large numbers of people senselessly turned into zombies and began attacking all living beings indiscriminately, even now I don’t know the reason.\nCreatures killed by them have a high chance of ’resurrecting’ as zombies, but as long as humans aren’t dead, the wound, albeit inflamed or even festering, won’t affect their mind, nor will they turn into zombies, it can be cured.",

It was bombed clean, which is the main reason it looks like this now,\" Sudan explained concisely.\n\"So how are the cities outside now?\"\n\"I don’t know. I know nothing about the outside world, as I haven’t left Yunguang,\" Sudan shook her head.\n\"Never left? Didn’t you come back later? What about during the bombing?\" Lin Li was a bit confused.\n\"They didn’t notify any of us survivors,\" Sudan raised her middle finger to the sky.\nA presence even more despicable than the Ren’ai Male Reproductive Health Hospital appeared, and Pol Pot felt that the Cloud Capital was overly urbanized, leaving Lin Li speechless.\nSeeing Lin Li’s questioning come to a temporary halt, Sudan took the initiative to ask:\n\"So how did you come from your world to ours?\"\n\"Not long ago, I activated a special ability that allows me to relatively freely travel between two worlds. In fact, the time I met you can be considered my first time coming here. You were the first survivor I encountered, so when I saw you, I thought you were going to attack me. Feeling uneasy, I quickly slipped away.\"\nLin Li responded with sincerity.\nThough it was actually the second time, the first time only lasted a minute, so it doesn’t really count.\n\"By the way, I wanted to ask, how long ago did you see me last time?\" Lin Li inquired.\n\"A few hours ago? I don’t know the exact details, but it wasn’t long ago,\" Sudan replied.\n\"Got it,\" Lin Li nodded.\nAlthough there had been speculation before, it was now confirmed that it had indeed not been long since his last time.\nThe time flow between Earth and this world seems to depend on which world I’m in; otherwise, there’s no reason for time to mysteriously extend.\n\"So, has your world also started to awaken abilities?\" Seeing Lin Li fall silent, Sudan continued to inquire.\n\"No, I personally believe, barring any surprises, that apart from me, my world still consists entirely of ordinary people without any extraordinary abilities. The ability to travel between worlds should only belong to me.\nBut I noticed you used the word ’also’ just now, Miss Sudan, which means your world has started to trigger abilities, right?\"\nLin Li asked in return.\nSudan didn’t answer immediately. Instead, under Lin Li’s shocked gaze, she turned slightly, squatted, and then jumped to the opposite building and back again.\nIf Zhan Bo had her abilities, \"Love Apartment\" would have a couple of fewer episodes.\nBoth the takeoff and landing were nearly soundless, and the speed and height in the air severely violated the laws of physics.\nIf Newton turned into a zombie here, his first task would be to chase Sudan.\n\"This is my ability. It allows me to be as light as a swallow when jumping, enabling me to jump very high and far, and descend in a near-gliding posture,\" Sudan explained.\nLin Li: \"I get it, the Spear Kid + Blade Babe.\"\nSudan: \"?\"\nLin Li realized this was likely the key to her approaching him silently last time.\n\"How do you trigger abilities?\" Lin Li rubbed his hands eagerly, eyes full of anticipation.\nCoach, I want to learn this.\n\"Is there some core in the zombie brain or heart that you kill, dig out, eat, or absorb?\"\nLin Li said, glancing at his snakeskin bag.\nSudan shook her head, \"Awakening, just like the outbreak of the zombie virus, it’s just as inexplicable.\nMy ability also appeared suddenly a year and a half ago, so I don’t know how to trigger it. I’ve heard from others that as long as you kill zombies, there’s a chance it will emerge. The more you kill, the higher the chance, but it’s not guaranteed.\"\n\"Wait, humans can awaken abilities, yet they still haven’t dealt with these zombies? Although it’s easy for me to say, I think the zombies I’ve seen aren’t that strong.\" Lin Li was somewhat puzzled.\nThese zombies must kill humans to infect, have no intelligence, only instinct. Although this world’s tech tree is different, there have been achievements in firearms. How did it become like this?\n\"To kill a zombie, you must completely destroy its brain and heart. Guns are hard to kill without covering fire. Secondly, and primarily, although humans have awakened abilities, zombies also have mutants.\nTheir mutation directions are also quite varied. Mutants are harder to kill and retain intelligence. Some can even access the pre-host’s memories, making them difficult to deal with, or Cloud wouldn’t have resorted to city destruction as a solution.\nAt first, I thought you were a mutant since you could keep zombies from attacking you while also... at the side... at the side...\"\nSudan furrowed her eyebrows deeply, seemingly contemplating how to describe it: \"... retrieving something from your crotch.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"But I don’t know much more. We’ve long lost contact with the outside world; perhaps the outside has already resolved this crisis, and Yunguang City has been entirely abandoned,\" Sudan abandoned her description while adding.\n\"Does Yunguang City have mutants?\" Lin Li’s demeanor shifted to seriousness.\nLin Li quickly accepted the concept of mutants, feeling it would be odd if there weren’t any.\nHowever, \"The Breath of Demons\" itself doesn’t necessarily make demons recognize their identity. Although it now works 100% on every zombie he encounters, once dealing with intelligent mutants, even if their IQ is low, they might still have a high probability of seeing through the disguise of the title.",

As for the reason, I don’t know.\" Sudan shook her head.\nLin Li breathed a sigh of relief.\nThat’s good then.\n\"So how do you make zombies not attack you, and even scratch themselves in front of you?\" Sudan’s eyes were full of curiosity.\n\"Just say they’re in heat. Let’s be a bit more refined, thank you.\" Lin Li corrected and then explained:\n\"These both count as part of my abilities. I think you’ve observed me, in fact, zombies don’t attack me only when they’re within three meters. From a distance, they still want to tear me apart.\"\n\"You’ve sure got a lot of abilities.\"\n\"After all, I’m the only ability user from our world, so having more is normal.\" Lin Li chuckled.\n\"Now I understand.\nI used to think there was something magical in that zombie head, so I took her to study, but it’s just your simple fetish.\"\nSudan gave Lin Li a thumbs-up.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Wait a minute!\"\n\"No, how did you conclude that it’s my fetish?\" Disputes over fetishes must be handled with utmost seriousness, so Lin Li immediately questioned.\nLin Li’s nickname is Pinocchio; his surname Pi has always been normal! Don’t slander.\n\"But if it was just a normal zombie head, why did you do that, and even call her Beauty Lady? And say all those sweet nothings?\" Sudan frowned, puzzled.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nAsk the system.\nBut Lin Li didn’t really want to talk about the system, so he explained:\n\"You can understand it as, I need to pay a price for the abilities you see, sometimes beyond my control.\"\nUpon hearing this, Sudan looked at Lin Li with a strange expression, muttering softly: \"You’re not that refined either...\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThen Lin Li gradually understood everything — he shouldn’t have used idioms recklessly.\nLin Li explained:\n\"Miss Sudan, ’beyond one’s control’ is an idiom from our world; the literal meaning is quite clear, it means actions aren’t self-governed. As for ’ba’, it’s a modal particle. Please read them separately! Never understand it as ’beyond one staying here’, that’s completely different.\"\n\"It’s all the same.\" Sudan nodded.\n\"Not really.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Miss Sudan, if you don’t mind me asking, how old are you?\" Looking at this woman who seemed a bit oblivious, Lin Li asked curiously.\nSudan was a bit puzzled: \"What does ’if you don’t mind’ mean?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nThe mistake I just made, I immediately made again.\nThe term ’if you don’t mind’ seems to originate from an idiom, but who can blame Lin Li, it’s a language habit, not something you consider while speaking.\n\"It means ’offend’. So Lin Li explained.\n\"If you knew it was offensive, why ask?\" Sudan promptly inquired.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nNo?\nWait?\n\"Miss Sudan, do you have the term ’if you don’t mind’ in your world?\" Lin Li only wanted to ask this question now.\n\"Yeah, we do.\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDamn.\nYou’re full of crap.\nThis isn’t obliviousness, it’s being shrewd.\nWomen are never easy to deal with, Lin Li conceded.\nThis age question is better left unasked.\nSudan is probably around 1.7 meters, otherwise, Lin Li wouldn’t have been so hard to distinguish her gender at first, but now confirmed as female, she appeared very tall and slender. With her voice, and her unreserved attitude towards discussing topics related to sex, Lin Li surmised she was over twenty.\nAn older woman, eliminated.\n\"By the way, Miss Sudan, are you surviving here alone? Are there other survivors here?\" Lin Li inquired.\n\"Of course not, we have a camp. My ability is suited for escape and evasion, zombies can’t catch me and have a hard time harming me. Every time I go out to gather supplies, I lead the zombies around the camp to remote areas, then other ability users or ordinary people go out to reduce fights and losses.\"\nSudan shook her head, explaining.\n\"I see. So this ’remote’ area is where you’ve already scavenged before?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Pretty much.\" Sudan nodded.\nNo wonder Lin Li couldn’t find anything while searching, this area had already been emptied.\nThe disturbance seen while waiting for sunrise was probably caused by Sudan.\n\"I see. Miss Sudan, at first, you definitely didn’t know I was from another world, so why did you call out to me?\"\n\"Originally, I wanted to ask where you came from. If you came from outside, I wanted to know about the situation outside, and through which routes. If you were looking for a place to settle, I wondered if we could bring you into our shelter.\nBecause of the abilities you displayed, just the fact that zombies have no desire to attack thanks to you is significant and meaningful for the camp.\nBut now that I know you’re from another world, settling is a joke for you. I give up.\"\nSudan spread her hands, not hopeful in her words.\nLin Li indeed saw no need for a long rest in this world.\nEven if he came next week, only a few hours would have passed, even shorter than a nap, yet he could regulate for a week.\nBut the camp...\nLin Li’s attention was on another matter.\n\"Miss Sudan, if I may ask, is gold on your list of gathered resources?\" Lin Li asked honestly and cautiously.\n\"At first, we did collect some. After all, gold has excellent properties as a metal, and back then we thought zombies might soon be wiped out.\nHowever, later we found out that just surviving was very difficult, and there was basically no place to use those properties of gold. Bringing metals back was too exhausting, so we gave up.\nDo you need some?\"\n\"How much is ’some’?\" Lin Li squinted.\n\"Around a hundred pounds, a box, roughly no one oversees it.\" Sudan’s tone was casual.\nA hun-dred pounds.\nA sing-le box.\nLin Li blinked.\nIt’s known that 1 plus 1 equals 2.\nSo what’s 100 times 500 times 612 equal?\nEquals rich man Lin Li!\nThis is an astronomical figure where one could even build walls, houses, beds, and even aircraft out of the material without worry!\nWho cares whose mold it is, switching daily without repetition, no need to wash after use!\nUpon confirming this, Lin Li stood up, walked over to Sudan, and shook her hand forcefully:\n\"Nice to meet you. I am very interested in your camp or shelter, and believe that our cooperation will be great and glorious!\"\nSudan: \"?\"",

Perhaps you can see some clues.\" Lin Li nodded, as there was no need to hide this.\nHe was still fully armed, wearing a helmet. However, this time, because he was willing to spend money, the view was much better.\nSeeing the slight hope in Sudan’s eyes, Lin Li immediately added:\n\"I might need to clarify that I can only bring inanimate objects. And if it’s from your world back to my world, even if it’s a dead zombie, or blood and flesh stripped from them, I can’t take it back from this world.\nI personally think this is a protective filter of my traversal ability for me, meaning I can’t even bring dead creatures from this world. If you have any thoughts of traveling to my world through me, I don’t think you’d get the results you want.\"\nWhen returning, Lin Li would test again with the ant corpse in his pocket.\n\"So that’s it.\" Sudan nodded slightly disappointedly.\nNothing to be embarrassed about having her ’purpose’ seen through.\nAfter all, if there were a better place, who would want to continue struggling to survive in this world?\n\"Also, let me apologize and reintroduce myself, I’m Lin Li, nice to meet you, Miss Sudan.\"\nLin Li reintroduced himself, this time extending a hand for a handshake, speaking with a hint of apology:\n\"When I travel to another world, I’m not used to using my real name.\"\nSudan: \"...\"\n\"Lin Li... nice to meet you, this name sounds better than Bai Bufan, and there’s no need to add any ’Miss’ suffix, just call me Ye Jing.\"\nSudan shook Lin Li’s hand, politely saying.\nLin Li gladly agreed: \"Okay, Su...\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWait.\nWhy did \"Miss Sudan\" become Ye Jing after dropping the \"Miss\"? That subtraction doesn’t make sense!\nWait.\nYou’re also using a fake name, aren’t you?\n\"Reasonable, reasonable, I understand, I understand.\" Lin Li’s apology instantly vanished, and instead, he found it amusing.\n\"Ye Jing is really your real name?\" Lin Li felt it necessary to confirm once more for a devious woman.\n\"...It is.\"\n\"...Alright, let’s get back to the main topic. I’m like a ’two-world gate,’ and I think undoubtedly, I can help you improve your lives. For example... let me ask, are you still lacking food?\"\nLin Li reached into the backpack behind him, took out a box, and opened it. Inside were neatly arranged Dove chocolates, Snickers, Crispy Sharks, and even a piece of tiramisu.\nAlthough compressed biscuits should be the most suitable and efficient food for survival in the wild.\nBut Lin Li wasn’t surviving in the wilderness; he was traveling to another world to encounter beautiful ladies.\nDating with zombies was already bad enough; if he could only eat compressed biscuits miserably, wouldn’t that be living Bai Bufan’s life?\nMoreover, Lin Li wasn’t going hungry; the chocolate was high in calories, and saving a bit of the food in this box could last for two days without a problem.\nCross-dimension travel that can be refreshed once a week, Lin Li believed his single-stay limit wouldn’t be too long, speculating it might be 24 hours or 8 hours—since the system’s given active abilities refresh within this timeframe.\nAs for the answer to his ’Are you still lacking food?’ question, Lin Li had already gotten it when Ye Jing’s eyes began to change, staring straight at the items inside the box.\n\"Do you want...\" Lin Li picked up a chocolate and held it out to Ye Jing, and before he could finish the sentence, his hand was lightened, and the chocolate was already in Ye Jing’s hand.",

Clearly, she should be ravenous, but she restrained herself, slowly tore open the package, and took a careful little bite of the chocolate. As it melted on her tongue, her eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a faint smile.\nUnfortunately, the scars twisted grotesquely with the movement of her facial muscles, making them even more glaring.\nIt seems that even with powers, the survival situation at Ye Jing’s refuge was still not good.\n\"Aren’t you afraid I’d poison it?\" Lin Li joked.\n\"Doesn’t matter, it’d be worth it even if I died.\" Enjoying the wonderful taste of the food, Ye Jing said, her voice slightly hoarse.\nLin Li hadn’t expected the chocolate to have such a powerful effect.\nBut perhaps it was also his privilege to think nothing of eating minced meat.\nTruly surviving for two years in the apocalypse, he might be even less capable than Ye Jing.\nShe probably hadn’t eaten such food in a long, long time, and who knows what they’re eating now.\n\"Ye Jing, let me share a survival tip with you: don’t eat things given by strangers because they might be drugged. But you can actively ask or snatch food from strangers; that way, they won’t have time to drug it.\" Lin Li said with a smile.\nIn a \"whoosh,\" Lin Li’s box was ’snatched’ in front of Ye Jing.\n\"Thanks.\"\nIndeed, she learned fast.\nBut Lin Li didn’t mind. There was still a bit in his bag, and to him, it wasn’t worth much, so he took out a bottle of electrolyte drink and handed it to her.\n\"Your world is so blissful...\" She took the drink and sighed softly.\n\"Oh right, Ye Jing, later Miss Beauty and I plan to make a hot dinner... What time is it now? Anyway, in the evening, I’m going to cook a dish. If you want, you can join us and share.\" Lin Li mentioned casually.\n\"Miss Beauty is...\" Ye Jing’s voice stopped abruptly as she looked at the zombie head in the snakeskin bag, halting her words.\nShe still couldn’t get used to calling a genderless zombie \"Miss Beauty.\"\nThen Ye Jing’s voice grew more perplexed: \"You’re making it together with her? How does she cook? Do you actually have the ability to revive zombies?\"\n\"Of course not, but I’ve already thought it through,\" Lin Li immediately introduced his idea to Ye Jing. \"Does your world have a method to make meat soup? Later, I plan to make a pork soup. Look, this is the pork I brought.\"\nLin Li took out the fresh pork from his bag to show Ye Jing and continued to introduce:\n\"This is the original pork. Pork soup needs minced meat, so I need to mince it. This is where Miss Beauty can come in. Her bones, once cleaned, can perfectly serve as the original wooden hammer. I’ll use it for pounding.\"\nThe system task required him and Miss Beauty to jointly prepare and enjoy a dish. If this didn’t count as co-creation, Lin Li didn’t know what would. Without Miss Beauty, it really wouldn’t work.\nYe Jing: \"o.o?——o.O?——O.o?——O.O?\"\nIs this something a human could say?\nAre people from another world really that terrifying?\n\"I’m not sure I dare to eat it,\" Ye Jing confessed.\n\"Don’t worry, I’ve thought about that too. I brought cling film. When cooking, of course, gloves must be worn, and the bones won’t contact the food, and bacteria won’t be an issue,\" Lin Li explained.\nLin Li would never really eat anything related to zombies just for a task.\nWhen the time comes, a bit of pounding would suffice.\n\"Let’s just say we’ll see when the time comes.\" Ye Jing left herself a way out.\nShe slowly and carefully finished eating the chocolate bar, but only that bar, and then refolded the chocolate wrapper and put it back in the box.\nShe then looked at Lin Li: \"Lin Li, you’ll be our savior.\"\n\"Overly high praise, just fulfilling needs mutually, I can save time too.\" Lin Li waved his hand.\nSearching aimlessly here was also tiring, not nearly as satisfying as earning thirty million in one go.\n\"Is your refuge far from here?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Not too far. At my speed, I can return in about half an hour, but I came across the buildings, almost in a straight line. If walking the roads on the ground, it would take about an hour.\" Ye Jing answered and, after hesitating a bit, added:\n\"By the way, Lin Li, I hope you understand that I can’t take you back directly. I need to discuss with the others at the refuge first; I can’t make decisions alone.\"\n\"That’s fine, and actually, I had no intention of going back with you. After all, I don’t know anything about the people in your refuge, and I don’t trust them. I was just pondering when to tell you this.\"\nLin Li hadn’t let down his guard. Although presumably, there was no necessary conflict point between the people in the refuge and himself, since even if they killed him, they couldn’t gain anything, Lin Li was always prepared to leave and remain in an invincible position.",

(3/4)]\nAfter revisiting the previous shopping routine, after more than half an hour later had passed, Lin Li saw the system’s notification.\nOK, so next up there’s only the small task of cooking, Lin Li tossed Beauty Lady’s hand back into the snakeskin bag.\nHe pulled out a rib, scraped it with a fruit knife until a fly would slip off, a point where Bai Bufan would shake his head after seeing, then began madly wrapping it with cling film.\nAfter completing these preparations, Lin Li stopped.\nBecause the system task required making a dinner, it emphasized dinner, but currently, in this world, it’s not even noon yet.\n\"Lin Li, I can already see people from our shelter sent out to gather materials.\"\nAfter walking for a while, Ye Jing, who was leading the way ahead, suddenly stopped jumping, turned back, and said to Lin Li.\nBut her eyes mainly rested on those few zombies following Lin Li, performing stopping challenges.\nBringing them over would surely cause a commotion.\n\"Okay.\" Lin Li nodded, then looked around, pointed at one of the relatively tall buildings nearby, and said:\n\"I’ll wait for you guys in that building, you can come over when you’re ready, I’m not in a rush, just come at your own pace.\"\n\"Okay, thank you.\" Ye Jing nodded.\nLin Li then led his fangirls toward the building he had pointed to.\nIdle time is wasted time, might as well prepare for the upcoming trade.\n...\nAlthough Lin Li said he wasn’t in a rush, in less than half an hour, Ye Jing arrived at the destination with her people.\nQuite fast.\n\"Lin Li? Lin Li? Bai Bufan?\" Ye Jing called quietly when she couldn’t find Lin Li in the building he had designated.\n\"Oi, I’m right here.\"\nHearing the voice, Ye Jing looked across the building where Lin Li stood, along with two zombies.\nStill in Tao Zhe state.\nYe Jing: \"?\"\nSeeing Ye Jing instinctively hide on the opposite side, Lin Li waved and loudly said: \"You should know, in this state, they won’t attack anyone, it’s fine if they see you, just consider them my hired bodyguards.\"\nThis scene was indeed enough for the people from the shelter to tread carefully around him.\n\"Are you Lin Li?\" At this point, two other people appeared next to Ye Jing.\nOne was a muscular man, though not as built as Zhai Kai, probably could touch his own back.\nThe other man wasn’t as robust, looked a bit older.\n\"Hello, yes I am, and you are?\" Lin Li politely asked.\n\"I’m Hu Fei, and he’s Shi Dongchen, both from the shelter, heard about your situation from Ye Jing, here to trade with you,\" the muscular man spoke with an awkward pacing, and the man named Shi Dongchen next to him nodded.\n\"OK,\" Lin Li nodded, it didn’t matter who was up for trading, then extended his hand, \"Did you bring the gold?\"\nHu Fei took an item from his pocket and threw it toward the building Lin Li was in, and Lin Li caught it securely.\nA small gold bar, weighing it in his hand, about twenty to thirty grams, bending it slightly with force, it should be gold.\n\"You should go to your world, and before night falls, bring back the one hundred packages of chocolate you promised Ye Jing, this value should cover it, we’ll wait for you here,\" Hu Fei said on the other side.\nLin Li, who was originally playing with the gold bar, felt puzzled after hearing this and scratched his head: \"Weird.\"\n\"What’s weird?\" Hu Fei asked with a frown, \"There’s no problem with the gold.\"\n\"I said weird, it’s you,\" Lin Li looked up at Hu Fei.\n\"What about me?\"\nAs everyone knows, Lin Li is the kind of miser who would dust off a single penny before putting it in his pocket.\nSo, regarding this piece of gold worth thousands, Lin Li wiped it with his bulletproof vest, huffed on it, then tossed it high in the air, and kicked it toward the opposite building.\nThe kick was a bit amateur, it veered off, hit a wall, and fell to the ground.\n\"Ding.\"\nNice sound, it’s well-minted gold.\n\"Why did you do that?\" Seeing this, Hu Fei frowned.\nLin Li flipped Hu Fei the bird:\n\"Did I misunderstand this, am I supposed to be begging you for business? Forget the gold, you can try your luck on your own.\"\n\"I’m wondering how someone like you managed to survive in the apocalypse for two years until now?\"\nLin Li wanted to spit, even had a sound building up.\nNot that manners stopped Lin Li.\nSpitting with a helmet on is self-harm.\nLin Li then put his arm around the two Tao Zhe’s shoulders and turned to leave.",

These are the two things we lack the most now.\"\n\"Okay, got it. I’ll bring some over the next time I come,\" Lin Li nodded.\nIf the recent incident hadn’t happened, Lin Li would describe how much he’d bring, making a promise.\nBut now, forget it; whether to bring more or less, it all depends on his mood.\n\"May I ask, Little Brother Lin, when will you be back next time?\" Shi Dongchen cautiously asked.\n\"I don’t know.\"\nLin Li gave a top-notch response.\nShi Dongchen: \"?\"\n\"What time is it in your world now?\" Lin Li countered.\n\"Roughly around 10:35, though there might be some error because the watch hasn’t been adjusted for a long time,\" Shi Dongchen said after checking his watch.\n\"I have to wait until...\" Lin Li’s words suddenly stopped.\nBecause just as he opened the system, he suddenly discovered a textless interface, and the button was no longer blank.\nOn the button representing ’departure’, it prominently showed [02.33.23].\nPreviously, he hadn’t paid attention to this interface, so he hadn’t noticed.\nWhat is this? An in-system clock?\nThen in the next second, it changed to [02.33.22].\nSure enough, it was a clock, though it seemed Middle Eastern-made.\nThis thing wasn’t here last week, clearly, it was just updated this week.\nSo is this a time travel limit?\nLin Li thought that was the only reasonable interpretation.\nHe compared it with his watch, and together they summed to about 5 hours exactly.\nIs this the time limit for being in the apocalyptic world?\nShorter than expected, not even eight hours?\nAs for the other buttons, they didn’t even have numbers.\nSeems like that’s all that was updated.\n\"Why are you all staring at me, is there something on my helmet?\" Lin Li, coming back to his senses, found Ye Jing and the others looking at him and curiously asked.\nYe Jing: \"...\"\nYou’re the one who stopped talking halfway!\n\"You haven’t said until when you’ll be back,\" Ye Jing added softly.\n\"Oh, right, I forgot. If nothing unexpected happens, I should be back around two or three in the afternoon,\" Lin Li calculated the time.\nThe dinner mission seems unlikely, and even if the time is maxed out, it can only last until one in the afternoon.\nAlthough he still doesn’t know the exact ratio of the time flow, if it’s the same as last time, it would be around an hour.\n\"So you’ll be back in the afternoon, is that the time you need for a round trip?\" Shi Dongchen asked.\n\"No, it’s just that I don’t plan to go back now.\"\nAlthough staying longer is meaningless, the issue is if he goes back now, the next time he can come around half-past eleven, with a limit of five hours, can only stay until four in the afternoon? The system doesn’t recognize if it’s dinner time, Lin Li also doesn’t know.\nSo this time Lin Li definitely wants to stay until the countdown ends.\nBy the way, Lin Li doesn’t know if this is a countdown for the time limit, just the right time to confirm.\nSeeing Shi Dongchen’s expression change slightly, Lin Li maintained his tone: \"I know you’re anxious, but don’t rush. It can’t be that I come and you can’t wait for even one second after that, right?\"\n\"Sorry, we’re just anxious,\" Shi Dongchen nodded quickly, then added:\n\"Little Brother Lin, I want to ask, besides Gold, is there anything else you need? When it comes to cooperation, the broader the better, right? Maybe we can reach a win-win situation in other areas.\"\n\"You’re all struggling to survive; what else could you offer me?\" Lin Li asked with some curiosity.\nHonestly, with 1.8 million on hand, and after the mission completes, this world’s allure would be a bit lower for him.\n\"Maybe there is something.\"\nShi Dongchen’s eyes brightened, then gestured for the document transfer assistant, Ye Jing, to come over.\nWhen Ye Jing hopped over to Lin Li’s side again, she was holding a stack of photos.\nLin Li looked them over and found they were all photos of women.\nPosing seductively, dressed provocatively.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhy does this feel so familiar?\nIsn’t this like Tianhong or Qingjue’s stuff?\n\"This is...\" Lin Li looked at them for confirmation.\n\"What else could it be? Lewd dealings,\" Ye Jing rolled her eyes, clicking her tongue with slight disdain, \"but it’s consensual, and there’s still some humanity in it.\"\n\"If you fancy any, you can freely choose your entertainment. There are no legal constraints on you here, you may do whatever you wish,\" Madam Shi Dongchen, rubbing his hands like a fly, said, \"Making them pretend to be zombies for your amusement is completely acceptable too.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Wait a minute, Ye Jing, what the hell have you been telling them?\" Lin Li stared directly at Ye Jing.\nYe Jing turned her head slightly, looking guilty.\nLin Li didn’t reply immediately, instead taking out his phone, opening a locked file, and handing it to Ye Jing: \"Assistant, help me transfer it.\"\nYe Jing, who had jumped back and forth multiple times in a short period: \"...\"\n\"Why do you have to talk across buildings!\" Ye Jing muttered through gritted teeth.",

Quiet, now is not the time for you to speak.\" Shi Dongchen slapped Hu Fei’s forehead when he heard this.\n\"You be quiet, Shi Dongchen, I am Hu Xiaojing, not Hu Fei!\" Hu Fei turned his head, glaring at Shi Dongchen.\nShi Dongchen: \"?\"\nLin Li was now completely convinced that this guy wasn’t doing it on purpose at all.\nAn idiot wouldn’t be acting like someone who wasn’t acting.\n\"Sorry for making Little Brother Lin laugh, just ignore him.\" Shi Dongchen could only say to Lin Li.\n\"No,\" Lin Li shook his head with a smile, opened his backpack, took out a portion of food originally reserved for himself, since there’s no need for a ’next meal’ anyway, and threw it directly to Hu Fei: \"Hu Xiaojing, it’s yours.\"\nHu Fei reached out to catch it, immediately opened it, stuffed it into his mouth in chunks, and his eyes lit up.\nShi Dongchen next to him was stunned, the action of swallowing was very obvious.\n\"Lin Li, I’m sorry, I lied to you again, I didn’t tell you one word less, actually... My real name is Ye Xiaojing.\" Ye Jing pressed her hands on Lin Li’s shoulders, staring longingly at Lin Li... behind the backpack.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Ye Jing, I recognize your shamelessness.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up, fumbled in the bag, but only a few candies were left.\nLuckily, Ye Jing took them without complaint, happily.\n\"You can just call me Xiaojing in the future.\"\n\"You’re much older than I am, I’m afraid calling you that would shorten my life.\" Lin Li waved his hands.\n\"Lin Li, you’re really bold.\"\nWatching the two chatting, Shi Dongchen laughed: \"Haha, I suddenly remembered, I’m actually called Shi Xiao too...\"\nLin Li shook his bag: \"Nothing left.\"\nShi Dongchen: \"...\"\nDamn! Changed my name too late!\nShi Dongchen awkwardly laughed, then added:\n\"I heard from Ye Jing that the technological development of our two worlds has different focuses, so we also have some conventional weapons and tools that might be valuable to you and could serve as trade chips? Additionally...\"\nShi Dongchen knew that just relying on gold was not enough. To keep Lin Li, this ’gate between the two worlds,’ a more lasting and stable relationship was needed elsewhere.\nAs for something that might be more precious in the shelter, he was still hesitant about whether to mention it now.\n\"If it’s completely different from my world, maybe there’s a need? But without seeing them firsthand, I can’t say if I would find it useful.\" Lin Li said casually upon hearing that.\nThings from another world surely have their value, and a very high one.\nBut for a seventeen-year-old without grand ambitions, it’s hard to say.\n\"That’s great! We sincerely invite you to our shelter for a visit. Rest assured, Ye Jing has already informed us of your concerns, but you needn’t have such thoughts at all.\nWe will absolutely not harm you, nor will we have any ill intentions towards you, I swear on my life that we will treat you as the most honored guest...\" Shi Dongchen said immediately when he heard this.\n\"I’ll also swear on Xiaojing’s name!\" Hu Fei, still munching away, chimed in.\nEven though one swears on ’life’ and the other on ’name,’ the weight might be about the same.\n\"I’ll talk about it once I return.\" Lin Li merely said.\nBefore having the right tools or abilities, Lin Li must avoid being discovered that his entry and exit points are fixed.\n\"...Okay.\" Shi Dongchen nodded, swallowing his words: \"Ye Jing, give this to Little Brother Lin.\"\nSo the document transmission assistant handed a round-shaped object to Lin Li.\n\"What is this?\"\n\"This is a pair of signal devices, as long as the distance doesn’t exceed three thousand meters, when one is pressed, the other will ring, so we can contact each other in this way.\" Shi Dongchen explained.\n\"I see.\" Lin Li nodded, took it, \"Then this afternoon when yours rings, or if it hasn’t rung by three or four o’clock, come here to wait for me.\"\n\"Alright.\" Shi Dongchen nodded.\n\"You guys continue gathering your supplies, I have to control these two zombies here, I’ll take them away from you first.\" Lin Li said lightly.\nTake care of killing and burying, as the zombies were brought in by him and need to be dealt with by himself.\nThe lust within the bottles was already empty, even if they wouldn’t attack him after they weren’t Tao Zhe in the past, but upon seeing Ye Jing and the others, they would charge at them first.\n\"Thank you.\"\nSeeing that Lin Li really didn’t want to talk any further, Shi Dongchen didn’t try to hold him back.\n\"Then I’m leaving, you won’t send anyone to track me, will you?\" Lin Li asked, hooking Tao Zhe’s shoulders on his way out.\n\"Of course not.\"\n\"Doesn’t matter, if you do, make sure not to let me find out, or you know what the result will be.\" Lin Li waved as a farewell.\n\"There will be no such thing as tracking.\"\nLin Li left with the beautiful lady and the self-defense gentlemen.\nIn fact, he didn’t go far, just a hundred meters away.\nHiding in a building, after letting the two zombies wander on their own, Lin Li began organizing his belongings.\nThis time returning to reality, many things were simply unnecessary to bring back.\nAfter all, they had to be brought over, backpacks, bulletproof vests, crossbows... It’s better to leave these in this world.\nIt’s only one or two hours, and no one would take them.\nAlso to bring them more food—at least with their behavior afterward, Lin Li was still satisfied.\nSo Lin Li found a building, placing all the items he didn’t need to take back and the beautiful lady at a relatively hidden high spot, where zombies were almost impossible to wander to.\nAs for that signal device, Lin Li specifically put it in another building.\nThen it was just waiting for time to pass, resting on the spot.\nToday, keeping in a high mental state for over two hours was still a bit tiring.\n[0.00.00]\nThe countdown ended, a white light flashed, and Lin Li sat in the bathroom of reality.",

Why would it use me as a reference point?\"\n\"Or is it actually using the system as the reference, like this apocalypse world is an extension of the system?\"\nLin Li racked his brain but couldn’t figure out the answers to these questions, so he simply gave up.\nUpon inspecting himself, the situation was similar to last time; flesh related to zombies didn’t come back. When Lin Li took out the plastic box from his pocket—the ant corpse and legs were gone.\nWhich means ant corpses can be taken from reality to the apocalypse, but not brought back to reality.\nGreat, that way, if I die in the apocalypse, even if time runs out, my corpse won’t be transported back to scare Wu Min! The system is really considerate!\nLin Li gave a thumbs-up to the system, details show warmth, it really does, Lin Li was dying laughing.\nThe system interface, the third button lit up, with a number \"20\" on it.\nIt’s not a countdown, just a fixed \"20.\"\nHonestly, Lin Li had some guesses about what this number might mean.\nJust like the weekly free refresh is only once, could this button be used to refresh the weekly visits to the apocalypse world?\nNow that this number has appeared, does it mean he needs \"20\" system currency to refresh once?\nBut Lin Li had no intention of clicking it.\nThe unit is important.\nWho knows if the unit could be \"20 wives the host’s future romantic luck could marry.\"\nWithout confirmation, Lin Li would still not click it.\nRecalling that Bai Bufan was still waiting for his message, Lin Li picked up his phone.\n\"Lin Li: It’s okay, I just took a little nap, now I feel fine, no need to ask for leave for me tomorrow or rather today.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: ?\"\n\"Bai Bufan: Then my breakfast is saved?\"\nStay true to your original intention.\n\"Bai Bufan: Are you really okay or just pretending? Don’t push yourself, take a leave if necessary, rest if needed, and leave the world if you must.\"\nIgnore it, we’ll meet in a few hours anyway, Lin Li freshened up and rested.\n...\n\"According to unofficial history, when Cao Cao saw the bound Lu Bu at Xia Pi City and White Gate Tower, he actually had the intention to subdue the first warrior of the Three Kingdoms and asked, ’Would you be willing to surrender and become my underling?’\nLu Bu was overjoyed at these words, as that was his intention all along, so he immediately shouted, ’I am willing!’\nCao Cao, hearing this, ceased his efforts, ’Indeed, great warriors have pride, then let me grant you an honorable death!’\nAnd so, Lu Bu was strangled and beheaded.\"\nBai Bufan’s voice was always so distinctive.\nWild knowledge plus one.\n\"The honorable death I heard of doesn’t match yours?\" Entering from the front door, after giving Chen Yu Ying’s breakfast, Lin Li came to the back row and said with a smile.\n\"’Humans should tend to humans, monsters should tend to monsters, this is the rule of nature, and also the cycle of life’!\" Bai Bufan raised his arm and called out, \"Is this the honorable death you heard of?\"\n\"Bingo!\" Lin Li snapped his fingers.\nThe Demon King is the most upright in ’Maze Dry’, bar none.\nBreakfast was distributed.\nLin Li was just about to ask what assignments to collect next when the corner of his mouth twitched.\n\"You two neat freaks.\"\nSeeing Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei take their breakfast, Bai Bufan then took a bottle of alcohol from the drawer to spray and disinfect, while Zhou Baowei put on a mask beside him, eagerly waiting for Bai Bufan to finish so it would be his turn.\nPaying so much attention to disinfection, who are they guarding against? So hard to guess.\n\"Lin Li, open your mouth, this is a breath freshener.\" After spraying the breakfast, Bai Bufan turned his head with the alcohol towards Lin Li.\nEyes wide open, Zhou Baowei: What about me?\nLin Li also smiled and pointed at his arm, \"Bufan, look up, this is a respiratory tract scarf.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Hold up!\"\nThe breath freshener wasn’t sprayed, but the scarf was indeed put on.\n\"Wrong, wrong, wrong!\" Almost ending up like Lu Bu, Bai Bufan rubbed his neck after Lin Li let go and curiously asked, \"What was up with you last night? Still feeling unwell?\"\n\"It’s fine, last night’s discomfort was just an illusion.\"\n\"Oh, an illusion, sigh, an illusion.\"\n\"Really that regretful?\" Lin Li smiled.\n\"Haha, how could it be, I was up all night praying for you, learning ’Rebirth Spell,’ ’Human Salvation Scroll’ and all that.\" Bai Bufan emphasized brotherhood and then remarked, \"Lin Li, what do you think happens after we die?\"\n\"Switch a new desk partner, embrace a bright tomorrow, it’s the same whether you die or I die.\"\n\"Makes sense.\"\n...\n\"Ring—\"\nThe bell rang for the last class in the afternoon, and after the geography teacher packed up the lesson plan and left the classroom, the class instantly became lively.\nBai Bufan, who had been standing at the back of the class, happily returned to his seat:\n\"Come on, let’s go downstairs! Epic battle with Class 3! Let’s show those math Olympiad guys who only know books the power of our parallel class!\"\nAs for why Bai Bufan was standing at the back during class, it was because the teacher had asked him why Middle Eastern architecture had thick walls and small windows.",

      "content": "Chapter 306: Chapter 239 Zhang Haoyang, come here, I want to ask you something_2\nThe correct answer is that the Middle East Region is primarily subtropical, tropical desert climate, characterized by large temperature differences between day and night, thick walls, small windows, which help with heat insulation and cold prevention.\nBut Bai Bufan’s answer was ’thick walls for bulletproofing, small windows, convenient for shooting’.\nThen he just stood there.\nFor this one time, Lin Li was willing to stand up for Bai Bufan; Bufan’s answer wasn’t wrong!\nOf course, if you ask Lin Li if he truly stood up for Bufan.\nThen the conversation would need to be reconsidered.\n\"Let’s go!\" Lin Li nodded and began stretching his muscles.\nStarting this week, those fun projects are set to begin competing one after another, and like tug-of-war, which can’t be conducted multiple times in a short period, with only two teams participating in one match, it naturally has to start early.\nToday is the first round; there was no drawing lots, simply class one versus class two, class three versus class four, and so on.\nThe top ten will start drawing lots.\n\"I’ve already investigated class three,\" Chen Tianming came up and said.\n\"What’s their level?\" Bai Bufan inquired.\n\"I’m already studying the finals’ opponent,\" Chen Tianming replied.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"If we lose because of your jinx, you better be prepared to stand on your head facing the sun, Tianming,\" Bai Bufan commented.\n\"Don’t worry, it’s solid. Feels like their whole class’s weight combined is not as heavy as Bao Wei,\" Chen Tianming waved his hand, then with some expectation added, \"I hope class seventeen can advance too, eventually facing us, so win or lose, it’ll become a topic for me and Qiaoqiao.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"Chen Tianming, damn it, what am I in your eyes?\"\nChen Tianming, entering his simp mode, ignored him.\n\"He’s Qiaoqiao’s fun toy,\" Lin Li answered for him.\n\"What toy?\"\n\"Collar,\" Bai Bufan answered.\n\"That makes sense,\" Zhou Baowei nodded, then clasped his fists, speaking with a murderous intent:\n\"To add weight for the afternoon competition, I’m deliberately not pooping; this time, we will definitely win.\"\nLin Li, Bai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"During the tug-of-war, you must stand last; if you stand in front, I’m quitting,\" both said in unison.\nHumans do break limits when exerting strength.\nStanding behind Zhou Baowei, such a scenario requires medicine.\nEspecially when shouting ’pull!’, who knows where Zhou Baowei might have done the pulling.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\n\"Don’t worry; someone mature and stable like me will definitely stand at the end of the rope as the anchor,\" Zhou Baowei said calmly.\n\"Weight and stability are visible, but mature is reversed; you are more like thoroughly cooked,\" Lin Li commented.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Old Jian’s here, come out quickly, let’s go.\" Wang Ze poked his head in the door, calling out to the group.\nTug-of-war is a mix of male and female, eight boys and eight girls, only freshmen have this competition because after class distribution, some classes might not be able to gather eight boys or girls.\nThe monk class and nun class have no human rights.\nIn such class competitions, students not participating also naturally need to go cheer for their class, so class four first came out as a whole team, then casually went downstairs.\nBasketball court.\nWhen class four came down, the court was already crowded with people since many classes gathered here.\nHowever, the school only prepared four tug-of-war ropes, some classes had to wait for others to finish.\n\"That little girl is so cute,\" Zhang Haoyang pointed in the distance, whispering.\nOn the court’s edge, a doll-like little girl was very noticeable in her bubble skirt instead of a uniform, tiptoeing, trying to peek out from the crowd, clutching a melting lollipop.\nProbably the daughter of a teacher.\n\"You should all stand in a line and distribute one each--,\" Lin Li glanced at Zhang Haoyang upon hearing.\n\"Really? Give me!\" Zhang Haoyang got excited, Pan Hong possessed.\n\"Lin Li, why did I receive a 5.56?\" Bai Bufan raised his hand, puzzled.\n\"Would you come if I didn’t say that?\" Lin Li no longer pretended.\nZhang Haoyang: \"...\"\nYou two damn it.\n\"Still giving addresses? Going or not?\" Lin Li looked at Zhang Haoyang.\n\"Giving! But I have a request; 5.56 bullets are still too big. Can we switch to smaller calibers like .22? I prefer smaller ones,\" Zhang Haoyang nodded, sincerely giving his suggestion.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThis needs the smallest too?\nDamn.\n\"You damn stubborn!\" Lin Li laughed and swore.\n\"Don’t worry, buddy, my obsession is purely with anime stuff. If anyone really tried anything bad in reality, the whole family would suffer,\" Zhang Haoyang laughed, explaining to ease Lin Li and the others’ murderous intent.\n\"By the way, Bufan, want to go shooting this weekend?\" Since 5.56 was mentioned, Lin Li suddenly remembered and turned to ask Bai Bufan.\nLast week, due to lack of time, Lin Li gave up on real shooting experience.\nBut this weekend is normal, and now Lin Li has both time and money, so with the idea, why not execute it?\nGoing alone is a bit boring, better to share the fun, so Lin Li plans to bring Bai Bufan along.\nAs for the girls, he can ask them later.\nOne prospers, all rise!\n\"Tianming said your size is off, I’m not joining you, afraid I’ll feel inferior,\" Bai Bufan expressed refusal.\nLin Li: \"...I’m talking about real guns.\"\n\"Real guns? How do you play real guns?\" Bai Bufan sounded confused.\n\"I plan to go to a live ammunition shooting club this weekend to try real guns, asking if you want to come?\"\n\"Huh? How do you go? Where? Is there such a place here?\" Bai Bufan seemed bewildered, completely unfamiliar with it.",

My plan is to take the high-speed train there on Saturday morning, try it out in the afternoon, and take the train back in the evening, all in a day.\" Lin Li shared his plan.\nLin Li had never experienced live ammunition shooting before, and he had never taken a plane, a high-speed train, or a subway due to his lack of enthusiasm for traveling.\nThese are all things he could experience.\n\"Can we go at our age?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"Yes, we can. I asked their customer service online, but we’ll have fewer guns to choose from.\" Lin Li nodded. He had already looked into it online in advance.\n\"Sounds tempting,\" Bai Bufan nodded. Which boy hasn’t dreamed of playing with real guns? \"How much would it cost, including the round-trip train fare?\"\n\"The train tickets aren’t that much, just two stops, about sixty round-trip. Including expenses at the club, if you fire a few more clips, it would be over a thousand.\" Lin Li spoke truthfully.\n\"Oh, just... how much?!\" Bai Bufan yanked Lin Li’s collar and exclaimed, \"Over a thousand?!\"\nThat’s like three Spring Breeze Elves (Bear One, Bear Two, Baldy Strong)!\nHe still needed to save some of that money to be a ’2D-to-3D lifer’!\n’2D-to-3D lifer’—reality money injected into the two-dimensional world.\nAlthough he had this dream, if the cost was this high, then maybe he’d have to suppress it for now.\nAfter all, only the unattainable are called dreams.\nBai Bufan felt he was doing it to preserve the dignity of his dream.\n\"I’ll handle the expenses at the club.\" Lin Li laughed dismissively upon hearing this.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nBai Bufan released Lin Li’s collar, carefully tidied it up, and softly asked, \"Could you say that again?\"\n\"It’s on me.\" Lin Li repeated.\n\"You’re going to pay for me to fire bullets costing over a thousand?\" Bai Bufan couldn’t believe it.\n\"Yup.\"\n\"You’ve got that kind of money?\"\n\"Yup.\"\n\"Lin Li, do you have a mirror?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"Heh,\" Bai Bufan chuckled mockingly, \"Lin Li, even if you don’t have a mirror, you should at least have some piss to look at yourself. Why don’t you go take a leak and see if you look anything like my dad?\"\nLin Li was all set to retort but was stunned by the last word.\nBai Bufan’s remarks threw him off completely.\n\"Dad, why so quiet? Don’t you even have some piss? No worries, I’ve got plenty today; I’ve drunk a lot of water. It’s definitely not yellow and won’t tarnish your glorious countenance.\" Bai Bufan’s tone was full of flattery.\nIndeed, Bai Bufan was known for adapting and thriving in any situation.\n\"Just don’t pee on my shoes, or I’ll smack you.\" Lin Li laughed.\n\"Seriously, Lin Li, are you for real? What’ve you been up to lately? Are you really treating us?\" Bai Bufan was puzzled, \"Or is there some special deal at that place?\"\n\"I’ll explain later, let’s focus on the tug-of-war first.\" Lin Li motioned with his head.\nThe referee was already here, using a dustpan with powder to redraw the victory line more prominently.\nEveryone started taking their positions.\nThere’s a knack to lining up for tug-of-war. Class Four had Zhuo Yongfei and Chen Tianming in the front, with Zhou Baowei as the mainstay at the end, and the boys and girls arranged by height in the middle.\nSo, Lin Li, the tallest in Class Four, took the second-to-last position.\n\"Are those Class Three’s people?\" Bai Bufan squinted at the Class Three students taking their positions, waved casually, \"Tianming was right, a bunch of nobodies, we don’t even need to use Plan B.\"\nLin Li didn’t pay attention to Bai Bufan at this moment.\nHe was in his zone.\nWhen someone handed him the powder, Lin Li pinched a little between his thumb and forefinger, spread it carefully on his thumb’s base, then pressed his nose close, inhaling sharply.\nAfter savoring it for a few seconds, Lin Li frowned and shook his head at the person:\n\"Boss, this stuff isn’t pure, the quality feels off. Or am I using it wrong and there’s another method?\"\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nOld Jian’s mouth twitched uncontrollably.\nWhy in the world was Lin Li so adept at this?!\nIf the student he taught turned out to know how to do this, his reputation would be ruined.\nBut fortunately, if anyone were to do this, it would be Lin Li; he could believe it.\nXue Jian held back from dropping the whole box of anti-slip powder on Lin Li’s head—fearing the kid might get high on the spot—and scolded, \"Stop fooling around and rub it on your hands.\"\n\"Got it.\" Lin Li nodded, grabbed some anti-slip powder, and rubbed it on his hands.\nThis powder increases friction and also protects hands from rope burns.\n\"Lin Li, Bai Bufan, everyone, keep it up.\" Chen Yu Ying, who had a camera hanging around her neck, cheered on the side.\nChen Yu Ying wasn’t too strong and didn’t participate in this event.\n\"Don’t worry, class monitor, I’ve got my ’Celestial Eye’ open, there’s no way we can lose.\" Lin Li dabbed some anti-slip powder on his forehead, making a ’third eye’, before saluting with two fingers.\n\"Good to hear.\" Chen Yu Ying laughed, lifting her camera to snap a photo of Lin Li’s antics.\nClass Three didn’t seem to have anyone particularly strong, and since this was a team effort, Lin Li didn’t need to hold back and could exert his full strength.\nTug-of-war was best of three, and if they lost the first round, Lin Li could go into \"Full Power Mode\" and double up in the next.\nSo, Lin Li could make a significant difference by himself.\n\"Darn it, why am I just ’everyone’ while you two have names?\" Wang Ze, sandwiched between Lin Li and Bai Bufan, was focusing on something else.\n\"You guys can get ready now.\" The referee whistled, and the surroundings fell silent.\n\"The team that pulls the red rope across their line wins. Don’t use force yet! If you start early, you lose! Best of three, you must stay standing during the match, no sitting or lying down, and no deliberate release of the rope...\"\nAfter explaining the rules, the referee placed the whistle in his mouth.\n\"Beep—\"\n\"Go! Go! Class Four! Go!\"\n\"Class Three! Go! Class Three! Go!\"\n\"One—two—pull!!! One—two—pull!!!\"\n\"Wang Ze!!\"\nIn a flash, loud shouts filled the area, deafening.\nThe strength difference was evident, as the red rope moved lopsidedly towards Class Four’s side.\n\"One, two, pull!!\"\n\"Wang Ze!!\"\n\"One, two, pull!!\"\n\"Wang Ze!!\"\n\"Beep—\"\nThe whistle blew after just a few seconds, ending the first round!\nNaturally, the winner was Class Four.\n\"Class Four wins! We’ll start the second round in five minutes!\"\n\"We are the champions!! We are the champions!!\" Even though the match wasn’t over, the one-sided nature of the initial contest paved the way for an expected outcome.\n\"Lin Li!! We’re the champions!\" Wang Ze turned, shaking Lin Li’s shoulder excitedly, wiping his anti-slip powder off on Lin Li’s clothes.\nHe didn’t understand why Lin Li was shouting his name instead of the team’s chant during the match, but maybe that was their bond.\nThat was until Wang Ze noticed an unusual look in Lin Li’s eyes.\n\"Wha-what’s up?\" Wang Ze asked, puzzled.\nLin Li looked down.\nSo did Wang Ze.\n\"Whoa, Lin Li, nice taste! The pattern on your shoe’s upper looks just like the sole pattern of my shoe!\" Wang Ze ’exclaimed’, realizing they had a similar taste!\nLin Li remained silent, only smiling.\n\"Haha, no wonder I felt uneven ground, but I was too focused on pulling to notice. So, it was you messing around, you cheeky person.\" Wang Ze patted Lin Li’s shoulder heartily, laughing.\nLin Li remained silent, only smiling.\n\"You were always calling my name; honestly, I was quite touched, thinking you wanted me to give it my all with you, or maybe my name gave you strength, haha.\"\nLin Li remained silent, only smiling.\nWang Ze could no longer laugh; he grabbed Lin Li’s shoulders, sincerely and hopefully asking:\n\"Bro, you’ll bring me breakfast tomorrow, right?\"\nLin Li, with a face that said ’What am I going to do with you?’, shook his head, smiled at Wang Ze, and said:\n\"You want three hard-to-fulfill wishes, Wang Tongxue? So greedy, what do you think I am, a genie in a lamp?\"\nWang Ze: \"?\"",

Isn’t that three wishes?\nLin Li saying you’re greedy is spot on. You really are like a Kinder Surprise Egg, wishing for all three things at once.\"\nBai Bufan analyzed it thoroughly.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nDamn.\nThat’s how the three wishes work?\nI’ll battle it out with you guys, masters of linguistic arts.\nLooking at Lin Li’s smile, Wang Ze felt like although he was in school, he was getting further from academic halls and closer to the chaotic ones.\n\"Wang Ze, I think Lin Li mainly feels that asymmetry is not visually pleasing. Trust me, if you step on a pattern here too, he’ll be happy immediately.\" Bai Bufan enjoyed the commotion, thinking that without someone dying for fun, it wouldn’t be right.\nWang Ze swung an imaginary punch at Bai Bufan, squatted down, wiped Lin Li’s shoe with his palm, and looked up at Lin Li with innocent eyes.\n\"These are new shoes.\" Lin Li’s voice was cold.\nWang Ze: \"Where’s the old pair? Where’d you recycle them?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nContinuing with a nuclear-friendly smile, Lin Li began pressing his finger joints, making crackling sounds: \"Wang Ze, whenever I see you, I feel a strange anger.\"\nWithout being able to continue flattering, Bai Bufan’s voice came over:\n\"In the stomach?\"\nLin Li, Wang Ze: \"?\"\n\"It’s okay, I understand you, Lin Li. Before, I used to spend money recklessly without budgeting, but ever since I saw Wang Ze, I’ve automatically started keeping track of my expenses daily. So it’s normal to feel a strange anger. It’s a sign of having life.\"\nBai Bufan was delighted to find a like-minded friend and patted Lin Li on the shoulder.\n\"Let’s release this strange anger together, not now, another day.\"\nLin Li, Wang Ze: \"?\"\n\"You’re also an inverse earth star!\" Wang Ze stared wide-eyed and covered his butt.\nOnly others used to fear being bent by him; now there were experts.\nClass 4-1 was completely ruined.\nBut Wang Ze actually still appreciated Bai Bufan because if it weren’t for him, Lin Li’s strange anger would remain focused on him.\n—Now it’s vented on him instead.\n\"Beep—!!\"\nThe five-minute break quickly passed, and the referee blew the whistle, signaling the start of the second round.\n\"Wait a sec, let me grab some powder. My hands are all clean, weird.\" The trio paused their antics as Wang Ze looked at his restored skin tone hands and wondered.\nLin Li glanced at his front and back, shoulders covered with a terribly white school uniform, and chuckled.\nThe second round victory came even faster than the first, given the obvious paper strength—it wasn’t like rallying the troops would flip the odds.\nA small win was still a win, and while the guys celebrated, Chen Yu Ying snapped photos from the side.\n\"Class rep, how did the photos turn out?\" Lin Li naturally extended his hand to inquire.\n\"I took a lot. Want to take a look?\" Chen Yu Ying nodded and handed the camera hanging around her neck to Lin Li.\n\"I want to see them too! Let me have a peek!\" A few guys nearby gathered around.\nOpening the camera album, Lin Li began browsing the photos.\nWang Ze and Bai Bufan, who crowded around, gradually fell silent.\nApart from the celebration photos just taken, most of the earlier photos were from the tug-of-war competition.\nAs a result, the rope stood taut, classmates’ faces distorted with bulging veins: front row Chen Tianming and Zhuo Yongfei gritted their teeth, faces flushing red; middle row girls Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu had messy hair, twisted expressions; the rear, carrier Zhou Baowei grimaced horribly as if exerting all his strength.\nBut this certainly wasn’t Chen Yu Ying’s fault; after all, tug-of-war, it’s normal for such heroic scenes to be recorded that way.\nHowever.\nHowever!\nThere was a beast standing in the middle, holding the rope with both hands but seemingly effortless, with hair perfectly neat, a confident smile, and even sometimes, during camera moments, winks!\nBeast, beast indeed.\nIn the captured moments, besides this beast, everyone else exerted all their strength, while the beast seemed more like he was just enjoying it.\nThus, the resulting arrangement for Class 4’s tug-of-war lineup was displayed as \"hideous monstrous pig muck, budget-conscious handsome Lin Li, hideous ugly athletic muck, hideous noble dog muck.\"\nUpon noticing everyone’s gaze directed at him, Lin Li blinked innocently: \"What’s the matter? I’m just naturally photogenic. Why those expressions?\"\n\"You only care about looking good, aren’t even exerting effort, huh!\"\n\"Red Stone! Lin Li, this is like we’re fighting on the front lines while you handle logistics and entertain our partners at the rear!\"\n\"Red! Let Lin Li strip! I’m ready to pull! Already holding back!\"\nLin Li’s exclusive handsomeness evidently stirred public anger, causing the crowd’s gaze to grow increasingly dangerous.\nEveryone seemed to have a strange anger in their stomachs.\n\"Don’t passive-aggressively criticize me. Although I’m pretty photogenic, I did use my strength properly; I didn’t drag everyone down,\" Lin Li emphasized hastily.",

Let go!\"\nLin Li realized belatedly.\nThis group didn’t care at all how many bowls of noodles he ate, they just purely wanted him dead.\nProving oneself was undoubtedly a trap, but these guys were pretty nice, didn’t even plan for him to self-prove.\n...\n\"Hey hey!\" Bai Bufan, holding a camera, wiggled his eyebrows at Lin Li, who was lying on the ground after some ’interaction’ with the basketball hoop, and Zhou Baowei beside him, motioning them to come over.\n\"What’s up?\" Lin Li, covered head to toe in anti-slid powder, walked over, confused.\n\"I just discovered something interesting,\" Bai Bufan, after ensuring no one’s eavesdropping, whispered to the two, \"according to my precise calculation, the class monitor took a total of fifty-two photos, of which thirty-nine featured Lin Li, and twenty-six featured Zhou Baowei, do you know what this means?\"\nZhou Baowei asked, \"What does it mean?\"\n\"Bao Wei, it means that the class monitor has you in her heart, always subconsciously taking photos of you! She must have some feelings for you!\" Bai Bufan congratulated Zhou Baowei first, then disdainfully looked at Lin Li, \"As for you, Lin Li, it means your damn face is too big, no matter how it’s photographed, it always gets in the frame! It’s such bad luck.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nLin Li: \"!\"\n\"No!!!\" Lin Li was indeed hurt by Bai Bufan’s words, he painfully knelt on the ground, wailing his heart out, pounding the basketball court with his fists:\n\"Damn it, damn it, why do I have such a big face, why do I insult those photos like this, I’d be better off dead, aaahh!!\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nFists hardened, knuckles stiffened.\nThese two beasts further honed their beastly traits.\nBai Bufan didn’t mistake the name; he deliberately nauseated others!\nInsult with oblique words, point at a deer and call it a horse, pointing at Zhou but meaning Lin!\nAnd Lin Li immediately connected, when he said ’better off dead’ did he mean himself, even need to say it?\nZhou Baowei squatted down, sure enough, Lin Li was crying hysterically, as if laughing maniacally.\nZhou Baowei couldn’t believe it, if after class sorting he was still in the same class with these two, after three years, would there be anyone in society who could still hurt him?\nIntolerable, there was no need to tolerate anymore!\n\"Mount! Tai! Meteorite! Drop!\"\nZhou Baowei made a big jump, sitting on the back of kneeling Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li passed, aged seventeen.\nSeeing Lin Li became speechless as his supporting arms started to tremble, Bai Bufan took two steps back in fear, and clicked his tongue:\n\"Damn, found something more pressuring than Bao Wei’s shoes.\"\nLin Li struggled to lift his head, Bao Wei’s weight reminded him of another authentic big fat pig, mnemonic linkage activated, he stuttered:\n\"Bufan, do you think if a general raises his butt, would that be... temple?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"If that’s a temple, then temple is also a temple eye, then how do you do the fourth exercise of the general’s eye-protection drill, press temple and rub eye socket?\"\nIn Lin Li’s eyes, there was no loyalty, only the thirst for knowledge.\nZhou Baowei, Bai Bufan: \"?\"\nShhh, let us think.\nWho the hell taught you to define a temple like that?\nThough it seems not entirely unreasonable.\n\"Lin Li, congrats, just got word, the general really likes your speech and invites you to tour Pyongyang, free of charge! And also wants to award you an international honor, but it must be collected in person.\"\nBai Bufan gave a thumbs up.\nDare to raise a temple, Lin Li is the one for this.\n\"Lin Li, Bao Wei, come over, this class could be a formidable opponent.\"\nThe three turned towards the voice, it was Wang Ze, who was watching other class competitions from the crowd, his expression slightly solemn at this moment.\nLooks like he was scouting the enemy.\n\"Be there.\" Bai Bufan ran over.\n\"Be there.\" Zhou Baowei patted the mule under his butt.\nLin Li was left speechless.\nWhen Lin Li reached Wang Ze’s side, he understood what Wang Ze implied by challenging.\nThis class had at least three Zhou Baoweis.\nOne of those Zhou Baoweis, even with Zhou Baowei beside, wasn’t Baowei enough, slightly showing a tender demeanor.\nAfter watching a match, this class won too easily, with just a whistle, the rope steadily moved towards their class.\nAlso won with a 2 to 0 sweep, the opposing side didn’t even struggle.\n\"Which class is this?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"Class Nine.\" Wang Ze sighed, \"One of the guys is specialized in shot put, I know him, but didn’t expect there’re a few Baoweis in his class too, who the hell could beat them?\nAnd they seemed to have no weaklings, even if we start Plan B, it might be to no avail.\"\n\"I have Plan C.\" In four there must be 1.333 idea kings, Bai Bufan pushed his non-existent glasses, lowered his voice: \"But it requires us few brothers to collaborate.\"\n\"How?\" Three looked at him.\n\"First, someone needs to have time,\" Bai Bufan looked at Zhou Baowei, \"Bao Wei, you have time?\"\n\"Yeah, I don’t have much going now, nothing keeping me busy lately.\" Zhou Baowei nodded, he’s indeed quite free.\n\"Then perfect, here’s the thing guys, I’ll get some cyanide, Lin Li you destroy the school’s surveillance system, Wang Ze you find out their daily habits, figure out the best time to poison, Bao Wei you prepare what to say when turning yourself in.\" Bai Bufan clearly articulated, issuing tactical orders.",

What the hell did you just ask me about my time?!\" he suddenly realized.\n\"Don’t worry, don’t worry. Even though poisoning four people gets you life at sixteen, with good behavior, you can definitely get it reduced to a fixed term and then parole. So, it only takes thirty years, maybe even less. See you then, Bao Wei,\" Bai Bufan explained.\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\n\"Damn! I don’t have time for that! I don’t have time!\"\n\"This is a great opportunity for you to avoid thirty years of hard work, Bao Wei. Don’t be ungrateful,\" Lin Li frowned and advised, \"Besides, you’re unwilling to kill a few people for the class, that’s a bit selfish.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Who the hell are you to call it avoiding thirty years of hard work? And who the hell are you to define selfishness like that?\"\n\"It’s just true, haven’t you heard this saying? College is easy for four years, hard for forty years after graduation. But if you’re struggling in college for four years, you’d be struggling for forty-four years in total,\" Lin Li shrugged and analyzed.\n\"How to reduce the struggle in life, besides finding a rich woman, is meeting King Yama.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nHe couldn’t refute them.\nHe wasn’t good with words, so he couldn’t outtalk Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\nBut he knew other ways.\n\"Tai! Mountain! Meteorite! Crash!\"\nLin Li: \"Wait! I just revived, new character, don’t do—\"\nBefore he finished speaking, Lin Li died again, aged seventeen.\n...\nBecause no one was willing to spend that time, the idea man’s idea failed.\nHad to react to events as they came.\nThe other classes didn’t seem to have particularly strong opponents.\nAfter tug of war ended, Wang Ze went to train, Bao Wei needed to return to the dorm first, Lin Li and Bai Bufan headed to the cafeteria for dinner.\nBai Bufan elbowed Lin Li and asked, \"Getting back to the point, are you really throwing a live gun party this weekend?\"\n\"Yes.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"So, did you really strike it rich?\" Bai Bufan frowned.\n\"Sort of.\"\n\"How did you make it?\"\n\"Last night when I got home exhausted, my mom suddenly called me and told me our family actually has thirty million in assets, and the past seventeen years were just for my training. Now the seventeen-year period is over, and they welcome the rich second generation back,\" Lin Li nodded.\nBai Bufan didn’t take it seriously, laughed and said, \"Haha, I’ve also fantasized like that and even went to probe my mom. But she said she’s still waiting for my grandma’s call. Once my grandma calls her, she’ll contact me.\"\n\"Haha.\" Lin Li nodded.\nThe little joke quickly faded, and the two continued walking towards the cafeteria, no further conversation,\nsilence.\nsilence.\nsi—\n\"You damn well better deny it to me too! Tell me you were joking just now! Lin Li! Hurry up, say it’s not true, you’re joking, then I’ll laugh heartily, pat you on the shoulder, and say, Lin Li, wow, you’re so humorous, this gag is new and good! Then we can continue cracking poor jokes and cursing this damn world!\"\nThe silence quickly faded, Bai Bufan grabbed Lin Li’s collar, pressed his forehead against Lin Li’s forehead, veins visible, he roared.\nThe other students around were startled.\nLin Li just stared at Bai Bufan.\nSmiling was Lin Li’s protective color.\n\"This isn’t real! Right! This isn’t real!\"\n\"You can’t really encounter this thing, right? You can’t betray your class, right? Lin Li, I can’t accept it!\"\nLin Li didn’t think this scene was funny; he only saw a hopeless Bai Bufan.\nOne... who saw a brother driving a Land Rover after all, a hopeless Bai Bufan.\n\"You can’t really have thirty million!\" Cold violence is truly terrifying, and Lin Li remained silent, Bai Bufan stuttered, giving a final dying struggle.\n\"Alright, alright, I was just kidding.\" Lin Li finally couldn’t bear seeing Bai Bufan like that and spoke helplessly.\n\"Exactly, it should be like this, scared me to death, almost truly believed you became a rich second generation. Really, I’m feeling sorry for you.\" Bai Bufan wiped the imaginary sweat off his forehead, looking both relieved and regretful.\n\"Just one million eight hundred thousand.\" Lin Li finished.\nBai Bufan’s hand froze at his forehead while still wiping sweat.\nAfter great joy and sorrow, emotions were hard to stir anymore. Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li with difficulty, seeking a real answer.\nLin Li patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder, \"In one’s life, there are always many unexpected events.\"\nBai Bufan shook his head, \"But I hate surprises.\"\n\"I mean unexpected wealth.\"\n\"Come to think of it, sometimes I quite like surprises.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\n\"I wasn’t talking about you; I was talking about myself,\" Lin Li smiled.\n\"I hate surprises, all surprises.\" The chameleon lesson really needs to take some tips from Bai Bufan.\n\"Specifically, it indeed involves my family a bit, not easy to say. Just think of it as I won ten million yuan lottery yesterday, and got a considerable amount of wealth that I can spend freely, no big deal if I spend more,\" Lin Li patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder and said.\nAfter thinking, it seems not quite right to mention becoming a rich second generation, let’s settle it in this way.\nBai Bufan no longer had the energy to mock, he reached for Lin Li’s pocket and took out the meal card: \"Five dishes and a soup, don’t refill the rice.\"\nLin Li: \"Mm.\"\nBai Bufan became more desperate.\nDamn, Lin Li is really playing.\nThe sunny October day is so cold, Bai Bufan really wanted to put his hand in someone else’s wallet to warm it up.",

Brothers are always the most important; you’re always my number one choice.\" Lin Li waved his hand, saying firmly.\n\"Haha.\" Bai Bufan couldn’t be bothered to display any emotion.\nBai Bufan will never forget, Bao Wei and his \"corpse without organs that was used for a ghost marriage to bring good fortune.\"\n\"You don’t believe your pal,\" Lin Li, questioned, got angry, \"Let me put it this way, if I’m in a toilet with no paper, and I have only your photo and a cheque for 1.8 million, I’ll choose you without hesitation.\nThat’s because you’re always my first choice.\"\nLin Li spoke emotionally, his voice sincere.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nYou’re his number one choice in that situation!?\nThat’s definitely chosen without hesitation.\nBai Bufan believes him.\nBecause if it were him in that situation, he’d also choose Lin Li first; rounding it up, that’s a mutual journey.\n\"Why didn’t you say your longing for me is turning yellow?\" Bai Bufan sneered.\n\"Eh? Could work, your version is more artsy, Korean-style, next time I’ll say this to Bao Wei.\" Lin Li, hearing this, compared and pondered for a bit, then gave a thumbs-up.\nThen, Lin Li suddenly fell into philosophical contemplation: \"But, Bufan, sometimes using your photo to wipe ten times and still can’t get it clean, I start to wonder, is mankind actually like a crayon? Never truly clean?\"\nBai Bufan almost spat out his drink.\n\"Could you first detach my photo from the scenario, and I’m eating curry chicken, don’t say such messed-up things!\"\n\"If you weren’t eating this, I wouldn’t say it, you know, when I first encountered this color and texture.\"\n\"Damn! So you’re pure sword!\"\nAfter eating, on the way back to the classroom.\n\"At least we’re doing well now; others worry about how to make money, while we’re worried about how to spend it.\" Bai Bufan quickly adjusts his mood, speaking cheerfully.\n\"What does that have to do with you?\" At this point, Lin Li must execute justice.\n\"I’m the same, how to make two hundred last till next month.\" Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li, his expression slightly sorrowful: \"Isn’t this considered ’worrying about how to spend money’?\"\n\"I understand now.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"By the way, Lin Li, how about buying my life?\" Bai Bufan asked hopefully:\n\"Ahem, born overseas (outside Shanghai), only lived nearly sixteen years, without much wear and tear. My brain hasn’t been used much, smooth, without scratches or damage, the body hasn’t been used much, typically stays indoors.\nPersonality is rare and high-priced, a little sickly feeling, though slightly flawed, mainly just a bit ill now.\nHas the admirable trait of working tirelessly to achieve goals, however, this can’t be paid in one go, needs installments, hence delivered in four phases: exhausted, rest; forget, eat.\nMoreover, there’s considerable appreciation potential, as I’m a ’moonlight clan,’ buying me and painting white turns me into a ’white moonlight,’ able to be unforgettable to many.\"\nBai Bufan finished his pitch, looking at Lin Li expectantly.\n\"Those things I don’t care much about.\" Lin Li shook his head, appearing to truly consider the idea of buying Bai Bufan’s life: \"Buying you could be feasible, but I need to confirm some other conditions.\"\n\"Which ones?\"\n\"Do you shed hair?\" Lin Li inquired.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Do you have fixed toilet times? Oh, you should, witnessed during National Day, then let’s change the question, do you bite people? Can you resist the urge to eat feces? Can you—\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYou jerk.\n\"You’re right, I do bite people!\" Bai Bufan, quickly retorts defensively.\nAfter some playful bantering, Lin Li asks:\n\"So are you definitely going or not?\"\n\"If you truly have money and aren’t bluffing like Bao Wei, then I’m definitely going along, why miss a free opportunity.\" Bai Bufan nodded, then asked, \"So it’s just us two, the ’one dog’ combo?\"\nLast time’s National Day accommodation was covered by the class monitor; if you’re hosting this time, it’s better to ask her too.\"\n\"I haven’t asked the ’third person’ yet, I feel even if I host, they might not be interested in traveling far for a day just to shoot guns, but I’ll ask them at lunchtime tomorrow.\" Lin Li nodded.\n...\n\"So, go experience live ammunition shooting this weekend?\"\nThe next day at noon, upon hearing Lin Li’s idea, Chen Yu Ying seemed slightly surprised.\n\"Yeah, class monitor, interested?\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Why suddenly have this idea?\"\n\"No guy can refuse guns, just like no guy can refuse white stockings and black stockings.\"\n\"That’s specifically you, right.\" Hearing Lin Li relate to this topic, Chen Yu Ying helplessly rubbed her forehead, then expressed concern:\n\"Interest is fine, but are you really hosting? That should cost a lot, right?\"\n\"Class monitor, you know me, I never force myself, let alone for face value. Don’t worry, I can only say, for this experience alone, including you all with me, expenses are trivial for me.\nSo you all don’t need any mental burden, just go and enjoy, shoot however you want.\"",

He has an absolutely unlosable reason!\n\"I’ve had this mindset for a long time.\" With these thoughts, Chen Tianming nodded.\n...\nBasketball court.\nAfter class ended in the afternoon, everyone from Class 4 gathered here.\nClass 9 arrived bit by bit.\nWhen the two Zhou Baoweis, along with a Zhou Baowei Plus, walked toward the tug-of-war rope, there was a strong tremor across the basketball court.\nEven Lin Li didn’t absorb powder this time; he started applying anti-slip powder and warming up meticulously.\nLin Li’s own strength is undoubtedly greater than anyone on the other side, even Bao Wei Plus isn’t much in comparison.\nBut from a collective aspect, even Lin Li isn’t fully confident of winning.\n\"Both sides ready, take your positions.\" The referee drew the lines again, held the middle red line, and spoke to the two classes.\n\"Chen Tianming, why are you wearing a mask.\"\nWith Chen Tianming at the forefront of the tug-of-war team, Zhuo Yongfei took his position and noticed the masked Chen Tianming behind him, asking curiously.\nChen Tianming didn’t respond, only continuing to apply powder to his hands.\nZhuo Yongfei raised an eyebrow, thinking Chen Tianming didn’t want to talk to him and didn’t insist, adjusting his posture.\n\"Zhuo Yongfei, no matter what happens, look ahead and don’t turn back.\" Chen Tianming’s voice echoed softly.\nZhuo Yongfei turned his head instinctively, but Chen Tianming stopped him with a hand: \"Don’t turn back!\"\n\"Listen to me, look forward, use your strength, don’t rest, and don’t turn back.\"\nZhuo Yongfei: \"?\"\nAre you trying to be \"The Fatty\" from \"Grave Robbers Chronicles\" here?\n\"All prepare!\" The referee said, already placing the whistle into his mouth.\nThen Zhuo Yongfei heard Chen Tianming roar from behind: \"Nansang Grade One Class Nine! Sixteen weaklings! Who dares face me! Fire at me! Fire at me!\"\n\"Damn!\"\nThe lead soldier from Class 9 almost stumbled, the referee who was ready to blow the whistle pulled his collar to cover his nose and lower face, turning around, his body shaking.\nThe audience erupted in a huge wave of noise, the Class 9 team’s movement was visibly shaky, a few girls bit their lips desperately, their shoulders shaking like sieves.\nWhen all the attention was directed at the side, who the hell can resist looking?\nChen Tianming, what the heck did you do!\nZhuo Yongfei decided to turn his head.\nDamn, it’s the Great Qing’s second assassin!\nKnowledge consolidation: Great Qing’s first assassin is Lin Li with makeup on the field trip bus.\nMom, this makeup was done by Lin Li, wasn’t it?\nDamn, if you’re painting sausage lips, just paint sausage lips, inserting scallions into nostrils, what’s that all about?",

Zhuo Yongfei! Don’t forget your responsibility!\" Chen Tianming shouted sternly.\n\"Sorry!\" Zhuo Yongfei admitted his mistake and turned back around.\n\"Referee! Start the match! Start the match!\" Class Nine had already lost their morale; now was the perfect opportunity to press the attack. Bai Bufan, Lin Li, and others saw their plan working and yelled from behind.\nAfter all, the longer Class Nine stared at Chen Tianming’s face, the more desensitized they would become. Timing was crucial.\nChen Tianming felt the gazes around him, maintaining calmness and aloofness.\nThe ups and downs don’t faze me; all’s still on me.\nIt’s true, by behaving this way, I might lose all chances of dating at Nansang Middle School today.\nBut since when would I care about that?\nAmong all the beauties, I only spice things up with Qiaoqiao, slurping and licking!!\nAs the prominent face of Class Four in tug-of-war, Chen Tianming had already prepared to sacrifice himself!\nAs long as I get to meet Qiaoqiao, I’m willing to burn everything for her.\nMoreover, Class Seventeen is competing too, and Yao Qiaoqiao is one of the participants; she won’t see this.\nAs for later... History is written by the victors.\n\"Teacher! Please start the match!\" Hence, Chen Tianming calmly followed and urged the referee, \"Stop dragging it on!\"\n\"I didn’t drag!\" The referee, who was laughing, suddenly turned around to refute, \"I was just laughing!\"\nChen Tianming: \"?\"\nWait a second.\nYou damn.\n\"If you didn’t drag, then let’s start, teacher!\" Chen Tianming said with a cold face.\n\"Oh haha, okay, Class Nine, quickly reorganize!\" The referee, not feeling offended by the student’s tone, managed to suppress laughter and nodded, whistling towards Class Nine as a signal.\nClass Nine immediately adjusted their stance, but some couldn’t hold back laughter again after glancing at Chen Tianming, especially since he was still dead-serious.\nWhat a wicked plan Class Four had!\nThey finally realized.\n\"Ready—\"\n\"Today I will use the bathroom on my own, Dad and Mom, don’t underestimate me—\"\nChen Tianming’s haunting tune floated towards Class Nine at this moment.\nA person with a funny painted face sang a nursery rhyme in a completely serious tone.\nThe difficulty of holding back laughter in this situation can’t be understood by outsiders.\nZhuo Yongfei’s lips were bloodless from biting too hard.\nDamn lips, don’t laugh supplement!\nWhy didn’t I listen to Chen Tianming, why did I turn around!\n\"Beeep—\" The referee picked up the whistle that had fallen on his neck due to laughter, put it back in his mouth, and blew hard!\n[Charge], go!\nThis time Lin Li held nothing back, giving it his all from the get-go.\n\"Go Class Four! Go Class Four!\"\n\"One—Two—Pull!!! One—Two—Pull!!!\"\nThe moment the whistle sounded, the red rope jolted towards Class Four. When Class Nine started exerting force, they found they couldn’t stem the downward spiral, the red rope wobbling and moving towards Class Four!\n\"Beeep—\"\n\"Class Four wins! Second round starts in five minutes!\"\nThe referee announced the result.\n\"We’re champions again! We’re champions again!\" This time Wang Ze, who hadn’t stepped on Lin Li’s shoes, excitedly turned around and hugged Lin Li.\n\"Turns out Class Nine isn’t as strong as I imagined; I didn’t even exert as much force as yesterday.\" Bai Bufan said smugly.\n\"I’m gonna go mock Yu Cheng.\"\nWang Ze trotted over to the opposing shot put athlete to mock him, pointing with a thumbs-down.\nSmart move indeed, teasing from a distance, knowing stepping closer wasn’t wise.\nSecond-class contributor Lin Li merely smiled without a word, concealing his achievements.\nThe combined force of Wang Ze and Bai Bufan wasn’t greater than his.\nAs for the first-class contributor—\nLin Li, Bai Bufan, and Zhou Baowei exchanged glances, nodded, and shouted towards the front:\n\"Brother Tianming, strengthen our Class Four!\"\n\"Brother Tianming, strengthen our Class Four!\"\nFacing the request from his classmates, Chen Tianming only left them with a back brimming with stories, but his right fist slowly raised high, symbolizing victory!\nRepresenting that he heard everyone’s voices!\nThe tug-of-war players of Class Nine were indeed struggling to hold back now.\nWhat kind of class is Class Four? Seems like a lot of fun.\n\"Referee, this... haha, damn cheating, right?\"\n\"Isn’t this a bit unfair, feels like we’re being disrupted.\"\nA few students who took tug-of-war seriously started protesting to the referee.\n\"Is this considered interference? Ugly people have no rights? Brother Tianming was born looking like this! An original face, never had surgery! Haters, stop being bitter!\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s fans came to defend upon smelling the situation.\n\"Did your mom give birth to you with two scallions in your nose?\"\n\"Genetic mutation, umbilical cord turned into scallions, why not?\"\n\"Alright, reasonable.\"\nChen Tianming: \"...\"\nYou’ve defended well, please don’t defend next time.\nThe referee smiled and shook his head at the protesting students from Class Nine: \"Not considered cheating; interference would be verbal abuse or physical contact, but this kind of self-painting doesn’t count.\"\nThe most important thing for a fun event is fun, there’s not much prize for winning, just a few points.\nSo, who said this makeup isn’t good? It’s fantastic.\nUpon hearing this, Class Nine didn’t contest further, admitting Class Four indeed pulled off a great stunt.",

Wait?\"\n\"Five minutes left! Who brought something to make us look ugly?! Quick! We need to use the foreigner’s skills to conquer them!\"\n\"I have a red pen here!\"\n\"I have a hair tie here!\"\n\"I have socks here!\"\n\"I even have two cigarette butts here!\"\n\"And I have some spit here!\"\n\"What the hell, who the f*ck used a cigarette butt to burn my ass?\"\n\"Did you say thank you?\"\n——The last few lines were all shouted by Lin Li and Bai Bufan as they blended in.\nClass Nine began to torment their classmates.\nAnd after Bai Bufan and Lin Li were driven away, the two went back to look after their brother, with Bai Bufan massaging Chen Tianming’s shoulders and Lin Li touching up his makeup.\n\"Monitor, sorry, but our brother doesn’t want any photos taken.\" Upon seeing Chen Yu Ying sneaking closer with her camera, Lin Li immediately stepped forward to drive her away, blocking the camera lens.\n\"Just one photo, please,\" Chen Yu Ying prayed with her hands folded.\n\"I said no, you can’t.\" Lin Li’s tone remained firm, but his fingers blocking the camera quietly opened up a crack, just enough for the lens to peek through.\n\"Click.\"\nChen Tianming: \"?\"\nThe cinema’s hired bodyguards? What kind of crappy professionalism is this?\n\"Chen Tianming, thank you for your sacrifice. Pfft, without you, we might have lost.\" After taking the photo, Chen Yu Ying smiled as she spoke to Chen Tianming.\nChen Tianming felt a bit embarrassed, scratching the back of his head, just about to return the politeness, when Bai Bufan firmly pressed his head back: \"How many times have I told you, don’t point the gun at your own people.\"\nChen Tianming: \"...\"\nYou motherf*cker.\nBeside them, Wang Yuezhi’s eyes widened.\nSo, this is all it takes to be praised?\nAnd even be praised with a smile?\nIsn’t this my forte?\nWang Yuezhi’s eyes lit up, checking the time, realizing there were still a few minutes before the next round, he had time.\nHe dashed towards the dormitory.\nHearing Chen Yu Ying say that, it wasn’t just Wang Yuezhi who reacted, but also his midday good buddy Lin Li.\n\"Without me, the class would lose too, Monitor, won’t you give me some credit?\" It’s not that we lack but rather fear the imbalance, Lin Li wasn’t pleased.\n\"Alright, alright~ You also did a great job.\" Chen Yu Ying smiled, coming forward to placate the childish Lin Li.\n...\nThe five minutes quickly passed, and the second round was about to begin.\nThe lead boy of Class Nine, now with a face full of messy marker drawings, his hair in a heap (literally), and two cigarette butts found on the ground hanging by his ears, stood lifelessly at the very front.\nHowever, this level of attack was a mere joke to Class Four.\nLin Li, the number one killer from the Great Qing, stood at the front, with Chen Tianming, the number two killer from the Great Qing, at the back, their hearts had long turned icy cold.\nBesides, Lin Li and Bai Bufan have lived like jokes before everyone’s eyes for so long, their humor threshold wasn’t that low anymore.\nNonetheless, Class Nine underwent desensitization training in five minutes, forcing themselves to stare at Chen Tianming, so his lethality was significantly reduced.\nWhose deer will it be? We still don’t know.\n\"Both sides ready.\" The referee enjoyed seeing this kind of scenario, signaling for the game to start amid laughter.\nBoth sides stood firm, squatted down, and gripped the rope.\n\"Hold on!\"\nThe crowd parted, and Lin Li’s peripheral vision caught a hint of red approaching.\no.o, O.O?!\nA figure wearing a colorful wig walked to the center between the two opposing teams at this time.\nHe first pinched his red nose, then spread his arms wide: \"I am... a clown, I’m... a joker!\"\nSome people, just standing there doing nothing, they make you feel both ridiculous and terrifying.\nClass Nine: \"?\"\nNo way, another master?\nWas this the hidden card Class Four saved to weaken Chen Tianming’s attack after the second round?\nClass Four’s strategy was overly meticulous.\nMoreover, this guy’s portrayal... had an innate feeling... incomprehensible, unimaginable... truly a pillars of clown power...\nClass Nine began to grit their teeth and take deep breaths, most even choosing to close their eyes.\nIf they watched any longer, they’d really explode.\nHowever, Wang Yuezhi forgot to turn off friendly fire.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, what the f*ck hahahaha! Where did you get that hair, damn?\" Lin Li was the first to lose it.\nWhy in the world would you manifest your soul avatar for no reason?!\n\"Ignore me!\" Wang Yuezhi turned his head, coldly barked: \"I’ll make them laugh, and you guys, just use your strength! Let’s... win this victory together! Don’t drag me down!\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWhat a passionate, raging speech! Fired up!\nMasseter muscle! Zygomatic muscle! Laughter muscle! Everyone, ignite it for me——\n\"Hahahahahahahaha!! Damn!\"\n\"The problem is, with you like this, we want to laugh too!!\" Wang Ze was utterly floored.\n\"I can’t stand it either!\" Bai Bufan followed suit.\nUnusually, the referee, Class Four, and Class Nine all collectively collapsed, and the once-tense tug-of-war rope fell limp.\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\n\"But I was just facing away from you guys! This makes you want to laugh too?\" He was baffled.\n\"Yes, we do.\"\nEveryone nodded in unison and then burst out laughing.\nWang Yuezhi: \"...\"\nThis useless bunch from Class Four, dragging him down.\n\"Monitor, sorry, to disappoint you.\" Helpless, Wang Yuezhi had no choice but to leave the stage disheartened, saying to Chen Yu Ying as he passed her.\nChen Yu Ying holding the camera: \"Eh?\"\nHuh? Sorry for what? Disappointed for what?\nIt was quite funny.\n\"No-no problem, you looked pretty funny, and many from Class Nine couldn’t take it.\" Chen Yu Ying politely said, \"Want... to take a photo?\"",

Long live Class 4!\"\nOn Thursday, the first-year tug-of-war competition officially ended, and with Class 9, the top rival, eliminated early, Class 4, boasting the hidden ace Bao Wei Lin Li, easily ascended the throne.\nThe finals were best of five, but it was still a 3 to 0 victory.\nClass 4 celebrated again and again.\nThe sorrows and joys of people are not connected.\nOf course, it’s not the nearby classes that are sad.\nBeside the basketball court.\nPrincipal Wang was silent.\n\"Teacher Zhou, can you tell me why the tug-of-war competition became like this?\" He hesitated for a long time before finally speaking up.\nPrincipal Wang, having heard that today was the first-year tug-of-war finals, came specially to watch.\nThen he discovered that out of the 33 people on both sides, seven had strange makeup, nine had messy hairstyles, and four were wearing bizarre costumes.\nAt this point, he was dumbfounded.\nWhat’s going on here?\nIs this still a tug-of-war competition, or is it a ’try not to laugh’ challenge?\nIs my school now mass-producing top YouTubers?\n\"Principal, that’s a good question, but I think you should ask Teacher Xue,\" referee Teacher Zhou said, shifting his gaze towards Class 4’s homeroom teacher.\nSo Principal Wang also looked at Xue Jian.\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nWhy are you looking at me?\nXue Jian didn’t meet Principal Wang’s gaze but looked towards his class, more precisely, at Lin Li and Bai Bufan, who were being tossed up and down:\n\"Principal, that’s a good question, but I think you should ask Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\"\n\"Do you need me to call them over?\"\nPrincipal Wang: \"...\"\nDamn, it’s those two misbehaving students again.\nBut for some reason, it seems fitting.\n\"If it’s those two, forget it.\" Principal Wang shook his head; he really didn’t want to engage in a conversation with the Anti-Pornography Vanguard and the Anti-Pornography Vanguard Dog.\nBut there was one more thing he had to ask Xue Jian.\n\"Doing it this way is pretty good; everyone is happy, and losing isn’t a big deal. It achieves the goal of our fun project from another angle, but——\"\n\"Teacher Xue, did you specifically hire a clown to make the opposing students laugh for this tug-of-war competition? Such a big investment?\"\nPrincipal Wang pointed to the clown in a polka-dot jumpsuit, wearing gloves, a wig, and a red nose on the basketball court, and asked in confusion.\nWhy did I say there are 33 people on both teams?\nIt’s because there were 16 on each side for the tug-of-war, and Class 4 even had a clown performing on the side, hiring a ringer.\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nXue Jian looked at Wang Yuezhi.\nFor this quiet and dependable good student—at least he once was—Xue Jian took a deep breath, then looked up at the sky and said rather poetically:\n\"He’s not hired; he’s also my student.\"\nPrincipal Wang: \"?\"\nIs Class 4 a place for some legendary gathering of talents? Once-in-a-century talents all gathered here at one time and place?\n\"Has he trained in acrobatics? Does someone run a circus in his family?\"\n\"I don’t know, probably not,\" Xue Jian shook his head.\n\"Then... how come this kid is so skilled at playing a clown? Others act like it isn’t convincing, but he doesn’t look like he’s acting.\"\nOnce again, Xue Jian didn’t meet Principal Wang’s gaze but looked at his own class, at Lin Li and Bai Bufan, who were still being tossed up and down:\n\"Principal, that’s a good question, but I think you should ask Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\"\n\"Do you need me to call them over?\"\nPrincipal Wang: \"...\"\nDid I fall under an illusion spell? Why does this scene and conversation seem familiar?\nNo, it’s not an illusion! Damn, why is it related to them again?\n\"Let’s still forget it.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nSilence.\nSilence.\nIn the end, Principal Wang couldn’t help but speak: \"Teacher Xue.\"\n\"What’s up, Principal.\"\n\"During the sports meet, keep a close eye on those two kids.\"\n\"... I will.\"\n...\n\"Ah-choo!\"\nNearby, Bai Bufan, who just landed, suddenly sneezed.\nDamn, who is talking behind my back?",

While waiting at the red light, he contacted Bai Bufan on his phone.\n\"Lin Li: I’m almost at the school gate. Are you up yet? Get ready to come out.\"\n——The two had agreed to meet and go to Nansang Railway Station together.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan also confirmed they would join the live ammunition experience, but they would be dropped off directly at the station by their families, so they’d see each other at the train station, not at school.\n\"Bai Bufan: OK.\"\nHalf an hour later.\n\"Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!\"\n\"Come on, Bai Bufan, tell your family, what the hell is your ’OK’?\"\nAfter waiting for twenty minutes without seeing anyone or getting a response, Lin Li furiously banged on Bai Bufan’s dorm door.\nThe dorm door was opened, and though Bai Bufan was fully dressed, his hair was still messy. Facing the furious Lin Li, he could only apologize and say:\n\"This time there’s really a reason, my eyes seemed to have a problem.\"\n\"What happened?\" Lin Li frowned upon hearing this.\n\"It’s nothing, it’s fine now. I managed to open them. Man, when I couldn’t open them this morning, it scared me to death. It was really thrilling,\" Bai Bufan said with a face full of lingering fear.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nLin Li laughed.\nSo not being able to open your eyes is a problem, huh?\n\"Great! Mountain! Meteorite! Fist!\"\nFortunately, the dorm was nearly empty over the weekend, otherwise, Bai Bufan couldn’t believe how many people would hear his screams.\n\"Wait a bit, just need to dry my hair and we’re good to go.\"\nBai Bufan grabbed a hairdryer, with wet hair, and left the dorm, leading Lin Li to the first floor of the dormitory.\nThere were a few rows of outlets that students could use here.\n——Inside the Nansang Middle School student dormitory, you couldn’t find a single outlet with power, even the ones meant for air conditioner power were sealed.\nCurrently being charged, besides the two public hairdryers constantly stationed there, were several desk lamps and power banks.\n\"Strictly check these power banks, they must be hiding phones,\" Lin Li immediately deduced the truth.\nThere were even some two-in-one desk lamp power banks. All students, doesn’t Lin Li know why they would buy such a thing?\n\"I suspect you only said that because you saw one of those power banks is mine,\" Bai Bufan said, flipping him off, before starting to dry his hair.\n\"There are public hairdryers here, why bring your own?\"\nLin Li, with nothing to do while waiting, asked.\n\"Watch the VCR.\" Bai Bufan nodded his chin, pointing to a notice posted on the wall.\nLin Li looked over.\n\"Prohibited to use hairdryer below the neck! Offenders will have their photos posted!\"\nHold on.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nRemember, every seemingly absurd rule hides a strange story behind it.\nThis \"again\" in the notice contains many stories.\n\"Lin Li, do you know how horrifying it is when you’re drying your hair and suddenly a curly hair flies out of the hairdryer?\" Bai Bufan said calmly.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Maybe it’s just naturally curly.\"\n\"But the hair was quite coarse.\"\n\"Everyone’s hair texture is different.\"\n\"Lin Li, do I have to say it was pubic hair for you to understand?\"\n\"Hahaha—\" That sent Lin Li into fits of laughter.\n\"Someone actually used the public hairdryer to roast chicken? There’s surveillance in this corridor, right? That person must be quite the character...\" Lin Li was relieved he didn’t have to live in the dorm.\nEven in the best of schools, there will always be people with low manners; there’s no doubting that.\nAfter Bai Bufan finished drying his hair, he put his power bank and hairdryer back in the dorm, and then they left school, heading for a bus stop half a block away from the school gate.\nThey took their time, no need to rush. It was both Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s first time taking a high-speed train, so they left plenty of time, otherwise Lin Li wouldn’t have waited twenty minutes without getting a response from Bai Bufan and not killed him.\nOn Saturday morning, even the station wasn’t crowded.\nBai Bufan glanced at the timetable posted nearby, turned back and said, \"The next one is in about five minutes.\"\n\"OK, why not take a taxi instead of the bus?\" Lin Li nodded, stretched, and then asked.\n\"Because I think since you’re treating me to an outing, I should treat you to something in return.\nAfter all, maintaining a relationship requires give and take, so I thought, if you handle the outing part, I’ll handle the transportation.\nBut when I checked last night, a taxi from the school to the station was fifty, compared to the bus, which is four for two people, much more cost-effective, so the bus is more appropriate.\nWhen we get on, don’t be polite with me, pick any seat you like, as if it’s your own car.\"\nBai Bufan had his reasons, his voice booming.\n\"Oh, so this is the ’give and take’ you’re talking about?\"\nHowever, Lin Li glanced at his phone, puzzled:\n\"Fifty? How could it be such a ridiculous price? Did you check this in the middle of the night? Prices are definitely higher then. I just checked, and at this time, it’s only eighteen.\"\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan looked at Lin Li, scratching his head awkwardly:\n\"Hehe, you caught me. Actually, it was only twenty when I checked last night. I just felt if I said I was unwilling to spend even twenty on you, it would make me seem stingy. Right? But saying fifty sounds like a lot more, doesn’t it?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou bastard.\nBai Bufan is going farther and farther down Bai Bufan’s path.\nBut the bus goes directly to Nansang Station, so it’s not inconvenient, and it won’t take much longer.\nThe usual choice is to take a taxi because the bus can’t reach directly and requires some walking at the end.",

Hide! Quickly hide! Go!\" Lin Li suddenly looked at Bai Bufan, urging anxiously.\n\"What’s going on, what’s happening!? Is Chen Yu Ying going to sit next to you again? Or is Xue Jian bringing his wife around, making surprise appearances?\"\nBai Bufan didn’t understand, but seeing Lin Li’s emotions didn’t seem to be an act. Despite checking around and finding no suspicious figures, he crouched under the bus stop bench, staying alert.\nWho’s trying to harm me!\n\"Don’t speak, breathe quietly,\" Lin Li was a bit nervous, sweating, afraid of being exposed, while he whispered a reminder.\nTwenty seconds later.\nAn old scavenger slowly walked to the nearby trash can and rummaged through it. When Lin Li handed the bottle to the old man, the old man even smiled and said thank you.\nThen he left.\n\"Phew——\" Lin Li finally stopped trembling, let out a long breath, signaled Bai Bufan that he could come out: \"Bufan, crisis averted.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWait.\nGoddammit.\nBai Bufan crawled out with a cold expression: \"What kind of life and death crisis is this dammit?\"\n\"I was afraid you’d get picked up by grandpa,\" Lin Li answered honestly.\n\"Damn! First it was a monkey, now it’s trash, right!\"\n\"Lin! Li! I’m taking you home!\"\nBai Bufan pointed at the trash can and charged at Lin Li.\nLin Li immediately ran away.\nBai Bufan wanted to chase but realized he couldn’t catch Lin Li, who was the top choice for the four-class three-thousand-meter race.\n\"Fruit Missile!\" Bai Bufan opted for a long-distance attack—his water bottle hadn’t been picked up.\nUnfortunately, he encountered Lin Li, who was skilled at \"[Catching a Blade Bare-Handed]\", so not only did it not harm Lin Li, the ’missile’ was seized, reversing the offense and defense.\nWhen Lin Li pursued Bai Bufan in reverse, halfway through, he heard footsteps behind him and turned to see a young man.\nHe was also sprinting.\nLin Li stopped running, surprised to look at him.\nWhen the young man made eye contact with him, after one or two seconds, he looked away, glanced around, slowed his pace, and walked towards the station.\n\"What happened?\"\nBai Bufan also noticed this and walked over to ask.\nLin Li squinted, pondering for a while before suddenly realizing: \"I get it! He probably saw us running towards the station and thought the bus was coming and we were rushing for it, so he followed us and pretended to look at the scenery to ease the embarrassment when he found out it wasn’t.\"\n\"Damn, just hearing the description makes me sweat with embarrassment, that’s too awkward,\" Bai Bufan said, scratching at the goosebumps on his arm in disgust.\nThe young man smiled.\nActually, this isn’t too embarrassing, today’s kids are still too young.\nThe real embarrassment is, after impulsively doing such a thing and discovering the object of his pursuit actually understood his thoughts, pointing it out directly, not even masking it in the slightest.\nThat’s what’s truly awkward.\nHaving surpassed Lin Li and Bai Bufan, the young man’s figure ahead was filled with a mixture of sorrow and freedom—though his expression was a grimace, crying TAT.\nDamn it, you two damn kids, when laughing at me, keep it down, don’t let me hear it TAT.\nThis is very impolite TAT.\n\"Lin Li, you seem to have guessed wrong, he continued walking forward and doesn’t seem to be here for the bus,\" Bai Bufan said after arriving at the station, noticing the young man didn’t stop and continued walking forward.\n\"He opted for the most popular solution, a respectable opponent,\" Lin Li didn’t think he guessed wrong and commented thoughtfully.\n\"The bus is here.\" After waiting for another half minute and seeing the bus number nearby, Lin Li said.\nArrival.\n\"Sir, is the bus fare two dollars?\" Bai Bufan stepped forward with coins asking.\nMost bus passengers at Xiling now are middle-aged and elderly, although they mostly ride for free, there are always exceptions, so cash payment hasn’t been canceled.\n\"Yes.\" The driver nodded.\n\"Standing fare?\"\nThe driver chuckled, pressed the door button, and pointed to the entrance: \"Get off.\"\nA good answer, immune to cheekiness, making Bai Bufan obediently insert coins.\nIn less than half an hour, the two arrived at Nansang Station.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan hadn’t arrived yet, but it’s not considered late as it’s still well ahead of the agreed time.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan thought for a while and decided to wait for the two at the station, after all, their car would arrive here anyway, and since the station had seating, waiting wasn’t tiring.\nTen minutes later.\nA black car pulled up not far away, Lin Li remembered the license plate and recognized it as the Chen Family’s car.\nLin Li’s gaze moved upward, he didn’t see Chen Zhongping this time but instead a forty or fifty-year-old stranger, probably the driver replacing the Chen Family’s during the National Day.\n\"They’re here, they’re here.\"\nThe early autumn breeze carried a slight chill, blowing words over.\nChen Yu Ying lightly jumped out of the car, steps hurried, wearing a beige knitted cardigan, sleeves slightly rolled up revealing slender wrists, underneath is a light blue denim skirt, the hem gently swaying with her run.\nHer legs were covered in thin black tights, paired with white canvas shoes.\nHer long hair was tousled by the wind, a few strands clung to her cheeks as she ran, casually tucking her hair behind her ear, with a brown small leather bag slung across her shoulder, the strap swaying with her movements, creating slight collision sounds.",

Tights and black stockings are totally different, you know...\"\nIndeed, the thickness and material of the two are completely different. How they feel to wear or to look at is also totally different.\nPairing a denim short skirt with this in autumn is perfect for warmth.\n\"Whatever, it’s just black stockings.\" But Lin Li was as stubborn as ever.\nChen Yu Ying could only sigh helplessly.\nWho’s turning eighteen soon, him or me?\nSo childish.\n\"Hasn’t Si Han arrived yet?\" Chen Yu Ying sat down next to Lin Li, then asked.\n\"Should be here soon.\" Hearing this, Lin Li glanced at the group chat, where Qu Wanqiu was wailing insincerely.\n\"I’m here already!\"\nSpeak of the devil, the latecomer had arrived, as Ding Sihan’s voice came over.\nThe three of them looked up, and it was clear Ding Sihan had dressed specifically for live ammunition shooting today, matching her outfit with the event.\nShe was wearing an oversized style women’s black tactical jacket with a white T-shirt underneath, and pure black leather pants that perfectly outlined her leg proportions, paired with black high-top shoes, her hair styled into a ponytail, complete with goggles and gloves, looking quite dashing.\n\"Holy crap, Ding Sihan’s outfit is truly handsome.\" Watching this scene, Bai Bufan clicked his tongue.\n\"Holy crap, black stockings are seriously awesome.\" Watching this scene, Lin Li clicked his tongue.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nDing Sihan, who had just gotten close enough to hear this sentence, pushed her goggles up her nose, revealing her eyes, and looked at Lin Li like he was an idiot:\n\"Lin Li, are you blind? These are leather pants, not your big fat imagination of stockings.\"\n\"Damn, leather pants, huh? So do farts make bumps?\" Lin Li asked with a scientific curiosity.\n\"Get lost! No way!\"\n\"I don’t believe it. Prove it by doing it once.\"\n\"Fine, it makes a bump,\" Ding Sihan took a deep breath, \"but it happens on your grave!\"\nHaving been rightfully scolded, Lin Li didn’t retaliate but instead got up with a smile and said, \"Since everyone’s here, let’s enter the station.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nAs the four of them left the station, the next bus arrived. The doors slowly opened, and a young man stepped off. Mid-way, he stopped.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan, along with him, exchanged glances.\nThis guy looked familiar, like they had seen him at the bus stop near Nansang School.\nBai Bufan blinked, then wondered, \"So... did this dude pass by the station on purpose earlier? Did he come back after we left?\"\nLin Li nodded: \"Without a doubt, it was to defuse awkwardness.\"\nThe pair of troublemakers maintained their standard performance, not lowering their voices, and the young man heard them clearly.\nThe young man who got off the bus smiled.\nAn even more awkward situation than before had presented itself.\nHe lowered his head and checked his phone.\n\"What are the ways to leave Earth?\"\n\"When will Earth approximately be destroyed?\"\nA ticket to Mars costs only $100,000, maybe it’s worth considering.\nHoly crap!\nThis world, just explode already, damn it TAT.\n...\nAfter learning from Lin Li and Bai Bufan what exactly went down between them and this passerby, Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying understood what the two were laughing about.\nThey were just doing it on purpose.\nEncountering either Bai Bufan or Lin Li would be unfortunate enough for any passerby, and this guy had the bad luck to meet both at once.\nPoor thing.\nThe four of them headed toward the station entrance.\n\"What are we supposed to do now? I feel like Granny Liu in the Grand View Garden.\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Rustic bumpkin.\" Bai Bufan scoffed.\n\"Aren’t you a rustic bumpkin too?\"\n\"Don’t talk nonsense, I know English, you, loser, me, badass, so at least I must be a returning student.\" Bai Bufan proudly straightened his neck, flaunting his English.\n\"That’s pretty fancy.\" Lin Li acknowledged.\n\"What’s with the Grand View Garden talk, you’re being too dramatic. You just scan your ID card to enter the station, go through security, and then scan your ID again when the light for your vehicle starts checking tickets.\" Chen Yu Ying explained with a smile.\n\"No, they’re both two bumpkins.\" Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying didn’t cooperate well here.\nNansang Station on a Saturday morning wasn’t very crowded, with almost no need to queue.\nAfter self-verification to enter the station, the two of them reached the security area.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan went to place their bags, while Lin Li and Bai Bufan, who weren’t carrying bags, went straight to the security door.\n\"Turn around, turn around.\"\nBai Bufan stood on the platform following the security officer’s instructions.\nLin Li wanted to laugh.\nHe remembered the zoo during National Day, wondering how Smart Dog Bufan, Silly Dog Lin Li, and that brat kid were doing.\n\"Good dog.\" So Lin Li clapped.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Take a sip of water.\"\nBut before he could curse Lin Li, Bai Bufan heard the security officer looking at the drink in his hand, saying to him.\nBai Bufan hesitated for a moment before handing the water to the security officer, hesitating for a few seconds, and added reassuringly, \"Don’t drink from the bottle.\"\nAfter all, it was their first meeting, and if they drank from the bottle, Bai Bufan felt it would make their relationship seem a bit too intimate.\nSecurity officer: \"?\"\nNo.\nWait.\nYou son of a—\n\"No, no! Not me! I meant you should drink a sip yourself to ensure it’s not a toxic liquid! Who wants to drink your water!\" The security officer cracked, speaking incoherently.\n\"Oh, oh, oh, sorry, sorry.\" Hearing this, Bai Bufan hurriedly opened the cap and took a big gulp.\n\"I didn’t tell you to drink it all!\"\n\"So you still want to drink it?\" Finally getting it, Bai Bufan tentatively offered it back.\nSecurity officer: \"?\"\n\"...Forget it, just go in.\" The security officer indicated with a dark expression for Bai Bufan to move along.\nLin Li, already sitting on the ground laughing, covered his mouth, then touched the floor of the station, announcing his incredible discovery:\n\"Holy crap, I was wondering why the station’s so clean, turns out someone’s pride swept the floor!\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nDamn! There’s a tomb of swords!\nThe staff, already holding back laughter, along with Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, couldn’t hold it in anymore.\n\"Alright, alright, enough laughing, it’s your turn.\" After laughing, the security officer still hadn’t forgotten his duties, urging Lin Li to proceed.\n\"Coming.\"\nLin Li walked through the security gate, stood on the small platform, waiting for the security officer to scan with a detector.\nWith a ding sound.\nIt wasn’t the machine, but Lin Li’s system that rang.\n[What an exquisite detection array, harboring numerous mystical and wondrous secrets within.

      "content": "Chapter 320: Chapter 244: It’s more important for the three of us to live a good life than anything else.\nIs security check regarded as a cultivation array by the system?\nReasonable.\nAlready trained into the shape of a system, Lin Li looks at the task that suddenly popped up without much surprise and immediately begins to think about ways to complete it.\nAfter all, the rewards are quite generous. Not only does it give a complete array, but it also awards random materials, meaning I can actually use or create arrays from the cultivation world in reality someday.\nArrays are great. The cultivation world is full of mysteries; there must be a way to turn Bai Bufan into a sweet, soft little dog poop.\nLin Li first turned around to check.\nOK, only Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying behind him.\nThen, time rewind!\nThus, Lin Li began backing out through the security gate with a bewildered look from the security guard.\n[Seek and experience personally... (2/100; 1/4).]\nAs he exited through the security gate, the numbers immediately changed.\nLin Li blinked and stopped retreating, then walked toward the security gate again.\nAdvance, retreat, advance, retreat—\nSecret skill, repeated cross-stomp!\nThe numbers are rising pretty fast.\nMainly because there aren’t many people today. Behind Lin Li are only Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, who saw Lin Li suddenly lose it. Although they didn’t know the reason, they found it reasonable as it didn’t affect anyone else, so Lin Li didn’t feel much stress.\nAnd because he was holding a phone, the security gate kept beeping.\nThis led the staff who was originally checking the luggage scanner to stand up, thinking there was a malfunction with the machine.\nAs for the security guard waiting by the security gate for Lin Li: \"?\"\nNo, didn’t I just send off a kind-hearted kid willing to share but whose intelligence is unknown?\nWhy is there another one? Kid, what potion did you take?\n\"What are you doing?\" The security guard hesitated for a moment, questioning with a face full of disbelief.\n\"Sis, I found something amazing, as long as I pass through this door, it beeps,\" Lin Li announced this discovery enough to shock the scientific world, continuing to stall for a bit.\nSecurity guard: \"?\"\nNow, not only the security gate was beeping; even the security guard’s head buzzed.\nBut she didn’t dare to mock, fearing he’s special.\nHowever, Lin Li didn’t play for long—mainly because Ding Sihan kicked him, so he stepped onto a small platform, allowing the security guard to sweep him with a metal detector as part of the normal procedure.\n[Seek and experience personally... (19/100; 1/4).]\nIn a way, one-fifth of the task is already completed.\nMoreover, it proves that the number of times for this task is pretty easy to achieve. If the security guard didn’t mind, giving Lin Li another two or three minutes would suffice to finish these hundred times.\nCompleting so many times for now is enough, no need to continue.\nBut Lin Li still frowned slightly.\nBecause earlier, the task number was already nineteen, but when the security guard swept him with a metal detector, and it beeped slightly when scanning the phone in his hand, meeting the basic situation of the security gate, the task’s two numbers did not change.\nLin Li had hoped the hand-held metal detector would add to the task’s category number.\nAfter all, although the principles of both involved electromagnetic induction, the difference was that the security gate involved pulse magnetic fields, while the hand-held metal detector involved magnetic field disturbances.\nIs this mighty magnetic field not enough?\nBut now the category didn’t increase, nor did the number.\nMeaning the system does not recognize the hand-held metal detector as an array?\nOr it doesn’t belong to the advanced array emphasized in the task?\nYet, theoretically, the technical content of both is not any different, right? Isn’t a movable array more advanced?\nUnfortunately, all rights for explanation belong to the system.\nMust it be fixed?\nLin Li moved his gaze toward the side luggage scanner.\nAlthough he wanted to, he suppressed the idea of crawling in.\nThese scanners have curtains on both sides because they use X-rays, which do have some radiation.\nNot that Lin Li was worried about the radiation—such radiation barely causes any harm—but if he crawled in, for the staff, it would be an incident.\nThat differs in nature from the repeated cross-stomping under the security gate. Doing so would result in the security guard being scolded or fined or even dismissed, better not cause trouble for others.\nThen Lin Li’s eyes lit up.\nNow he knew how to complete this task.\nAbout the number, once able to swipe 19 times, finding some opportunities later would achieve 100 times; at worst Lin Li would buy a security gate and place it at home for self-amusement.\nAs for the category, the X-ray scanner beside him already gave Lin Li the answer.\nHospital.\nLin Li could completely go to the hospital for a legitimate and safe X-ray, and, for instance, a chest CT machine, such equipment far exceeds this security gate in terms of cost and size, and it is also comparable in detection function, with disease detection contrasting better with metal detection, fitting more with the system’s understanding of evil and foul objects, right?\nFrom any perspective, it should meet the detection array.\nUnless the system is limited to metal detection, or my speculation direction on the category has errors.\nAnd as long as the direction is correct, if X-ray counts as one category, then the ultrasound diagnostic instrument involving ultrasound and the MRI scanner involving nuclear magnetic resonance could fill the remaining two category gaps?\n– Nansang County Hospital is Grade 3A, has an MRI scanner, though it is the kind with relatively low magnetic field strength, but at least it has.",

Maybe try next weekend.\nIf I fail, I’ll attempt to study the system’s proper definition of an array.\nSo now, Lin Li can do something more important.\n\"Bufan, have a sip of water.\" Lin Li reached out to Bai Bufan.\nAlmost forgot to roast my buddy. As for the task of a hundred times, no need to continue now, we’re in no rush at all.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Do you really have to rub salt in my wounds?\"\n\"I sprinkled cumin.\"\n\"Get lost.\"\nSoon after, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan also got through security, picked up their bags, and came over to the two of them.\n\"We should have the same boarding gate, right? 3A and 4A?\" Lin Li asked.\nThe four tickets weren’t bought together. Lin Li and Bai Bufan bought two, and Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan bought two.\nAfter all, there are no four-person seats on the high-speed train.\nLin Li didn’t actually mind sitting with Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying, and Bai Bufan sitting alone.\nBai Bufan minded.\n\"The same train should have the same boarding gate.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, then glanced at her phone: \"We’re in car 04, what about you?\"\n\"Car 02.\" Because they bought them at different times, the cars were different too.\n\"By the way, Bufan, why don’t we try first class on the return trip and see the prestigious car 01?\" Lin Li suggested.\n\"1000% no way! The only person who can stop you is me!\" Bai Bufan said with a cold shout.\nIt’s all dialogue from Kamen Rider Zero-One, fits the scene quite well.\nLin Li gave a cold smile: \"I’ll pay the difference.\"\nBai Bufan gave a fawning smile: \"First class doesn’t match my status, I want to sit in the business class.\"\nVery Bai Bufan, but Lin Li refused, because love that comes late is even cheaper than grass.\nThe four of them discussed for a while in the waiting room about what to eat in Pingjiang City, eventually leaving it to the online foodie Ding Sihan to decide. Then the ticket check began, and they scanned their IDs through the turnstiles, heading to the departure level.\nSince it wasn’t the starting station, the high-speed train hadn’t arrived yet.\n\"What status, what position, to actually make me wait for the high-speed train?\" Bai Bufan, with little skill and a big temper, grumbled immediately upon seeing the train hadn’t arrived.\n\"Then do you want to jump down and hide, and when the high-speed train arrives, stick out your leg to trip it, give it a lesson?\" Lin Li pointed at the tracks and sincerely suggested.\n\"I’d love to see that.\" Ding Sihan’s eyes lit up upon hearing.\nLin Li looked at Chen Yu Ying, who also had to nod.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYou gotta be kidding me.\n\"Forget it, I’m afraid if I trip the train, it’ll be in pieces, and we’re supposed to be riding the Fuxing, quite the valuable specimen, it’d be troublesome to repair, I can’t afford the compensation.\" Bai Bufan waved his hand dismissively.\n\"Forget it, I’ve calculated it, the Harmony train is about 130 yuan a kilogram, the Fuxing only two or three hundred yuan a kilogram. Your shoes alone could buy two kilos of Fuxing, don’t think it’s something valuable.\"\nLin Li wasn’t as reverent, and upon hearing this, laid out the numbers straightforwardly.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nWho the hell buys trains by the kilo!\nIt made him want to buy two kilos of train to take home as a memento.\nGiving gifts for New Year, starting with \"I got you two kilos of Fuxing,\" too impressive.\nBai Bufan had even thought about whether to bring a box of Yousuanru or Wangzai when meeting his future father-in-law for the first time. Now it seems, there’s a better choice.\n\"And as for you, Bai Bufan, there’s no need for self-depreciation. Your spare parts are quite valuable too: fresh corneas fetch 30,000 on the black market, heart tens of thousands, liver tens of thousands, lungs tens of thousands, kidneys five or six thousand...\" Lin Li counted on his fingers like a pro.\nBai Bufan smiled, relieved.\nBao Wei’s corpse, which had a ghost marriage, wasn’t unfair because it had no organs to speak of.\nThis groove of Lin Li had been coveting for a while, with prices thoroughly researched—everything set, just waiting for the brother to drop dead.\n\"How did a bunch of precious organs come together to form such a useless person like me?\" Bai Bufan stretched and sighed in disappointment.\n\"Hmm.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"At this point, you’re so stingy with words? Just a hmm?\" Bai Bufan turned his head and glared fiercely at Lin Li.\n\"What else? Was there anything in that sentence that could be ridiculed or refuted?\" Lin Li wondered, \"Aren’t those organs in you just like scattered stars in the sky, gathered as a lump of crap?\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nBai Bufan felt he was just asking for it, having to ask that question.\n...\n\"Thanks for accompanying me, we’ll part ways here. Wondering when next we’ll meet, which fallen leaf will blow into the flowing memory. I will miss all four of you.\" Lin Li said sadly to Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying.\nDing Sihan, Chen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nSilent reflection point one, it’s just the high-speed train has arrived now.\nSilent reflection point two, when Lin Li said this, he was looking at their legs.\nSo what he would miss was the four things indeed.\nLin Li’s eyeballs clearly scanned left and right, taking in both sides equally.\nHence, when Ding Sihan raised her leg to kick him, Lin Li dodged with 100% precision.\n\"See you in half an hour, you perv.\"\nThey split into pairs, Lin Li and Bai Bufan heading to car 04.\nWith a smile from the train attendant, Lin Li boarded the high-speed train.\nThe system didn’t give a ding this time.\nIt’s rare to ride in such a class of ’mecha’, and sitting with the class leader no less, and the system doesn’t pop up with a task?\nOr do you have to be in the same car with the class leader to earn the system’s favor?",

Of course, they’re Bluetooth,\" Bai Bufan replied, surprised.\n\"Then they’re useless, they can’t solve the current problem,\" Lin Li shook his head regretfully.\n\"Wait, how were you planning to solve it?\" Bai Bufan was initially puzzled, then squinted his eyes.\nUpon hearing this, Lin Li mimed tightening a rope, then acted as if he was going to strangle himself.\nHis gaze aimed at the several middle-aged men playing their music out loud.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nA very hardcore solution.\nJust strangle all those playing their music out loud, and the carriage would indeed be quiet.\n\"Good thing you didn’t bring any.\"\nSince the tickets were only bought last night, the high-speed train had a 3+2 seating layout, and the DF seats were practically full. The two of them had AB seats.\nFun fact, the reason high-speed trains don’t have an E seat is because, according to international conventions, seats AF are by the window, CD are by the aisle, and BE are in the middle. But due to the width constraints of the train which don’t allow for a 3+3 layout, E is skipped.\nThe most awkward configuration for Yassuo.\nAfter finding their assigned row according to the tickets, they discovered that the BC seats were already occupied by two people.\nIt was Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s first time taking a high-speed train, and they stood aside to confirm several times that they hadn’t made a mistake before Lin Li reached out and patted the guy sitting in B:\n\"Sorry to bother you, buddy, are you sitting in the wrong seat?\"\n\"Oh, yes, yes. Brother, can we switch seats? I want to sit with my girlfriend. My seat is over there.\" The guy nodded, first pointing to the girl next to him and then to a nearby seat.\nLin Li understood upon hearing this.\nThen he stared at the girl in seat C for a while before finally shaking his head at the guy: \"No switch, I also want to sit with your girlfriend.\"\nThese are genuine black stockings, not leather pants, nor tights, worth sitting next to.\nThe guy: \"?\"\nAnd the guy’s girlfriend heard this and, pretending to look unintentionally, glanced sideways at Lin Li.\nThen her eyes lit up.\nShe then kindly said to her boyfriend, \"It’s okay, darling. It’s two people sitting together, they definitely don’t want to switch. You should go back to your seat.\"\nObserving all of this from behind, Bai Bufan: \"?\"\nThis can happen?\nBuddy, your girlfriend seems like she’s about to start dating someone else.\nBut it’s not a big deal, as long as these two trust each other, all three are safe.\nThe guy returned to his seat a bit green with envy.\nThe two of them sat down, Lin Li by the window, Bai Bufan in the middle.\nThus, Bai Bufan could feel the resentful gaze from the woman on his right.\nScrew it, why are you looking at me? Look at Lin Li! I don’t want to sit here either, I had no choice!\nBai Bufan could only lower his head, eyes and nose observing the black stockings, his heart focusing solely on the black stockings.\nThanks, Lin Li.\nApart from the loud music, the experience of taking the high-speed train was quite nice.\nLin Li enjoyed the outside scenery for half an hour, and Bai Bufan was stared at resentfully for half an hour, of course, he stared back.\nThe train announcement had already begun in advance, soon they would arrive at Pingjiang City.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan didn’t know it would take several more minutes after the announcement before reaching there, but standing up early by the door wouldn’t hurt.\nThe girl in seat C didn’t seem to be getting off at this station. Seeing that Lin Li and Bai Bufan were about to leave, she first widened her eyes, then couldn’t help but shyly ask Lin Li:\n\"Hey handsome, can I have your WeChat number?\"\nLin Li frowned upon hearing this: \"If I give it to you, what will I use?\"\nWoman: \"?\"\nBy the time her brain resumed function, Lin Li and Bai Bufan had already walked away.\nDamn?\nWhat’s going on here?\n\"There really are more and more shameless people in this world. A WeChat number can be sold for at least dozens, right? Just reaching out to a stranger and asking?\"\nAt the door, Lin Li was still grumbling to Bai Bufan.\nFor his pal who meticulously upheld male virtues while pretending not to understand, Bai Bufan could only chuckle.\nBut the more he laughed, the more he became annoyed.\n\"Damn it, shut up, Lin Li, you’re so annoying.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nBai Bufan was grinding his teeth, wishing there was a Feifei to ask for his WeChat too, just to experience that feeling.\nUpon arrival, the two met up with Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan.\n\"How did the high-speed rail ride feel for the first time?\" Chen Yu Ying asked with a smile.\n\"People are not as innocent as they used to be.\" Thinking of the woman just now, Lin Li shook his head.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nAfter understanding the whole story, the two girls just found it amusing.\nChen Yu Ying laughed a little more joyfully than Ding Sihan.\nPingjiang Station is at least a city-level station, quite large, so the four of them walked a while before exiting.\nThe place for lunch was already decided, so Ding Sihan directly hailed a car.\n\"Qu Wanqiu’s sacrifice was worth it, at least four of us fit just perfectly in the car.\" Lin Li mischievously decided to start bad-mouthing behind someone’s back:\n\"Let’s hang out just the four of us in the future. I’ve actually been fed up with Qu Wanqiu for a long time.\"\nSeeing Ding Sihan smilingly pull out her phone, Lin Li knew this little woman was about to tattletale.\n\"Ding Sihan: @Qu Wanqiu, Lin Li just said he’s been fed up with you for a long time.\"\n\"Bai Bufan: I testify, not a word altered.\"",

All the heavy hitters are in it, but guess what? Who didn’t get an invite?\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu: We already made a four-person group chat without you during National Day, haha.\"\n\"Ding Sihan: Don’t say it out loud @Qu Wanqiu.\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu retracted a message.\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu: We didn’t make a four-person group chat without you, I remembered wrong @Lin Li.\"\n\"And you guys still hang out with someone that dumb?\" Lin Li pointed to Qu Wanqiu’s message on the screen and said to the other three, \"She exposed the whole isolating me thing right away.\"\nNo one responded.\nLin Li suddenly realized it seemed like he really was being isolated.\nMaybe they really did set up a chat behind his back, how sad.\nBut there was no time to wallow, the taxi arrived, and Bai Bufan quickly took the front seat.\nDing Sihan was next to jump into the backseat, and when Lin Li tried to do the same, Chen Yu Ying pulled him out, making him sit on the outside.\n...\n\"This chicken drumstick is so delicious. I suggest biologists research crossbreeding chickens with centipedes to create a centipede chicken!\"\nIt was already noon, so the taxi’s destination was a lunch spot, not a gun club.\nBai Bufan couldn’t stop praising today’s choice of restaurant and was thoroughly enjoying the meal.\n\"What did you say, a centipede chicken?\"\n\"Don’t rope me into your fantasies.\"\nBai Bufan shifted a bit in his seat.\n\"This is the most reliable Xiaodingding has ever been.\"\n\"I’ve mostly picked places that were above the baseline, alright? The times it went wrong, I was fooled by the internet!\" Ding Sihan retorted.\n\"This place is really good. How about we come back here for dinner?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Sure.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"These spicy wings are good too. We’re all eating them, aren’t you having some?\"\nGetting a response, Lin Li grinned and pointed at the remaining red chicken wings on the plate, asking Bai Bufan.\n\"Too spicy for me, I can’t handle it. You eat my two.\" Bai Bufan shook his head. There were eight wings on the plate, two per person was perfect, but they’re called spicy wings for a reason—too spicy. Bai Bufan didn’t want to end up with a stomach ache.\nLearn from past mistakes, learn from Bao Wei’s mistakes.\n\"But you haven’t even tried a bite, how do you know if they’re spicy or not?\" Lin Li persisted.\n\"I could tell just from the smell.\"\nSeeing Lin Li about to keep persuading, Bai Bufan held up a hand to stop him, saying in a low voice, \"Don’t try to turn me into a gay.\"\n\"What the heck, what does this have to do with being gay?\" Lin Li frowned.\n\"Persuading someone to eat spicy food and trying to get someone to be gay are fundamentally the same.\"\nBai Bufan explained.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nAlright, Bai Bufan indeed made him lose the desire to persuade him.\nWhen it comes to persuasion, Bai Bufan was pretty good.\nMakes sense.\n\"I’m going to the restroom.\" The spicy wings could wait, Lin Li got up and told the three others.\n\"Wait a minute, I’m coming too.\" The ever-clinging Bai Bufan, still gnawing on a drumstick, looked up.\nLin Li didn’t bother acknowledging him.\nThus, when Bai Bufan got to the restroom, Lin Li had already washed his hands and was coming out.\nAs Bai Bufan passed Lin Li, Lin Li happened to be shaking his hands.\n\"You just splashed water all over my face,\" the soaked Bai Bufan cursed.\n\"What water? It’s pee,\" Lin Li joked with a smile.\n\"Idiot.\"\nBai Bufan cursed before going into the restroom.\nOne small step at the urinal becomes a big step for hygiene; aiming at the deodorant ball in the urinal, he opened the floodgates and started peeing precisely.\nAfterwards, like rinsing tripe in hotpot, he gave a few firm shakes.\nAll done.\nBai Bufan headed to the sink.\nTurned on the faucet.\nThe faucet made a scratchy sound, but no water came out.\nBai Bufan tapped the faucet, still the same result—it seemed there was no water.\nDeduct points from the restaurant for this.\nOh well, no water in the restroom, but he hadn’t splashed anything on his hands, so wiping them with paper would do.\nSo Bai Bufan reached for the paper on the wall.\nHis hand suddenly froze in mid-air.\nBai Bufan licked his lips and then his tongue stopped.\nThe pupils in his eyes slowly but steadily moved downward, and a sense of horror gradually filled them.\nWait.\nWait TAT.\nWait TAT!!!!\nIf there was no water in the restroom, then what was on Lin Li’s hands just now!?",

Li——!\" Thinking of this, Bai Bufan rushed out of the toilet, blushing with anger and embarrassment.\nIf we can’t meet again with red eyes ~ can we still meet with a red face ~\n...\n\"What happened?\" Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan looked at Lin Li and Bai Bufan, who had returned, in confusion.\nJust now, Lin Li returned first, and then, within half a minute, Bai Bufan rushed over and dragged Lin Li away again.\nNow they’re back in less than a minute.\n\"It’s nothing, it’s nothing.\" Bai Bufan smiled awkwardly.\nA false alarm.\nTurns out there’s a sink in the corner of the toilet, originally meant for washing mops and other cleaning tools, and there’s a faucet there with water, which is where Lin Li washed his hands.\nCome to think of it, it’s neither the mischievous hot summer nor the shrinking cold winter, Lin Li wouldn’t have aimed so poorly while peeing, getting his hands wet.\n\"Let’s keep eating.\" Bai Bufan said to the three of them.\nAlthough puzzled, Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying didn’t ask further.\nLin Li was also about to continue the meal when he suddenly squinted his eyes.\nGrabbing Bai Bufan’s collar with zero frame start, he asked with a cruel smile, \"Wait a minute, Bai Bufan, so did you just come and grab my clothes without washing your hands?\"\nEh?\nBai Bufan blinked, blinked again, then turned his head and extended his hand, saying in a child-like voice:\n\"Wow, Lin Li, look at this spicy wing, it really looks delicious!\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"You bastard!\"\n...\nAfter lunch, since they weren’t in a hurry and taking a taxi from the club’s rather remote location is expensive, plus Lin Li and Bai Bufan had never experienced the subway, the four of them decided to take it to the shooting club.\nThe subway also has security checks, and walking through the security gate increased the task count by one.\nHowever, the category naturally didn’t change.\nAfter scanning the QR code at the turnstile, Lin Li and Bai Bufan looked around with curiosity and scrutiny.\nAfter all, these are scenes Xiling absolutely cannot see.\nAlthough Nansang is not a particularly backward and shabby county - having the Nansang train station is already quite promising - a subway, something exclusive to cities, will be a success if Pingjiang City has a line reaching Nansang within ten years.\n\"We’ve always solved subway problems in exam questions, and today we finally get to see one for real,\" Bai Bufan whispered to Lin Li.\nIt’s like elementary school problems always had Young People’s Palace, Xiao Ming needs six minutes to get from home to the ’Young People’s Palace,’ but some people never get there in a lifetime.\n\"I’ve always heard the subway is the intestine of the city, and we passengers are the excrement traveling through it. Finally, we too have the chance to become this lump of excrement.\" Lin Li whispered to Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWhat the hell.\nCan’t you have a normal sentiment?\n\"You’re still excrement even if you don’t take the subway, Lin Li.\"\n\"No wonder you’re so close to me, you’ve been eyeing my body all this time.\" Lin Li chose to harm both enemies and himself.\nAlthough it’s the weekend, since the line was relatively remote, there was ample space on the subway, so they couldn’t experience what it’s like to be crowded on a train.\nA dozen minutes on the subway flew by.\n\"In the past, carriages were slow, and a lifetime was only enough to love one person; now the subway is fast, in six stations I’ve fallen in love with ten people.\" After getting off the subway, Lin Li stretched and sighed.\n\"Then you’re quite useless, I fell in love with at least thirty or forty.\" Bai Bufan felt he had won this, then clicked his tongue and added, \"But tell me, why can even the ugly ones find love?\"\nOn the weekend subway, there were so many couples. Already irked by Lin Li today, Bai Bufan got even more annoyed at the sight, making his remarks a bit harsher.\n\"Because the beautiful ones are selling air conditioners.\" Lin Li, who was already checking the map and navigation with Chen Yu Ying, deciding which subway exit to take, replied offhandedly.\n\"...So cold.\"\nThe four of them scanned their codes to exit the station.\nDing Sihan and Chen Yu Ying planned to go to the restroom, leaving Lin Li and Bai Bufan waiting at the entrance.\n\"It’s only four yuan,\" Bai Bufan checked the payment information on his phone again and sighed, also setting an ambition, igniting his fighting spirit: \"I must stay and work hard in the big city in the future.\"\n\"Many years later, Bai Bufan finished the last flight and ate the last meal in Pingjiang City. He recalled today’s vow with a miserable and hopeless smile, then walked with an empty stride to the bathroom, burying his head in the foul-smelling toilet, ending his life through self-drowning.\"\nA graceful voice floated by gently.\nBeautiful.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Lin Li, for God’s sake, stop narrating nonsense here!\"\n\"And who the hell told you that struggling means flying planes and eating meals! You owe that phrase an apology!\"\n\"And even if my future life gets so despairing that I must commit suicide, I can’t possibly choose such a method, right? Is this even a humane method of suicide? Even if I must kill myself, can’t you let me do it with some dignity!!\"\nBai Bufan nearly shouted into Lin Li’s ear, deafening.\n\"Oh, oh, sorry,\" Lin Li quickly corrected himself, clearing his throat with documentary narration tone:",

And it’s a second-hand counterfeit suit! This isn’t the kind of decency I wanted, you bastard! Does it really have to be drowning in a toilet? At least mention a bathtub! Can’t a bathtub work?\"\nBai Bufan grabbed Lin Li’s sleeve and roared loudly.\nLin Li shook his head without hesitation: \"What are you thinking? How could your crappy rental have something like a bathtub? The bathroom’s just two square meters; you usually squat on the toilet lid to shower.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nHe was completely stunned.\nIt seemed to make some sense.\n\"Oh, oh, like this, then that makes sense...\" Bai Bufan slightly loosened his grip, then suddenly realized something wasn’t right and tightened it again: \"No! What are you talking about! This is all your unfounded malicious setup, you bastard!\"\nLin Li was quite helpless; truly hard to please: \"Why are you like a nagging housefly, so hung up on every little thing?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nUnable to beat or out-argue him, Bai Bufan decided to go home in a huff and let his mom guess what happened.\nAfter the two girls came out, the four walked to the club. Not far, just 300 meters in a straight line, reached it in five or six minutes.\nThe club covered a fairly large area.\nThere was security at the entrance as well, and any metal items detected on a person had to be shown to the staff. In a way, it’s stricter than the subway.\nUnfortunately, even though the detectors the staff held looked different from those in the subway or high-speed rail, and even the security gates were different, the system type remained unchanged.\nIt seems that the ’same array’ set by different ’people’ is considered identical by the system.\nIt appears completing this task at the hospital is indeed more promising.\n\"Hello, I have a reservation under the name Lin Li, four people, please check for me.\" After the four passed security, Lin Li said to the front desk.\n\"Alright, I’ve found it, please wait a moment.\"\nSoon, a male and a female coach walked over.\n\"Hello everyone, we are your accompanying coaches. My surname is Shi, her surname is Lu, you can call us Coach Shi or add brother/sister suffix.\" The man introduced.\n\"Yes.\" Coach Lu also nodded with a smile.\n\"Hello, Coach Shi, Coach Lu.\"\n\"Now, please follow me.\" The two coaches led the four into the club, with pictures and introductions of firearms on either side of the path.\nThe destination wasn’t the shooting range, but an area inside the club more like a merchandise zone, where Lin Li noticed they also sold shell casings crafted into art with price tags.\nThe prices weren’t too expensive; one could buy a shell casing keychain as a souvenir when leaving.\nAs for the casings of used ammunition, not a single one could be taken away; if you did, the Demon Suppression Bureau would come to have a chat with you.\n\"Here are the protective gear, you can choose freely.\" Coach Shi pointed to the wall beside him, where shooting gear like goggles, earmuffs, gloves, vests, and knee pads were neatly arranged.\n\"If you’re a beginner, goggles and earmuffs are a must, while other gear can be chosen according to your needs.\"\n\"Then look over here.\"\n\"To the left, open the door to this room, and you’ll find our club’s photo spot; although we’ll help you take photos and record videos when you enter the shooting range, since we’re not professionals, and due to the shooting range’s regulations and camera position limitations, we might not be able to take photos to your satisfaction.\nThis area is specially set up by the club to meet customers’ regrets in this regard.\nWe’ve already decorated the inside, and there’s exterior scenery too, so if you want to take photos, you can do so in these spots.\nAt the same time, we offer rental services for replica guns, fake grenades, ammo belts, and some decorative items, and as long as your per capita consumption at the club reaches two hundred, all the rental fees will be waived at checkout, so feel free to rent, just don’t break anything.\"\n\"Here is a paper menu, and here you can scan the QR code for an electronic menu, feel free to choose which firearms to use later.\nPersonally, for beginners, especially the two ladies, live shooting with a pistol is more suitable, and if you want to try rifles, you can start with air rifles.\nAs for the gentlemen, coming to a place like this, you likely have your plans, so I won’t say much more.\nCoach Lu and I will be here, so feel free to ask us any questions about firearms or gear at any time.\"\nAfter a brief introduction, perhaps considering the presence of outsiders, making discussions less comfortable, the two coaches sat aside waiting.\nIt’s nice, at least they won’t stand there staring, pressuring while we look at the menu.\nDing Sihan and Chen Yu Ying exchanged a glance, then made a beeline for the photo room without even looking at the menu.\nLin Li let them go and sat with Bai Bufan on the sofa with the menu.\n\"Lin Li, do they have a White Tiger - Scar Light automatic rifle?\" Bai Bufan rubbed his hands excitedly, resembling a fly.",

He turned back to Lin Li with a provocative look and continued to ask, \"Lin Li, do you have a Star God 98K?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nShit!\nThis bastard didn’t ask Coach Shi if there was a nail gun because he really wanted to play with one; he just wanted to make sure nothing could seal his damn mouth shut!!\n\"Coach Shi, are you sure there’s no nail gun? If not a gun, maybe just some nails would do.\" Into the spotlight now was Lin Li, hopefully looking at Coach Shi.\nCoach Shi: \"?\"\nBuy one, get one free problem child?\nExit and turn right 800 meters, two VIPs on the construction site.\n\"No.\" Coach Shi’s smile became a bit strained.\nBai Bufan became even more smug: \"Lin Li, stumped now?\"\n\"Bufan, have you heard of a martial art called Nail Fist?\" Lin Li closed the menu and asked in a low voice.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Dong——\"\nHaving suffered two Nail Fist blows, Bai Bufan became more obedient.\nThe two began seriously choosing the types of firearms they wanted to try later.\nThere were actually quite a lot of options, but neither of them were gun enthusiasts and only knew about some famous guns from video games.\nAnd those were basically not available here.\nLike the Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon.\nLike the M917 American-made Smith & Wesson.\n\"Coach Shi, can we, after buying ten rounds, I fire five and he fires five?\" Bai Bufan looked up to ask Coach Shi.\nExcept for sniper rifles, other firearms were generally sold in units of ten rounds here.\n\"That’s possible, but the waiting party must wait outside the glass door, and when switching, you must follow my instructions.\" Coach Shi nodded.\nBecause while shooting live ammunition, the coach must ensure that he can control the space; the number of ’outsiders’ must never exceed the number of coaches. If Bai Bufan wanted to stand by Lin Li during his shooting, another coach would have to supervise him.\nIt’s possible, but it requires additional costs — not necessary.\n\"That doesn’t matter.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\n\"Why so saving?\" Lin Li asked amusingly, looking at Bai Bufan.\n\"Damn, just randomly ten rounds cost nearly two hundred yuan. If you’re not distressed about the money, I am on your behalf. Save where you can and spend where you should. Instead of spending here, spend it on appreciating your desk-mate.\" Bai Bufan shook his head and said,\n\"Besides, it lets us try a bit more variety. Honestly, if not for the ten-round minimum, I’d want to fire just one round of each type.\"\n\"That works too. We can always add more time if it’s not enough fun.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Seems like you’re so crazy about Xiaojing that you’re mixing it up with adding more time.\" Bai Bufan said disdainfully, then lowered his voice and asked softly, \"Lin Li, you know everything — has Feifei come out yet? Where is she working now? Is she doing okay these days?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Foolish idiot.\" Lin Li remarked sharply.\nFinally, the two decided to first try out the classic Type 92 pistol, the must-try AK47 automatic rifle, and the Type 95 sniper rifle.\nJust for these, six hundred yuan is spent.\nAfter confirming with Coach Shi, he went to make preparations first.\nWatching the paint dry with Coach Lu here was pointless, so Lin Li and Bai Bufan went to see why Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan hadn’t come out yet.\nAs Lin Li entered, Chen Yu Ying was in front of a full-length mirror, turning sideways and adjusting the fit of her tactical vest by hand.\nHer graceful curves were evident, and upon hearing the sound, she looked up.\nShe was already wearing a pair of black goggles, the lenses subtly reflective, with a pair of noise-canceling earmuffs hanging around her neck. The black shell of the earmuffs contrasted starkly with her cream-colored cardigan.\nThe tactical vest on her body unexpectedly matched her light blue denim skirt, with fake grenades swinging from her ammo belt at her waist with each movement.\nA pure black tactical glove fit her hand perfectly, not bulky at all.\n\"How do I look?\" Chen Yu Ying, noticing it was Lin Li who entered, rotated a shy 270 degrees, then asked.\n\"Monitor, if your dog goes missing, I won’t help you find it.\" Lin Li replied, shaking his head, stroking his chin, and commenting with little expression.\n\"Hmm?\" Upon seeing this reaction, Chen Yu Ying was slightly disappointed and a bit nervous, fiddling with her gloves somewhat helplessly: \"Why?\"\nLin Li: \"Because I’ll take its place.\"\nLin Li’s voice suddenly turned sincere, answering promptly.\n\"Pfft—\" First startled, then Chen Yu Ying, with her gloved hand, held her fist in front of her lips and laughed.\nLin Li was always Lin Li; you never knew how he’d end up complimenting you.\nEven guessing what he’d say had turned into an entertaining game. Though never able to guess, it was still enjoyable.\nGot so scared, thought he wouldn’t praise me this time.\n\"Ah ah ah Lin Li Lin Li, ah ah ah my dog is missing too, what should I do!!\" Ding Sihan’s classic battle cry started, as she dashed in from outside with an ’anxious’ look, spun around, and asked expectantly.\nDing Sihan’s outfit was already more of crisp black, and with the props here, it added a touch more vigor and handsomeness.\n\"No need to search, I’ll give Bai Bufan to you. I already asked; he doesn’t shed, he’s house-trained, vaccinated too, just not very gentle; rush him and he’ll bite.\" Hearing this, Lin Li pushed Bai Bufan forward with a Nail Fist, waved his hand, and said nonchalantly.\nNo nail gun, conveniently couldn’t find a place to deal with Bai Bufan. Originally planned to send him to a dog meat restaurant, but since Ding Sihan came along, let her keep him.\nDing Sihan, Bai Bufan: \"?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 327: Chapter 246: I’m Just Here\n\"Why is it that when it’s my turn, losing a dog means I just adopt a Bai Bufan?\" Ding Sihan complained angrily, brandishing the imitation gun hanging from her waist and aiming it at Lin Li’s temple, going rat-a-tat-tat.\nBai Bufan, who was also ready to verbally attack Lin Li, turned his head toward Ding Sihan upon hearing this response: \"?\"\nSeriously, girl, your words are pretty hurtful. Using two \"just\" is a bit too much, don’t you think?\nAm I really that inferior compared to Lin Li? Just because he’s a bit richer, a bit taller, a bit more handsome, a bit better at sports, a bit better at studying...\n\"...\"\nGeez.\nDamn, Lin Li, Lin Li! Lin Li!! What a despicable guy!\nBai Bufan, unwanted, decided to hide in a corner and draw a circle to curse Lin Li.\n\"Alright, we’re pretty much ready, shall we go pick out the guns?\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan only took goggles and earplugs as the most basic protective measures, and then spoke to the two ladies.\n\"Sure.\"\n\"There are so many options, I can’t make heads or tails of it. Lin Li, could you help me choose? I’ll go with whatever you pick.\" Chen Yu Ying glanced at the densely populated menu and various parameters, furrowed her brows, and then gave up, entrusting the decision entirely to Lin Li.\n\"Okay.\" Lin Li nodded, selecting a pistol and an air gun as per the coach’s suggestion.\n\"Air gun sounds weak, give me the most powerful one, preferably one that can take you out in one shot.\"\nHearing this, Ding Sihan snorted twice and stared maliciously at Lin Li’s head.\nApparently, aiming at Lin Li’s temple with rat-a-tat-tat became somewhat addictive to her.\n\"Air guns are weak? I have to correct you there. There are news stories abroad where a man used just an air gun to perfectly fend off an attack from a full-grown male brown bear, unharmed. Don’t underestimate air guns.\" Lin Li immediately defended air guns seriously.\n\"Really? That’s a brown bear, even harder to defeat than a tiger. I remember air guns are lethal, but not particularly so. Are they really effective against the thick-skinned brown bear?\" Bai Bufan questioned doubtfully upon hearing this.\nThe attack and defense of brown bears are quite strong, they’re kings among beasts.\n\"It’s true, but luck might have played a role. After all, the news also mentioned that the guy’s friend, who got shot in the knee, wasn’t so lucky and ended up with a grand funeral.\" Lin Li nodded, finishing the story.\nBai, Chen, Ding: \"?\"\nWait.\nWhat’s this about a friend who got shot in the knee?\n\"Wait a minute, so the air gun was aimed at his own friend, not the brown bear? Sacrifice your buddy to save your own skin?!\" Bai Bufan’s eyes widened.\n\"You could say he escaped the bear attack unharmed, couldn’t you? The dude got away without a scratch.\" Lin Li was surprised by Bai Bufan’s reaction.\nPutting himself in that situation, Lin Li’s first instinct would probably be to aim at Bai Bufan too.\nIsn’t that human nature?\n\"What are you thinking about?\"\nFeeling Lin Li’s gaze fixed on his knees, Bai Bufan squinted his eyes.\n\"Bufan, if you ever face a brown bear, it’s best if I’m not around.\" Lin Li patted Bai Bufan’s shoulder sincerely.\n\"Geez!\"\nBai Bufan sighed, returned treachery with kindness, and gave a thumbs up to Lin Li: \"But facing a powerful presence like you, akin to two earless bears, I think the brown bear might be the unlucky one.\"\nLin Li squinted his eyes.\nBai Bufan never praises him, especially with a preface like that.\nSomething’s fishy.\nThink, brain, think!\nHehe.\n\"Are you calling me an idiot again?\" Lin Li suddenly lifted Bai Bufan’s collar, sneering.\n\"Damn, you still caught on.\" Bai Bufan was somewhat unwilling.\n\"Lin Li, request a translation.\" On the side, Ding Sihan, who was enjoying the banter, raised her hand in a standard motion.\n\"’Bear’ is B-E-A-R, take away the E-A-Rs, you get B, so two such bears would be 2-B.\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"I see.\"\n\"Ying Bao, why are you daydreaming? Take notes.\" Ding Sihan, who also understood and learned new knowledge at the same time, urged when she saw Chen Yu Ying unmoved.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\nBecause both of them planned to share one gun to save money for Lin Li, he ended up ordering a pistol, air gun, and rifle.\n\"Alright, everything’s ready, you four come over.\" Not long after placing the order, Coach Lu left and returned with Coach Shi, waving the four over.\nThe four of them quickly made their way to the shooting range.\nThe range was composed of rows of shooting platforms, separated by shatterproof glass.\nThe range was long, with mechanized targets that could be raised or lowered at various distances. There were cameras on the ground, and screens next to the shooting platforms seemed to show the target’s status immediately, confirming the scoring.\nBefore entering the shooting platform, there was a glass door that could be shut.\nCoach Shi and Coach Lu split the four into pairs and led them to adjacent shooting platforms.\n\"Bufan, did you notice the targets at the range are all black?\" Coach Shi was about to introduce the magazine-less pistol in his hand when Lin Li opened his mouth.\n\"Lin Li, did you notice that most Olympic shooting champions from the United States are white, while long-distance running champions are black?\" Bai Bufan immediately made an analogy upon hearing this.\n\"Hmm.\"\nHaving said this, the two looked at each other and nodded in mutual understanding.\n\"Don’t be racially discriminatory.\" Coach Shi said, somewhat exasperated but amused.\n\"We don’t intend to. I’ve always had a dream to eliminate discrimination. I hope I can achieve it in the future.\" Lin Li shook his head at Coach Shi upon hearing this.",

Lin Li’s dream is to protect everyone like Xi’Er.\" Bai Bufan added his two cents, unconsciously raising his right arm at a 45-degree angle, fingers together pointing forward.\nCoach Shi: \"?\"\nWhich the hell Xi’Er are you talking about?\nCoach Shi took a deep breath, money is hard to earn, and poop is hard to eat. He forced a smile, sidestepping those topics to introduce the gun in his hand:\n\"Alright, you two, let’s get back on track. Let me first introduce what you’ll be experiencing. It’s our domestic classic pistol——the Type 92 pistol.\n\"First of all, the Type 92 pistol comes in two calibers: 9mm and 5.8mm. Just to note, there’s no 5.56 caliber domestically. Today we’re using the 9mm version. The recoil is moderate, making it very suitable for beginners to experience. Its magazine capacity is 15 rounds, which is quite high for a pistol, providing good firepower endurance.\"\n\"Look, its design is very ergonomic, with a comfortable grip and solid feel, offering great stability when shooting. It weighs about 760 grams, not too heavy, but in the hand, it feels substantial, giving you a sense of ’control’.\"\n\"The shooting accuracy of the Type 92 is very high as well, with an effective range of about 50 meters. At our shooting range, it fits the 10-meter and 30-meter targets well. The 50-meter target is a bit of a stretch, but considering each of you will only try five shots, I personally recommend you focus on the targets around 10 meters...\"\nAs Coach Shi was using the gun in his hand as a demonstration model, he saw Bai Bufan suddenly raise his hand:\n\"Teacher, I have a question.\"\n\"Go ahead.\" Coach Shi paused his introduction, looking towards Bai Bufan.\n\"If I stand at 51 meters from the muzzle, can I catch the bullet with my hand?\" Bai Bufan inquired.\nCoach Shi: \"?\"\n\"Of course not. Let me explain: 50 meters is the effective range, which means the range at which you can accurately aim. In fact, even at 1400 meters, a 9mm bullet still has lethality.\" Coach Shi explained earnestly.\n\"Teacher, I have a question.\" Lin Li raised his hand.\nCoach Shi felt a chill down his spine, looking at Lin Li, swallowing hard: \"Go ahead.\"\n\"If I stand at 1401 meters from the muzzle, can I catch the bullet with my hand?\" Lin Li inquired.\nCoach Shi: \"???\"\nSh*t!! I knew it!!\nCoach Shi took a deep breath and opened the glass door to the shooting range, smiling at Lin Li: \"Shall we conduct an experiment then?\"\n\"Sure, coach, I find shooting at stationary targets boring anyway.\" Lin Li nodded expectantly, reaching out for the gun.\nCoach Shi: \"?\"\nWhy is it assumed I’m the one catching the bullet now?\nCoach Shi took another deep breath, smiling as he said: \"Indeed, according to your theory, there must be a certain position where one can catch a bullet bare-handed, but let’s not delve into that, okay? It’s too tricky to determine.\"\n\"Coach, that’s inaccurate. You shouldn’t use ’everyone’. Some can’t catch it.\" Lin Li raised his hand again upon hearing this.\n\"Who?\" Coach Shi asked instinctively.\nLin Li: \"Jesus, he has holes in his hands.\"\nCoach Shi: \"?\"\nBai Bufan: \"Venus can’t either, she has nothing on her hands.\"\nCoach Shi: \"...\"\nCoach Shi covered his face with his hand, sighed deeply, and leaned on the wall nearby, gently but continuously knocking his head against the bulletproof glass.\nMoney is hard to earn!! Sh*t is hard to eat!!\nWho the hell said the birth rate is low nowadays!?\nWhere the hell is it low!? There’s always two at a time!!\nMeanwhile, next door.\nCoach Lu, who was normally explaining to Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying, was attracted by the noise next door. She looked up and saw her colleague looking utterly desperate, banging his head against the wall.\nIf his gun didn’t have a magazine in it, Coach Lu would have suspected he would fire a shot at himself the next second.\nA fit of rage, a full-on rage, just a rage.\n\"What happened over there?\" Coach Lu asked puzzled.\nHowever, Coach Shi didn’t hear through the glass and kept banging.\nChen Yu Ying blinked, looking at the innocent-looking yet fervently chatting Lin Li and Bai Bufan behind Coach Shi, and awkwardly smiled at Coach Lu: \"It’s nothing, should be normal.\"\n\"That’s right, but Sister Lu, you better advise Coach Shi to get some psychological counseling later.\" Ding Sihan chimed in.\nCoach Lu: \"?\"\nHer gaze also turned to those two guys.\nWhat are these geniuses?\nCoach Shi painfully adjusted his mindset, showing a ’smile’ again.\n\"Which one of you wants to go first?\" He directly skipped the lengthy introduction and opened the glass door, asking.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged a glance; with their bond, no more words were needed, they nodded to each other and stepped forward: \"I’ll go first.\"\nCoach Shi: \"...\"\nHe thought they would be courteous towards each other, looks like he was overthinking.\nThe two of them exchanged glances, a spark of electricity seemed to pass between their eyes.\n\"What the hell!\" Bai Bufan suddenly shouted.\nWhoa, why did it feel like I was just zapped with something?\nThe remote attacker Lin Li hid his skill and fame.\nFinally, following the principle of humanity first and fist first, Lin Li went first.\nLin Li and Coach Shi went in, closing the door behind them.\nCoach Shi got back into work mode, demonstrating the correct stance and grip.\n\"When shooting, be mindful; the recoil isn’t especially large, but you should still maintain the correct posture. Hold the gun with both hands, arms straight, body slightly leaning forward, eyes, the front sight, and the target aligned. Remember, smoothly pull the trigger without haste.\"",

After using, you will mimic 50%~150% of that behavior pattern, talent, or ability for one hour. The specific rate depends on your physical condition and ability at the time of use.\nYou can accumulate one usage every 48 hours, with a mimicry ability storage limit of 2.]\nWith a thought, Lin Li hoped... he could mimic Coach Shi’s firearm skills?\n[Mimicry successful, mimic rate \"150%\".]\nSeeing the system prompt, he not only successfully mimicked but far exceeded Coach Shi.\nHowever, Lin Li realized his brain had no reaction; no firearms knowledge surged in like \"soul of close combat\".\n\"Alright, you can give it a try now.\" Although noting Lin Li’s distraction, Coach Shi just sighed inwardly, tied the handgun to the safety rope, and then reminded:\n\"Remember, safety first. Keep the muzzle pointing at the target, don’t put your finger on the trigger until you’re ready to shoot.\nSpent shells must not be taken away; before any major movement, like picking something up or bending, you must report to me first, or I might impulsively take you down.\"\n\"Okay, got it.\"\nLin Li nodded and took the gun from Coach Shi’s hand.\nHis hand subconsciously aimed at the target ten meters away, following a more standard action than Coach Shi’s.\nLin Li raised an eyebrow. So it’s muscle memory being directly mimicked, without involving the brain?\n\"Alright, you can start anytime now. On your first shot, try not to miss the target—\"\n\"Bang! Bang!\"\nBefore Coach Shi finished speaking, Lin Li had already fired.\nTo be honest, the gunshots were much louder than Lin Li imagined, even wearing earmuffs, it felt a bit buzzing.\nAfter shooting, Lin Li confidently looked at the screen.\nTwo closely spaced bullet holes formed a single hole in the center of the 10-meter target.\n\"Coach, help me adjust to the 30-meter target.\"\nCoach Shi: \"?\"\nWhat do you mean? Did you already shoot?\nHitting a ten-ring on a ten-meter target isn’t hard, but two ten-rings in succession is no easy feat, especially for a complete novice?\nThis kid... is quite impressive!\n\"Is this really your first time? Never secretly practiced at home?\" Coach Shi asked, operating both the ten-meter target to lower and the 30-meter target to rise, with curiosity.\n\"Handgun practice every two days, if I’m in the mood once a day,\" Lin Li said shyly.\nCoach Shi: \"...\"\nWhat kind of handgun have you been practicing?\n\"Young man, moderation is key. Don’t wait until you’re middle-aged to lament, the world has no more well diggers.\" But, unphased, Coach Shi continued his lesson with all his experience, irrespective of whichever handgun.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWhat’s this lament over an ocean for? There’s plenty of water.\nThough confident in his robust health, Lin Li felt a bit concerned.\n\"The 30-meter target is ready.\" Looking at the screen which had switched views, Coach Shi signaled.\n\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\"\nLin Li raised his hand, almost immediately performing a triple shot.\nTen-ring, eight-ring, nine-ring.\nCoach Shi opened his mouth wide, speechless for a long time.\nPreviously, it might have been attributed to luck; now, it’s purely skill.\nAnd it’s already reached a level even Coach Shi finds hard to achieve.\nLin Li also looked at his results—not his own but 150% of Coach Shi’s results.\nApparently, the coach’s level was just average—this might be Coach Shi’s 150% limit; it couldn’t maintain consistent hits due to spread and dispersion of trajectory.\nHuh?\nSuddenly, Lin Li thought of a question.\nMimicry seems to not just be limited to mimicking others’ abilities?\nCurrently, his ability to shoot handguns was perceived by himself, doesn’t it mean he can mimic it too?\n[Mimicry successful, mimic rate \"150%\".]\nLin Li raised an eyebrow, damn it works again, and at the extreme rate.\nThis adds up, meaning his shooting skills for the next hour are at 225% of Coach Shi’s?\nHis feel of the handgun indeed changed once again.\nThe scope of [Mimicry] is behaviors seen in the past month; so does it mean as long as he mimics ’himself’ every month, this ability becomes permanently activatable?\nAnd it could get stronger, until one can only mimic their own [100%], stabilizing?\nNo, as long as he continues body and skill training, ideally, his physical condition should be stronger each use, maybe achieving [105%], [110%]?\nLin Li thought it was feasible.\nMoreover, Lin Li’s comprehension was quite good now, and wasn’t hands-on teaching less useful than this ’direct teaching through embodiment’ experience right in front?\nTeaching by instruction pales against the ghost teaching directly.\nThough no new knowledge surged to his mind, relying on memory and comprehension of these physical sensations definitely enhanced his inherent firearm skills.\nWith these thoughts, Lin Li felt satisfied, rested the gun on the table, and prepared to leave, letting Bai Bufan in.\n\"Lin Li, do you want to fire an R-rated cannon?\" But Coach Shi suddenly stopped Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Want to play fighter planes? Want to play handguns? Desire the clash of blood and flesh, yearning for audible resonances, striving for everything a man desires? They all belong to R-rated items!\" Coach Shi now looked like a salesman, enthusiastically speaking.\nBut Lin Li wasn’t fooled, squinted at Coach Shi:\n\"Coach, just say it’s recruitment.\"",

You might even become a legendary soldier king, with lots of potential and a bright future ahead.\"\nCoach Shi was sincerely impressed and spoke earnestly.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"I’m only a high school freshman, coach.\" Lin Li politely declined.\nThis isn’t my true talent.\nBesides, what would happen to my daily tasks in Genshin Impact if I joined the army?\nLin Li thought to himself that he’s not really suited for hardship. Even a few days of military training would leave him exhausted and whining like a dog, let alone joining the army.\n\"Aren’t you about to turn adult? High school grade isn’t an issue.\" But Coach Shi didn’t think it mattered.\n\"What?! Coach, how do you know which grade I’m in? And can we even join the army if we’re into bromances?\" Lin Li exclaimed in shock.\nCoach Shi: \"?\"\nDamn you.\n\"I just mentioned it casually, it’s not a big deal.\" Coach Shi waved his hand with a smile, at Tokyo University, they really respect individual choices.\nLeaving Coach Shi to pick up the spent shells inside, Lin Li left the shooting platform.\nAs soon as he walked out, Bai Bufan earnestly grabbed Lin Li’s hand and said sincerely:\n\"Lin Li, promise me, when we do... uh... outdoor activities together in the future, if we encounter a brown bear, let’s not point our guns at each other’s knees, okay?\"\nEven though Bai Bufan was outside, he could clearly see Lin Li’s scores through the glass.\nWhat the heck, how am I supposed to compete now?\nBai Bufan felt that when he sees a brown bear, the next moment he’ll see blood gushing from his knees and Lin Li’s retreating figure.\nLin Li chuckled at his words, \"Don’t worry, I won’t.\"\n\"Good brother.\" Bai Bufan was moved.\n\"—The risk of shooting at the knees is still too high. If in desperation, you decide to go down fighting and shoot me while I’m escaping, what then?\nIt’s not safe, so I’d definitely aim for your eyes. That way, even if you’re unlucky and just get blinded but not killed, you still won’t be able to hit me again, and you can’t escape. The brown bear will surely target you first.\" Lin Li finished his sentence.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn you.\nEven harsher than shooting at the knees, there’s really no chance given.\n\"Lin Li, I don’t know what you’re pretending to be, seriously,\" seeing Lin Li was determined to put him in a tough spot, Bai Bufan sneered, \"I’m giving you face, and you’re still so smug, really—just let me say, if I had hands, I’d hit your scores too.\"\n\"Oh—\" Lin Li nodded with a prolonged tone.\n\"Just you wait!\"\nBai Bufan pushed open the door and went inside. Seeing Coach Shi preparing to adjust the target distance back to ten meters, he gestured that it wasn’t necessary:\n\"No need, coach, with my skills, I can start directly at the thirty-meter target. You see, some people’s lifetime achievement is just a casual baseline for others.\" Bai Bufan said nonchalantly.\nCoach Shi: \"?\"\nBut this time, Coach Shi didn’t say much.\nHe realized that although these two kids might seem like idiots, they’re actually quite skilled idiots, and shouldn’t be judged by their appearance.\nJust based on looks, Bai Bufan seemed a bit more incapable, looking like a child who couldn’t take care of himself.\nSo... maybe this guy was indeed stronger than Lin Li.\nHave some faith!\n\"Hold the gun with both hands, arms straight, body slightly leaning forward...\" So Coach Shi began to guide him on the shooting posture again.\n\"I’m ready!\"\n\"Bang!\"\nBai Bufan went down.\n—After Bai Bufan fired this shot, he instinctively tried to bypass the safety rope to perform a move of blowing away the gun’s smoke, which was impossible due to the safety rope’s restrictions. However, because there was a tendency for the gun muzzle to lift, he was already floored.\nBut you can’t blame Coach Shi for this, it was just a display of the opponent’s diligence, and instead, Bai Bufan took the initiative to apologize.\nThe thirty-meter target is indeed quite far. After apologizing, Bai Bufan looked at the screen beside him.\nThe picture was serene, with only the three bullet holes Lin Li left on the target paper.\nBai Bufan tilted his head and made eye contact with Coach Shi.\n\"Coach, the network seems to be lagging.\" Bai Bufan pointed at the screen.\nCoach Shi: \"...\"\n\"Kid, is there a chance you missed the target?\" Coach Shi asked politely.\nBai Bufan’s posture was not very standard, plus it was his first experience using a handgun, missing the thirty-meter target was a normal outcome.\n\"No, it’s definitely the network.\" Bai Bufan shook his head.\nCoach Shi laughed and pressed the target switch, and the target on the screen started descending in real-time.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Coach, could it be that I hit so accurately that it perfectly overlapped Lin Li’s previous ten-ring bullet hole, so it looks like I missed?\" Bai Bufan came up with a new excuse.\nCoach Shi: \"...\"\n\"You can fool your buddy, but don’t fool yourself. If your buddy gets tricked, it doesn’t matter, we’ll laugh it off, but I hope after you say this, you’ll wipe your eyes and make sure the tears don’t fall on the gun barrel.\nA brother believing you won’t lose a piece of meat, but don’t make it so you believe it yourself. If your buddy gets fooled, it’s really no big deal, and we’ll laugh it off, I’m not trying to break your defense. Just wipe your tears and think carefully, who else will believe these words besides your buddy?\"\nLin Li’s calm voice came through the glass door, sounding muffled.\n\"Damn!\" Bai Bufan couldn’t hold it any longer.\n\"Accident, accident, let’s go again!\"\nHe raised his hand, aimed once more, this time the gun took longer to go off.\n\"Three rings, not bad.\" This time he hit the target, and with no extra moves, Coach Shi looked at the screen and commented.",

The first shot scored seven, the second shot eight.\nAfter completing five shots, it was now time for Bai Bufan’s most feared part—leaving the room to face Lin Li.\nWatching Bai Bufan turn around and leave the room, Lin Li, who had been waiting for a long time, smiled.\n\"Bufan, do you know what’s useful about being born as me?\"\n\"Wait a sec—\"\n\"Talent, of course!\"\n\"Bufan, do you know what to look for when making tea?\"\n\"Shut up!\"\n\"Find some teaware yourself.\"\n\"Bufan, do you know the periodic table of elements?\"\n\"Damn it!\"\n\"Arsenic is not at the top, erbium, cerium, rhodium, tellurium, and niobium need to be refined.\"\n\"Bufan, compared to the beach at Shanting, I prefer the beach over at Sanya. Do you know why?\"\n\"Because there are no stones, only sand!\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn.\nYou b******.\n\"Alright, alright, alright, bro. It’s about time we stopped. My bad, my bad.\" Seeing that Lin Li still intended to continue, Bai Bufan covered his ears, despairing.\nIf I had known during the National Day, I wouldn’t have mocked Lin Li so much during the stone-skipping session. Now, I’m the victim getting the turn.\n\"Mainly, I haven’t practiced for a long time, so I was a bit rusty.\" Seeing Lin Li finally stop, or maybe temporarily out of words, Bai Bufan felt he was capable again and tried to justify himself.\n\"Damn, are you playing billiards here? You’ve even come up with a cosmic-level defense,\" Lin Li sneered.\nWhether it’s playing basketball or billiards, there’s always someone who has to say something like this before starting a game.\nIf they win, it’s pure strength; if they lose, it’s understandable.\n\"I’m not pretending, Lin Li, when was the last time you shot a handgun?\" Bai Bufan immediately questioned.\n\"The day before yesterday.\"\n\"I haven’t done it since a week before I went home! I’m inherently rustier than you. Plus, look at the scores, you’re 10, 10, 10, 8, 9; declining in a spiral, while I am 0, 3, 2, 7, 8, spiraling upward. Isn’t it clear what this means?\nFrom a dialectical long-term perspective, my future is promising, while you have no future!\" Bai Bufan argued logically.\nLin Li didn’t refute, just looked at Bai Bufan with a mocking gaze, as if he was looking at an idiot, smiling warmly.\n\"Damn!!\"\nThat gaze is so damn hurtful.\n...\n\"So, are you guys still playing?\"\nThe afternoon passed with the sound of gunfire. After finishing three rounds of shooting, the four of them returned to the club’s inner hall to rest, and Lin Li asked the other three.\n\"Not interested. I’d rather shoot with you than shoot with you,\" Bai Bufan said, utterly bored.\nAfter three rounds, Bai Bufan’s target shooting scores were brutally outclassed by Lin Li, and even after switching to a more uncontrollable rifle, this guy could still maintain his scores even with bursts, as if he got more practiced.\nIndeed, that’s exactly what happened, [imitated] the [imitation]’s [imitation] took full responsibility.\n\"Let’s not play anymore. We’ve played enough. I want to take some photos with the background here later,\" Ding Sihan also shook her head.\n\"Yeah, I’ve experienced it, that’s enough,\" Chen Yu Ying also agreed.\n\"Alright, then let’s not continue,\" Lin Li lazily nodded, leaning back on the sofa. After all, his original purpose of experiencing live shooting was to get up close and handle a gun, to make some preparations for potential future scenarios, and now [imitations] had overachieved this task.\nIf there’s such a situation in the apocalypse, this ability would work very well.\n\"And the gun is so heavy! Much heavier than I imagined, and it makes my shoulder and chest hurt,\" Chen Yu Ying gently rubbed her knitted cardigan, complaining.\nInstinctively controlling his gaze, Lin Li glanced over.\nChen Yu Ying’s curves were indeed excellent, not quite voluptuous yet, but already quite prominent. It’s known that for Asians, except for someone as exceptionally gifted as Yu Yu, there are few at this age with such features— of course, not many at this age wear push-up bras either.\nEspecially combined with her height, which is considered tall among the girls in the class, she’s already quite impressive.\nAs the saying goes, girls blossom at eighteen; the future is promising; perhaps it will bear rich fruit.\nThat damn rifle, ruinous gun, good chest.\n\"Is it very painful? Class President, need a rub?\" Lin Li ceased his laziness, sitting up straight to ask.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Ewww~~~\" Upon hearing this, Ding Sihan immediately hugged her chest and started raising a ruckus.\n\"Lin~ Li~ while shooting~ my hemorrhoids also got really sore~~\" Bai Bufan, not wanting to miss out on the chaos, contributed by shouting in a high-pitched voice.\n\"No need, you pervert.\" Chen Yu Ying’s face turned crimson, raising her compact legs until her knees touched her chest, her eyes lowered, shrinking into the corner of the sofa as if wanting to hide herself.\n\"What, what the hell are you all up to? I was talking about rubbing shoulders! Shoulders!\" Lin Li laughed while defending himself, \"Can’t you all stop having such dirty minds?\"\n\"You better be,\" Ding Sihan scoffed.\nLin Li looked at Ding Sihan.\n\"What does that look of yours mean?\" Sensing the undisguised ’sigh of lament and pity’ locked onto her hands covering her chest, Ding Sihan squinted her eyes and said.\n\"Xiaodingding, just try to be happier in the future, happiness is good for you,\" Lin Li sincerely advised.",

Joy lifts the cup,\" Lin Li explained.\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Who the hell told you that ’joy lifts the cup’ means this kind of cup! Lin Li, quickly order me a bunch of bullets, it’s urgent!\" Ding Sihan angrily threw the sofa cushion or pillow at Lin Li while reaching out in a mock plea.\n\"No way, you rejected it yourself before.\" Lin Li shook his head with a smile.\nWhat is this urgency, Lin Li still doesn’t know?\n\"Then lend me some money, I’ll pay you back right away.\" Annoyed, Ding Sihan continued to reach out.\n\"You want to pay me back with bullets to my forehead, right? No way, hahahaha.\" Lin Li chuckled and refused.\nAfter saying that, Lin Li looked at Chen Yu Ying, who was giggling on the side, and solemnly shook his head: \"Class monitor, you better stop laughing, I personally think you’re just fine right now, but if you really want to lift it up...that’s fine too.\"\nLong live big chests! Hooray! Loyalty!\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"Pervert! Don’t say it again!\" The flush that had just receded suddenly came back with a swish.\nPillow +1 by Lin Li’s side.\n\"Here I go, here I go.\" Seeing this, Bai Bufan assumed it was his turn to be attacked and then retaliate, raising his hand eagerly while holding a pillow with the other ready to throw it at Lin Li’s head.\n\"Do you want to have a pillow fight with me?\" Lin Li scoffed at the idea, pointing to the pile of pillows around him, showing off his ammo stockpile.\nBai Bufan blinked, realizing he seemed to have only one pillow.\nDarn it, Lin Li won’t retaliate against the other two, but against him.\nSo Bai Bufan decided to negotiate: \"Lin Li, do you know what pillow fights have in common with black people?\"\n\"The harder you fight, the more cotton there is?\" Lin Li thought before responding.\n\"Exactly, considering these pillows aren’t ours, let’s cease fire.\" Bai Bufan nodded, putting down the pillow, \"It would be bad if we ruin them.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nCoach Shi, coming over with the bill, happened to hear this sentence: \"...\"\nYou two are just having too much fun.\nThen who the hell is going to make up for the part of the merit I deducted?\n...\nAt the club, the four took more photos and bought some souvenirs for memory before planning to head back the same way.\n\"Lost again, where did it go wrong.\"\nOn the subway, Bai Bufan looked at a couple across from him, an unattractive guy with a pretty girl, and sighed in dismay.\nHearing Bai Bufan, Lin Li, whose hearing had surpassed normal people, hesitated after capturing the keywords and then spoke: \"Bufan, have you ever thought that they might be from the same dormitory?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nBai Bufan leaned in to listen and suddenly realized that the pretty ’girl’ was actually speaking with a male voice!\nSong Luping once said that some technicians may not be good at massage techniques, but just speaking can make people comfortable.\nThis ’pretty girl’ might look great but makes people uncomfortable when speaking.\nAs for whether they’re comfortable or not when speaking, that’s yet unknown.\n\"So you lost because Bao Wei refused to be a ’male girl’.\" Lin Li concluded.\n\"Why Bao Wei! Can’t Tianming or Ze Yu do it? I can’t accept a feminized Bao Wei!! Won’t it still be Bo Gang!\" Bai Bufan whispered in frustration on the subway.\n\"All good.\"\n\"Darn it, men becoming feminine, women becoming childish, children turning dark, dark people picking cotton, what’s going on in this world.\"\nHowever, knowing the truth didn’t make Bai Bufan feel better; instead, he sighed more deeply, expressing such sentiments.\nLin Li sighed upon hearing this too.\nBecause Coach Shi couldn’t hear this, Lin Li felt it was a pity.\nDinner was still at the same restaurant; they ordered the two dishes the four liked most at lunch and other dishes they couldn’t experience due to serving size at noon, which made for quite the experience.\nPlus, the faucet in the men’s restroom was repaired, said to be the result of two customers filing anonymous complaints one after the other at noon, showing good efficiency.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan gave thumbs up to those two customers and also to the restaurant.\nSince the high-speed rail tickets were purchased in advance, the four didn’t stay in Pingjiang and headed to the train station, ready to return to Xiling.\n\"Hope Lin, the Great, keeps it up. I want to go to Disney next week, preferably abroad, thank you.\" While waiting for the high-speed rail at the departure level, Ding Sihan smiled as she spoke.\n\"You want to go to Disney? Xiaodingding, do you want to see if I look like Disney?\" Lin Li retorted upon hearing this.\nThis was Wu Min’s signature move.\nMaster of mimicry!\nWhen Lin Li asked her for something as a child, she would become like it.\n\"You want a summoner for the Digimon? Lin Li, look at your mom, does she look like a Digimon?\"\n\"You want to eat the crab from whatever? Lin Li, see if your mom looks like this crab?\"\nLin Li would typically reply, \"No, looks like an incompetent mother who abuses children.\"\nThen Lin Li would use his backside to hit the feather duster hard, demonstrating the power of his rear.\nDing Sihan took a serious look and replied completely differently from what Lin Li imagined:\n\"Hey, Lin Li, what you just said really does make it look like it, otherwise why is there a Prince here?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nᓖ뮤?\n\"Hahaha darn it, Ding Sihan, you’ll say anything to get a freebie!\" Lin Li couldn’t hold it when he found Ding Sihan didn’t change her tune, but sincerely praised.\nWhat drove the kid to this extent, saying such things.\n\"What do you mean, it’s all sincere.\" Ding Sihan said sincerely.\nLin Li was touched: \"But I’m broke.\"\nDing Sihan was also moved: \"Poor ghost, scram.\"\nLin Li laughed, pointing at Ding Sihan.\n\"Later, do your best. Actually...anyway, if there’s an event, I’ll call you all.\"\nLin Li stroked his chin, initially prepared to speak, but hesitated for a moment and refrained from saying what he had intended.\nInviting the \"three dogs\" for checkups next week...would it seem crazy?\nThis craziness isn’t just mental, it might make them think something’s physically wrong too.\nDammit, when we’re all high schoolers then, will they go for ultrasounds together?\nLin Li thought, when the day comes, if he supports Bai Bufan to line up outside the ultrasound room, people will definitely look at him strangely, right?\n\"Bufan, are you interested in going to the hospital?\" Lin Li still asked tentatively.\n\"Why go to the hospital?\" Bai Bufan asked, surprised.\n\"Heard there’s an ultrasound.\" Lin Li couldn’t hold his laughter after saying it, \"Darn.\"\nWait, darn, this ’darn’ seems to make his words even more nonsense.\n\"...Pregnant, huh.\" Bai Bufan managed to keep a serious face while asking.\n\"That works too.\" Lin Li accepted the answer, keeping a straight face and nodding.\n\"Hahahahaha darn it! Beastly!!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 333: Chapter 248: Lin Li is born, Bai Bufan is also born\nThe high-speed train arrived, and because we still bought tickets for pairs of twos, the four of us were separated.\nAccording to the ticket, two of them went to their seats.\nThere was someone already sitting in the seat, next to a woman, but this time she wasn’t wearing black stockings.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged a glance: Encore?\n\"Hello, sir.\"\n\"Come on, come on, you’re sitting at A and still coming so slow, no manners.\" The man, wearing Bluetooth headphones and watching short videos, looked up impatiently at Lin Li, took off one earbud, and stood up.\n\"No, sir, did you take the wrong seat?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"What?\" The man frowned at this, then checked the ticket interface and confirmed with the seat information several times before showing Lin Li, speaking more impatiently: \"07B, that’s right! You guys are the ones who got the wrong seats! Can’t you see? Annoying, go, go, go.\"\nHe immediately sat back down.\nMumbling a few phrases in dialect, which wasn’t from Yushun District, but judging by the tone, it wasn’t anything good.\nThe ticket information he just showed indeed had 07B as the seat.\n\"But—\" Lin Li tried to continue, but was interrupted before he could finish.\n\"Get lost, get lost, what ’but’ this and ’but’ that, don’t bother me.\" The man continued watching his phone without even looking at Lin Li.\n\"I’m sorry, I’m sorry.\" At seventeen, the age where you can tolerate grievances, Lin Li sincerely apologized after getting a cold glare thrown at him, then pulled Bai Bufan away.\n\"Did we really make a mistake? Car 06, 07A and 07B...\" After walking away, Bai Bufan was puzzled but not confident, took out his phone to check several more times since it was his first time on a high-speed train today, mistaking it is understandable.\n\"No need to look, the seat is right.\" Lin Li waved his hand dismissively.\n\"Huh? Then why is that uncle’s seat also 07B, double booking?\" Bai Bufan was puzzled.\n\"No, I just saw the train number on that b-ticket, it’s not this train, it’s the one across, he got on the wrong train.\" Lin Li smiled.\n\"Then why are we leaving our seat?\"\n\"Wait, wait!\"\nBai Bufan abruptly stopped talking, looked at Lin Li, blinked, then gradually his face was filled with restrained laughter: \"Oh, you bastard, I swear, Lin Li, you’re something else.\"\n\"If he had been a bit more polite, I would have explained to him.\"\nLin Li chuckled softly.\n\"Agreed, he starts with swearing right off the bat, I hate people who swear without any manners.\" Bai Bufan agreed, rubbing his hands with anticipation: \"But we should remind him when we get off, otherwise, I’d regret not seeing him go all frantic.\"\nAlthough Lin Li was a bastard, fortunately, Bai Bufan wasn’t a good guy either.\n\"Sure.\" Lin Li nodded, he had the same thought, \"And it’s best when the train is just about to start again.\"\n\"Still, Lin Li, you’re considerate.\" Bai Bufan gave a thumbs up, \"For that moment, it’s worth standing for half an hour.\"\n\"No need, I did some homework before coming, the indicators next to the seats on the high-speed train have meanings, red means occupied all the way, green means the seat hasn’t been sold, yellow means not sold until the next stop, although there might be a delay, but as long as we wait till the train starts, find a green or yellow seat, it’ll be fine.\nAlthough we can’t sit together, it doesn’t matter.\"\nLin Li explained.\nBai Bufan’s eyes lit up, he really didn’t know about this.\n\"Even better!\"\nSo as they waited for the train to start to find a seat, the two of them stood by the entrance connecting the cars, eagerly watching 07B, afraid the man would get up and leave, making them miss the fun.\nBut seeing Bai Bufan standing awkwardly next to him, Lin Li asked curiously:\n\"What are you doing? You look like you need to pee urgently.\"\n\"Because I really do need to pee a bit right now.\" Bai Bufan nodded.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Why don’t you go pee? There are toilets on the high-speed train. Actually, they are right in this car.\" Lin Li was surprised, pointing towards the toilets to indicate.\n\"It’s not the right time yet.\" Bai Bufan shook his head, \"I hope to contribute to the nation’s development.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Speak human, would you?\"\n\"Lin Li, have you heard of a project that benefits the country and the people, the South-to-North Pee Diversion?\" Bai Bufan’s eyes shone as he said this, full of youthful enthusiasm, expressing his commitment to the nation:\n\"I drink a lot of water in Yushun District in the South just to bring the water to the North to urinate in Nansang.\"\n\"In order to solve the imbalance of water resources in our country.\"\n\"For the country, for the people of Nansang, I’m willing to endure, to hold back, it’s nothing!\"\nHearing this, Lin Li was moved to tears by Bai Bufan’s spirit of self-sacrifice:\n\"Moved to tears, what an idiot.\"\n...\nThe high-speed train arrived.\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Why haven’t you two come out yet? @Lin Li @Bai Bufan.\"\n\"Lin Li: Wait for us for a moment, we’re timing it.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: ?\"\nAs the sound indicating the train doors were about to close rang out, Lin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged a glance and approached the man with a smile.\n\"Why is it you two again!\" The man, interrupted again with a tap on the shoulder, saw it was the people who bothered him last time and angrily wanted to act.\n\"Hello, uncle, I just realized something, you got on the wrong train.\" Lin Li bent over politely to greet him.\n\"Uncle, shouldn’t you be on the high-speed train heading to Bridge Town? But we’re on the one going to An Sect.\" Bai Bufan followed up politely, \"Oh dear, it seems like you really got on the wrong train.\"\n——With the train number Lin Li remembered, it was easy to check where the man’s original train was going.",

Lin Li and Bai Bufan laughed happily.\nThe man also noticed Lin Li and Bai Bufan outside the window and realized what had happened. He started angrily banging on the window, pointing at them and talking.\nThe high-speed train’s windows are soundproof, so they couldn’t hear clearly.\n\"What’s he saying, Lin Li?\" Bai Bufan asked with a smile.\n\"Hey, nano rescue, buddy.\" Lin Li laughed as he replied.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, seeing Lin Li and Bai Bufan finally come out, walked over.\nBefore they asked what had happened, they saw the two transforming into carrier-based aircraft pilots, making a ’takeoff’ gesture to the high-speed train, and then switching to a taunting funny face.\nChen Yu Ying, Ding Sihan: \"?\"\n...\nTheir confusion cleared up once they understood the situation.\n\"Ahh, you’re so mean, you two, so mean.\" Ding Sihan laughed so hard her words were broken, \"Why didn’t you call me over to see that man’s expression! Darn, hogging it all to yourselves!\"\n\"Indeed, quite bad.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded with a smile.\n\"Firstly, Bai Bufan is the eunuch. I’m not the eunuch.\" Lin Li explained with a laugh, \"Secondly, I don’t think it’s bad at all. That man started it with me, how can we repay resentment with virtue?\"\n\"I wasn’t calling you bad just now, that man was bad, you’re good.\" Chen Yu Ying said with a light laugh and nodded at Lin Li.\n\"What? So that’s how it is! Oh my virtue!\" Lin Li, feeling vindicated, started to sing: \"Xiling has a Chen Qing Tian~ unwavering and impartial, discerning loyalty and treachery~\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"What a ridiculous name! Lin Li, retract it! You’re not good, you’re also bad, you’re also deceitful.\" Unable to bear the name, Chen Yu Ying immediately corrected the judgment.\nLook at those puffed cheeks, squeezing them would surely be fun.\n\"Why the hell did you suddenly pinch my butt?\" attacked, Bai Bufan jerked his head around to question Lin Li.\n\"You don’t understand my regret.\" Lin Li, with a deep, melancholy gaze, sighed: \"Life is a series of concessions, concessions, until we retreat... and seek the lesser evil.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWhere’s the reservoir you’re pining for here? Where’s this nutcase from?\n...\n\"Do you really want me to ask my dad to give you two a ride home?\" After leaving the station, Chen Yu Ying paused at the door and turned to ask.\nToday, there was no further plan, so it was time for each to go home, thus her question.\n—In the evening, it wasn’t the family driver who’d come to pick her up, but Chen Zhongping.\n\"No need, class rep. If it were your family driver picking you up, I’d agree, but since it’s your uncle, I’ll still go back with Bufan on the bus.\" Lin Li said with a smile.\nLin Li’s bicycle was still at the school gate, so indeed he would first return to school with Bai Bufan later.\nDidn’t come in the morning, but here to pick up at night, Old Chen doesn’t know what he’s worried about.\nCould it be he’s worried that he might think today’s fun isn’t enough and will suggest not going home just yet, continuing to play until home urges them back, and incidentally find an opportunity to pinch the class rep’s cheeks?\n\"Okay then, when you get to school or home, let us know in the group chat. I’ll make sure not to let him come next time.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded with a smile, without insisting.\nAfter all, with her dad around, indeed it might make them uncomfortable instead.\nThe four of them first went to the bus stop, then the two girls continued to the parking lot, so they parted ways:\n\"See you tomorrow then.\"\n\"When you think about it, we see each other every day.\" Lin Li waved with a smile.\nAt school on Friday, a date on Saturday, and again for night study on Sunday evening.\n\"Isn’t that nice, bye-bye~\" Chen Yu Ying waved with a smile as well.\nAt this point, a lot more people were waiting for the bus, no longer as empty as eight or nine in the morning.\nIt turns out there are so many people taking the bus.\nLin Li indeed had no such concept.\nAfter waiting for a few minutes, the corresponding bus arrived, and everyone queued to get on.\n\"Lin Li, the class rep is calling you.\" Bai Bufan said after inserting the coins, directing Lin Li inside the bus.\n\"Huh? She hasn’t left?\" Lin Li turned around confused, seeing Bai Bufan quickly passing by him.\nLin Li felt a jolt and turned to see Bai Bufan.\nThe county’s buses weren’t big, with only about a dozen seats per bus, and now, the last seat had been taken by Bai Bufan.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Bai Bufan, you dropped your coin on the ground, pick it up.\" Lin Li gently smiled as he suggested.\nSome kind of friend, using sneaky tricks on his own people.\n\"It’s just standing for twenty minutes, if you can’t stand for twenty minutes now, how are you going to manage standing all day as a security guard later?\" Bai Bufan said with disdain.\nThat sounded familiar, like when he mocked Bai Bufan about delivering food in the past, and now the boomerang came back to smack him in the head.\nDeserved.\nNot a big deal, just twenty minutes, Lin Li went to stand beside Bai Bufan and looked at the other passengers on the bus.\nLin Li noticed they were actually the only young people; aside from them, there were either elderly or tired middle-aged people, with some nearly writing \"corporate slave\" on their faces.\nIn the morning, he had not encountered this group, purely because it wasn’t rush hour.",

He got smashed by Frieza in the Frieza arc and lent Cell a helping hand in the Cell arc...\" Bai Bufan thought for a moment before answering.\n\"No, it’s the labor law.\" Lin Li’s map of the Yan Kingdom was very short.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nBai Bufan paused for a moment, then looked around the bus, instantly understanding why Lin Li had suddenly asked such a question. He gave Lin Li the finger, laughing and cursing, \"Lin Li, don’t you dare get me kicked off the bus.\"\n\"If I ever become a boss, I definitely won’t tolerate overtime. Damn it, if any of my employees dare to work illegal overtime, I’ll confiscate their illicit earnings.\" The more Lin Li thought about it, the angrier he got, and so he made this grand vow.\nWe, as capitalists, should dedicate our lives to society, establish a belief for the universe, inherit the knowledge of the saints, and bring peace to the world for all future generations.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWhat did Lin Li just say?\nWas it in Chinese?\nSuch an obscure language.\n\"You were born to be a boss.\" Bai Bufan gave a thumbs up, then sighed deeply:\n\"How many women, in order not to take the bus, have become the bus themselves? And how many men, to own a bus, ride the bus every day?\"\n\"Life, oh life, so fleeting, so fleeting.\"\nThe philosopher Bai Bufan and the capitalist Lin Li exchanged a glance, appreciating each other’s thoughts.\nThe bus gradually became crowded, and more people began to stand.\n\"Young people today rarely have the virtue of respecting the elderly and cherishing the young, sigh.\" An aunt who just got on the bus glanced around, finding no space, and chose to stand beside Bai Bufan, muttering to herself, \"Sigh, my poor back, it’s tough standing at this age.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nShit.\nAuntie, why are you specifically using Mandarin? Worried I won’t understand the dialect if I’m not local?\nShit.\nAlready squeezed to the side, Lin Li was secretly delighted.\n\"Sigh——\"\n\"Sigh——\"\n\"If only a kind young person would give this old lady a seat.\"\nThe aunt started sighing madly, patting her old waist.\nThis could no longer be called a hint; it was outright.\nBut actually, it was almost our stop.\nSo Bai Bufan got up.\n\"Oh, young man, so kind of you, thank you.\" The aunt was already eager to sit down as Bai Bufan stood up.\nBai Bufan hobbled on one leg, grabbing the handrails around him, hopping away from his seat. Hearing this, he turned back, pointed to his seat for the aunt, nodding to indicate she could sit.\nLin Li, Aunt: \"?\"\n\"Young man... is there a problem with your leg?\" The aunt hesitated mid-air, looking at Bai Bufan, asking with a guilty conscience.\nBai Bufan waved his hand, struggling on one leg to move toward Lin Li.\n\"Hey, young man, don’t go, come back, come back, you sit here.\" Now the aunt was anxious, feeling the seat was incredibly hot, gesturing to Bai Bufan.\n\"Hey! Don’t go! Don’t go!\"\nBai Bufan shook his head, opened his mouth: \"Aba aba.\"\nThen, looking somewhat anxious, he pointed to Lin Li, then to the aunt, then to his own mouth: \"Aba! Aba! Aba!\"\nLin Li: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nAfter a brief moment of confusion, Lin Li’s mischievous mind took over.\n——Light bulb moment!\nHe immediately stepped forward to support Bai Bufan, apologizing to the aunt: \"Auntie, he’s mute and can’t speak. He means for you to sit; he doesn’t need it, he’s young, it’s no problem for him.\"\nBai Bufan’s eyes lit up!\nLin Li not only understood his intentions and collaborated perfectly but even helped cover for his name!\nBro! Ther!\n\"Aba aba!\" Bai Bufan gave Lin Li a thumbs up, then continued using body language and aba aba to urge the aunt to sit.\n\"What am I sitting for? Quickly let him come sit, come on, come on, you sit, what’s with this young man, priority to the disabled!\" The aunt now wouldn’t dare sit for another second, especially feeling the curious gazes of the other passengers around her, speaking quite anxiously.\n\"No need, no need, we’re just about to arrive, it’s the next stop, please sit.\" Lin Li waved his hand quickly.\nThis was the only non-lie in their words, as the bus was about to reach Nansang Middle School, which was their destination.\nSo, Lin Li and Bai Bufan, two supposed disabled people, limped off the bus supporting each other.\nLeaving behind the bus, with a seat available but stubbornly not sitting, watching them leave, the aunt lamented as she saw their bleak and bitter backs.\nShe was deeply confused.\nWhat did I just do?\n\"You beast! Bai Bufan! You’re a total beast!\" After confirming the bus drove away, Lin Li gave a hearty kick to Bai Bufan’s good leg, laughing and cursing, \"The aunt didn’t mean any harm; she just purely wanted a seat, and you were so vicious!\"\n\"Right back at you, haha.\" Bai Bufan laughed heartily, \"I did give her my seat.\"\nThen Bai Bufan said regretfully:\n\"I can’t take the bus for some time now, or getting exposed next time would be troublesome.\"\n\"Alright, I’m heading home too.\"\nReaching the school gate, Lin Li unlocked his bicycle and got on, saying to Bai Bufan.\n\"OKOK, my plane is taking off soon, so I won’t keep you for dinner.\" Bai Bufan nodded, waving goodbye to Lin Li.\nThe failure of today’s hand job was very painful, but hard work makes up for clumsiness. Bai Bufan believed that as long as he worked hard, he would surpass Lin Li before his kidneys gave out.\n\"Shit, even if you did invite me for dinner, I wouldn’t dare imagine what’s on the menu.\" Lin Li shouted while riding away, looking back and laughing.",

      "content": "Chapter 336: Chapter 249: Lin Li Puts on His Pants and Doesn’t Recognize Anyone Anymore\nOctober 20th, Sunday.\n[Seek and personally experience... (100/100; 1/4).]\nCompleting the number part of Task Four wasn’t difficult at all.\nThe security gates didn’t need purchasing, as some mall entrances already had these devices. If there were no other people waiting and the security guards didn’t mind, going back and forth a few times quickly fulfilled the remaining count.\nAs for the types portion.\nLin Li had already purchased a full medical check-up package.\nIt was from a private medical check-up facility.\nThe CT scan was routine and naturally included in the package, and the ultrasound diagnostic machine was also at the private facility Lin Li went to. Lin Li bought an additional one so they could experience it together.\nAlthough usually, these private institution check-ups are bought in bulk by large companies to distribute as employee benefits, making individual purchases is certainly not as cost-effective as going to a public hospital.\nBut for Lin Li, spending a little extra to save on appointment and queue time was worth it.\nAnd since he bought the premium package, even if Lin Li needed to change the time temporarily, it was completely fine.\nA regular check-up typically costs a few hundred to over a thousand yuan out of pocket, but Lin Li’s package was nearly six thousand yuan for just one check-up, even in a small place like Xiling.\nIf people didn’t know, they might think Lin Li was living Little Chen Yu Ying’s life now.\nIt can only be said that the account balance gave Lin Li the courage to live.\nLin Li enjoys playing with the gold under the bed in his spare time, polishing it until it shines with a water glow.\nAs for the MRI, Lin Li specially went to the hospital this morning to try and book one.\nThe doctor, upon learning that Lin Li was not experiencing any discomfort, merely wanted to have an MRI to spot early signs of hidden diseases, naturally tried to dissuade him, saying it was completely unnecessary and alternative check-ups would suffice.\nOf course, it was meant for Lin Li’s own good, but due to his persistence and earnest request, the doctor eventually refrained from further dissuasion and issued a checklist.\nAfter all, MRI scans have no side effects, and they are used for the prevention of diseases in physical examinations, except most cannot afford the cost — an MRI for one body part generally costs over a thousand.\nLin Li didn’t need a full-body scan. The checklist marked for the brain, which should take about half an hour.\nHowever, Lin Li also informed the doctor that if a patient needed an MRI but couldn’t get an appointment, they could inform him at any time to swap his appointment for theirs.\nAfter all, there is only one machine like this in the entire Nansang. He didn’t want his task to affect those in genuine need.\nIf such negligence led to a tragedy, Lin Li feared he would end up like the aunt who replaced Bai Bufan’s slot, waking up at night slapping himself and saying, \"I’m such an idiot.\"\nEven if the MRI couldn’t be done, it didn’t matter. In his information search, Lin Li found that metal detectors, beyond the basic electromagnetic induction principle, also had a detector using shortwaves.\nPerhaps it could be considered a new type.\nBut due to its limited applicable scenarios, they are few in number. Lin Li only found one priced over two thousand yuan on a second-hand platform. Luckily, it was nearby. If the MRI failed, he could spend a few hundred to borrow it for testing, having it scan him.\nNight fell.\nLin Li moved several large boxes of chocolate, compressed dry food, and other groceries he bought last evening from the supermarket to the bathroom and unpacked them all into snakeskin bags.\nHe also brought two packets of seeds, but he doubted whether they would \"pass review.\"\n[Update complete.]\nAt the scheduled time, the message arrived as expected. Lin Li opened the cross-world interface, but unfortunately, it was the same as squeezing toothpaste — no visible update was seen.\nAfter switching out a bottle of five \"Grain Avoidance Pills,\" Lin Li chose to refresh this slot.\n[You have refreshed a \"Quality Upgrade Talisman\": 100 system currency, replace?]\n[Quality Upgrade Talisman: Place on a refined magical artifact, nourish with Spiritual Qi to possibly enhance the artifact quality. Difficulty increases with higher current artifact quality, minimum chance is 1%. If enhancement fails, the next success probability for this artifact will increase.]\nEnhancing the artifact quality?\nLin Li only possessed two artifacts, one being the \"Substitute Jade-faced Buddha\" and the other the \"Bottle of Hidden Emotions and Desires.\" Enhancing artifact quality would indeed be beneficial; if it could increase the revival armor’s uses, that would be a great gain, but the ’minimum’ provided seems a bit low.\nYet, for top-tier artifacts, even a 1% chance of enhancement doesn’t seem low.\nLin Li’s unknown point now is the effectiveness rate on artifacts of different qualities and what quality his two artifacts belong to.\nThe system hadn’t stated.\nIs he supposed to blindly use it combined with the \"Fate Talisman\"?\nThe trial-and-error cost becomes somewhat high all of a sudden, unable to ensure success, and with only 480 system currency in total, testing once would consume 250.\nIf it failed, Lin Li would feel foolish, like a fool.\nSo even after replacing the item slot, Lin Li did not make a purchase.\nHe decided to wait until a suitable scenario arises.\nAfter preparing, taking a deep breath, collecting the items in front of him, a flash of white light occurred, and Lin Li was already on Mingyuan Star.\n\"Phew—\"\nWith a long exhale, Lin Li dropped several large snakeskin bags beside him.",

      "content": "Chapter 337: Chapter 249: Lin Li Puts on His Pants and Doesn’t Recognize Anyone Anymore_2\nThe things I left here last week show no signs of being tampered with.\nLin Li stepped forward to check his watch; the time was exactly as he estimated. It was 2 PM in Yunguang City, and nearly an hour had passed since he last left, to be precise, close to 56 minutes.\n1:180.\nHe opened a bag. As expected, things involving living entities like seeds weren’t brought over either.\nHe looked at the system interface.\n[5.29.55]\nThe countdown showed such numbers.\nLin Li frowned slightly.\nIf he remembered correctly, he calculated last time that the longest he could stay was only five hours, right?\nThis time there’s an extra half-hour? It’s impossible that he calculated wrong by such a large margin, it must have just come up this time.\nWill there be more each time?\nNoting this change and suppressing the doubts that needed more information to validate, Lin Li switched to the title \"Breath of the Demon.\"\nHe retrieved the communication device he had left in another building and pressed it, dragging all his belongings, including the lovely Ms. Beauty, to the rendezvous point with Ye Jing and the others.\nAs he approached, he could see the hopeful looks of the three people. Lin Li felt that they hadn’t left at all during that hour.\n\"Come over and get it yourself.\" After shouting this at the three of them, Lin Li led a few zombies clad in pink clothes into a nearby building and shook them off.\nYe Jing was, of course, the first to arrive.\n\"The food you wanted, I couldn’t bring the seeds.\" Lin Li indicated that she could open it to take a look.\nShi Dongchen and Hu Fei also came over.\nWhen Ye Jing opened one of the bags, she saw bundle upon bundle of chocolates tightly wrapped in plastic, far exceeding the anticipated hundred pieces, her excitement was visible.\nNot to mention, it wasn’t just one bag.\nShi Dongchen opened his bag, revealing a pile of biscuits, looking dense enough to fill stomachs, with some canned food beside them.\nTo his surprise, there was a third bag.\nThe bag Hu Fei opened contained a zombie corpse, stacked with seductive lingerie.\nHu Fei: \"?\"\n\"Hello, sister-in-law!\"\nDamn, he hit the jackpot with this hidden item. Hu Fei took a step back, knelt down in front of the charming Ms. Beauty, and banged his head three times, loudly proclaiming.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Who told you to call her sister-in-law?\"\n\"Lin Li, Shi Dongchen is useless, make me your little brother!\" Hu Fei turned to Lin Li, eyes full of hope.\nShi Dongchen: \"...\"\n\"It’s not about being a brother or not; even if I take you as my little brother, she won’t be your sister-in-law.\" Lin Li said with amusement, unable to get angry with Hu Fei.\n\"I get it! Lin Li, in the future when the sister-in-law asks, I won’t spill the beans about you and the little sister-in-law.\" After seriously thinking for a long time, Hu Fei finally looked up and said solemnly.\n\"...\"\nGreat thinking, next time try not to think.\nLin Li laughed relaxedly, waved his hands to give up explaining, and instead looked at Shi Dongchen, repeating:\n\"Couldn’t bring the seeds.\"\n\"Understood, no problem! With these, our immediate crisis is already solved! Thank you! Lin Li, thank you so much, we’ll go back and break down the rest of the gold pieces to bring to you!\"\nShi Dongchen didn’t feel disappointed upon hearing this; the number of food items in front of him frankly exceeded his expectations.\nHe originally thought it would be ideal if Lin Li’s attitude could fill up one backpack, but he didn’t expect him to drag along two entire snake-skin bags full.\nEach of these bags required both of Shi Dongchen’s hands just to lift them briefly.\nIt seems Lin Li’s heart is far kinder than how he presents himself; perhaps if he approached differently initially, the results might have been better.\nUnfortunately, there’s no going back in time.\n\"I’m not in a hurry for gold bars; if convenient, just bring me some water and cooking and dining utensils.\" Lin Li waved his hand, speaking nonchalantly.\nBack home, there’s still nearly two million unspent Gold; Lin Li’s only purpose in coming to the apocalypse this time is to complete mission two and collect the reward.\nThe current priority is to create an \"evening meal\" environment to avoid a system judgment failure for mission completion.\n\"Okay! Cooking and dining utensils, right? We’ll head back and prepare them right away!\"\nShi Dongchen wasn’t afraid of Lin Li making requests; he feared Lin Li having none. Hearing this, he nodded rapidly and agreed.\n\"Then...shall we take these things and head back now?\" he asked testily.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Alright, alright, if you need anything, just press the communicator to contact us, and we’ll be here immediately!\" Shi Dongchen said, then looked at Hu Fei: \"Hu Fei, take the stuff and let’s go.\"\nHu Fei remained motionless, still bowing to Ms. Beauty.\n\"Hu Xiaojing!\" Shi Dongchen shouted.\n\"What?!\" Hu Fei replied, head still on the ground.\n\"Take the bags, we’re heading back to the shelter!\" Shi Dongchen said, somewhat frustrated.\n\"Only my big brother and sister-in-law can order me around; you’re no longer my big brother, Shi Dongchen.\"\n\"Little Brother Lin, could you...\" Shi Dongchen laughed, sounding sorrowful.\nLin Li, on the other hand, found Hu Fei increasingly amusing, so he simply took out an entire bundle of chocolate from the snake-skin bag and placed it beside Hu Fei:\n\"No matter how your shelter divides it, this bundle is yours. Now, take these things and go back with them.\"\nOnly then did Hu Fei stand up, holding onto the chocolate, and cheerfully said to Lin Li: \"Big brother, only Lin Li is my big brother!\"\n\"What if Shi Dongchen offers to give you two bundles separately?\" Big Brother Lin asked.",

Even using [Strength Reserve], I can’t be as relaxed as him.\nIf only I could awaken some kind of supernatural ability.\nAnything like time stop, hypnosis, or world modulation mode would do, Lin Li’s not picky.\nYe Jing disappeared from sight first, presumably diverting the nearby zombies, to prevent Hu Fei from being attacked on the way back to the shelter.\nAfter all three left, Lin Li found a building nearby and went upstairs, lying on the snake-skin bag, gazing at the sky, waiting for time to pass and for the kitchenware to arrive.\nWhen Ye Jing returned with Hu Fei, nearly two hours had passed.\nThe afternoon in the apocalypse, four o’clock.\nIt’s about time to start preparing dinner.\nWhich, in this environment, is quite a big project.\n\"Big brother! Sister-in-law! Where are you people!\" Hu Fei shouted loudly in the middle of the road while carrying the snake-skin bag, seemingly unconcerned about attracting zombies.\n\"Over here.\"\nWhen Ye Jing and Hu Fei came up, Lin Li opened the snake-skin bag that had contained food not too long ago.\nNow, on top, there’s a barrel of water, and underneath, all sorts of tableware and kitchenware are laid out.\nIt seems to have been specially cleaned, most of it’s quite clean.\n\"Is this barrel of water enough?\" Ye Jing came over to ask.\n\"It’s enough.\" Lin Li nodded, taking things out one by one and laying them out.\n\"Uncle Shi stayed at the shelter to handle the supplies you sent, and will come over once he’s done. If you have any instructions, just press the communicator now and he’ll come right away.\" Ye Jing explained afterward.\n\"Okay, no need right now.\"\nAt the bottom, there’s even an irregularly shaped gold nugget, like they said, freshly knocked down, heavy, weighing at least ten pounds conservatively.\nThat’s at least three hundred thousand.\nThough not really needed, as someone who’s transcended high-level interests, Lin Li is still happy to obtain it.\n\"Is there anything you need help with? I can cook a little too.\" Seeing Lin Li begin to organize the tableware, Ye Jing volunteered herself.\n\"There really is.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Great!\"\nLin Li pointed to the snake-skin bag and said to Ye Jing, who was rolling up her sleeves to wash her hands, \"Help me assemble Beauty Madam.\"\nYe Jing: \"?\"\n\"Make sure she retains her human form, thanks.\" Lin Li said politely.\n\"Alright...\" Ye Jing put down her rolled sleeves, swallowed a gulp, and started this arduous task.\n\"Sister-in-law, if you hurt yourself tell me...\" Standing in front of Beauty Madam, she hesitated for a while. Remembering Shi Dongchen’s reminder, she softly said.\n—— Shi Dongchen: Ye Jing, remember, from now on, Beauty Madam is no longer a zombie; she’s a living, breathing Beauty Madam!\n\"Big Brother Lin Li, what should I do then?\" Hu Fei squatted nearby, took a piece of chocolate from his pocket, and asked while eating.\n\"Can you cook?\"\n\"I can eat very well.\"\n\"Then just stay there and chat with me.\" Lin Li said with a smile.\nHu Fei nodded, then looked up at the sky: \"Sky, hmm, sky, sky like a sky, sky...\"\nAfterward, he scratched his head: \"Big Brother Lin Li, my, I can only talk about this much.\"\n\"Hu Fei, what’s your supernatural ability?\" Ignoring Hu Fei’s hardcore sky talk, Lin Li asked while handling the ingredients.\n\"Big brother, I’m called Hu Xiaojing.\" Hu Fei emphasized before answering.\n\"Alright, Xiaojing, what’s your supernatural ability?\"\n\"I’m very hard, I’m hard all over.\" Hu Fei said, picking up a piece of stone from the ground and banging it against his forehead.\nApart from leaving a dust mark, there was indeed no injury.\n\"Does your strength remain unaffected?\"\n\"Oh, it does too, I’m also very strong.\"\n\"Can you beat zombies?\"\n\"I can beat them, they can’t grab or bite me, but I can keep hitting them, I’m not afraid of zombies at all, uh, dummies like me I’m not afraid.\" Hu Fei seemed to recall zombies have mutated species, and specifically added.\n\"How did you awaken?\"\n\"I became strong suddenly while fighting zombies.\"\n\"...\"\nAfter question and answer covered mostly Hu Fei’s personal information, Lin Li shifted to ask about the shelter’s condition.\n\"How many people are at your shelter now?\"\n\"Big Brother Lin Li, I promised my bro and others not to talk about the shelter casually with outsiders.\" Hu Fei heard the words, hesitated for a while, and said.\n\"Then wouldn’t it be fine if you seriously said it?\" Lin Li said, puzzled.\nHu Fei was stunned for a moment, then realized, eyes even cleared: \"Oh, right!\"\n\"Big Brother Lin Li, we have more than two hundred people at our shelter now...\" Hu Fei’s attitude suddenly became much more upright, even his sitting posture turned serious, and began to disclose information genuinely.\nYe Jing on the side: \"...\"\nThe guy’s already dumb, and you teased him.\nShe didn’t stop it, though, Shi Dongchen and her, their intention now was to strengthen Lin Li’s connection with the shelter as much as possible, hoping he might ’visit’ the shelter or even choose a place to ’live’ or at least make a stop.\nRegarding shelter information, after receiving those foods, Lin Li even if he asked her now, she’d still tell him everything in detail.\n...\nPutting bone meatballs in boiling water to cook, Lin Li also gained understanding of the shelter’s situation.\nIt wasn’t too big or too small, roughly around two hundred people.",

Want to find a hole and crawl into it!\nThen, according to Lin Li’s instructions, helped, watching Lin Li scoop a spoonful of meat soup into Beauty’s mouth, leaking out again.\n\"Help me push it into her stomach, thanks.\" Lin Li didn’t care about this outcome, said to Ye Jing.\nFelicitous, with Ye Jing around, he doesn’t need to do these disgusting tasks himself.\nYe Jing: Shit.\n\"Is it delicious?\"\nAfter Ye Jing finished, Lin Li looked at Beauty.\nThis time, without a hint from Lin Li, Ye Jing manipulated Beauty to nod.\n\"If it’s delicious, eat more. Why don’t you eat it all? I’ve actually already had enough, good looks are quite filling.\" Lin Li said, looking expectantly at the system.\nNo response.\nShit, good looks aren’t allowed to be eaten?\nNo way around it then.\nLin Li replaced with a brand-new spoon, washed it several times, and then removed his helmet and mask, first using the fan method to smell.\nOnly to say that his cooking talent is still steadily performing, while the seasoning and ingredients brought from Earth, the cooked taste is still quite fragrant and appetizing.\nLooking at the dish collaborated with Beauty, Lin Li took a deep breath.\nIt should be safe and sound.\nDown the hatch, brothers!\n[Deeply kiss Beauty’s forehead...

However, after reading the task introduction, Lin Li finally breathed a sigh of relief.\nCompared to the previous two tasks, this one was much more acceptable.\nAnd it seemed like it might be the last task in this series.\nLin Li raised an eyebrow slightly. It wasn’t hard to notice that the system seemed to end every strongly continuous series of tasks with a \"title\" as part of the reward.\nHe had four titles on hand, as well as \"The Fruit of Persistence\" and \"Nonchalant Once Dressed,\" all of which were granted under similar circumstances.\nYet, this discovery didn’t seem very significant.\nLin Li looked at this title and, to be honest, found it difficult to evaluate.\nWhat was difficult to evaluate wasn’t the ability of the title, but its effect.\nSeriously?\nStupid system, your title reward doesn’t match well with the task’s prologue, does it?\nThe pretentious prologue was supposed to put a beautiful end to his encounter with the beautiful lady, so what does rewarding a title like \"Nonchalant Once Dressed\" mean?\nSuch behavior, according to his mentor Song Luping, is like Park Changfan not paying, which is extremely vile.\nHowever, the effect of the title wasn’t as offbeat as its name.\nWith this title equipped, he could completely conceal his identity information, at the expense of not being able to see others’ faces.\nThis was undoubtedly disproportionate.\nBecause according to the description of the title, he could still identify others by their clothes and voices, just not see their faces. However, others couldn’t identify him through any means.\nIt was suspected to have the same effect as Superman’s glasses.\nThis would be a useful title whether in reality or the post-apocalyptic world.\nHowever, this task...\n\"Ye Jing, does your shelter have any vehicles?\" Lin Li looked at Ye Jing.\n\"Vehicles? Yes, do you mean usable ones?\" Ye Jing was stunned for a moment before replying.\n\"Yeah.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"We have two in use that we’ve modified to minimize noise and armor, and a few others that haven’t been used in a long time; not sure if they’re faulty. Do you need a vehicle now? If so, I can immediately go back and have someone bring one over?\" Ye Jing replied in a flurry.\nHer urgency was due to two reasons: Lin Li’s task had a high priority,\nand she didn’t want to continue upsetting the beautiful lady’s stomach.\n\"Sure, as long as there are vehicles.\" Lin Li nodded.\nIt’s good that there are existing vehicles in this world.\nOtherwise, if Lin Li wanted to bring a car from reality, a sedan wouldn’t suffice, and he’s not sure if the system would recognize bicycles or tricycles.\nAlthough Lin Li still had \"Repair Crystal,\" which should be able to repair scrap vehicles by the roadside, it was better not to use it if unnecessary.\nAs for the differences in driving between the two worlds, Lin Li felt that with his understanding, having them teach him a bit would allow him to learn quickly.\nThe first element of the task had been found, but there was still another element.\n\"Home.\"\nWhere is the beautiful lady’s home?\nIs it enough just to send her back to where they met, or does he need to find the beautiful lady’s real, former home in this ruined Yunguang City and send her home?\nLin Li leaned towards the latter, as it required some ’bedroom activity,’ but if it was the latter, wouldn’t that be like finding a needle in a haystack?\nIf the beautiful lady was a beggar from outside, then no amount of searching through Yunguang City would suffice.\n\"Ye Jing.\" Lin Li looked at Ye Jing again.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Can you help me confirm her identity information? Primarily, I need to know where she lived—when she was alive.\"\nGlancing at the beautiful lady, who sat beside him, Ye Jing: \"?\"\nYe Jing looked at the beautiful lady, whose appearance was barely humanoid due to all the damage, and fell silent.\n\"Well, that’s probably... a bit...\" Ye Jing was troubled.\n\"Never mind, it’s indeed difficult for you guys, we’ll talk about it later. Can you drive?\" Lin Li waved his hand, and changed the topic.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Alright, I might need you to teach me how to drive vehicles from your world at some point. For now, go back and bring the vehicle here.\nOh, I’m not sure whether I can return the vehicle to you, but as a return favor, I’ll soon be back on Earth and help bring you at least another batch of food, no less than this time.\"\nWalking all over this vast world is tiring in itself, and the vehicle will also be useful after completing this task, so there’s no need to return it.\nThe cars are definitely more valuable to the shelter than gold, but no problem, Lin Li can always afford a reward that satisfies them.\nIf two bags aren’t enough, he’ll offer four, and if four aren’t enough, then eight, and if eight aren’t enough, Lin Li will even ask Shi Dongchen if he wants to fly up.\n\"Alright, I’ll head back right away! It’s fine, you don’t need to return it! Hu Fei... Hu Xiaojing, you stay here for now.\" Ye Jing got up and left immediately, not taking Hu Fei with her.\n\"When you get back, I might have already left, but as before, wait for contact via the communicator.\" Lin Li added.\nIt’s unrealistic to complete this task in the remaining time. Even just fetching and returning with the vehicle means he’ll likely already be back in reality, not to mention that Lin Li needs to find a safe place to store things and leave.\nWhen she brings the car, he can return with two boxes of food.",

Wondering what happens if the [Change When the Pants Are On] effect is reduced by 50%.\nHe lifted his leg, kicked forward, the sound breaking through the air.\nThe \"Physical Strength\" improvement had never been obtained before; Lin Li clearly felt it.\nNot only was he stronger, but even when he punched his legs hard, the pain was less than before.\nIt seemed the strength enhancement was quite hardcore, with defense included.\nNow, if Lin Li were to kick the Beauty Lady in the head again, it definitely wouldn’t hurt as much as before.\nDarn, if the strength keeps increasing, wouldn’t it be disastrous if ingrown nails prevent the doctor from cutting even the nails?\nBefore Lin Li could delve deeper into this blind spot, he heard a crunching sound behind him.\nLin Li turned back, then fell into a contemplative silence.\nHu Fei was biting into pieces of the porcelain bowl.\n\"You’re... eating even that?\" Lin Li asked in astonishment.\n\"Doesn’t taste good.\" Hu Fei shook his head.\n\"Then why are you eating it?\"\n\"Brother Lin Li told me to eat it all.\" Hu Fei chewed the porcelain bowl like chocolate, showing difficulty but with determined eyes.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nHu Fei was dumb, but he was obedient.\n\"I meant for you to finish the meatballs, not the bowl. Stay here and wait for Ye Jing, I’ll be off now, see you in a few hours.\" Lin Li smiled, then dragged away the Beauty Lady along with his other gear.\n\"I bid Brother and Sister-in-law farewell on their journey.\"\n...\nJust like last time, after making preparations to return, Lin Li waited for the system to automatically send him back to reality.\n[0.01.57]\nLooking at the recorded time on the backup device, Lin Li calculated and frowned.\nThe ratio was off.\nHe stayed for five and a half hours, and according to a 1:180 ratio, about 110 seconds should have passed in reality, 1 minute and 50 seconds would be normal.\nEven if he made a mistake, the discrepancy shouldn’t be as large as a whole seven seconds.\nLin Li took out a calculator and calculated using 1 minute 57 seconds, discovering the time flow ratio became 1:169, roughly 1:170.\nThe ratio had decreased.\nWhat does this mean? Does it imply that as the system updates, the time flow would increasingly approach reality, or does this occur with more visits, or is it inherently random?\nThe system remained silent, just groveling.\nGiven the circumstances, better take a shower first.\nNo point in overthinking it, perhaps yelling at the system would be relieving.\n...\nMorning.\nAfter exercising, Lin Li carried breakfast and biked to school.\nThe somewhat old bicycle was pedaled furiously, consistently maintaining this speed.\nThough appearing to exert effort, Lin Li remained relaxed, without fatigue.\nThe physical strength enhancement indeed covered every aspect.\nEndurance, explosiveness, and jumping ability in his legs had notably increased.\nStanding long jump could reach over 3 meters without any extra effort, and for vertical jumps from a standing position, the performance was impressive — though Lin Li couldn’t measure exact numbers by himself, he could now touch a half-meter higher.\nEstimations showed it’s now possible to dunk easily.\nSigh, the time he could normally be human was already limited, soon he might not even qualify as human.\nWith his current jumping ability, coupled with his height, reach, and insight, when playing with those clumsy hand friends, wouldn’t his blocks just leave them speechless?\nLin Li decided that after the sports day ends, Bai Bufan would come to hate basketball forever.\nAims to target him.\nIsn’t cultivating just to witness Bai Bufan’s tearful expressions like flowers?\nSchool.\nAt the staircase entrance, today’s gossip, though late, was really late.\nLin Li entered from the front door and was startled by Wang Ze’s peculiar smile.\nThought it was some prank at first, but upon seeing half the boys in class wearing the same expression, he recalled it was Bufan’s laugh theory from last week’s workday start, so he followed suit with a smile.\nDamn, within this class, just a casual sentence from last week could be recalled today; good job there, but glad there’s still a chance for reassignment.\nThere’s hope.\nAs for Bai Bufan, no wonder there was no gossip today, lying on the desk sleeping pathetically.\nProbably stayed up late again last night.\nAfter giving the girls their breakfasts they asked him to buy, Lin Li cleared his throat and shouted at Bai Bufan:\n\"Bufan!\"\n\"Abandon, abandon!\" Bai Bufan jumped with a start at the call, clutched his textbook, and began reciting words, \"One bench, Abandon!\"\nThe recitation style embarrassed Koukou.\nCarefully scanning around, Bai Bufan realized it wasn’t the teacher arriving, but Lin Li calling him, and glared angrily at Lin Li, \"What!? Why!?\"\nLin Li smiled, took a breath, and began loudly chanting:\n\"I couldn’t do what you asked me last weekend. This weekend, the hotel has no waterbeds or themed rooms, and the room can only accommodate four creatures. Aren’t you making things difficult for the reception by ordering eight male companions for yourself? You’ll have to prepare the scented candles, whips, collars, and lubricants yourself, but the hotel has already printed Bao Wei’s photo on the toys for you, so you can use them directly then.\nYou didn’t respond to my message, so I can only tell you now.\"",

Get lost!\"\n\"Bufan, Bufan, you stay up late so often, I don’t even dare to imagine how short your lifespan might be. You wouldn’t want me to bury you, would you?\"\nAfter delivering breakfast and sitting back down, Lin Li’s expression began to mourn Bai Bufan’s demeanor.\n\"No worries, the lifespan lost from staying up late is made up for by the increased waking hours from staying up late,\" Bai Bufan said lazily, putting his breakfast under the table to eat it during class later, and choosing to continue lying down for a bit.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nDon’t say it, seriously, don’t say it.\nYou bunch who stay up late (pointing fingers).\n\"And I didn’t sleep well, not because of staying up late, but because I had a nightmare. Last night I dreamt I was beaten up by a group of people. After waking up scared, I went back to sleep, only to be beaten up again with them saying, ’How dare you come back?’ I was beaten so badly I couldn’t take care of myself, and overall, it didn’t feel like resting at all, like I was falling ill.\"\nBai Bufan sighed sadly.\n\"It’s okay, look on the bright side. Dreams are usually the opposite. Maybe today you’ll get beaten up by a group too,\" Lin Li consoled.\n\"What the hell, weren’t you saying the opposite? How am I still getting beaten up by a group?\"\n\"In reality, you’ll get beaten so badly you can’t even take care of yourself.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Isn’t your opposite too literal?! Damn it!\" Bai Bufan covered his head with an English book. \"Don’t wake me for morning self-study, wait until Koukou comes.\"\nBai Bufan felt a pat on his right shoulder.\nJust as he was about to curse, he recalled previous experiences. Shaking himself awake, he looked to his right rear with a fawning smile, remembering the lesson of ’I sent Xue Jian a lesson’.\nDamn it.\nIt was still Lin Li OvO.\nIn fact, Xue Jian didn’t enter the classroom until the first bell of the class meeting, sitting on the lectern table and taking a sip of tea.\n\"Class meeting, let’s talk about a few things.\"\n\"The school checked the weather and saw that for a few days starting the day after tomorrow, it will be nice and not rainy, with some clouds, which is great for holding a sports event.\"\n\"So, our first and last high school sports event for class four is starting the day after tomorrow.\"\n\"I know most of you have your cell phones with you this week. If you have them, hand them over now.\"\nThe routine phone collection session.\nLin Li looked over at Bai Bufan after hearing this.\nBai Bufan, confident and graceful, calmly took out a model phone from his bag, flashed it before Lin Li, and handed it in boldly.\nOn the way back, he gave Lin Li a devilish smile.\n\"Prepared, early, accurate.\" This is what it means to learn from experience —\n\"Bufan, take back your model phone and hand in your real one.\"\nBai Bufan’s steps stopped, and his smile shifted onto Lin Li’s face.\nTurning his head slowly, Bai Bufan tried to play dumb: \"Huh?\"\nHowever, Xue Jian just held the ’phone’ Bai Bufan handed in, pressing the power button for a long moment, and smiled at him after seeing no reaction.\nWith Principal Wang’s expectations to uphold, Xue Jian had a reason to keep an eye on Bai Bufan!!\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"Damn it.\"\nHis scheme exposed, Bai Bufan admitted defeat willingly and handed over his actual phone.\n\"Why is Old Jian always checking my phone?!\" Bai Bufan said unwillingly, as in contrast to Xue Jian’s indifferent attitude towards the other phones handed in, he felt clearly singled out.\n\"Because you have poor integrity,\" Lin Li sneered. \"If you acted decently like me now and then, you wouldn’t simply do indecent things.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nSome people have no self-awareness, doesn’t matter who says it.\nDamn it, if Lin Li ever stayed in the dorms with a phone, Bai Bufan couldn’t even imagine how it would be carefully guarded.\n\"Anyone who needs to charge their phone, let me know,\" Xue Jian stood up after collecting the phones and said, \"I’ll take these to the office first. Yu Ying, you can share what you wanted to say with everyone.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nXue Jian left with a bag of phones, and Chen Yu Ying went up to the lectern.\n\"Everyone, I mainly wanted to bring up that I’ve noticed other classes rehearsing for an opening ceremony performance, and I was wondering if our class should do something as well. Otherwise, our class would just be circling the track aimlessly during the opening ceremony, which might be a bit boring.\nSadly, this idea came up a bit late, and the sports event is scheduled for this week. We can only brainstorm together to see if there’s a last-minute solution. If we can’t put a performance together, we can focus on our attire.\"\nChen Yu Ying said.\n\"What’s an opening ceremony performance? Is it by class?\" someone asked out of curiosity.\n\"Hold on, I’ll find a video from last year.\"\nChen Yu Ying opened the multimedia equipment and played a video of last year’s sports day opening ceremony.\nDuring the opening ceremony, each class marched past the main platform, and the announcer would say that the class approaching is High Year XX Class, brimming with enthusiasm and style, etc. Then, each class would shout a class slogan to the principal and other leaders upon reaching the platform.\nThis is when classes could choose to stop on the platform to ’perform.’\nThe performances were not only for the teachers but also for other classes waiting on the field.\nBased on past recordings.\nSome classes sent out a few people or even the whole class to dance, others performed a skit without dialogue, and some even danced dragon and lion dances in front of the platform.\nWhen the music for \"You’re So Beautiful\" played in the video, the boys in the back row felt a bit dazed.\nWhat year is it now?\nIn this era where Kun dancing has faded, it’s touching that seniors last year were keeping the spirit alive.\nTeary-eyed.\nOf course, these opening ceremony performances weren’t compulsory, otherwise, Wang Ze would have informed everyone a week ago. Actually, many classes just shouted a slogan and passed on to the next class.\n\"The school says that if there is a performance, it shouldn’t exceed three minutes. After watching, does anyone have suggestions or anyone willing to volunteer to perform?\" Chen Yu Ying asked.\nThe slightly noisy group immediately quieted down.\nTime was too tight. A full rehearsal wasn’t possible, and it was difficult for those willing to perform to come up with a program everyone’s okay with on short notice.\nSeeing that Chen Yu Ying’s words were going to fall flat, Lin Li couldn’t stand it. Despite not knowing what to do, he loudly said:\n\"Class President, I have an idea!\"\nThe entire class looked over at Lin Li.\n\"Don’t harm Bai Bufan,\" Bai Bufan warned cautiously.\n\"Then I have no idea,\" Lin Li instantly deflated like a popped balloon.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nYou damn idiot.\n\"Lin Li, go ahead,\" Chen Yu Ying smiled at him.\n\"I have a script for a stage play, and I already decided on the content: ’The Great Traitor Bufan,’\" Lin Li said enthusiastically.\n\"Why is my role already fixed! Baka yarou, I’m not playing a traitor! Your wicked heart!\" Bai Bufan widened his eyes.\nHe’s so angry he could turn into a ghost.\n\"Bufan, you don’t have to play a traitor. You just play yourself,\" Lin Li said with gentle affection, then looked at the class to recruit other roles: \"We still need five big men, preferably with dark skin. Any volunteers?\"\nThe class went silent.\nBai Bufan started to think.\nWhat does playing himself mean, recruiting big men now?\nBai Bufan: ⊙.⊙.\nWait a minute.\nNo!\nWait!!\nYou damn great traitor Bufan!\nSo it wasn’t a verb-object structure but a subject-verb-object, was it?!",

Being the person who loves to stand firmly behind his brother, he immediately stood up to be the first to take the plunge.\nHe had to consider whether this was his only chance to play a traitor Bufan in his lifetime.\n\"Just rounding off, I can also count as a dark-skinned sports student. Please let me be one of the five big men! I beg you!\"\nSo, Wang Ze bowed ninety degrees towards Lin Li’s position, reaching out a hand as if confessing:\n\"Please entrust everything to me.\"\nBai Bufan: \"ಠ_ಠ.\"\nInsane.\nAnd Lin Li was moved to tears.\nZhou Baowei was also moved by these deep words and sighed from the side: \"I thought Wang Ze’s confession was already awkward, but when I looked down, something even more awkward came up.\"\nBai Bufan: \"(;゜○゜)?\"\n\"So, I can’t shirk it either. Whether it’s big or not is another story, but I have to be a part of it!\"\nActually, many times, sacrifices are just like leaving a party, many people are willing, they just lack a leader.\nThus, when Wang Ze had already taken the lead, Zhou Baowei stood up to follow closely behind him.\nHe turned his head to look at Bai Bufan: \"Don’t worry, I’ll lose weight these days.\"\nBai Bufan: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nWatching the boys in the class starting to enthusiastically sign up for this stage play, Bai Bufan kept silent, only twisting his expression.\nHe was really full of sweat.\nDamn it, don’t be so enthusiastic over such weird things!\nNo, you’d better just be enthusiastic in a good way!!\n\"Still, let me play the traitor. Lin Li, I’m begging you, I suddenly remember that I was a traitor in my past life and got shot dead, I’m the most suitable to play the traitor, yo si yo si, I’m the lackey of the devils.\"\nBai Bufan looked at the instigator Lin Li beside him with regret and sincerity, begging.\nBut Lin Li remained silent, only recruiting big strong men.\n\"Damn!\"\n\"Class rep, that’s it, the actor script is ready, they can rehearse in the dormitory tonight.\" Lin Li said to Chen Yu Ying.\nChen Yu Ying pressed her lips with the back of her hand while laughing and shook her head: \"Lin Li, this won’t pass the review.\"\n\"It’s fine, I know Principal Wang, we get along okay, he even praised me, so the review is practically in-house.\" Lin Li expressed there was no harm, confident of his connections.\nBai Bufan felt a bit nauseous listening, having found someone thicker-skinned than Zhou Baowei.\nAnd just what kind of rehearsal is this damn thing?\nChen Yu Ying naturally wouldn’t believe Lin Li’s nonsense, smiling steadfastly and shaking her head.\nLin Li had no choice but to give up, and everyone continued to watch the video from last year’s performance, fast-forwarding for inspiration.\nThere was even a class performing a Chaplin-style silent comedy, dressed specifically in black and white costumes.\n\"Lin Li, if the mime master is performing on stage and I drink an invisible potion, go up, cover his mouth and punch him, would the audience think it’s part of the performance and applaud?\"\nBai Bufan watched on, curiously inquiring.\n\"Who says there are no real devils in the world.\" Lin Li gave a thumbs up.\nAfter drinking an invisible potion and not going for Happy Hero, but thinking about this, Bai Bufan is certainly something else in this life too.\nBut then Lin Li also got into thinking: \"Hey, Bufan, after drinking the invisible potion, if you close your eyes, can you still see things through your eyelids?\"\nBai Bufan was stunned for a moment, then also began to ponder.\nGood question.\n\"Or does anyone in our class know how to dance? We could do something like this class, with a few people dancing in the center and others doing simple dance moves around them, that could be quite interesting too.\"\nAfter pausing, Chen Yu Ying looked at the screen and asked the class.\nWhen asked about specific talents, unlike before, two girls in the class raised their hands.\n\"Anyone else?\"\nLin Li smiled helplessly.\nClass rep, when you asked, was it not appropriate to keep looking at yourself?\nEvery time you lower your head and look up, why does your gaze become even more intense?\n\"I can also dance a bit.\"\nSeeing her still staring, Lin Li raised his hand with a face full of amused helplessness.\nFolks, isn’t this just silent coercion and bullying?\nNever mind, since Chen Yu Ying wants it, really making Lin Li perform ballet in front of everyone isn’t a problem.\nBallet itself isn’t exclusively a female dance form, and actually, many moves, paired with loose casual wear, can be quite elegant when performed by men.\nBut either way, Chen Yu Ying is bad, and I’m good.\nThe classmates, upon hearing this, all curiously focused their gaze back on Lin Li.\nAnother expert?\n\"I have a new content proposal!\" At this time, a voice sounded clear in the classroom.\nEveryone looked over and found it was Wang Yuezhi.\nWang Yuezhi pointed at one of the classes on the multimedia screen: \"Their class is just simply doing some acrobatics, right?\"\nChen Yu Ying fast-forwarded a few clips upon hearing and indeed, it was so.\n\"Just so happens, I learned a lot of new tricks this weekend, and if no one minds, I can put on a performance for the whole school, while it may be hard to win over all the applause, it surely won’t make anyone embarrassed.\"\nWang Yuezhi, as a man among men, a male among males, decisively stood up at this moment.\n\"Even the costume and props I have prepared myself, so no need for additional setup, saving our class some budget.\"\nWang Yuezhi’s heart was far from being as calm as his words suggested.",

Wang Yuezhi couldn’t guess?\nIsn’t it just to dance with Chen Yu Ying, shamelessly pretending to know how to dance when he doesn’t?

Last week during the tug of war, his performance made Chen Yu Ying smile at him four times.\nIt’s a good opportunity to continue the effort and create more glory.\n\"This class performance format is indeed fun.\" Lin Li watched the multimedia for a while and acknowledged.\nAnyway, it’s better than dancing.\n——not caring is one thing, but it’s better not to dance if possible.\n\"I support Wang Yuezhi, not talking about costumes and props, he’s still skilled, doesn’t even need rehearsal.\" So Lin Li said.\n\"But if it’s only Wang Yuezhi, when facing or showing the back to the platform, one side won’t be able to see anything.\" Chen Yu Ying didn’t actually mind, but raised a minor point.\n\"Just like this class, rent a few inflatable mascot outfits, then have a few people wear them, simply swaying around me counts as a performance, while also helping me hold and give some props.\" Wang Yuezhi said seriously.\n\"If it doesn’t work, anyway, we aren’t running these two days, Chen Tianming can learn some acrobatics from me during this time, if he can learn it, we can perform back-to-back, ensuring that both front and back face an audience.\nHe’s got good potential, I respect him, he can become a clown similar to me.\"\nWith the sports meet starting the day after tomorrow, even the athletes won’t be doing high-intensity exercises these days, maybe some simple jogging, indeed can take it easy.\nAt this moment, Chen Tianming, resting his face on one hand, looked out the window yearning for a wonderful life with Qiaoqiao.\nWho just mentioned my name?\nNot sure, listen more.\n\"No?!\" Once confirmed, Chen Tianming abruptly turned back, pointing at Wang Yuezhi, \"Wang Yuezhi, stop spouting nonsense, who said I have potential, I’m not like you!\"\nTrust me, brother, Qiaoqiao is really different.\nHearing such a voice, Wang Yuezhi turned to glance at Chen Tianming.\nNo anger from being scolded, his eyes were full of a senior’s admiration and reassurance for a promising successor.\nChen Tianming: \"?\"\nWhat kind of gaze is that?\nMight as well scold me.\n\"I won’t perform, I can’t be a clown.\" Chen Tianming didn’t think Qiaoqiao would like this, so he shook his head firmly like a rattle.\nWang Yuezhi sighed.\nNow he understood how those elderly felt watching the young waste their talent, it’s truly a pity.\n\"I nominate Lin Li, wouldn’t be as funny as the Great Qing’s top killer taking the stage?\" Bai Bufan instigated at this time.\nIt’s about time for Lin Li to die.\nCan’t be him harming others all the time.\n\"Lin Li? Okay.\" Wang Yuezhi turned his head and watched Lin Li on the other side for a while, frowning and said.\nThough he didn’t think Lin Li had a clown’s talent, he was willing to accept.\nBecause through this opportunity, they could judge, see the difference.\nWith the bond of the red nose personally handed by Chen Yu Ying, he will definitely not lose.\nFacing Wang Yuezhi’s strange gaze, Lin Li pointed to himself: \"Me?\"\n\"You.\" Wang Yuezhi nodded, displaying the composure of a strong person: \"Of course, you can choose to refuse.\"\n\"I don’t mind.\" Lin Li shrugged.\nThe acrobatics Wang Yuezhi can do aren’t difficult, with his body coordination and ability, learning it seemed easy.\n\"If there are two performing front and back, plus mascot dance partners, setting a humorous and playful tone, even if there’s a mistake during the performance, it could appear as part of the design, seems good, so shall we?\"\nWatching as the situation took an unexpected turn, Chen Yu Ying blinked and concluded.\nThe plan to see Lin Li dance ballet failed, it seems it’s time to try again next time.\nEveryone had no objections.\nThus, in the upcoming class meeting, everyone began discussing around the acrobat theme, how to arrange the rented inflatable mascot suits appropriately in the lineup.\nGradually, a basic plan took shape, more awaited for Wednesday’s freestyle innovation.\nEssentially, it’s to create fun memories, whether it ends up messed up or perfect, there’s meaning in it.\nUntil the end of the class meeting’s bell, everyone reluctantly ended the discussion.\nBai Bufan stretched lazily, ready to continue sleeping, but curiously asked:\n\"By the way, Lin Li, can you dance? What dance do you do?\"\n\"Certainly the cool street dance that boys often learn which can dazzle countless girls, not the sensuous ballet generally learned and performed by girls, of course not, I wouldn’t learn that.\" Lin Li responded immediately.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nOkay, learned what Lin Li can do.\nAt this point, Wang Yuezhi also came over, proactively sought Lin Li, briefly and directly:",

I’ll apply for a room, and then teach you everything I know. I won’t hold back because I don’t want my victory to be undeserved.\"\nWang Yuezhi’s tone was cold but confident. After speaking, he left without looking back, his swagger akin to a wanderer drifting the earth.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWhat was that gibberish? What does ’victory undeserved’ mean?\n\"Is Wang Yuezhi planning to teach you everything he knows? Interesting, Lin Li, don’t let him turn you into a puff pastry,\" Bai Bufan said, looking up after hearing.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWell, right now, there’s no time to deal with Bai Bufan’s reinterpretations. Lin Li has something more important to address:\n\"Wang Yuezhi! Wang Yuezhi! Wait!\"\n\"Can we change the time? Noon is when I have a set study session with the class monitor.\"\n\"How about afternoon? Self-study in the evening? During the English class?\"\nWang Yuezhi’s steps paused momentarily. Although he heard, he didn’t respond and shuffled back to his place.\nIn this all-or-nothing duel, Wang Yuezhi felt his chances of thoroughly defeating Lin Li and proving who the true clown king was had increased slightly.\n— He had gained a deeper understanding of clowns.\n...\nNoon.\nLin Li arrived as promised.\nNo choice—asked Wang Yuezhi in the morning to pick another time. This guy just ignored him.\nHad to temporarily abandon Chen Yu Ying.\nAfter all, Wang Yuezhi was his real lunchtime buddy, not like that fake friend Bai Bufan.\nThe two went to the art building. Wang Yuezhi used a key to open a spacious practice room.\n\"Lin Li, what’s your understanding of clowns?\" Wang Yuezhi set down a large bag he had brought on the table, sat across from Lin Li, and asked seriously.\nLin Li blinked, somewhat confused by the setup and the question. After thinking for a moment, he replied, \"Clowns... are just clowns? Their thoughts make people laugh?\"\nWang Yuezhi laughed softly upon hearing this.\nHe looked at Lin Li with a hint of disdain.\nThis guy probably would never threaten his clown position.\nDifferent paths, no collaboration—Lin Li’s answer left Wang Yuezhi disinterested. He opened his backpack and took things out, sticking to routine:\n\"See here. Which one do you want to learn first?\"\nJugglings balls, long balloons, playing cards, unicycle...\nWait, where the heck did that unicycle come from?\n\"You can do this too?\" Lin Li pointed to the unicycle and asked.\nWang Yuezhi, hearing Lin Li’s shocked gaze, was a bit proud and smug, suppressing his laughter, nodding:\n\"I just bought and learned it last weekend. Found out I have talent in this area—mastered it in ten-some hours.\"\nSaying this, Wang Yuezhi took out the unicycle, unfolded it, set it down, and started riding.\nWhile not perfectly smooth, Wang Yuezhi could indeed ride—without looking unskilled.\nMoreover, during his ride, Wang Yuezhi even started juggling balls.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nNo way, man.\nYou really got this down?\nJust last week’s tug-of-war finale, you couldn’t even do this stuff.\nNoticing Lin Li’s gaze, Wang Yuezhi smiled.\n\"While you’re wasting your weekend wondering what to do, I’m working hard,\" he said casually.\nLin Li started mindfully scrutinizing where he wasted his weekend.\nOh, he hung out with Chen Yu Ying.\nHer fault.\n\"If you’re performing that, I’m not sure I’ll be able to replicate your entire show back-to-back on the day.\" Lin Li modestly remarked.\nIndeed, there was a touch of humility—Lin Li felt he could definitely learn it in two days, but performing while riding on the day might be too risky for errors.\n\"I understand. I’ll go easy on you,\" Wang Yuezhi seemed considerate of his buddy Lin Li, tossing the juggling balls to him: \"Start with the basics first. Let’s see how much you learned in these two days, and then decide on Wednesday’s performance format.\"\n\"Okay.\" Lin Li caught the juggling balls and began trying to juggle.\nHis first attempt predictably failed—couldn’t keep even three balls in cycle.\nMind you, Wang Yuezhi had already reached four-ball Great Perfection, nearly glimpsing into the five-ball realm.\nIn the clown world, skill reigns supreme—\n\"Teach me your tricks! Master!\" Lin Li sincerely pleaded.\n\"I’ll do it, Lin Li. Remember, juggling balls shouldn’t be viewed as a mere trick—they should enchant the audience to forget to breathe,\" Wang Yuezhi said as he started teaching, his tone shifting, \"Your red nose is your third eye. Align the throws along the parabola, let your nose sense the balls’ trajectory.\nYour hands must be nimble. While learning, silently recite the chant in your heart: catch, throw, catch, throw—left, right, left, right!\"\nSaying this, Wang Yuezhi began to demonstrate.\nLin Li’s aptitude and control soon kicked in. Within minutes, he was able to keep three balls moving in cycle.\nHe started practicing juggling while walking.\nWang Yuezhi nodded—such a rival at least had potential and wasn’t a complete waste.\nBut he still felt something was missing.\nBeing a seasoned clown, he quickly identified the key issue.\n\"Lin Li, you’re doing it wrong.\" Wang Yuezhi stopped him from continuing practice.\n\"Hm? What’s wrong?\" Lin Li caught the balls, humbly inquiring.\n\"Your expression is wrong.\" Wang Yuezhi shook his head.\n\"Expression? What’s wrong with my expression? I don’t have any expression.\" There was a mirrored wall in the practice room. Lin Li looked at it, not seeing what was off about his expression.\n\"No expression is the problem!\" Wang Yuezhi sighed in disappointment, \"As a clown, how can you be expressionless? An expressionless clown—can you still call that a clown?\"\n\"So what kind of expression should I have?\" Lin Li asked.\nWang Yuezhi took the balls from Lin Li and began juggling, his face gradually changing.\nLin Li’s eyes gradually widened.\nThis face was like a fire-punch—how is Wang Yuezhi, you rascal, so skilled at showing that face? And how was he exuding that clownish aura?\nWhat just happened—was it illusion technique?\nLin Li understood Wang Yuezhi’s meaning now.\nBecause with Wang Yuezhi’s current expression, Lin Li felt like laughing just watching.\nThis is the clown’s soul...\nTerrifying!\n\"Got it?\" Wang Yuezhi asked calmly after stopping.\nLin Li adjusted his face not to laugh, forcing a stern expression and nodded: \"I think I got it, let me try.\"\nTaking back the balls, Lin Li started performing.\n\"What kind of a lousy expression is that? That’s not a clown!\" After looking a few times, Wang Yuezhi couldn’t bear to watch, rubbing his forehead in exasperation.\nIt was a disgrace to clowns.\nLin Li looked at the mirror; indeed, there was a noticeable gap compared to Wang Yuezhi.\n\"How should I adjust my features to get the right expression?\" Lin Li could only ask.\n\"No need to focus on adjusting your features consciously. Doing so will just reveal a contrived artisan vibe. The best expression is to adjust your inner self, and let your face adjust on its own—then it’s natural, that’s a clown,\" Wang Yuezhi explained, slipping back into that expression.\nEffortless mastery.\nIt seemed he reached the summit.\nLin Li blinked, puzzled: \"...How do I adjust my inner self?\"\n\"That’s even simpler—playing a role is just playing a role. We need to stop acting and become a clown. To reach that, just recall some heartbreaking moments in your mind,\" Wang Yuezhi shared his secret.\n\"Heartbreaking moments? How so?\" But Lin Li, as always, couldn’t understand.\n\"Just recall some scene of a girl you like rejecting and ignoring you, wouldn’t that work?\" Wang Yuezhi frowned, further perplexed by Lin Li’s question.\nLin Li scratched his head; after a few seconds, he spoke: \"No such scene in my memories.\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\n\"No? How is that possible?\"\n\"Really, I don’t have any.\" Lin Li seemed innocent.\nBefore high school, the 2D roast chicken world never betrayed him. After high school, the trench system started grooming him. Though Lin Li never succeeded, he also never failed.\nAs long as he wasn’t attacking romance head-on, he could remain undefeated forever.\n\"Not once?\"\n\"Not once.\"\nLin Li’s demeanor and tone didn’t seem staged.\nSo Wang Yuezhi stared at Lin Li.\n—\"(;☉_☉)?\"\nQuiet, I’m thinking.\nThinking.\nThinking TAT.\nCrying out loud, crying TAT!\nCrying Lin Li, crying your mom crying TAT.",

      "content": "Chapter 346: Chapter 252: Efficiency reaching a certain level is essentially ineffective growth; slightly lower is better.\nWang Yuezhi suddenly felt that he could recall and utilize the current scene when playing the clown the day after tomorrow.\nDamn, even more heartbroken.\nThe clown potion really melts as soon as it enters the mouth.\nSo Wang Yuezhi didn’t want to discuss this topic any further, waved his hand dismissively, and cursed with a cold face:\n\"Without this scene, can’t you just create and imagine this scene in your mind? Can’t improvise even a bit? Useless, lifeless guy who’s never had this kind of experience...\"\n\"Mentor, please elaborate, what kind of scenes should I imagine? You seem to have a lot of experience.\"\nLin Li, who was scolded, wasn’t annoyed but continued to humbly seek advice.\nWang Yuezhi: \"...\"\nYour mom.\nWang Yuezhi took a deep breath, hesitated several times, and finally spoke: \"I actually don’t have much experience, but my friend does in this area. He taught me a lot.\"\n\"The meaning of learning is in passing on, so now I’ll pass on the secrets my friend told me to you. You’d better not embarrass me the day after tomorrow.\"\n\"Understood, Mentor!\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"I’ll just give you a few scenarios.\" Wang Yuezhi began describing how the brain should create settings during a clown performance:\n\"My friend told me, for example, when taking pictures, you think a girl is taking photos of you and tells you to look at the camera, but when you give a scissors hand, it turns out she’s actually taking pictures of the people behind you.\"\nLin Li suddenly realized.\nThis event is also recorded in Lin Li’s memory.\nNo wonder the last time Wang Yuezhi suddenly scratched his head in front of me, and used a scissors hand gesture to scratch it.\nI thought at the time he wanted a haircut because he felt his hair was long.\nTurns out it was like this.\n\"And for instance, my friend told me, a girl suddenly calls your name, you look up excitedly, but she actually wanted you to pass something to another guy.\"\nLin Li suddenly realized.\nThis event is also recorded in Lin Li’s memory.\nThe last time I got Chen Yu Ying’s workbook for proofreading, Wang Yuezhi handed it to me with a grumpy face.\n\"For example, my friend told me,\nA girl you like shyly approaches you over the weekend and says ’I want to go to the movies with someone I like... are you free tonight?’\nYou excitedly respond ’Free! Free! Of course I’m free!’ You do seven or eight somersaults on your bed, start preparing clothes to wear when going out, but when you’re ready and check your phone—\nThe girl’s message says ’Great, then please help with the class statistics table tonight, thank you, friend of Wang Yuezhi.’\nAt this time, you actually want to say ’Sorry, I just got notified I’d have to perform in a circus temporarily, no time,’ but in the end, because of that liking, you don’t send it.\"\nWang Yuezhi’s speech got slower and sadder.\nLin Li suddenly... wait, how come Lin Li doesn’t recall this?\n\"There’s something like this?\" Lin Li frowned and asked.\nChen Yu Ying personally handles matters related to the class and wouldn’t pass responsibilities to others just to go out, moreover, I’ve never gone to the movies with her.\n\"This is a memory from my friend’s junior high school time.\" Wang Yuezhi explained.\nLin Li suddenly understood.\nSo that friend of Wang Yuezhi’s has been doing this since junior high, not just starting to be a clown in high school.\nReasonable.\nUnderstood.\nSo Lin Li nodded to signal Wang Yuezhi to continue.\n\"My friend told me...\"\n\"My friend told me...\"\nWang Yuezhi kept on going; the scenarios from his friend seemed endless.\nHonestly, Lin Li really wanted to meet this friend of Wang Yuezhi’s because Lin Li discovered too many similarities in their experiences, there must be many common topics to talk about.\nBut noticing that as Wang Yuezhi continued, his expression looked more like he was reenacting \"It: Chapter Two\", Lin Li was concerned that furthering it might make Wang Yuezhi cry for his friend, thus he gestured for him to pause.\nLin Li nodded:\n\"That’s enough, Mentor, I think I got a bit of a feel for it.\"\nThe desolate Wang Yuezhi rubbed the corners of his eyes, nodded: \"As long as you feel it, it’s not in vain for my friend’s memories. Start performing then, don’t disappoint me and my friend.\"\n\"Mm!\"\nScene, construct!\nMind, puzzle!\nThe brain quickly spinning, Lin Li swiftly asked:\n\"Mentor, how is my expression now? Do I have the soul of a clown?\"\nWang Yuezhi squinted his eyes, staring at Lin Li, or to be precise, at the gradually rising corners of Lin Li’s mouth.\n\"?\"\n\"Wait! Lin Li, are you fucking laughing!?\"\n\"Hahaha, damn, I’m sorry, Mentor, when these scenarios appear in my mind, I can’t hold it back.\" As soon as Wang Yuezhi asked, Lin Li burst into laughter.\nThe same scenarios recreated, the perspective Lin Li inserted into was a bit different from that of Wang Yuezhi’s friend.\nIt’s truly hilarious.\n\"Can you still laugh!?\"\nWang Yuezhi who just had red eyes and nose now blushed from temperature.\nAfter this period of study, he had really developed some interest in the clown profession, otherwise, he wouldn’t learn these techniques.\nHe can accept a talentless student, but cannot tolerate a student who disrespects clowns!\nWithout contrast, there’s no harm.\n...If...if it were Chen Tianming... it wouldn’t be like this, right...Chen Tianming...why did you waste your talent...\nSeeing Wang Yuezhi so sad, Lin Li gave himself a slap.\nRecognizing his own folly, Lin Li held back his laughter and forced a serious tone:\n\"I’m sorry Mentor, I’ll try again.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Pfft—hahaha—\"\n\"...\"\n\"Stop it, Lin Li, I don’t want to teach you anymore, you’re not good at this at all.\" Seeing Lin Li’s expression still devoid of soul, showing no progress, Wang Yuezhi felt a deep sense of despair, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and said decadently.",

If I stop, I’ll never get good at it! The word ’abandon’ doesn’t even exist in my dictionary!\" Lin Li responded immediately.\nWang Yuezhi raised an eyebrow.\nYep, if you give up just because you think you’re not good, you’ll never be good. The best time to plant a tree was ten years ago, the second best time is now.\nLin Li’s learning spirit is indeed commendable.\nI was a bit too judgmental, Wang Yuezhi thought as he looked at Lin Li—\n·Fuck·your·mother.\n·Still·laughing.\nScrew your learning spirit, you bastard!!\nAre you getting all hot-blooded at a flea market or something?!\n\"You can’t be a clown, go back and do what you’re supposed to do.\" At this point, Wang Yuezhi’s voice became extremely cold, his goodwill toward Lin Li completely doubling.\n——Goodwill went from minus 100 to minus 200, it definitely doubled.\nHe took the unicycle to the empty area of the activity room and started practicing on his own, not even glancing at Lin Li.\nUseless.\nTrash.\nFor the first time, Lin Li was rejected so thoroughly, he got up in a daze: \"Maybe Wang Yuezhi is right, I can’t be a clown. It’s time to go back and study with the class monitor, she might be feeling quite bored alone in the classroom.\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\nWait.\nYour mom.\n\"Lin Li, come back! I suddenly realized I can take back what I said! Come back!\" The training over the past two weeks paid off, and Wang Yuezhi immediately ran over to block the door, nodding earnestly at Lin Li, \"Lin Li, let’s keep practicing!\"\n\"But I can’t be a clown with a soul.\" Lin Li said sadly.\n\"Never let anyone tell you what you can and cannot do!\" Wang Yuezhi patted Lin Li’s shoulder heavily a few times and encouraged him loudly, \"I have an idol called Beethoven, everyone said he couldn’t become a great musician, but he never listened!\nLin Li, you should be the same. I deny you not because I want you to give up, but to strengthen your resolve! Don’t waste my efforts!\"\nWang Yuezhi’s words resonated deeply, and Lin Li, somewhat rejuvenated, remembered something and squinted his eyes.\nWait.\n\"Wasn’t Beethoven deaf?\"\nWang Yuezhi waved dismissively, \"That doesn’t matter.\"\nLin Li: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nWhat the hell.\nIsn’t that really important?!\nIndeed, Beethoven couldn’t hear others’ denial because he literally couldn’t hear!!\n\"Forget it, I can’t do it, sorry for disappointing you, Wang Yuezhi.\" Thus, the motivation failed, and Lin Li waved his hand, still thinking he wasn’t cut out for it.\n\"You can do it, you really can! At least by noon, you must be able to!\" Wang Yuezhi shook his head like a rattle drum, quickly speaking after thinking on his feet, \"Lin Li, the lack of expression isn’t that big of a deal, although it lacks soul, the day after tomorrow in that scenario won’t need much soul.\nFirst, whether it’s the teachers on stage or the students below, they won’t see clearly.\nSecond, second... let me think, right! Second, the soul can be shown through makeup at that time, as long as you match it with the right clown outfit and clown makeup, there won’t be much difference.\nSo we’ll ignore the expression part, soul is a bonus, not a necessity. Two days to learn this was indeed too harsh, my fault, let’s focus only on technique now! How about it!\"\nWang Yuezhi firmly blocked the door, preventing Lin Li from leaving, and continued to emphasize in a rushed tone:\n\"Lin Li, aside from the soul, you’re the most talented person I’ve ever seen. You absolutely have to be a good clown!\"\nLin Li: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nLook at what pressure has made him say.\nBut Lin Li wasn’t insisting on leaving anymore.\nAfter all, he promised in the morning, so he really shouldn’t give up halfway.\n\"Makes some sense, let’s keep trying!\"\nSeeing Lin Li wasn’t planning to leave anymore, Wang Yuezhi let out a sigh of relief:\n\"Since we’re talking about it, let’s also discuss costumes, our heights and builds are different, so the costumes don’t need to be the same. But if you need, I can send you the link to mine.\"\n\"Thanks, mentor, but aren’t performance outfits the class monitor’s responsibility? She’ll surely help me pick one when she rents the inflatable costumes, if you want to talk about style, mention it to her, but you can send me the makeup template.\" Lin Li explained upon hearing.\n\"...\"\nWang Yuezhi: (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ︵┻━┻.\nCrap, crap, crap! Forgot that Chen Yu Ying’s in charge of costumes!\nIf I don’t have my own clown outfit bought, would Chen Yu Ying rent one for me too...?\nDoes it seem too deliberate if I go back and mention it now?\nIf I burn the dorm, can I rationally have new clothes?\n\"Wang Yuezhi? Wang Yuezhi?\" Seeing Wang Yuezhi zoning out, Lin Li waved a hand in front of him.\nNo response.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, your clown nose fell off.\" Intending to continue calling him, Lin Li noticed a spot of red with his peripheral vision, looked down, and saw a clown nose on the floor.\nIt must have accidentally fallen out when Wang Yuezhi was retrieving something from his bag, so Lin Li said as he reached out to pick it up.\n\"Don’t move!\"\nWang Yuezhi finally reacted, stopped Lin Li with a loud shout, then squatted to pick up the nose and blew off the dust on it.\n\"This nose, hehe.\" Wang Yuezhi looked at the nose with a story and suddenly got happy.\nLin Li wouldn’t have such a nose.\nNice.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWhy the hell are you giggling like a fool?",

I’ll teach you the unicycle. Try it out—if you can learn, great; if not, we’ll set it so we are clowns with different styles, performing entirely different acts for an asymmetric beauty,\" Wang Yuezhi said while tidying up the props on site.\n\"Sure,\" Lin Li readily agreed.\n\"I’ll go return the key.\" After locking the activity room door, Wang Yuezhi headed straight for the first floor.\nLin Li went straight back to the classroom.\nWhen he returned to the classroom, only Chen Yu Ying was there.\nUsually, during lunchtime, the classroom was filled with the three-musketeers, but now the two boys had gone off together, leaving her alone.\n\"Class President, how does it feel to be left alone?\" Lin Li walked over and plopped down on Ding Sihan’s desk, asking with a smile.\n\"Very quiet, nobody poking me or asking questions constantly, so efficient for studying. I can even take a nap without worrying about someone playing with my hair next to me. It’s very peaceful.\"\nChen Yu Ying looked up, clenched her fists, rubbed her cheeks, tilted her head slightly, blinked, and spoke with a smile.\n\"So Wang Yuezhi is usually such a pest and doesn’t keep his hands clean? I have to say, Class President, I actually feel the same way as you, he’s a pest,\" Lin Li frowned upon hearing this, nodding in agreement.\nThe more Lin Li thought about it, the angrier he got. This Wang Yuezhi really is an asshole.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nIs that understanding correct?\nBut quickly, Chen Yu Ying burst into laughter; the response was so typical of Lin Li.\nAs Chen Yu Ying’s laughter echoed, Lin Li looked at her again, guiding:\n\"Class President, let’s not mention Wang Yuezhi anymore. The benefits of his absence are well-known and don’t need further explanation. What I want to know is the downside of my absence, emphasis on downside.\"\n\"Well, it’s a bit boring and feels unusual.\"\nFacing Lin Li’s anticipation, Chen Yu Ying nodded with a smile.\nWithout the occasional elbow jabs, she couldn’t look forward to the completely unpredictable but surely interesting words that would follow—it’s dull.\nWhen taking a nap and waking up, turning her head to see that particularly guilty-looking face—it’s dull.\nBy the way, why does Lin Li seem a bit more good-looking?\nAs for efficiency and such, when you’re already this smart, what’s the point of being so efficient? A little lower is fine.\n\"Bingo!\" Lin Li snapped his fingers, nodding contentedly, \"That’s exactly what I wanted to hear. Say more next time, sounds good, love to hear it.\"\nChen Yu Ying clicked her tongue and then asked, \"Lin Li, how’s it going, are you ready to perform the day after tomorrow?\"\n\"You can always trust me because I’m invincible,\" Lin Li replied in a Zhoushu accent, then remembered something and looked at Chen Yu Ying:\n\"Oh, right, Class President, can you help me with the clown makeup the day after tomorrow?\"\n\"Of course I can.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded in agreement first, then asked with a slight smile, \"But Lin Li, your own makeup skills shouldn’t be bad, right? Maybe you’re even better than me.\"\nThe number one killer of the Great Qing will always be the number one killer in her mind.\nLin Li sneered contemptuously, waved a finger in front of him, and explained seriously:\n\"Wrong, Class President, drawing ’funny’ and drawing ’ridiculous’ are completely different.\"\n\"I hope I’m funny, but I don’t want to be ridiculous. So even though I might have a natural talent, I prefer not to use it if I can.\"\nHearing this, Chen Yu Ying’s lips first curled slightly upward, then she lightly covered her mouth with her hand, trying to hide her smile.\n\"Heh—\" Her slightly trembling shoulders were proof that she was holding back her laughter, but unfortunately, her amusement still seeped out through her fingers, gently echoing through the classroom.\n\"Do you have an opinion, Class President?\" In the cold air, Lin Li’s whole body trembled with anger at this laughter, so he questioned with a cold smile.\n\"Absolutely not.\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head with a smile and even playfully saluted, \"Task received, so come early the day after tomorrow morning and wait for me on the first floor of our dorm building? Or the classroom is fine too, I’ll bring the makeup stuff.\"\n\"Then let’s meet downstairs at your dorm building. Bringing stuff to the classroom would be troublesome for you, and I can use this chance to scout the terrain of the girls’ dormitory for future raids,\" Lin Li said immediately upon hearing this.\nChen Yu Ying had long been immune to such comments and simply nodded, \"Then see you downstairs, if anything else comes up, let me know by phone.\"\n\"OK.\"\n\"Lin Li.\" A tap on the shoulder and someone calling his name made Lin Li turn around, and it turned out to be the smiling Ding Sihan.\nMona Lisa’s smile is priceless.\nDing Sihan’s smile is dangerous.\n\"What’s up, Xiaodingding?\" Lin Li asked in confusion.\n\"Tell me, what’s under your butt?\" Ding Sihan maintained her smile.\nLin Li looked down and then answered, \"A pair of underwear worth a dollar eighty.\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\nYou actually wear such cheap underwear?\nDing Sihan now believes Lin Li is wearing ratty pants.\nBut that’s not the point now, Ding Sihan took a deep breath and asked further, \"What’s under the underwear?\"\n\"The school pants worth eighteen hundred.\"\n\"What’s under the school pants?\"\n\"That I don’t know,\" Lin Li said honestly and innocently, shaking his head.\n\"Let me tell you, it’s a shoe print.\" Even dealing with a foolish student like Lin Li, Ding Sihan was much more gentle than Wang Yuezhi, choosing to give the answer instead of scolding.\n\"Haha, fool.\" Hearing this, Lin Li jumped off Ding Sihan’s desk, first pointing at her desk, then at her, loudly mocking, \"Under my school pants is clearly your desk, there’s no shoe print there!\"\n\"Haha, fool.\"\n\"Ha—\"\n...\n\"Bufan, don’t underestimate Ding Sihan, she seems to be a psychic, she knows big prophecy spells, she can see the future.\"\nBai Bufan, sleepily walked into the classroom, only to see Lin Li, standing in his place and dusting off his own pants, seriously and solemnly warning him.\nBai Bufan: \"(;☉_☉)?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 349: Chapter 253: Experts are Experts After All, Her Research is Very Meaningful\nWednesday.\nAfter finishing his usual exercise routine, Lin Li rode his bike to school.\nThere was still a month and a half left until the two-month deadline for the Body Refining task.\nSince starting over from scratch with the Body Refining Eighth Rank Technique, he indeed felt new insights. During practice, he could perform much better in many details, especially in the Spiritual Qi Chapter.\nHis efficiency in utilizing Spiritual Qi and his physical qualities were steadily improving.\nLin Li thought that if he were to face Zhai Kai again now, he probably wouldn’t need to \"charge up\" and would still be able to hold his own at least.\nHe might even win.\nWith a month and a half still to go, he could at least go through the journey four or five more times. Lin Li didn’t believe that with so many tries, he wouldn’t meet the task requirements.\nIt’s worth mentioning that the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique had also progressed further. Once he had achieved a small success with the Thunder Body, Lin Li could gradually control the output of the electrical arcs in his body, like concentrating a ball of electricity in his palm.\nAlthough he couldn’t maintain it for long and its power was average, it was indeed a step forward in the technique, giving him a feel of ’thunder magic’.\nFinally, he wasn’t just a simple power bank.\nThe future is promising, and since there are no opponents, he could take his time.\n——So far, the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique was used for nothing other than zapping mosquitoes or Bai Bufan.\nNot even a zombie had been zapped by Lin Li’s electricity.\n\"A horse’s eye cannot tolerate a grain of sand~ because it feels uncomfortable~ A horse’s eye is always full of wisdom~ as if it has experience to impart~\"\nLeisurely cycling, Lin Li hummed a song.\nLin Li was already tired of \"Spring Breeze Elf,\" but fortunately, he discovered another gem song— \"The World in a Horse’s Eye.\"\n\"Sometimes there’s shyness in a horse’s eye~ when being petted~ A horse’s eye can also shed tears~ when it ends a battle~\"\n\"What exactly is the world in a horse’s eye like! Is it like I’m searching for direction! No matter how much honing and clashing experienced! My horse’s eye is always full of strength!\" In the chorus, Lin Li sang loudly.\nHe dared not sing softly, fearing that the heavens wouldn’t hear.\nThis song was shared with Lin Li by Bai Bufan last night, and Lin Li instantly replayed it a hundred times and became a fan.\nThis deeply emotional song for horses struck a chord with Lin Li, who had never touched or ridden a horse before in his life.\nIt could be considered another sensational work of Chinese pop music, proving that the Chinese music scene had completely transitioned from the Golden Age to the Silver and Gold Age.\nThe lyrics were thought-provoking; what exactly was in the eyes of a horse?\nLin Li believed that those majestic horses destined to gallop the prairie, in the current modern society of only steel torrents, ought to see a longing and yearning for the grassland.\nAs he approached the school, Lin Li stopped singing.\nAfraid of being overheard by acquaintances.\nThe school’s electric retractable gate was wide open today, after all, even though it wasn’t open day during the sports meet, parents could still fill out a form and drive in to watch if they wanted to.\nThe small mischievous gate, which usually opened just a little crack for him, was wide open today?\nHmph.\n\"Lin Li: I’ve reached the school gate, are you up, class monitor?\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Yep, I’ve got everything ready, I’m heading downstairs now.\"\n\"Lin Li: OK.\"\nThe opening ceremony started at 7:30, so there was plenty of time left; it was just a little past 5:40 now.\nThe campus was still shrouded in a thin layer of mist, and below the female dormitory building was especially quiet, seldom seeing traces of people, with occasional bird calls breaking the silence.\nAs for the dormitory doors, the dorm supervisor opened them at 5:30, so there was no conflict.\nLin Li parked his bike at the entrance and walked over, carrying the five breakfasts for their dormitory in his hand—one person wasn’t eating.\nSo from a distance, Lin Li saw Chen Yu Ying standing on the steps in front of the building, carrying her makeup case in her hand.\nHer long hair casually draped over her shoulders, wearing a light blue long-sleeve shirt, with a pair of dark teal high-waisted straight-leg pants below, complemented by a pair of white sneakers.\nLike the fresh wind of an autumn morning.\n\"Hello, here’s your delivery.\" Lin Li approached with a smile, then spoke, \"Class monitor, why aren’t you wearing the school uniform again?\"\n\"Not wearing the uniform is what makes these days precious.\" Chen Yu Ying laughed as she curled her hair.\n\"Are Ding Sihan and the others up yet?\"\n\"Not yet, why?\"\n\"Then I’m the first to appreciate this outfit today, no wonder today’s lucky day chart favors going out; the great luck is here.\" Lin Li said with a smile.\n\"Too bad, our dorm supervisor auntie already complimented me on it earlier.\" Chen Yu Ying said regrettably.\n\"What’s your dorm supervisor’s TikTok ID, I’ll assemble a truckload of bread people to handle her.\" Lin Li said angrily upon hearing this.\n\"Floral prosperity, and the TikTok ID is just a phone number, right at the door here. If you’re too lazy to search, I can share it with you directly.\"\nChen Yu Ying pointed to a placard at the entrance, indicating the dorm’s safety contact details.\nClearly abetting others to take violent actions, yet speaking so casually, even with a smile.\nHmph, no matter how good she looks on the outside, at heart, the class monitor is still a bad woman.\nLin Li followed Chen Yu Ying into the dormitory building, feeling somewhat disappointed that in this forbidden zone for boys, there was neither an empire nor ill omen covered in red fur, just like the ground floor of the boys’ dormitory.\nThe dorm supervisor auntie Lin Li planned to cyberbully lived in the room closest to the entrance on the first floor, and at the moment, the sounds and aroma of cooking came from inside.\n\"Do you want to have breakfast first?\" Lin Li asked accordingly.\n\"No need, let’s do makeup first.\"",

Next time, make it sound more expensive,\" Chen Yu Ying opened the box, taking out foundation, eye shadow, and lipstick, smiling as she gave instructions.\n\"It has to be cheap, otherwise how could I shamelessly lose face so freely each time? If it were more expensive, I’d be too embarrassed to do so.\"\nOnce Lin Li sat down, Chen Yu Ying rubbed a bit of base and began applying it to Lin Li’s face.\nStretching out, touching.\nHer fingers gently glided across Lin Li’s cheek, carrying a hint of coolness; for a moment, both seemed to lightly shudder imperceptibly.\nA delicate fragrance wafted as the girl’s body drew closer, lingering around the nose.\nLin Li widened his eyes, observing closely to find that Chen Yu Ying’s face seemed flawless.\nWhere’s the teenage acne?\nAll exterminated by the nightly skincare routine?\nThinking about Chen Yu Ying’s nightly skincare process and the time she spends, Lin Li found it reasonable.\nThis face is fitting for her.\nAdmiring Chen Yu Ying’s face up close, Lin Li suddenly shook his head slightly, feeling a bit annoyed in his eyes.\nWhat does the Louvre claim as the pinnacle of art? It hasn’t even hosted a face like Chen Yu Ying’s, yet it dares to call itself that?\nTonight going home to look up the Louvre’s TikTok account and join the dorm manager in wreaking havoc online.\nAnyway, it’s an easy thing to do.\nAs long as Nansang Middle School issues the call, Lin Li is willing to support it as the new pinnacle of art.\nThe urge to pinch Chen Yu Ying’s cheeks surged again with his gaze.\nWhere’s Bai Bufan’s rear end, please save me!\nUnlike Lin Li’s thick face, allowing him to blatantly stare at Chen Yu Ying, Chen Yu Ying glanced at him for a moment and immediately averted her eyes, her long dense eyelashes trembling lightly like the wings of a summer cicada.\nStabilizing her breath to suppress a slight blush, Chen Yu Ying used her left palm to hold and fix Lin Li’s face, as she began to apply makeup with her right hand, her gaze focused.\nBoth were very focused.\n\"Now, don’t move,\" Chen Yu Ying said softly.\n\"Even my heart shouldn’t move? That’s hard, but I’ll give it a try.\" To stop his lungs from moving erratically, Lin Li started pinching his left chest, trying to keep his heart from moving too.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nWatching Lin Li gradually turn blue in the face, Chen Yu Ying blinked and withdrew her hand, tilting her head as she evaluated him. Under Lin Li’s increasingly surprised and inquisitive gaze, she shook her fist downwards and with a smile encouraged:\n\"Yes, don’t move, keep it up, let me know when you stop.\"\nLin Li: \"What?\"\nIt’s not that bad guys have decreased, it’s that they’ve changed tactics!\nWhich creature from the depths corrupted Chen Yu Ying like this!\nCapable of such behavior, seems like someone born with a mom but raised without a dad.\n\"Class rep, you say you can do makeup, but you didn’t mention you’re good at putting makeup on the deceased, are you?\" Lin Li couldn’t hold back anymore,\n\"I’m done, class rep, I don’t want you to do my makeup anymore, is Ding Sihan awake, the dorm manager auntie, can she do makeup?\"\n\"Alright, don’t move, the true beginning has commenced,\" Chen Yu Ying said with a smile, \"If it itches anywhere let me know.\"\n\"Will you scratch it for me? Hey, you know what, I’m suddenly feeling itchy all over...\"\n\"I’ll withdraw my hand so you can scratch yourself.\"\n\"——Suddenly not itchy all over anymore.\"\nTime flies by, the years swiftly pass like a white horse swiftly crossing a gap, time quietly goes by.\nChen Yu Ying let out a long breath, clapped her hands that had some makeup residue on them, and took a step back.\n\"Raise your head.\"\n\"Lower your head.\"\n\"Turn left, turn right.\"\nCarefully examining her work, Chen Yu Ying nodded with satisfaction: \"Done.\"\n\"Great, class rep, at least you didn’t say something like turning in circles,\" Lin Li stood up and said with a smile.\nThere was a mirror stuck to the wall on the ground floor of the dorm, Lin Li walked over to take a look.\nHis face was painted with white foundation, the area around his eyes adorned with exaggerated blue diamond-shaped eye shadow, while a huge exaggerated red smile was drawn at the corners of his mouth.\nHowever, it was not the expected ridiculousness or absurdity.\nLin Li’s makeup, surprisingly, didn’t resemble a circus clown, but instead looked more like a movie joker that could kill, especially when Lin Li deliberately didn’t smile, revealing a fierce gaze.\nIt even seemed a bit handsome.\n\"Perfect.\" After admiring for a few minutes, Lin Li gave a thumbs up towards Chen Yu Ying.\n\"Glad you’re satisfied.\"\nChen Yu Ying nodded, intertwining her hands behind her back, still showing a delighted face from the praise.\n\"Alright, class rep, you should take breakfast upstairs now. If it cools down more, it really won’t be tasty. I’ll head to the boys’ dorm to change; shall we meet at the playground later?\" Putting the makeup remover borrowed from her into his backpack, Lin Li picked it up and secured it before speaking.\n\"Okay.\"\nChen Yu Ying nodded, waving goodbye to Lin Li, then turned and went upstairs carrying breakfast.\nLin Li proceeded to the boys’ dorm to change clothes and wear a wig.\nWalking on the way, he took a few selfies with his phone.\nSo handsome, Lin Li.\nNo wonder the three essentials of photography are portraits, portraits, and more portraits.\nBack when I was a stick figure, where was this confidence?\nFeeling like someone who scrolls through forums not seeing himself, only to turn and find declarations of affection full of photos.\nDid my image really only enhance by 30% rather than 300%?\nLin Li just had to share this.\n\"Lin Li: Sister Min, are you awake?\"\n\"Wu Min: No cash.\"\n\"Lin Li:?\"\n\"Lin Li: ’Image’, who’s asking for money, I’m letting you admire your son’s breathtaking looks.\"",

I want to dye it during winter break, and if worst comes to worst, I can cut it before school starts.\"\nGreen was still conservative. Lin Li felt he could pull off a dazzlingly colorful black.\n\"Wu Min: Let’s not. I heard from an expert that dyeing hair can affect your height. You’re not at that age yet.\"\n\"Lin Li: ? Mom, what marketing headline are you reading again? What kind of expert says dyeing your hair affects your height?\"\n\"Lin Li: Mom, if you’re going to believe that, when you get old and want to buy health supplements, buy from me. You’re definitely going to buy them, so better to keep the benefits within the family, right? Let’s boost Xiling’s GDP!\"\n\"Wu Min: Your mother isn’t an idiot, the expert is me. If you dare to dye it, especially green, I dare to break your legs.\"\nLin Li: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nWow, this time the expert’s really telling the truth.\nDyeing your hair really can affect your height, by nearly half a meter at once.\nWu Min can indeed be considered an expert.\nBecause a doctorate actually makes you an expert in a field, not necessarily well-versed in everything, so a doctorate should be called a diploma.\nSo, by reverse logic, Wu Min’s diploma naturally makes her an expert.\nWith the expert saying so, Lin Li could only abandon the winter break green hair plan.\nAfter all, his height was a major tool for him to tease the boys in class; it still had its uses.\n\"Knock, knock, knock.\" At the dorm door.\n\"Lin Li, is that you?\" The one who opened the door was Bai Bufan, still bleary-eyed.\n\"Why so serious?\" Lin Li asked with a sinister grin.\nBai Bufan: \"Ah? Oh? That, what’s it... I’m fine, thank you. And you?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nHow terrifying it is to deal with uneducated guys.\nTalking to this idiot is kind of a waste of time.\n\"The sun’s already up your ass, and you’re still sleeping. Get up, move over, give me space to change.\" He tossed his backpack right onto Zhou Baowei’s stomach, who was still lying in bed, and Lin Li sat down and took off his shoes, urging them.\nZhou Baowei sat up and flipped him the bird, kind of used to it.\nBesides, the sun coming up doesn’t concern him; he doesn’t need photosynthesis.\nMeanwhile, Bai Bufan was staring at Lin Li’s face for quite a while, feeling a bit sour.\nHe wanted to see a clown, not a clown.\n\"Lin Li, seeing you like this really makes me want to hit you, I feel like you’re provoking me,\" Bai Bufan grumbled, \"Do you know? I’m actually the heir of Batman and Spider-Man, I’ve inherited half of their legacies each.\nBy putting on Joker makeup in front of me, you are undoubtedly provoking me.\"\n\"Aren’t your parents and uncle still alive? What legacy did you inherit?\" Lin Li raised an eyebrow and asked.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\n\"The damn default legacy, what else.\"\n\"Ignorance is foolish! What I inherited was Batman’s lack of superpowers, and Spider-Man’s lack of money,\" Bai Bufan explained.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Where does your inheritance outshine mine?\"\nBai Bufan then lamented: \"I can live without superpowers, but the pain of not having money, you, newly rich guy, will never understand.\nZe Yu, you like digital stuff, I’m thinking about getting a new pair of headphones, do you have any recommendations for brand new, thousand-dollar headphones around ten bucks?\"\nQin Zeyu, who was brushing his teeth: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nHeadphones worth around ten bucks yet brand new and a thousand dollars?\nThis is no longer about whether you understand digital stuff or not.\nWhat Bai Bufan said might be human language, but it’s unlikely he speaks human language.\n\"You’ve inherited the legacy, hasn’t your mentor taught you the ways to solve problems, inherit his entertainment skills too!\nIsn’t Spider-Man making a living as a welfare sister? When he’s out of money, he takes pictures of himself in costume and sells them to the media to make ends meet,\" Lin Li suggested.\nThe sea is such a wonderful thing, when you’re happy you can look at it, when sad you can jump into it, when you’re broke you can go down, and when you have money you can float up.\n\"Don’t talk nonsense, there’s an essential difference between Spider-Man and a welfare sister, okay? He doesn’t have any books,\" Bai Bufan snapped, standing up for Spider-Man.\n\"Makes sense.\"\nLin Li nodded, realizing his thoughts were a bit narrow.\nSpider-Man can only be considered a pseudo-welfare sister.\nAfter all, he’s probably the only anime character without any books, even Dong Zhuo mushroom has some, but not Spider-Man, alas, what a downfall.\nAt this moment, Zhou Baowei, who just went to the restroom, poked his head out: \"Bai Bufan!\"\n\"What is it?\" Bai Bufan squinted cautiously.\n\"Is the pee you left in the toilet still useful? If not, I’ll flush it for you. If it is, I’ll put it in a cup for you,\" Zhou Baowei said innocently.\nThe others in the dorm burst into laughter.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Crap, I just forgot to flush, okay? Just flush it for me!\" Bai Bufan roared.\n\"Still need to ask, it’s your private property after all,\" Zhou Baowei said politely before retreating back.\n\"How respectful.\"\nLin Li was moved by the bond within the dorm.\nThis is respect.\nThis is acknowledgment.\n\"He holds a grudge, last time he didn’t flush after pooping, I asked if he was using it as a rice cooker to keep a midnight snack warm, now he’s got his revenge.\"\nBai Bufan sighed.\nLin Li already changed into his Joker outfit. Rental clothes are always one-size-fits-all, so naturally, they fit poorly, a bit too big.\nFortunately, it’s the Joker character, he can explain it away however.\nIf it’s too big and baggy, he’s a clown with disheveled looks; if it’s too tight, he’s a social justice clown.\nThey went together to the canteen with Bai Bufan and the others for breakfast. After eating, the classic \"Athlete March\" began echoing across Nansang campus.\nThe entire school started heading towards the sports field.\nWhen they found their class’s spot, another clown was already standing in line.\nIt’s not scary to wear the same outfit, it’s embarrassing if you’re the uglier one.\nLin Li wasn’t embarrassed anyway.\nWang Yuezhi wasn’t embarrassed either.\nHe looked Lin Li up and down and then shook his head both regretfully and sympathetically:\n\"Lin Li, you’ll never understand the soul of a clown, nor will you ever truly become one.\"\nWang Yuezhi no longer needed to humor Lin Li like in the past few days as he wouldn’t go off alone with Chen Yu Ying anymore.\nJust say it straight!\n\"Especially your makeup, absolutely devoid of any humor.\"\nLin Li wanted to say something but stopped.\nBetter let it go.\nLin Li worried that if he said the makeup was done by Chen Yu Ying, it might just add another clown material for Wang Yuezhi’s friend.\nAt that point, some girls from another class passed by Class One Grade Four.\nThey hadn’t walked a few meters.\nA faint voice came from their direction as they left.\n\"Wow, did you see the clown just now? So handsome. The clown next to him, so ugly.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nLin Li scratched the back of his head upon hearing this, feeling embarrassed by the compliment, hehe.\nWang Yuezhi also scratched the back of his head upon hearing this, feeling embarrassed by the compliment, hehe.",

It’s Lin Li himself, surely not someone else.\nWhile Lin Li calmly smiled, \"Being handsome is inevitable, there are two kinds of people who are most charming in the world, one is like me, and the other is just like me.\"\nDing Sihan: \"?\"\n\"Could you be any more disgusting?\" Ding Sihan took off her headpiece because she had to let Lin Li see her convulsing mouth corners and her expression of sudden disgust.\n\"Sure thing, sister, sure thing.\"\nWhen she saw Lin Li’s \"this was your request so I won’t hold back\" expression, Ding Sihan’s heart skipped a beat.\nBu Hao!!\nQuick, cover, your, ears—\nNo time.\n\"There are two kinds of handsome guys, one who has a bad memory, and the other I forgot.\"\n\"Back in my hometown village, there were two handsome guys, but after coming to Xiling for school, there aren’t any more, because I’m worth two.\"\n\"Sorry, I’m not good at saying charming things, but fortunately charming me is speaking, der!\"\n\"...\"\nLin Li, with each sentence finished, flicked his tongue while vigorously shaking his head, letting green wigs fly everywhere, sometimes covering the left face, sometimes the right, using only one eye to view the world.\nEven emo has its springtime.\n\"Ugh—\"\n\"Ugh—\"\nAmidst the fragrance of rice, the rogue face speaking, hearing echoes of ugh.\nEven the frog prince Wang Ze lost his patience, dropping the class sign and running over, executing a Leo Flying Kick.\n\"Leo Flying Kick!\"\nUnfortunately, the mascot costume restricted his range of motion, a flying kick only ten centimeters off the ground, not even as tall as his knees.\n\"Just wait, Leo, as soon as that big plan of his succeeds, all your Ultramen will be eradicated,\" Lin Li sneered at Wang Ze.\n\"Thank you, Lin Li, you bought too much breakfast today, got a bit stuffed in the morning, now it’s all relieved,\" Ding Sihan patted Lin Li’s shoulder as she put her helmet back on and sighed.\n\"Hehe, those words have no attack power, sister, are you flirting with me,\" Lin Li scoffed.\n\"Wanqiu! Come help!\"\nUpon hearing this, Ding Sihan called for help towards the class lineup.\nQu Wanqiu let Lin Li know with one word what attack power means.\n\"Hey!\"\nThe kick had real attack power.\n\"Buzz——\"\nFrom the campus broadcast, a classic long buzz of ear-ringing sound.\nThen the music of \"Athletes March\" began to quiet as the broadcaster’s voice appeared:\n\"Respected leaders, teachers, dear students, hello everyone! In this sunny and passionate day, we welcome the 51st Nansang Middle School Athletics Meet! The opening ceremony now begins! All class teams, please position yourselves and prepare to enter!\"\nAll classes have been positioned or queued up.\n\"...At this moment, the national flag team marches in with determination. Let us welcome them with the warmest applause! The national flag is the symbol of our nation, the pride of our people...\"\nWith the broadcaster’s voice, the parade officially began.\nWang Yuezhi appeared somewhat nervous, rode his unicycle, and started the final process confirmation.\nLin Li learned to ride the unicycle in two days, but since there are no convenient rental shops near the school, it’s just not feasible.\nThe two of them were just performing their own thing anyway, they weren’t in sync at all.\n\"It’s our turn.\"\nThe first three classes only had a short performance from Class Two, so it quickly became Class Four’s turn.\n\"Now approaching us is Freshman Class Four. They’re stepping to the rhythm of youth, holding a class sign painted with stars, showing off the unique vitality and sharpness of young boys and girls! Their slogan is—Class Four, Class Four! Class Four, Class Four, eh? Class Four, Class Four? Class Four, Class Four...\"\nEight times \"Class Four\" spoken out by the broadcaster with four different emotions.\nBeside the podium, Xue Jian, waiting to take photos and videos of the class while pondering where to sneak a smoke later: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nWhat the heck slogan just entered my ears? Whose class? Class Four?\n\"Class Four, Class Four!\" As they neared the podium, Wang Ze loudly began.\n\"Class Four, Class Four, Class Four, Class Four! Class Four, Class Four, Class Four, Class Four!\"\nThe crowd from Class Four told Nansang Middle School with intense words, and told Xue Jian, that this wasn’t the broadcaster’s problem.\nTheir class slogan was exactly like this.\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nTurning his head, sure enough, a gaze nervously contemplating laughter inappropriately came from Principal Wang, observing him.\nXue Jian took a deep breath, looked up at the sky.\nLin Li!!\nBai Bufan!!\nAfter reciting the slogan, the broadcaster paused briefly and rarely, then re-engaged with enthusiasm:\n\"Ah, this... this is a declaration of courage to break conventions! Each seemingly repetitive ’Class Four’ contains different emotions—a battle drum pounding the first sound, a thunderclap breaking the frame the second sound! A gale sweeping the stage the third sound, and a triumphant song the fourth sound!",

Isn’t it memorable and innovative? Much better than those overused ones from other classes like cutting through thorns or always striving for first place... isn’t it better than these?\"\n\"Who came up with this slogan?\" Xue Jian wanted to confirm that.\n\"I came up with the first eight characters, Bai Bufan thought of the last eight characters, it’s a result of our joint effort.\nHowever, if it’s published, my name should be the first author, Bai Bufan at most the second, my contribution is bigger, and I take the main credit.\" Lin Li’s tone was humble, but the content was proud.\nXue Jian laughed.\nSpeaking of which, is a completely expected surprise still a surprise?\nYou kid are even mentioning first and second authors like it’s a paper.\nMain credit? Headache credit!\n\"Teacher, what’s up?\" Chen Yu Ying saw Xue Jian questioning Lin Li, so she quickly walked up to ask.\n\"Nothing, just asking about the class slogan.\" Xue Jian replied.\nThe tone seemed completely different, Lin Li wasn’t sure, so listened more.\n\"So... why did you kid use such a slogan for the class?\" Xue Jian looked at Lin Li again.\nNow Lin Li was sure, the tone was indeed different.\nFacing the questioning, Lin Li smiled slightly, looking at Xue Jian with a calm but confident tone:\n\"Teacher, a strong person doesn’t need flashy decorations, their name is the strongest golden brand.\nLike when Jordan takes a shot, he’s the god of basketball; when Li Bai speaks, he’s the eternal poetic sage, when Lin Li speaks, he’s the dream of countless girls...\nOur Class 4 doesn’t need fancy words, just the two words ’Class 4’ are enough to instill awe in opponents! Teacher, you should know, we took first place in three fun events.\nTeacher, if you ask anyone in the school now, who doesn’t know there’s a Grade 1 Class 4 in Nansang Middle School, and there will only be one Grade 1 Class 4, past, present, or future?!\"\nLin Li was full of spirit, his words powerful and imposing, eyes shining.\nWhen youths are strong, the nation is strong, when Lin Li is strong, girls lean against the wall!\nXue Jian: \"?\"\nNo?\nWhat nonsense.\nYou seriously want someone to ask outside the school, they’d also know there can only be one Grade 1 Class 4 in Nansang Middle School!\nIf the school had two Grade 1 Class 4s, the education bureau would call Principal Wang to ask if he’s gone mad, right!?\nBut Xue Jian had to admit one thing.\nThe name of a strong person is indeed the best golden brand.\nNow whenever someone mentions Lin Li, he feels his heartbeat skips a beat, instinctively calculating his retirement time, feeling fearful, wanting to avoid it.\nIt indeed has intimidation power.\nHearing this reason, Xue Jian seemed helpless, then looked at Chen Yu Ying, and sighed: \"So it’s decided this is our class slogan?\"\nChen Yu Ying nodded: \"Class vote, minority obeys majority, everyone felt it was acceptable, so we chose this.\"\nXue Jian: \"...\"\nXue Jian never participated in these, first because he wasn’t interested at this age, second to give Class 4 autonomy, so he truly didn’t know.\nTurns out it wasn’t just Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s doing, but over half the class agreed on this slogan?\nHis class...\nXue Jian looked up at the sky.\nLooking forward to next year’s class division.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan, the teacher is really willing to let you go.\nAfter lamenting for a while, Xue Jian came to his senses, nodded at Chen Yu Ying, and said somewhat apologetically: \"Yu Ying, thank you for helping the teacher lead this class.\"\n\"No, no problem.\"\nChen Yu Ying replied softly upon hearing this.\nShe also lowered her head, guiltily using the tip of her canvas shoe to grind into the lawn inside the playground.\nBut teacher, I... I also voted in favor.\nTo be precise, Chen Yu Ying’s entire dorm voted in favor of this title choice.\nNoticed Lin Li beside her sneeringly laughing, apparently, he also realized this.",

So boring.\" Bai Bufan, idle and bored enough to pick at his nails, asked Lin Li beside him.\nAlthough phones were allowed during the sports meet, the school banned using them during the opening speeches.\nThere would be many teachers patrolling back and forth on the field.\nLin Li, now at the back of the class rows, shrugged when he heard this: \"You can play secretly, there are a lot of people today, it’s hard to catch you.\"\nNormally, the seniors have their independent campus, and their morning meetings and exercises are held at its basketball court, so on usual occasions, it’s just juniors and sophomores, but today it’s crowded.\n\"Better not, I know what’s more important.\"\nBai Bufan, hearing this, looked around and muttered dejectedly.\nIf a teacher catches you sneaking with a phone, the nice ones just lecture you, but the strict ones will confiscate it for the rest of the week.\nIf caught by the first-year head teacher, you might not get it back until the end of the term.\nBai Bufan forced himself to listen for a while, then finally found something amusing, and looked at Lin Li in surprise:\n\"Lin Li, I discovered that when making speeches, the formal language actually sounds quite... kinky.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nHow can it be kinky?\n\"Explain.\"\n\"Think about it, during meetings, don’t they love saying——\nNo, no, no! Yes, yes, yes!\nVigorously promote...! Go deeper...! More and more!\nRaise high, speed up, promote... Insist, grab with both hands, must be tough... Grasp firmly, strive hard, advance fiercely...\nFinally, it’s applause!\"\nBai Bufan excitedly started describing, in a weird tone, making students from other classes glance over several times.\nLin Li: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nWho says Bai Bufan isn’t a genius?\nWhen Father Bai and Mrs. Bai were having a meeting back then, did they ever imagine that an unintentional ’misfire’ would result in a devilish child being born?\nIf a movie starring Bai Bufan were made, it might even reach the billion mark.\n\"Awesome.\" Lin Li could only say that.\n\"... At last, I wish all athletes to perform at their best, display their style, and wish this sports meet to be a great success! Thank you, everyone!\"\nAfter Director Ji finally finished, as Bai Bufan predicted, everyone started clapping together.\nAfter applauding so many times, only this time was heartfelt.\n\"Alright, next we invite the vice principal to give a speech.\" The broadcaster continued.\nThe applause abruptly stopped.\n\"Let’s welcome him with applause!\"\nThe applause resumed, but it was scattered and listless.\nLin Li looked up and swallowed hard: \"Oh man, there are five more teachers on stage, they’re not going to each give a round, are they?\"\nBai Bufan had to stand on his tiptoes to get Lin Li’s view, and when he saw clearly, his face turned pale.\n\"Damn! No wonder there isn’t any event in the morning! I was wondering what we’d do with the rest of the time, turns out they planned it all along!\"\n\"Sad!\"\nTime flies, but it wasn’t over yet.\nThe years go by like a shuttle, but it wasn’t over yet.\nLike a white horse passing a crack, another teacher was speaking, but it wasn’t over yet.\nEven Lin Li was feeling a bit bored.\n\"Bufan, want to stir things up?\" Lin Li squinted and leaned closer to Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan squinted and moved away from Lin Li.\nThe half-step back was real, a small gesture that hurt so much.\n\"This time I’m not tricking you.\" Lin Li had to add.\n\"Then tell me.\"\n\"Simple, just applause.\"\nLin Li chuckled, then suddenly started clapping.\nBai Bufan first paused, then his eyes lit up, he immediately understood, and started clapping as well.\nTheir applause was quite abrupt during the speeches, so not only their class, but also students from other classes looked over.\nAt first, people were confused, but then some caught on and started clapping along.\nThus passed from one to another, the applause gradually became thunderous, and more genuine than before.\nPrincipal Wang on stage: \"?\"\nHe looked down at the content he had just spoken.\n\"Today’s weather is nice.\"\nHuh?\nWhat’s worth clapping for there?\nAfter the applause subsided, Principal Wang continued: \"We’ve gathered in the name of sports—\"\n\"Clap, clap, clap, clap!!!\"\nPrincipal Wang: \"?\"\n\"For the 51st annual—\"\n\"Clap, clap, clap, clap!!\"\nThe applause already merged with laughter, and Principal Wang realized the students were doing it on purpose.\nPrincipal Wang squinted his eyes, he didn’t stop them, but kept talking while actually focusing on the crowd below.\nYou rascals, I’ve wanted to call you out for a long time but never got the chance, today I’m going to catch you.\nHence, when the applause sparked again.\nPrincipal Wang squinted his sharp eyes, scanning below, he found it!!\nThe source of the clapping, as expected, from sophomore class four... Wait, why isn’t it class four?\nIt was classes twelve and thirteen clapping first.\nWhere’s class four? What’s class four doing?\nPrincipal Wang looked towards the class four row, finding them at the back.\nThen he fell silent.\nHe saw Lin Li and Bai Bufan.\nThese two guys weren’t leading, they weren’t even clapping.\nThey were just... with their palms out and raised beside their heads, necks slightly leaning forward, faces like they were crying joyfully, jumping in place.\nPrincipal Wang: \"...\"\nI take you two as unruly students, but you take me as sunshine to bask in?",

The rhythm is already there, someone else will lead now. It’s more meaningful for us to switch to something else.\"\nLin Li leaned forward, puffed out his belly, put his hands behind his back, and issued a command: \"The second floor should be built on top of the first floor.\"\nThis was earth-shattering content!\n\"General! General! General!\" Bai Bufan’s body reacted instinctively, entering loyalty mode, and he shouted excitedly.\n\"Wrong one, it’s the Principal! Principal! Principal!\"\nAnd then things turned into the current situation.\nThe grade director stepped in to maintain order, and the group that led the applause earlier got a severe scolding, while the true mastermind, Lin Li, remained hidden, his achievements and reputation untouchable.\n\"Isn’t that obvious,\" Lin Li responded to Bai Bufan’s compliment, turning his head with a smirk reminiscent of Nike: \"You’re just not experienced enough. Once you’ve been around longer, you’ll have a sharp sixth sense like mine.\"\nBai Bufan felt a pang of sympathy and lamented:\n\"Lin Li, being born in the same era as you must be quite tragic.\"\n\"Those who admire you, it’s like looking up at a high mountain, they’ll spend their entire lives just watching. Those who envy and hate you, it gets under their skin.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nSeems like a compliment, unsure, listen again.\n\"You quoting ’Sword Coming’?\"\nLin Li suddenly realized that the words were from ’Sword Coming’ and were a compliment to Cao Ci, so he instantly got into character, looking at Bai Bufan:\n\"Although your starting point is still quite different from what I was before, I believe you, Bai Bufan, have the hope of following in my footsteps.\"\nXue Jian: \"That’s a high compliment.\"\nAfter finishing their lines, the three exchanged glances and burst into laughter, finally finding enough amusement in the boring speech segment.\n\"Hahaha—\"\n\"Hahaha—\"\n\"Ha.\"\nWait, O.o?\nLin Li and Bai Bufan suddenly stopped laughing, looking at each other.\n— Why the hell was there a third person?\n...\n\"So boring.\" Ding Sihan hugged the head of a polar bear plushie in front of her chest and used her palm to block a bit of the sunlight, looking at the endlessly talking teachers on stage, she said to Chen Yu Ying.\n\"We’ve got no choice, just wait it out.\" Chen Yu Ying replied with a smile.\nAt the back of the class lineup, familiar laughter came through. Chen Yu Ying instinctively turned to look back.\n\"What are those two laughing foolishly about now?\" Ding Sihan also turned around, sighed after seeing them clearly, and said: \"I should have gone to the back to play with them. Listening to their comedy act would surely be more fun than standing here as punishment, especially since even Xue Jian is laughing; it must be fun.\"\n\"Eh? Xue Jian?\"\nWhen Lin Li and Bai Bufan weren’t laughing, the smiles transferred to Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan’s faces.\nThen they saw Lin Li walking towards them.\nAsk and you shall receive, maybe?\n\"What’s up?\" Chen Yu Ying asked curiously as he approached.\n\"Monitor, do you know the theory of risk dispersion?\" Lin Li asked, adjusting the collar of his clown suit, sounding a bit proud:\n\"By distributing important figures across different locations or vehicles, it avoids collective loss from a single event, ensuring that in extreme cases, the leadership of an organization, enterprise, or even a country won’t be entirely wiped out and can continue operating normally.\"\n\"A classic example is that it’s said only three people know the Coca-Cola recipe, and they never fly on the same plane. The example isn’t necessarily true, but it should help you understand.\"\n\"And Teacher Xue deeply understands this principle. He just realized that Bai Bufan and I, two crucial figures for our class, were in the back of the class lineup during a sports meet, which is chaotic and might accidentally allow terrorists to infiltrate Nansang Middle School.\nThink about it, if a sudden airplane crash targeted us as twin towers, hitting the back of the class lineup, Bai Bufan and I would be taken out simultaneously.\nIt’s terrifying to think about, once it happens, it would be a \"10.23\" incident that would shock both China and the world. Just imagining the scene makes me shiver with fright.\nTherefore, to prevent the class from failing to operate without Bai Bufan and me, Teacher Xue asked me to move to the front of the class lineup, away from Bai Bufan.\"\nLin Li carefully and earnestly explained the pros and cons to Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, using both hands and words, sincerely afraid they wouldn’t understand.\nChen Yu Ying, Ding Sihan: \"?\"\nAfter being fooled for a moment, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan both lowered their heads and laughed.\nThis guy’s at it again!\nWhy can he describe things like this!\nIf this were a sentence-shortening exercise in Chinese, the answer would probably be \"Teacher Xue told me to move to the front,\" just this simple?\nOh well, since it’s Lin Li, it’s quite normal.\n\"Keep moving forward, to the very front.\" Xue Jian said with a black face, urging from behind.\n\"Teacher, can I just stand here?\" Lin Li stayed next to Chen Yu Ying, looking at Xue Jian for approval.\nToday’s sun is so cold, Xue Jian’s smile is so warm.\nWarm enough to make Lin Li shiver, leaving them with a look that said ’you’re both so regrettably unfortunate,’ and then he cheerfully continued ahead.",

When you two combine, it’s an explosion.\"\nLeading the class sign in the front, Wang Ze listened to the sudden enthusiastic report from Lin Li about the recent incident behind him, and laughed as he commented.\n\"Whatever, Ghana.\"\nLin Li first spoke mechanically, then frowned to correct an important fact: \"How can I be water? Surely Bufan is water, and I’m sodium.\"\n\"Why say that? Bufan has a lot of water? Have you tried it? Damn, hogging all the good stuff!\" Wang Ze teased upon hearing this.\n\"Bai Bufan is the kind of creature that boils over when opened. If he’s not water, what is he?\" Lin Li questioned in surprise.\nI’m different, when I open up, it’s like now... wait, not like opening, haven’t opened up yet.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\n\"Good scolding, I’ll help you convey it.\" Wang Ze laughed.\nTime flies like an arrow, years pass swiftly as a shuttle.\nFinally, sincere applause rang out again, as all the teachers finished their speeches, a student in a school uniform took the stage.\n\"On behalf of all the athletes, I solemnly vow: At this school sports event, we will strictly abide by the competition rules, obey the referee’s decisions, respect our opponents, and respect the audience...\"\n\"On behalf of all the referees, I solemnly vow...\"\nAfter the vows, the microphone returned to Principal Wang’s hand.\n\"I announce, the 51st Nansang Middle School Campus Track and Field Sports Event, officially open!\"\nTwo colorful smoke shells shot up from both sides of the podium, followed by more than ten peace doves representing beautiful expectations appeared, circling in the sky, from an unknown place.\n\"Beautiful.\" Wang Ze took off his headgear to admire.\n\"Hope those pigeons didn’t just eat their fill before being released.\" Lin Li whispered with some worry.\n\"Thanks, suddenly it’s unattractive.\" The threat of a sky mess made Wang Ze silently put his headgear back on, looking back gloomily.\n\"Want to grab some fries at the dock around noon.\"\n\"That’s seagulls, but Lin Li, did you know, pigeons die after mating.\" Wang Ze said.\n\"That’s not cold knowledge, that’s wild knowledge, who told you this? Pigeons still need both parents to alternate incubating eggs.\" Lin Li casually questioned.\n\"But the ones I’ve used all died.\" Wang Ze spoke innocently.\nLin Li: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nSo it’s mating with you?\nThen it indeed deserves to die.\nOf course, Lin Li meant that what deserved to die wasn’t the pigeons.\nCharm of statistics moment.\nAfter the performance ended, each class’s teams loosened up, dispersing in different directions, getting ready for the final preparations.\n\"Lin Li, Bai Bufan, you two come over for a moment.\" Xue Jian waved his hand toward the front and rear of the class team.\n\"What’s up, teacher.\" Lin Li and Bai Bufan jogged over, then asked.\n\"Wait.\" Xue Jian gestured by pressing down his hand, then shouted to the class:\n\"Is there any boy willing to also voluntarily help the class move the sunshade and desk and chairs?\"\nDuring the sports event, Nansang Middle School would allocate a small area to each class as a ’base’ in the spectator seats and the outer running track, so during the sports event, each class’s students and athletes at least had a place to land.\nThe sunshade and desk and chairs needed to be arranged by the class themselves, but it’s pretty convenient, needless to mention desks and chairs, you don’t need to go back to the classroom, you can move them from the activity room on the first floor, and return them later.\nSunshades also don’t need to cost any money, you can just go to the school gate to borrow from shops, many businesses are willing to lend those sunshades with ads for free.\nClass Four already borrowed one, it’s in the classroom.\nHaving heard Xue Jian’s shout clearly, Lin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged a glance.\nWhat’s with ’return’?\n\"Teacher, we’ve already assumed we’re participating in the moving?\" Though thinking he deserves it, Lin Li still wanted to ask.\nXue Jian glanced at Lin Li: \"Usually in class, whether it’s taking out the trash or moving textbooks, aren’t you two the most proactive?\"\nLin Li blinked: \"Because those are during class time.\"\nXue Jian checked his watch: \"Isn’t now class time too?\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nIndeed.\nReasonable, now no room not to think about moving.\n\"You two surely haven’t cared about where our class’s allocated area is, don’t know where to put things, right? Let’s help out too, we can assist in carrying chairs.\" Chen Yu Ying approached with Ding Sihan, smiling as she spoke.\n\"I care a lot about our class, that’s malicious slander, class president, apologize.\" Lin Li countered upon hearing this.\n\"Exactly, slander, apologize.\" Bai Bufan said with the authority of a pack.\n\"Then tell us where our area is.\" Chen Yu Ying tapped her cheek lightly with her phone’s side, tilted her head, asking with a smile.\n\"In the field.\" Lin Li answered confidently.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"Be more specific.\"\n\"In Nansang Middle School’s field.\"\nSpecific but the direction is incorrect.\n\"See.\" Chen Yu Ying spread her hands, smiling.\n\"Then rain and desk and chairs also trouble Yu Ying to handle.\" With Chen Yu Ying responsible, Xue Jian felt assured.\nChen Yu Ying: \"Okay, teacher.\"\nLin Li: \"Safe journey, teacher.\"\nEven before Xue Jian turned around: \"...\"\n\"I can help too.\" At this moment, just ready to go back and remove makeup, Wang Yuezhi volunteered.\n\"Great, Wang Yuezhi, do you know the class’s allocated location?\" Chen Yu Ying inquired upon hearing.\n\"I know, Spectator Stand A4 middle and field West Seven, I saved the reference map you posted in the class group!\" Wang Yuezhi nodded, glancing challengingly at Lin Li.\nDetails decide success or failure.\nCountless details weave an inescapable web, this is Wang Yuezhi’s love rule!\nWin!",

We can’t move things while wearing them.\" Chen Yu Ying said happily.\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\n\"Arigato Wang Yuezhi-san, to be honest, this frog prince costume gets a bit hot if worn for too long in mid-October.\" Hearing this, Wang Ze immediately wriggled out of his suit and conveniently placed the toad headgear on Wang Yuezhi’s head.\nThe headgear was put on slightly askew, rubbing off Wang Yuezhi’s red nose.\nDing Sihan, who also handed over his costume at the same time, picked it up when he saw this and gave it to Wang Yuezhi along with the suit, gently saying, \"Your clown nose fell off, Wang Yuezhi.\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"TAT\"\nHe looked up at a 45-degree angle to the sky, just to hold back his tears: \"Okay, okay.\"\nWang Yuezhi hugged the clothes and headgear, nodded stiffly, and turned to head towards the area of Class 4.\nHis silhouette appeared somewhat desolate.\n...\nIn the classroom on the first floor of the Art Building, many people were quietly borrowing chairs.\nRemember, scholarly activities shouldn’t be called stealing.\nAs soon as Lin Li and Bai Bufan arrived, they squinted their eyes.\nThey spotted a familiar face.\n\"Chen Tianming, why are you moving things here?\" Lin Li pulled over Chen Tianming, who was trying to walk past them with a table without looking sideways, and asked in a cold voice.\n\"Moving tables.\" Chen Tianming laughed heartily and replied.\n\"Which class are you helping to move for?\"\n\"Class 17.\"\n\"What class are you in?\"\n\"Class 17... but I’m from Class 4 downstairs, on the lower floor.\"\n\"Then do you know which area the Class 4 downstairs, on the lower floor, was assigned to for the sports meet?\"\n\"The sports field.\"\n\"More specifically?\"\n\"The sports field of Nansang Middle School.\"\n\"And what area was Class 17 assigned to for the sports meet?\"\n\"The B7 spectator seats and 20 meters north of the long jump sand area on the field.\"\nWang Ze and Bai Bufan: ᓖ뮤?\nLin Li sighed: \"Was this another order from Yao Qiaoqiao?\"\n\"What order? Don’t say it so harshly. It’s Qiaoqiao’s request, request, understand? Have you ever done a quest in Genshin Impact? It’s a request, a hope, a rescue!\" Chen Tianming retorted.\n\"You’ll end up being led around by Yao Qiaoqiao one day.\" Lin Li looked at Chen Tianming with pity and shook his head.\n\"I’ll say it again, I’m not being led around by her. Spinning around is my personal hobby. I actually have my plans.\" Chen Tianming frowned and retorted.\nLin Li: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nA personal hobby, huh? That’s fine then.\nLin Li accepted it.\n\"I’m going to move things first. Let’s talk later.\" With that, Chen Tianming left carrying the table.\n\"Chen Tianming has reached this point? So amusing, I want to keep one too.\" Ding Sihan eagerly gossiped at this time, too afraid to speak out loud.\n\"You’ve given up on Bai Bufan, and now you’re planning to keep Chen Tianming, do you understand what you’re doing? I won’t agree.\" Lin Li sneered.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nYour mom.\n\"But just ignore it,\" Bai Bufan sighed, \"According to our dormitory late-night chats, Tianming is on a bit of a willing playing and willing suffering path. He’s aware but not completely rational, it’s hard to explain, but he somewhat enjoys it. After all, he doesn’t lose anything and even feels like he gains emotional value, so let him be.\"\n\"Incredible.\" Ding Sihan clicked his tongue.\n\"In this world, even something like Lin Li exists, what counts as incredible?\" Bai Bufan fired back.\nSadly, it wasn’t very aggressive.\n\"I’ll go get the sunshade umbrella.\"\nBy the time Lin Li returned to the classroom with the borrowed sunshade umbrella, everyone had already picked up what they needed to move and were preparing to head back to the field.\n\"You two only need to take one chair each, take two, don’t wear yourselves out, there’s still a competition in the afternoon.\" Seeing Ding Sihan and Chen Yu Ying each carrying a chair in both hands, Lin Li transformed into a super gentleman.\n\"I’m not so fragile, you know.\" Chen Yu Ying said while lifting the chair up and down a couple of times.\n\"No worries, give me one.\" The sunshade umbrella was tied up, making it easy for Lin Li to sling over one shoulder, while he reached to take one chair from Chen Yu Ying’s hand with the other.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t stand on ceremony, nodding: \"Since you don’t have any events today, there you go.\"\n\"I also have one more, you can’t just be nice to Ying Bao, can you?\" Ding Sihan, with even less ceremony, placed a chair down, indicating it was no longer her concern.\nLin Li was prepared and picked up the chair, placing it upside down on the table Wang Ze was carrying.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nBai Bufan, however, was unbothered.\nThe main reason was that Lin Li was relatively good-natured, the secondary reason was that when Bai Bufan saw Lin Li appear, he immediately left carrying his table at a brisk pace, now ten meters away from the rest of the class.\nWang Ze sighed: \"Lin Li, care to guess when my event is?\"\n\"What events did you participate in again?\" Lin Li asked upon hearing him.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nSo you never cared about the events from the beginning?\nReasonable.\nWang Ze walked for a while.\nSuddenly turned his head: \"Class president, do you know what event I’m participating in?\"\nChen Yu Ying’s smile was beautiful.\nBut why was she just smiling?\nSo you also only remembered Lin Li’s event schedule right?\nWang Ze came to terms with it.\nIt was just male thieves and looters.\nBai Bufan was the first to reach the class area, easy to recognize, as a lone clown was standing there.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, you should go wash your face. Having paint on your face for too long isn’t good for your skin.\" As Chen Yu Ying approached carrying a chair, she said to Wang Yuezhi.\nEh?\nWang Yuezhi stood straighter as if invigorated.\nThis was concern, right? Unquestionable concern, wasn’t it?!\n\"Okay, thank you for the concern, I’ll go remove it now!\" Wang Yuezhi nodded vigorously and headed towards the dormitory.\nClown? Screw the clown, I’m not being a clown anymore!\nAnyone who dares to call me a clown again, I’ll beat them into a dog!\n\"So do I need to remove my makeup too? My pretty face can’t be damaged.\" Lin Li, while crouching to set up the sunshade umbrella, looked up and asked with a smile.\n\"Don’t worry, when I did your makeup, I used a primer carefully, and all the products on your face are high-quality, no need to worry too much.\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head.\n\"Then I’m relieved because you know—\"\n\"Shut up, stop being narcissistic.\" Ding Sihan immediately interrupted Lin Li.\n\"Damn it.\"\nNo one cared about the direction.\nWang Yuezhi quietly took out the clown nose from his pocket, which for some reason, often falls off at the right time, stuck it back onto his nose, and gave himself a light pat:\n\"Woof woof.\"",

It’s cost-effective and not suitable for transportation, so it’s usually hollow and can be filled with water to increase weight.\n\"This thing needs so much water? The store that rented it to us is really awful,\" Bai Bufan commented sharply.\nLin Li chuckled, \"Bufan, you shouldn’t buy big bottles of mineral water in the future; they are also heavily watered.\"\n\"Thanks for the reminder,\" Bai Bufan took it to heart.\nSo Lin Li took the base and headed to the restroom on the playground behind the podium.\n\"You’re here.\"\nAs soon as Lin Li entered the restroom, he heard a heavy male voice from one of the stalls speaking to him.\nWhat kind of call from destiny is this?\nAm I finally not the last one picked?\nAlthough it was a bit puzzling, Lin Li still answered while walking to the sink, \"I’m here.\"\n\"What are you here for?\"\nIt’s not like quoting lines from Ancient Dragon; Lin Li turned on the faucet and said truthfully, \"Fetching water.\"\n\"When are you leaving?\"\n\"I’ll leave once it’s full.\" Though the other party was quite friendly, Lin Li was a social phobia—a social terror causing fear to others in society.\nAfter all, as the saying goes, more friends, more paths; girls have a future; boys have a backup plan.\n\"Don’t leave, come to my place,\" the other party said with a smile.\n\"Dude, are you taking a dump? What am I supposed to do there?\" Lin Li frowned and raised his voice a bit.\n\"Never mind, I’ll call you later; it seems like someone’s here,\" the male voice first continued heavily, then raised his voice a bit, directing it towards the inside of the restroom, \"Hello? Did someone just speak? Were you talking to me?\"\nLin Li: \"(;゜○゜)?\"\nHaha, how awkward, this place is not suitable for staying long, Lin Li quickly left with the water-filled base.\nThey soon set up the sun umbrella and arranged the tables and chairs.\nAt this moment, Zhou Baowei came over carrying a bundle of mineral water and a box of energy snacks, placing them on the ground.\nThese were bought with class funds to provide for participants in need during the sports event.\nOf course, those not participating can also drink, just with lower priority, as long as Zhou Baowei is willing to spare any for them.\n\"You didn’t sneak any, did you, Bao Wei?\" Lin Li questioned.\n\"Lin Li, I didn’t even unpack it; isn’t that clear?\" An innocent Zhou Baowei pointed at the intact food and water, jokingly scolding.\n\"Got it,\" Lin Li first nodded, then angrily pointed at Zhou Baowei, \"You damn thief ate an entire box! And drank 24 bottles of water!\"\nZhou Baowei: \"???\"\nDamn you.\nIf you want to condemn someone, you don’t need an excuse.\nZhou Baowei admitted defeat, feeling like Lin Li was treating him like the black guy who stole chocolate.\n\"Lin Li, just because you’re standing under the sun umbrella doesn’t mean you get to act like a sunshade thing,\" Zhou Baowei said disdainfully.\n\"Hahaha—\" Lin Li first froze, then looked up at his sunshade and couldn’t help but laugh.\nBao Wei’s combat power matched up.\n\"Do you think I could eat so much in such a short trip back and forth? You think I’m a feasting monster?\"\n\"What is ’feasting monster’?\" Lin Li asked, puzzled.\n\"I don’t know how to pronounce ’glutton’ in Chinese.\"\n\"Oh, okay, makes sense.\"\nAfter everything was set up, Lin Li went to the audience seats to check the spot assigned to their class.\nNot bad, close to the finish line, a bit past it, but luckily the location is high. The view is good, and they can just stand up to see past the crowd around the finish line.\nThen the group headed to the dorms.\nIt’s already past ten, Lin Li needs to remove his makeup and change into normal clothes. Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan also need to prepare for the afternoon’s events.\nThe makeup remover Chen Yu Ying gave him in the morning is in his backpack, left in Bai Bufan’s dorm.\nBack to the dorm, remove makeup.\nLin Li’s makeup is much heavier than the Great Qing’s top assassin, so by the time he finished removing it, it was already past eleven.\n\"When are we going to the canteen?\" Lin Li poked his head into the dorm.\nThe two playing games didn’t even look up.\n\"Let’s order delivery, not going to the canteen.\"\n\"Yeah, delivery. Hey, Bufan, how do you deal with real-name registration, using a family member’s ID?\" Zhou Baowei nodded and then kicked the upper bunk with his foot to ask.\n\"No, just search for lost IDs on Douyin; it’s full of fresh ID information, just use them. I registered for the gay site using that info too.\"\n\"Indeed,\" Zhou Baowei learned something new.\n\"Hey, you two, stop with the ID stuff; the canteen is less than 100 meters away, and you’re ordering delivery?\" Lin Li interrupted them.\n\"Eating delivery in a closed dorm during high school has this rebellious, taboo feeling that just thinking about makes me feel fascinated and excited, Lin Li, you being a day student won’t understand this,\" Bai Bufan replied.\n\"...Lin Li, you being a day student won’t understand this,\" Zhou Baowei echoed, possibly a Yin-Yang Master player.\n\"You like forbidden taboos this much? Bufan, do you like ’NTR’?\" Lin Li asked after a moment of silence.\n\"How did you know it’s a tag I often search for when reading manga? You know, I’ve never been moralistic; taboo manga has been harming me for a long time.\"\nTalking about such topics inevitably made Bai Bufan look up from his game and look at Lin Li.\n\"Do you have any recommended codes? Please, this is really important to me.\"\n\"What’s the point of manga, you want to play in real life? I have connections,\" Lin Li said with a chuckle.",

Surely not to the school’s gate? If I have to get it from the gate, I might as well go to the cafeteria.\" Lin Li didn’t mind and, being too lazy to go to the cafeteria by himself, asked.\n\"Nah, just write the iron gate of the dorm building; you can go get it directly from downstairs.\" Bai Bufan explained, \"I’ll send you a more detailed description on WeChat.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Are you really going to eat that rice bowl, or should we order something else together?\" Lin Li asked again.\n\"Let me finish this game first and then I’ll see.\" Bai Bufan continued playing.\n\"Bai Bufan, can’t you pause the game and eat first?\" Lin Li suddenly shouted.\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Bai Bufan didn’t even lift his head: \"And you’re calling me by my full name, Lin Li, you’re living a full life.\"\nThen Bai Bufan asked with some amusement: \"Lin Li, do you think forty years from now, nursing homes will become e-sports rooms where grandkids often get knocked out in games and kneel at the gates, shouting ’Please, Ancestors, come out of the mountain’?\"\n\"Ha, rubbish. In reality, by then, you won’t even be able to press a keyboard; the only thing you’ll do every day is raise your hand to the caregiver and say ’Caregiver, I pooped on the CPU again,’ and then be spun like a top by the snarky caregiver.\" Lin Li chuckled.\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nThe imagery was strong; he’d already been spun away.\n...\n\"Okay, okay, just leave it behind the fence, I’ll go get it in a bit.\"\nBai Bufan’s phone rang first, then he got up, stretched lazily, and climbed down from the bed.\n\"Bufan, look at this.\" Lin Li was scrolling through short videos, laughing so hard he couldn’t contain himself, indicating that Bai Bufan should come over and watch.\n\"Coming.\"\n\"Finished watching, what’s so funny about it?\" Bai Bufan asked, a little puzzled.\n\"You probably didn’t get it; watch it again later, pay attention to the subtitles.\" Lin Li explained, holding back laughter.\nAfter being pulled to watch it multiple times by Lin Li and still not finding the humor, Bai Bufan suddenly realized something was off, stood up and pointed at Lin Li in disbelief:\n\"Are you trying to stall?\"\nAt this moment, Lin Li immediately reined in his smile, cut to the background, and saw the message that the rider was 50 meters away, and his grin slowly returned.\n\"Bufan, remember to grab my delivery while you’re at it; you should reach just as it arrives.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nDamn, all the little tricks were used on himself.\n\"Fine.\" Bai Bufan sighed.\nNext to him, Zhou Baowei poked his head out, smiling awkwardly: \"Haha, Bufan, I also have a really good video over here...\"\n\"Bao Wei, wishing you a bright future.\" Bai Bufan just left that line and turned to leave.\n\"What do you mean? Are you cursing me?\" Zhou Baowei couldn’t understand.\n\"Many years later, with his head buried in a filthy toilet, as he drowned himself, Zhou Baowei finally realized that ’wishing you a bright future’ was a farewell; thus he said, ’My toilet, I wish you a bright future’.\"\nLin Li added a fitting narration at this moment.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"So that’s what ’bright future’ means? Bai Bufan is pretending to be so cultured.\"\n\"Is that really what you’re going to argue about?\" Lin Li was somewhat surprised.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nNot right!\n...\n\"Seems like a lot of people have the same idea as us, there are deliveries all over by the fence.\" Bai Bufan said as he returned and handed Lin Li’s delivery to him.\nThen Bai Bufan, seated and opening his delivery, suddenly exclaimed.\n\"What’s the matter?\" Lin Li asked curiously, turning around.\n\"Got bitten by the delivery.\" Bai Bufan showed a small drop of blood on his thumb.\nIt was from when he got pricked by a staple while opening the bag.\nNo big deal.\nFortunately, Bai Bufan wasn’t an idol trainee; otherwise, they’d have to call an ambulance.\n\"Lin Li, after being bitten by the delivery, I now feel like my senses are heightened. In my mind, I see an image of a delivery rider in a yellow vest riding an electric bike calling me to merge with him. Am I about to become the Superhero Takeout Man?\"\nBai Bufan closed his eyes, feeling a bit dazed.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou’re crazy.\nBut if Bai Bufan wasn’t crazy, Lin Li wouldn’t even play with him.\n\"Your injury is more serious than I thought, it may have already affected your brain.\" So Lin Li quickly searched around the dormitory, finally picking a piece of rust off the corners of the bed and handed it to Bai Bufan:\n\"Bufan, quickly apply this on your wound, it works especially well for someone in your condition.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"You treating me like I’m SpongeBob with a splintered thumb?\"\n...\nWhen the end of lunchtime bell, replaced with the ’Athlete March’, rang, the people in the dormitory got up, ready to go downstairs.\nThe weather was really nice.\nEven though it was noon, only sparse sunlight could stream through the clouds onto the playground, with a gentle breeze bringing a slight chill.\nThe playground had already undergone some changes.\nThe high jump equipment, the starting smoke screen, the run-up devices, the tape at the finish line...all the things needed for the competition were set up in the remaining time of the morning.",

The jet-black hair glistened faintly in the sunlight.\nA high ponytail truly gives off a strong youthful vibe.\nAway from the campus scene, Lin Li realized he hadn’t really seen this hairstyle much elsewhere, and wasn’t sure why.\nShe wore a black jacket draped over her shoulders, with a white sports vest underneath, perfectly outlining her graceful curves. Her shoulder and neck lines were smooth, and her collarbone faintly visible.\nHer long, straight legs extended from under light gray athletic shorts, skin appearing fair and glossy in the sunlight.\nApproaching, he saw Chen Yu Ying smiling at him. Without waiting for her to speak, Lin Li rubbed his stomach and asked:\n\"I’m so full, class monitor, do you have any digestive tablets?\"\n\"Nope, but since you don’t have a match today, walk around a bit later. What did you eat for lunch to be this full now?\" Chen Yu Ying asked, sounding a bit concerned yet puzzled.\n\"A feast for the eyes.\" Lin Li gestured towards Chen Yu Ying with both hands, palms up.\n\"Eh?\"\n\"Pfft——\" Chen Yu Ying was taken aback, then laughed, \"Oh, that’s so cheesy.\"\n\"Then why are you blushing?\" Lin Li marched proudly under the sunshade, delivering his line undeterred.\nChen Yu Ying glared at Lin Li.\nNo need to say out loud such things that were noticed.\nNot satisfied with just one glare, she gave Lin Li’s shoe a light kick.\nDing Sihan, also dressed in sportswear, came over, bent down under Lin Li’s envious gaze, and patted Chen Yu Ying’s thighs and calves before teasingly looking at Lin Li:\n\"Lin Li, where did you first look at Ying Bao, tell us honestly.\"\n\"Of course it was the eyes, the windows to the soul, what else could it be? It couldn’t possibly be that my gaze shamelessly swept over her fair legs, fair arms, fair collarbones, or even sneaked a look at her chest, right? Impossible, I am a gentleman; I wouldn’t do such a thing.\"\nLin Li snorted, declaring his integrity and uprightness.\nDing Sihan laughed heartily, satisfied.\nChen Yu Ying silently zipped up her jacket, crossing her arms in front in a mix of humor and helplessness.\nHere comes the pervert again.\nBut this time, Lin Li was slightly wronged.\nYou should look at a girl’s eyes first, and if you find she’s not looking at you, then you can check out her legs.\nSuddenly, Ding Sihan stopped laughing and angrily kicked Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"I demand an explanation.\" Lin Li sternly asked with a serious face.\n\"Why didn’t my joy increase a level? You want an explanation? From whom should I demand my explanation?\" Ding Sihan kicked again, her face colder.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Kick all you want, getting hit by this boomerang is my own fault.\" Lin Li stuck out his rear, feeling he deserved it.\n\"Great opportunity!!!\"\n\"Who the hell said great opportunity!\" Lin Li heard Wang Ze’s voice from behind, causing his heart to skip a beat, quickly pulling his rear back.\n\"Wang Ze, good luck in the match later.\" Turning around, Lin Li gestured to Wang Ze.\n\"You finally know what event I’m in?\" Wang Ze was somewhat touched.\nA good friend knows when he’s wrong and improves.\n\"It’s written on the whiteboard here.\" Lin Li pointed at a whiteboard under the sunshade, on which were written today’s events and participants’ timings in black ink.\nWang Ze is in the 400-meter run, the preliminaries are in the afternoon, essentially the first event.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nWhy did I even hope for anything from Lin Li.\n\"All male athletes competing in the 400 meters, please proceed to the check-in area...\" The announcer’s voice rang out with the notification.\n\"Let’s go!\"\nWang Ze confidently laughed as he pulled out his number tag from his pocket and headed to the check-in.\n...\nThe freshman group ran first, and Wang Ze was on the first track.\nLin Li brought the \"three-person dog\" group to cheer for Wang Ze from the inside track of the field.\n\"Don’t bother, Wang Ze. I’ll say it again, this spot for Class Four’s sports student; if you don’t take it, someone else will.\" Lin Li laughed.\n\"Don’t worry, advancing is a breeze. I’m a seasoned sports student.\" Wang Ze was relaxed, not nervous at all.\n\"A veteran general on the stage.\" Lin Li chuckled.\n\"Last time Wang Ze said this, he stayed up all night trying and didn’t make it, even dropped a level.\nThat night, starting from three o’clock, no matter what we said, he chose silence, only responding with ’one more round’ every time he lost.\"\nBai Bufan’s voice came lazily.\nWang Ze, who had already bent down and started getting used to the starting block, almost stumbled and knelt, glaring back angrily: \"This advancement is not the same!\"\n\"On the first track, Class Four freshman, Wang Ze. On the second track, Class Six freshman...\" The referee began the final roll call.\nThe athletes in this group lined up on the track, aside from Wang Ze, there was another using the starting block. The rest simply bent down, shifting their weight forward, ready to start.\nAfter all, forcing oneself to use a starting block without training could negatively impact performance.\nThe referee holding the starter gun stood on the starting platform.\n\"Lin Li, do you think pointing the starter gun at the athletes would be more effective?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"Which athlete are you referring to?\"\n\"Someone from another class.\"\n\"Then it would.\"\nThe referee nearby listened, tempted to point the gun at Bai Bufan’s head.\n\"On your marks——get set——\" The referee raised his hand high, announcing with his unique preparatory call, \"Bang!\"\nThe starter gun fired, Wang Ze surged forward like a dog off its leash.\nFour hundred meters, to a sports student, isn’t much different from a hundred; both require an all-out sprint.\n\"Go!\"\n\"Go!\"\nCheering resounded around, mixed with calls of athletes’ names.\nFor four hundred meters, even straight-line running across the field may not keep up, so Lin Li and others waited at the start, which is also the finish line.\nBut Wang Ze was steady indeed.\nWhen he started the final straight sprint, except for another using the starting block in the fourth track, who seemed to be an athlete too, the rest were tens of meters behind.\nCreating a gap of tens of meters in such a short distance is quite significant.\nWang Ze crossed the line, firmly first in his group.\n\"Awesome, Wang Ze! You led the third-place finisher by at least fifty meters in the four hundred meters.\" Bai Bufan praised.\n\"Told you.\" Finishing his slow run, Wang Ze walked towards Lin Li and Bai Bufan, proudly thumping his chest.\n\"But the guy in fourth track isn’t bad either, is he an athlete as well?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"Yeah, I know him, but he’s usually slower than me and another guy during training. He’ll probably get the bronze.\" Wang Ze nodded, \"My goal, like Lin Li’s, is to secure silver and eye the gold.\"\n\"So you sports students have already divided the school sports meet titles among yourselves?\" Bai Bufan clicked his tongue.\n\"There aren’t many maniacs like Lin Li, there aren’t that many high-level talents among the common folk. Losing would get us laughed at.\" Wang Ze thought it was a given.\n\"Then we’re really just here to participate.\" Bai Bufan nodded, having nothing to argue with.\n\"I have a strategy that could bring about a resurgence for the Han Dynasty and even provide you, Bai Bufan, a chance to compete against the likes of Wang Ze.\"\nLin Li spoke with depth and mystery.\n\"Oh? Tell us more.\" Bai Bufan and Wang Ze curiously asked.\n\"After the starter gun, give everyone a problem to solve. Whoever first lies down on the track and writes the correct answer can start running.\" Lin Li grinned wisely, \"It will be an exhilarating collaboration of brains and brawn, a dual contest of intellect and physical strength!\"\nBai Bufan, Wang Ze: \"?\"\nBai Bufan and Wang Ze exchanged glances, their eyes wide with shock.\nWhether the Han Dynasty’s cultural students could see a resurgence was uncertain, but Wang Ze felt that under such circumstances, the sports students of the Wei Kingdom might also face downfall along with the Han Dynasty.\nCultural students would finish the problem and stand up, but with insufficient blood flow to the brain, their vision might blacken.\nSports students would finish the problem and stand up, with sufficient blood flow to the brain, but darkness would fall upon them.",

If we do it like this, when it gets dark, I’ll still be sticking my butt in the air on the track counting!\" Just imagining that scene made Wang Ze sweat profusely.\nRunning while doing problems?\nSorry, coach, I think I’ll switch to culture courses.\nSports students are just sports students, not Japanese, you know.\nWhen Lin Li heard this, his eyes lit up: \"What a great opportunity!\"\n\"How is this a great opportunity? That boomerang sure came back fast, damn!\" Wang Ze couldn’t hold it anymore and burst out laughing, then quickly put on a solemn face, righteously indignant:\n\"No, it’s really too much, I mean, us sports students don’t have it easy, right? 365 days a year, 360 are for training, and the remaining 5 are spent thinking about training.\nWe don’t hope for much each year, just want to show off a bit at the school games, then at night check the confession wall, see if anyone’s mentioning us, and maybe fall into the Love River with a lucky little admirer or big sister, and start the decline into an unscrupulous sports student. You can’t take away even this little hope.\"\nLin Li just blinked and raised an eyebrow.\n\"Funny, do you really think only you sports students have it rough? Have you ever considered the suffering of us culture students!\" Bai Bufan heard this, his eyes reddened as he grabbed Wang Ze’s collar, responding tearfully:\nWhen I was little, I was abused, soaked in liquid for several months, and during that time my family didn’t feed me, I could only curl up and see nothing, and later when I was finally rescued, I was hung upside down and beaten.\nAlso, the doctor said I have a severe oxygen addiction, and if I don’t breathe for a minute, I’d have problems, and this gas is a slow poison, once an ordinary person inhales it, their lifespan is unlikely to reach three digits.\nFor the next two years after being rescued, I couldn’t even walk, I could only crawl to get anywhere, during which I couldn’t sleep when I walked, and while inhaling, I couldn’t even exhale, yet I still persisted in living.\nEvery day at dawn I had to sleep, at dusk I had to get up, I had to eat when I was hungry, drink when I was thirsty, I couldn’t even stand while pooping, and I would run out of breath if I stopped breathing for a moment, the doctor said my heart has to beat at a frequency of dozens of times per minute for my entire life, even while sleeping I can’t rest.\nIf what you have counts as suffering, then what is mine?\"\nWang Ze: \"(;゜○゜)?\"\n\"...\"\n\"You’re an idiot.\" Realizing what was going on, Wang Ze’s mouth twitched.\n\"This Wang Ze, as a sports student, is really lacking in quality, listening to others’ sufferings, he responds with mockery and ridicule, completely lacking empathy, are all you sports students like this?\"\nBai Bufan mumbled with trembling lips, first looking at Lin Li’s face sorrowfully, then turned his head to look at Wang Ze’s fist.\nWait a second,\nWhy is it a fist?\n\"Sports students are supposed to use words, not fists! Wang Ze, stop!\" Bai Bufan sprinted away.\n\"Words, right? Bai Bufan, damn it, open your mouth, I’ve got something urgent.\"\n\"Then let’s use fists!\"\nThe two started a chase scene, running around the 400-meter track wasn’t too tiring, it seemed.\n\"Stop chasing.\" Lin Li interrupted their chase at this moment, his pupils quaking, eyeing his phone in disbelief, his expression especially grim: \"Wang Ze, you actually made it onto the confession wall.\"\n\"What?\" Wang Ze immediately let go of the dying Bai Bufan and jogged over.\nBai Bufan didn’t care about his impending doom either, and crawled over too.\nThree heads gathered in front of Lin Li’s phone.\nHe saw Nansang Campus Confession Wall had just updated with a post, one of the pictures was—\n\"Wall Wall, confessing to Wang Ze from Class 4, Grade 1, who just ran the 400 meters.\"\n\"Just wondering, does he have a girlfriend?\"\n\"Anon please.\"\n\"What the hell! Oh ho!!\" The three lines sent Wang Ze back to primal roots, screeching like a gorilla, even excitedly running circles around the two.\n\"No way, did someone really fess up to him!?\" Bai Bufan gasped alive again with anger, pulling out his own phone to confirm.\nDamn, it was true.\n\"No, gotta quickly comment ’no girlfriend’... wait, I can’t comment myself, that’s too forward, damn it, maybe someone’s watching me right now, I must present myself well, Lin Li, Bufan, you guys hurry, help me reply, say no girlfriend.\"\nWang Ze suddenly became serious, although the corners of his mouth were about to split to his ears, he quickly motioned for Bai Bufan and Lin Li to be good wingmen.\n\"Right, right, you two can also be helpful bros, just post my QQ number in the comments, and tease a bit.\" Wang Ze had everything planned out.\nLin Li, Bai Bufan: \"...\"\nHe’s quite street-smart.\nBai Bufan chuckled: \"Wang Ze, I already commented you’re gay and have a boyfriend.\"\nWang Ze: \"?\"\n\"Stop!\" Wang Ze lunged to snatch Bai Bufan’s phone, relieved only after seeing it wasn’t actually sent, then started tapping on Bai Bufan’s phone.\nBai Bufan let him do as he pleased.\nSeeing that a brother was admired, Bai Bufan was genuinely happy for him, not one bit jealous, damn it! Not! One! Bit! Jealous!\nThough for some reason, his molars just suddenly clenched together tightly.\n\"Getting ready for the 200-meter prelims, I have a feeling this is just the start! Damn, the sports day’s thrilling! I’m outta here!\" Wang Ze left like he was on adrenaline, leaving Bai Bufan holding his phone, looking at those gross comments ’he’ posted.\nJealous Yellow Dog Bai Bufan started to examine the post.\nWait a minute.\nBai Bufan suddenly frowned.\nHe exited the app and searched \"Son\" in his contact list, tapped on it.\n\"Lin Li, why does your QQ chat bubble look exactly like the one from the girl who confessed to Wang Ze just now?\" Bai Bufan raised his head abruptly, squinting his eyes.",

I’ll just switch to the default QQ theme; it suits better.\" Lin Li nodded calmly and began to make changes on his phone.\nBai Bufan: \"(;゜○゜)?\"\nHuh?\nWait a sec.\nOh no, why are my molars separating all of a sudden?\nBai Bufan tried to hold back his laughter, but couldn’t, and pointed at Lin Li, exclaiming, \"You beast! Lin Li! You’re such a beast!\"\n\"It’s a little white lie. See how happy he is? Even if he knows the truth later, he won’t blame me.\" During the chase between Wang Ze and Bai Bufan, Lin Li, who had confessed on the confession wall and got an instant reply, responded with a gentle smile.\nGood deeds leave no trace, hiding one’s accomplishments and name.\nThe red scarf that Lin Li wore for six years in elementary school is now a tangible presence on him.\n\"Did you learn it?\" Lin Li asked, trying to pass down this eternal flame to brighten the future.\n\"I learned it.\" Bai Bufan nodded emotionally, \"I’ll put it to use.\"\nAs the men’s 400-meter race for the second-year students began, the broadcast had already started notifying the female 400-meter runners to head to the check-in area.\nCheck-in needed to be done about half an hour earlier, so when the third-year race was over, the female race could seamlessly continue.\nWhen Chen Yu Ying returned to the field, her number badge was already pinned to her jacket.\nNumber 4011, no special meaning, as the numbers for each class were randomly assigned by the school. At most, they could be swapped internally for numbers they liked.\n\"A bit nervous?\" Lin Li tilted his head to look at the girl beside him and saw her lips pursing constantly. He smiled and asked.\n\"Yes, I feel like they’re all really strong.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, her eyes on the track but not very focused as her mind wandered.\n\"It’s all about participation,\" Lin Li comforted.\n\"But I still want to try my best to get a good ranking,\" Chen Yu Ying smiled.\n\"You can do it! Go for it, I think you’ll have no problem, class president. You’ll definitely have a smooth run and run faster than usual to take first place,\" Lin Li encouraged.\n\"Alright.\" Chen Yu Ying smiled happily.\nWhen the first group of first-years finished, it was Chen Yu Ying’s group’s turn.\nChen Yu Ying took off her jacket and handed it to Qu Wanqiu—Ding Sihan was in the check-in.\nQu Wanqiu handed the jacket and the water she had prepared to Lin Li, \"You hold on to this. When she crosses the line, I need to be free to support Ying Bao.\"\n\"Sure,\" Lin Li had no objections and watched Chen Yu Ying standing on the track.\nPerhaps it was the warmth of admiration, disturbing the girl’s hem, as Chen Yu Ying turned her head to meet his gaze.\nLin Li then made a funny face, raising his eyebrows continuously, almost performing an eyebrow dance like Zeng Xiaoxian.\nThen he looked down at the clothes in his hand, winking, indicating he was about to do something mischievous.\nChen Yu Ying couldn’t help but laugh, and her tension eased a bit.\nThe autumn wind suddenly picked up, blowing from behind, pushing the girl’s high ponytail and clothes forward.\nHer clothes clung to her back, accentuating her curves, her hair drawing graceful arcs in the air, the wind brushing across her cheeks and causing strands of hair to gently touch her ears.\nChen Yu Ying squinted her eyes slightly, a hint of surprise tucked away, her lips slightly turned up as she instinctively turned to look for the boy who had wished her a smooth journey earlier.\nHis words always seem to manifest.\nThe sunlight filtering through her hair cast a soft glow on her face, outlining her delicate features in a gentle halo, making her beauty irresistible to look away from.\n\"This underclassman looks so good!\"\n\"Which one? Wow, no need to point, I see, such delicacy.\"\n\"Is it just me? Why does it feel like the wind is only blowing on her? No way—does the wind these days only favor the good-looking ones?\"\n\"...\"\nLin Li could hear the praises from the boys and girls around for Chen Yu Ying and smiled softly.\nThe wind now listens to him, discriminating as it pleases, hehe.\n\"On your marks—get set—bang!\"\n\"Go! Class president! Go! Chen Yu Ying! Go!\"\nThe wind at the girl’s feet should theoretically be more precious than gold, but in reality, it’s just a cheap element gathered for ten minutes after eight hours.\n\"The class president isn’t slow, huh.\" Watching Chen Yu Ying run into the distance, Bai Bufan stopped cheering and turned to Lin Li.\nWhere did the person next to him go?\nBai Bufan quickly turned around, seeing Lin Li and Qu Wanqiu running to the other side to continue cheering.\n\"Poor Wang Ze.\"\nNow even if I run, I can’t catch up, Bai Bufan stayed behind, feeling wistful.\nLin Li’s favoritism was way too obvious.\n...\n\"All made it to the finals, each of you is amazing. Keep it up tomorrow,\" at Class Four’s sunshade base, Lin Li leaned against the post, praising Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, who still had the exuberance of sports on their faces, while sitting on a chair.\n\"Give me the water.\" Ding Sihan reached out and caught the water Lin Li tossed over, taking a gulp before speaking. \"Hehe, the weather’s nice today, the wind was just right, felt like I sprinted so fast at the end.\"\n\"I also think I ran faster than usual,\" Chen Yu Ying clasped her hands around the bottled water on the table, smiling and nodding.\nLin Li managed the natural wind on the field, making it aid them fully during their sprinting, while on the flip side, providing light assistance.\nAfter all, a strong tailwind throughout might feel odd to people. This way, it was just right, making it feel like the wind stopped at what should’ve been against-the-wind moments.\n\"I checked all the specific results of the prelims. If you two sustain this tomorrow, you can make top three, very impressive.\" Xie Wenjing walked over and said.",

You have to know, sometimes your finish line is just someone else’s starting point. Qu Wanqiu and I are guaranteed spots in the finals and we haven’t said anything.\" Lin Li threw some cold water on Ding Sihan at this moment.\n\"Guaranteed finals? Why?\" Ding Sihan was stunned upon hearing this.\nSo impressive?\n\"Because there’s no preliminary in the 1500-meter and 3000-meter events; the first race is the final.\" Chen Yu Ying explained for Lin Li.\nDing Sihan: \"...\"\n\"Then you talking like this because you made it to the finals is just disgraceful!\" Ding Sihan said speechlessly.\nIf he wasn’t too tired from running, Ding Sihan would have kicked Lin Li.\n\"Alright, you guys take a good rest, I’m going to cheer for Tianming who’s in the 100-meter race.\" Glancing at the project participant list on the whiteboard, Chen Tianming’s race was about to start, Bai Bufan was already waving at him from not far away, so Lin Li said.\nAlthough Chen Tianming is a dog from Class 17, he’s raised in Class 4, so he still needs some encouragement.\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Yiling, who is this Cheng Feng? Why did they suddenly add me? My display shows the card was shared by you.\" Looking at her phone, Chen Yu Ying suddenly raised her head and asked a girl not far away.\n\"Oh, Yu Ying, it’s a senior from the Calligraphy Club, who suddenly asked about you and wanted your contact details, so I gave them your WeChat.\"\nFang Yiling came over, a face full of suggestive smiles: \"Seems like he likes you.\"\n\"Got enamored by Ying Bao just now while running?\" Ding Sihan said in surprise upon hearing this.\n\"Totally, I’ve hardly spoken to him before, but suddenly he wanted to chat, even asked if Yu Ying was dating anyone.\" Fang Yiling blinked rapidly and then nodded.\nDing Sihan looked up toward the direction Lin Li went; the person was already gone, seemingly over at the track.\nCouldn’t have left at a worse time.\nWaste of space, hurry back to your mom.\nDing Sihan quickly took out his phone, preparing to contact Lin Li.\n\"What kind of ridiculous nickname is that? Did the wind agree to let him ride?\" a voice sounded from behind.\nStartled by the sudden voice in her ear, Ding Sihan shook all over, turned back and resisted the urge to punch the shadow, yelling angrily, \"Ah, Lin Li, are you a ghost? Walking silently, are you looking to die!!\"\nThe accused Lin Li felt innocent.\nDing Sihan patted her chest a few times, then squinted her eyes: \"Why did you come back, weren’t you going to cheer for Chen Tianming?\"\n\"A guy who wouldn’t even help move tables for our class but did for Class 17, I’m cheering for him? I’d be doing well not to break his legs, does he qualify? That guy...\" Lin Li sneered hearing this, his temper rising, speaking in an unfriendly tone.\nAn inexplicable anger, not just a visceral anger.\nIt’s all Chen Tianming’s fault.\n\"Just go ahead, Yu Ying, check what the senior says.\" Fang Yiling eagerly anticipated the gossip.\nLin Li kept sneering.\nNow, there’s double the inexplicable anger.\nIt’s all Chen Tianming and Fang Yiling’s fault.\nWhat kind of senior is that, is he over eighteen? Is he someone old? Not even older than me, yet called a senior?\nChen Yu Ying was secretly listening to Lin Li, who was behind her listing everything annoying Chen Tianming does, and hearing Fang Yiling said, she shook her head with a smile:\n\"Forget it, not keen on adding someone I don’t know.\"\n\"Maybe there’s official business.\" Fang Yiling continued to coax.\nSeeing Fang Yiling insist, Chen Yu Ying slightly frowned, hesitating a moment then nodded: \"Alright then.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: I’ve accepted your friend request, we can chat now.\"\n\"Lin Li, keep talking, what else did Chen Tianming do?\" Ding Sihan was listening to Lin Li’s story, and seeing him suddenly stop, purposely urged him.\n\"Shut up first, let me eat this gossip here.\" Lin Li’s eyes locked on the screen, he reached out to hush up Ding Sihan.\nAlmost pressed it right into his own face, Ding Sihan slapped Lin Li’s hand away, blinked then shook her head, but then leaned over too to watch Chen Yu Ying’s screen.\nChen Yu Ying didn’t mind being surrounded by everyone and wasn’t hiding anything.\n\"Cheng Feng: Hello.\"\n\"Cheng Feng: My name is Tao Qiyuan, a sophomore in Class 11.\"\n\"Cheng Feng: Just wanted to confirm, are you still single?\"\n\"How can there be such outrageous people in this world?!\"\nEveryone looked up at Lin Li, who suddenly became very angry, a bit confused.\nFacing everyone’s gaze, Lin Li pointed at the phone in response: \"Can’t you see what he’s doing? Why would anyone do something like this? This is just born!\"\n\"Huh?\" Ding Sihan was a bit bewildered, he hadn’t seen any connection to being born.\nBut it seems someone is genuinely anxious.\n\"What’s the matter?\" Chen Yu Ying was a bit confused too.\n\"Class President, didn’t you see what he’s doing? Can you give me the phone? I have to question him.\" Lin Li reached out his hand.\nChen Yu Ying tilted her head, blinked, then placed her phone in Lin Li’s hand: \"Go ahead.\"\n\"Eh? I’m really gonna ask?\" Surprised to actually have the phone, Lin Li blinked, for a moment didn’t move, just asked.\n\"Yeah.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\n\"Class President, I’m Lin Li.\" Lin Li still didn’t act immediately, but made a final confirmation.\n\"Of course I know you’re Lin Li.\" Chen Yu Ying chuckled, nodded vigorously.",

Am I bothering you?\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Delete.\"\nChen Yu Ying, Ding Sihan, Qu Wanqiu, Fang Yiling: \"?\"\n\"Hahahahahaha!! Lin Li, you’re a freaking genius, hahaha!\" Ding Sihan was the first to react, clutching her belly and starting to laugh.\nThen Qu Wanqiu and Chen Yu Ying also burst into laughter.\n\"Whew—\" Lin Li finally vented a bit of his frustration.\nHonestly, he could never do something like adding a single girl and then mocking her for not having a boyfriend.\nThis bastard Tao Qiyuan actually did such a thing.\nIndeed, it was a bit unbearable.\n\"Class president, this kind of in-your-face mockery is really too much. Even saying one more word to such a person brings bad luck; we must delete him, don’t you think?\"\nAlthough he sent the words \"Delete,\" Lin Li definitely needed to consult Chen Yu Ying before actually doing it.\nAt this moment.\n\"Cheng Feng\"\n\"The other party is typing...\"\n\"Cheng Feng\"\n\"The other party is typing...\"\n\"Cheng Feng\"\n\"The other party is typing...\"\nThe other party’s nickname showed countless times that he was typing, but not a single message was sent.\nAfter a little more than half a minute.\n\"Cheng Feng: Uh?\"\n\"Cheng Feng: No no no, don’t delete me!!\"\n\"Cheng Feng: No, younger sister, that’s not what I meant...\"\n\"Deleting directly is too impolite, let’s wait a bit.\" For Lin Li’s request, Chen Yu Ying shook her head, then took back her phone to start replying herself.\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Sorry, it was my friend replying on my WeChat just now.\"\n\"Cheng Feng: [Sticker]\"\n\"Cheng Feng: I see, no wonder, you scared me. I thought you were really going to delete me.\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Anything you need, senior?\"\n\"Cheng Feng: Just wanted to get to know you [Sticker]\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying: Sorry, I’m not used to having strangers on my list. If there’s nothing important, I’ll just delete you first.\"\nThen Chen Yu Ying looked up, handed the phone back to Lin Li, and nodded with a smile: \"You can delete him now.\"\n\"He sent you another message.\" Lin Li glanced at the phone screen and said.\n\"No need to look.\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head, not caring.\nSo, whoosh, the phone disappeared from Chen Yu Ying’s hand, and whoosh, it was back in her hand again.\nIn just the span of those moments, the world gained one more sad person.\nBut his sadness had a price, as the world lost one more person who’d randomly lash out.\n\"The class president is indeed polite, it’s necessary to follow the procedure, yes, indeed.\" Lin Li nodded with satisfaction.\nHey, this random tantrum, truly comes and goes unnamed.\nUnstarts unnamed, unstops unnamed.\n\"Yiling, don’t just casually give out my contact information to others anymore, at least ask me first. I’m not very fond of adding people I don’t know.\" Chen Yu Ying smiled at Lin Li, then turned and said to Fang Yiling.\n\"Oh oh, sorry, it won’t happen again next time.\" Fang Yiling was completely satisfied.\nIt was refreshing.\nBeing able to see such corporate-level comprehension of chat records.\nAnd possibly getting a more interesting scoop.\nIt would be worth dying for the ticket price.\n\"Wanqiu, your cooking skills are good, can you smell if there’s some seasoning in the air? It seems a bit sour, my stomach is growling from the scent.\" At this moment, Ding Sihan stretched and said to Qu Wanqiu at the table.\nUpon hearing this, Qu Wanqiu seriously closed her eyes and took a sniff, then opened her eyes somewhat shocked and nodded: \"It does seem like there is.\"\nThen Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu simultaneously turned their heads to look at Lin Li: \"Lin Li, do you have any idea?\"\n\"Nope? What is it anyway?\" Lin Li sniffed, having no idea what these two girls were talking about.\nHis nose might as well be donated to a deaf person in need.\n\"... Second track, first-year class twenty, Xu Feng; third track, first-year class four, Chen Tianming; fourth track...\"\nNo time to care about the games of the two girls, Lin Li now had very important things to do, so he turned around and headed toward the track:\n\"I’m going to cheer for Chen Tianming first, talk later!\"\n\"Huh?\" Ding Sihan exclaimed ’confusedly’, shouting in the direction Lin Li was leaving: \"Lin Li, didn’t you say Chen Tianming was a lackey of class seventeen, not worthy of being from class four, not worthy of being cheered by you?\"\n\"Ding Sihan, if you keep talking like that, even if we’re close, I’ll scold you! Chen Tianming is my best buddy! I absolutely won’t allow you to insult him like this!\" Lin Li shouted angrily as he ran, looking back.\n\"Chen Tianming, you petty.\"\n\"Forget it, Chen Tianming, long life ahead.\"\n\"——\"By the Cloud, a Small Lin Li\"\"",

Her right thumb was busy, constantly opening WeChat and then returning to the main screen, repeating this meaningless command. Her left fingers were rubbing the edge of the phone.\nHer cheeks, which had turned pale after resting, now blushed faintly again, as if stained by the sunset of an autumn day.\nFinally, the phone screen became boring, and her thoughts drifted elsewhere. Chen Yu Ying couldn’t help but sneak a glance in the direction Lin Li had left, her lips curving up before quickly pressing them down.\n\"Ying Bao! Soon you’ll no longer be my Ying Bao! Did you see Lin Li’s reaction just now? He was almost ready to follow the signal and duel with that someone, getting as anxious as Bai Bufan.\"\nSeeing Chen Yu Ying’s silence, Ding Sihan turned her head at that moment, leaning on Chen Yu Ying’s shoulder, deliberately slowing down her speech, teasing.\n\"What, hasn’t Lin Li always been like that? It’s not like it’s the first day you’ve known him, what’s there to be surprised about?\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head with a smile.\n\"Al~wa~ys~ li~ke~ thi~s~?\" Ding Sihan rubbed her head against Chen Yu Ying’s shoulder, repeating in a peculiar tone, \"It’s like you’re intentionally not having the same conversation as me.\"\nChen Yu Ying just blinked, seemingly not understanding what Ding Sihan was saying.\nDing Sihan suddenly laughed out loud.\nWhy does it feel so familiar?\n\"Si Han, here’s the phone for you to delete it.\" Qu Wanqiu didn’t let Chen Yu Ying off either, suddenly taking out her phone and handing it to Ding Sihan.\n\"Giving me the right to delete your friend? Wanqiu, what do you mean by that?\" Ding Sihan was first stunned, then her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\"No meaning, just a gesture.\"\n\"How could I dare?\"\n\"No big deal, I even feel it’s not big enough.\"\nListening to the repeated gestures, a foreigner who has learned some Chinese might blush hearing it.\nChen Yu Ying looked up, lightly biting her lower lip, then chuckled softly but immediately held it back: \"What are you doing, if you want to delete, I can let you delete too? It’s the same.\"\nDing Sihan nodded, clapped her hands, and said: \"The same? Then can we sleep with you, when is Lin Li?\"\nQu Wanqiu lazily nodded: \"I can make room.\"\n\"You two!\"\nChen Yu Ying’s face really turned red this time, her cheeks puffed up in anger.\nLuckily, Lin Li didn’t see it, or Bai Bufan’s backside would be in trouble.\n...\n\"Has Chen Tianming started running?\" Lin Li found Bai Bufan, Zhou Baowei, and the others at the side of the 100-meter track and then inquired.\n\"Yo, what wind blew you, Lin Li, the big busy man, here, I thought you no longer cared about your buddies.\" Bai Bufan said sarcastically after hearing Lin Li’s voice, turning his head.\nEarlier, he was waving for Lin Li to come over, but this guy suddenly turned his head and went back.\nThis is a blatant betrayal! The wound of betrayal sometimes heals!\n\"Don’t mention the wind to me, hearing that word makes me mad now.\" Lin Li waved his hand, then punched the air beside him, saying coldly: \"I really want to ride the wind to the west.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWhere does this violent and suicidal tendency come from?\n\"Not yet, soon.\" Bai Bufan finally responded to the earlier question, pointing to the starting line.\nFor a 100-meter race, people mostly choose to watch around the back half of the track and the finish line to see the results.\n\"On your marks—get set—bang!\"\nThe 100-meter race took less than ten seconds, with the cheers from both sides of the track, the runners crossed the finish line one by one.\nChen Tianming finished third in his group, not sure if he can make it to the finals.\nLin Li and the others didn’t go up to talk to Chen Tianming because Yao Qiaoqiao was also at the finish line. After Chen Tianming crossed the line, she approached him, handed him a bottle of water, and started a conversation.\nWith the water in hand, Chen Tianming looked as if he had a tail, it would be wagging like a helicopter.\nAfter a while of talking, Yao Qiaoqiao turned to leave, and upon noticing Lin Li and the others, she walked over: \"Lin Li, Bai Bufan... you’re here too.\"\nWithout much chatting, exchanging simple greetings and asking each other if they participated in any events, Qiaoqiao left after saying they would cheer if they meet.\n\"Got any water? I’m so thirsty.\" Chen Tianming then came over, commanding Lin Li and the others.\n\"If you’re thirsty, damn it, drink water! Isn’t there a bottle in your hand?\" Lin Li pointed at the mineral water in Chen Tianming’s hand, looking at him like he was crazy.\n\"How can I drink this! This is the water Qiaoqiao gave me, it’s Holy Water, I must take it back to the dorm, place it on the table, and worship it every day. It’ll definitely bring me good luck.\" Chen Tianming’s eyes widened immediately, clutching the water to his shoulder.\nZhou Baowei, Lin Li, Bai Bufan: \"...\"\nYour mom.\nZhou Baowei: \"Others wear jade pendants around their necks to summon wealth, and you wear a collar to summon lickers, huh.\"\nBai Bufan: \"Tianming, let’s be straight with each other, have you ever thought of collecting Yao Qiaoqiao’s chewed sugar cane, gum, or betel nuts to make tea with?\"\nLin Li: \"Bring wealth, bring, bring wealth.\"\nAsked such a humiliating question by Bai Bufan, Chen Tianming shook his head furiously, his face turning white in denial: \"Impossible, Qiaoqiao doesn’t chew betel nuts.\"\n\"And sugarcane and gum?\" Bai Bufan was about to breathe a sigh of relief, but suddenly squinted his eyes and quickly asked.",

You’re not seriously collecting, are you?\"\nChen Tianming didn’t speak, just blinked.\nBai Bufan: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nYour mom.\n\"Someone! Someone! Exorcist needed! Get the simping spirit out of Chen Tianming!\"\nBai Bufan was really worried now, being roommates with such a bug won’t land you love, a heavy hand is needed.\n\"It’s not like that, not like that,\" Chen Tianming hurriedly denied, mainly because this group would actually take action. Holding up the water in his arms, he explained happily:\n\"Collecting this is an important step for me; today I got Qiaoqiao’s water, so how far am I from getting Qiaoqiao’s heart?\"\n\"Tianming, it indeed might not be far. Just now in my chat with Yao Qiaoqiao, I found out that getting her heart seems quite simple,\" Lin Li said to Chen Tianming, turning his head.\n\"Hmm? What did you discover? An outsider might see things clearer, you might notice details I’ve missed, go on, elaborate.\" Chen Tianming immediately took out his phone, even opened the notes app.\n\"It’s not much use telling you now because there’s a problem I haven’t solved. Without solving this problem, even if you get it, it won’t last long, you can’t keep the heart.\" Lin Li shook his head, frowning as if deep in thought.\n\"No problem, tell us the issue, we’ll brainstorm, the four of us together must have at least... half a brain, maybe we can come up with a solution.\" Chen Tianming confidently said after looking around.\nLin Li nodded, and then slowly revealed the problem bothering him: \"I just don’t know how to deal with the remaining corpses properly.\"\n\"Handling remaining corpses, huh? That’s indeed tricky. This sort of thing, I think...\" Chen Tianming pinched his chin, beginning to think —\nWait a minute.\nDon’t bother thinking just yet, your mom.\nChen Tianming: \"o.O?\"\nCorpses? Where do the corpses come from?\n\"Wait, Lin Li, let’s put that problem aside first. Tell your dad, how the hell are you planning to help me get Qiaoqiao’s heart?\" Gulping down his fear, Chen Tianming asked.\n\"I just discovered during the chat that she doesn’t have much defense against us, and her combat power isn’t high. As long as a white knife goes in, a red knife comes out, it’s simple.\" Lin Li explained his findings, looking sinister:\n\"But friends who often commit murder should know, killing is easy, getting rid of the corpse is hard, if you don’t handle other parts, the heart in your hand will soon be taken by the cops. You don’t want love taken by force, do you?\"\nChen Tianming: \"...\"\nYour mom.\nSo, it’s like this after all.\n\"If it’s that problem, I have a solution.\" Bai Bufan raised his hand at this moment and said, \"I know how to deal with the remaining corpses.\"\n\"Oh? Tell us.\" Lin Li looked at Bai Bufan expectantly.\nHe still had faith in Bai Bufan’s abilities.\n\"We just bury the remaining corpses directly, the key is to later cover the area with endangered plants, that way no one dares to dig it up, because digging up endangered plants is illegal, meaning we can use legal means to protect ourselves!\" Bai Bufan offered his solution.\nLin Li suddenly understood.\nIt really could work.\nChen Tianming was right; brainstorming, the power of the masses is amazing.\n\"But here’s another question, how do we get endangered plants? Transplanting them is also illegal, what if the law turns against us?\" Zhou Baowei asked.\n\"I have a solution to that too,\" Bai Bufan obviously had it figured out.\n\"Let’s hear it.\"\n\"Bao Wei, do you have time?\"\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nThis question is too familiar; the last time this bastard asked this, Zhou Baowei already knew what Bai Bufan’s plan was.\n—\"Get lost! I don’t have time! Don’t send me digging plants for you guys again!\"\nAnd so, the situation fell into a stalemate once more.\n\"Think, think, let’s think together, when faced with difficulties, think and think, don’t let any clues go, like a super detective, think carefully.\" Lin Li sang a nursery rhyme while thinking.\nLooking at the three people seriously pondering, even sitting on the field with knitted brows, Chen Tianming: \"...\"\nThey are genuinely trying to help him win Yao Qiaoqiao’s heart.\nBut damn, what a choice in friends.\n\"Gentlemen? Um...\" Chen Tianming began.\n\"Don’t interrupt, I’m thinking.\" Lin Li interrupted him.\n\"Instead of figuring out how to get Qiaoqiao’s heart, can you think of a way to get me some water to drink? I approached you all to ask for a drink!\" Parched, Chen Tianming complained, giving each of them a gentle kick in the back and speaking coldly.\n\"Don’t you have your own? Want us to spit it out for you?\" Bai Bufan looked up at the words.\n\"Give me a test tube, let’s keep things hygienic,\" Lin Li looked up at the words.\nLin Li had learned how to collect saliva, first rinse with clean water, then press the tongue against the upper or lower gums, tilt the head slightly, and let the saliva flow into the test tube touching the lower lip.\nChen Tianming: \"?\"\n\"I meant a sip of water, not saliva! Damn it, expecting anything from you guys is foolish, I’m going back to get it myself!\" Chen Tianming shook his head grumpily, heading back to the classroom base.",

Chen Tianming suddenly stopped, raising his bottle of mineral water to admire the sun, and couldn’t help but say.\n\"Don’t act like you get love just because you don’t love food,\" Bai Bufan scoffed.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Bai Bufan, I swear I’ll get a whole crew of bread people to deal with you, don’t leave after school!\"\n\"Then remember to prepare some tomato ketchup for me!\"\n\"Any salad dressing? Just whipped it up.\"\n\"What the heck kind of salad dressing is this?\"\n\"...\"\nThe two started messing around.\nDodging Zhou Baowei’s ’Mount Tai Meteor Fall’ move, Bai Bufan shook him off, noticing Lin Li hadn’t said a word and was slowly walking toward the class gathering spot. He returned to Lin Li’s side, slightly puzzled, and asked:\n\"Lin Li, what are you doing? Acting like an emo kid?\"\n\"My affections seem to have changed,\" Lin Li said softly, with the autumn afternoon wind tousling his bangs, while he gazed at Chen Tianming with unfocused eyes.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nHe followed Lin Li’s gaze to Chen Tianming, then back to Lin Li.\nBuddy, don’t be like this, you’re scaring me.\nBut Tianming, maybe Lin Li is more suited for you than Qiaoqiao. Every cloud has a silver lining.\n\"Xiaojing, Xiaojing, why can’t Xiaojing save me?\" Lin Li looked up at the sky, his expression shifting.\n\"Huh? What happened? Why can’t Xiaojing save you? What about Feifei, can Feifei save you too? Feifei is the stuff of dreams, my lifelong goal is to be her Piggy Hero, please don’t let her go to Jinluo while I go to Shuanghui!\"\nIt’s important to take care of the chicken farm, whatever happens with Chen Tianming is fine, Bai Bufan inquired with concern.\n\"I’m talking about something else, Xiaojing can’t save me!\" Lin Li waved his hand, speeding up as he walked away.\nCalling out to Xiaojing in his heart countless times seemed meaningless.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nWhat’s the deal?\n...\nOn the first day’s afternoon, only preliminaries were held, and Class Four’s results were decent, with quite a few advancing.\nNansang Middle School’s sports field wasn’t fully lit, so there were no night competitions, but students weren’t allowed free activities; they had to self-study.\nWhen the afternoon events ended, Lin Li returned to the dormitory.\n\"Bao Wei, don’t just stand there, come lie down, don’t be shy, treat it like your own bed.\"\nAfter Lin Li returned to his bed, he saw Zhou Baowei, who was feeling awkward about his first visit to the dormitory. Lin Li moved over slightly to make room for him.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nSquinting his eyes, he moved close to Lin Li’s legs, using his sense of smell to confirm Lin Li’s socks and feet were odorless, then he finally relaxed a little.\n\"I helped you both carry stuff twice this afternoon, you handle the takeout later,\" Zhou Baowei said after settling onto the bed.\nA fair request.\nFor sustainable exploitation, Zhou Baowei couldn’t be used like a beast all the time; it’s not good for his longevity.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan exchanged a look, and an intense spark of competitive spirit was ignited.\n\"Darn, why do I feel like I got shocked?\" Bai Bufan said before his eyes could turn vicious, becoming clear suddenly.\nStatic electricity running rampant even before winter. Ugh, annoying and distracting.\n\"Hey, how about you two open Douyin, and whoever swipes to a positive content first goes down to fetch the takeout? What do you say?\" Zhou Baowei suddenly had an idea and suggested to them.\n\"Alright.\" Lin Li nodded, accepting the challenge.\n\"Fine.\" Bai Bufan agreed too.\nUnder everyone’s watchful eyes, Lin Li opened the short video app.\nAnd got eliminated.\nThe opening video was so motivational, it made all three of them very positive.\nAs you grow up, you realize the phone is your greatest nostalgic link, women inside, myself outside; it’s deep nostalgia that never gets resolved.\n\"Man, what can I say? Lin Li, you’re out!\" Lin Li admitted it was deserved that he lost.\n\"Useless, but hey, if I lose later let that blogger promote me a bit,\" Bai Bufan scoffed, opening his phone.\nBai Bufan was eliminated too.\n\"Looks like a tie then,\" Lin Li didn’t expect he could revive himself, so he moved his fingers again.\nLin Li first lost a round.\nBai Bufan tied it.\nLin Li lost another round.\nBai Bufan tied it again.\nThe spectating Zhou Baowei: \"...\"\n\"Are you selling your accounts? I’ll give you five hundred; if it’s not enough, I can add more, if it is, pretend I didn’t say anything.\" Seeing these two fully developed accounts, Zhou Baowei admitted he felt tempted for a moment.\nAfter several rounds, Lin Li finally emerged victorious—swiping to a wealth-related video.\nBai Bufan lost but was still proud.\nThe two exchanged information on bloggers they approved of and began ordering takeout.\nWhile waiting for takeout, Lin Li played PUBG with them.\nIn-game, Lin Li and his two friends follow three principles:\n1. Don’t criticize middle-aged people, because they represent their future; putting themselves in their shoes, being mocked when all they wanted after a day’s work was relaxation, feels like the world’s ending.\n2. Don’t insult women because they’re gentlemen.\n3. Don’t berate kids because they are the future of gaming.\n4. In the face of battle, there’s no distinction between males, females, young, or old; above principles do not apply, go for it, soldiers.\nHence, the dorm’s atmosphere got slightly more inappropriate.\nWhile playing games, the juniors loved to shout: Mama, mama mama, mama.\nAnd now, the three in the dorm were much the same: **Mama* ma**ma* mama**.\nIn over half an hour, they played over a dozen matches.\n\"Nice! Nice! We’re champions!\" Lin Li and Zhou Baowei hugged, bursting into tears of joy.\nThey won the match.\nBai Bufan also stepped off his bed to join the celebration.\nLin Li glanced up, coldly saying, \"Survived ’til the end with a 3.0 rating.\"\nZhou Baowei glanced up, coldly saying, \"Total victory by doing nothing.\"\nBai Bufan: \"...\"\nNo time to discuss how the rating system is alienating people with these two jokers; the takeout call came a few minutes ago, hence Bai Bufan left a middle finger behind and went downstairs.\nAnd Zhou Baowei also got off from Lin Li’s bed.\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"The soul abandoned in a large intestine yearning for the outside light,\" Zhou Baowei said, deeply walking towards the restroom.\nAlright, taking a dump.\nLin Li, having nothing to do, continued nurturing his account while waiting for food with his legs crossed.\nAwhile later.\n[There’s a practitioner in the sect being tempted by Heart Demon into the demonic path, stealing other’s opportunities, which is misfortune for the sect. If not managed, it could become a hidden threat for the sect.]\n[For the future of the sect, for smooth cultivation, and for solid Tao, can’t let it go unchecked, must lend a hand!]\n[Task triggered!]\n[Task Five: Capture and discipline a disciple for stealing and deter others in the sect from committing the same offense.]\n[Task Reward: Physical Improvement: Intelligence increased by 10%; ability to hide presence increased by 100%; system currency*100]\nOriginally lying down, Lin Li immediately perked up.\nHe soon started a self-translation—someone around is stealing, he must go discipline them.\nAnd Lin Li knew, task scenes generally occur nearby.\nLin Li got it immediately; he angrily ran to the restroom door and knocked: \"Zhou Baowei! What the heck are you secretly eating behind my back?!\"\nPeople are really vulnerable and helpless when taking a dump, especially the still wiping Zhou Baowei, who looked at the vibrating restroom door perplexed: \"I’m eating lemons?\"\n\"Then hand over the lemons!\"\n\"Heck!\"\nThen there was another loud sound, and the whole dormitory shook.\nAlthough Zhou Baowei didn’t know what happened outside, based on experience, he judged it was caused by someone kicking the door which led to the tremble.\nLin Li stopped knocking, turned back, and looked at Bai Bufan who walked in with a dark expression.\n\"What’s wrong?\"\n\"The takeout...\" As he spoke, Bai Bufan’s eyes seemed to hold a flea, \"was stolen.\"",

Lin Li followed his gaze and noticed that they had ordered separately, and yet he was only holding two bags of delivery.\nAfter placing the food on the table, Bai Bufan spoke coldly:\n\"I wonder which bastard couldn’t afford offerings for his parents in heaven and went on to steal our delivery for it.\"\n\"Looks like today, I have to be Nuwa and go screw his mom hard.\"\nLin Li nodded. It seemed now the task wasn’t aimed at the little food thief Zhou Baowei but the stolen deliveries.\n\"Is there any surveillance?\" Lin Li turned back to ask.\n\"No,\" Bai Bufan shook his head. \"I checked, there’s no surveillance near the iron fence.\"\n\"What’s up? What happened?\" Zhou Baowei, having finished his lemon, also came out of the toilet to air out the smell and asked.\nLin Li, who had originally been on the balcony, quickly ran back into the dorm.\nDamn, it stinks.\n\"The delivery got stolen,\" Bai Bufan replied.\n\"Did it really get stolen? Could it be that you just couldn’t find it?\" Zhou Baowei still seemed to have a lot of goodwill toward the world.\n\"Impossible, there were only about ten deliveries there. I checked each one twice, definitely couldn’t find it,\" Bai Bufan shook his head firmly.\n\"Could it be cats or dogs...\"\n\"It was definitely stolen by a person,\" Lin Li chimed in to agree.\nThere are no stray cats or dogs on Nansang Campus, and considering the task description, it’s definitely a student’s doing.\nGrades and character aren’t always linked; even at top schools like Tsinghua or Peking University, people would still steal deliveries.\n\"Damn, stealing delivery? How idiotic is that? Can’t even afford a meal? Why wouldn’t the money their mom made from selling herself be used for them? Did it all get burnt for their real dad, or did they use it to find their wild dads?\"\nZhou Baowei, as a foodie, was deeply enraged by such behavior.\nThough he’d heard about such things, this was the first time it happened nearby.\nIndeed, the amount involved in stealing a delivery isn’t large, but it’s easy to break a person, especially after waiting for half a day, being starving, and going happily to pick up your food only to find it’s been stolen.\nAt that time, you’d already missed the cafeteria, and ordering another delivery means staying hungry for at least another half hour.\nThis is what true despair looks like.\nOften, losing a twenty-yuan delivery can feel much worse than losing a fifty-yuan bill.\n\"I can only say it’s insanely disgusting, what a scummy thing,\" Bai Bufan kicked the bed frame in visible anger. \"This bastard still doesn’t know he’s unleashed a real demon.\"\n\"Without surveillance and no witnesses, it’s going to be hard to catch them,\" Zhou Baowei shook his head after thinking for a while.\n\"In this case, you can only consider yourself unlucky. Even if you report it, at most it’s just filed, they won’t mobilize resources to investigate. That’s why people dare to steal,\" Bai Bufan said, quite dejected.\n\"Forget it, calm down, and order another delivery, consider the missing one my treat, just eat some of mine and Lin Li’s to fill your stomach,\" Zhou Baowei consoled.\nLin Li naturally didn’t mind either.\nA call of ’brother’, and it’s brotherhood for life.\nBesides, they’ve always been taking care of Bai Bufan, it’s both a responsibility and a duty.\n\"No need, just eat yours. Consider myself unlucky; bringing negative emotions onto brothers isn’t good,\" Bai Bufan smiled gratefully at first, but still shook his head and took out his phone as if to order new delivery.\nLooks like this really hit Bai Bufan hard; the kid’s finally starting to act properly.\n\"No worries, I ordered a lot, definitely enough to eat! Join in, brothers, don’t be shy!\" Zhou Baowei said sincerely after exchanging a look with Lin Li.\n\"But the one that got stolen was yours,\" Bai Bufan said and then, in frustration, kicked the wall hard again.\n\"As I said, it doesn’t mat—\"\nZhou Baowei: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nWait.\nNo way.\nZhou Baowei rushed to the two bags of delivery on the table with a look of horror, stepping heavily, the ground shaking beneath him.\nHe checked the receipts with trembling hands.\nMr. Bai.\nMr. Lin.\nDamn it! Where’s Mr. Zhou’s? Where the hell is my Mr. Zhou!?\nSilence.\nTears fell as I learned the truth.\n\"Del!i!very! thief! Fuck! You!r! Mother!\" At this moment, Zhou Baowei was a king descending from the heavens, fiercely furious.\n\"No need, just eat yours. Consider myself unlucky; bringing negative emotions onto brothers isn’t good,\" was Bai Bufan’s earlier statement, which now became significantly clearer.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nJust now, I was quite empathetic toward Bai Bufan, but now, the subtext of that sentence seems... kinda different?\nSo Zhou Baowei turned to Bai Bufan and gave a forced smile, \"Bufan, even your imaginary mom must suffer like the real mom of the delivery thief.\"\n...\nOn Lin Li’s suggestion, the three of them went downstairs again to the iron fence area to double-check.\nIt was indeed stolen, and there indeed was no surveillance.\nThe nearest camera was aimed beneath the dorm, nowhere near the fence area, making it easy to stay in a blind spot the entire time.\n\"Damn it, the rich steal my life, the poor steal my delivery; good things never happen to me, why do bad things always choose me?\" Zhou Baowei ground his teeth.\nBai Bufan was also grinding his teeth, \"Jealous of misfortune.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\n\"Jay Chou met Kobe, why aren’t you envious of Jay?\" Lin Li said with a chuckle, frowning in thought at what he heard.",

Bao Wei, you should eat what Lin Li and I have first.\" Bai Bufan kicked a stone and cursed quietly, patting Zhou Baowei on the shoulder to comfort him.\nThe grievance just now wasn’t an act.\nAs for saying I would eat my own food, of course, it was a joke.\n\"Actually, takeout isn’t expensive, I also have food in my dorm, but it still feels annoying, especially when I think about how this bastard enjoyed eating it. It makes me even more annoyed.\" Zhou Baowei spat on the ground.\nAfter all, there’s no surveillance.\nIt’s a pity Chen Tianming isn’t here, no drinks.\n\"I can only hope he steals again tomorrow, I beg him to keep up the theft.\" Lin Li clasped his hands together and looked to the sky, praying sincerely.\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei both looked at Lin Li: \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Don’t you want to catch him?\" Lin Li tilted his head and looked at the two.\n\"Of course, I do! I certainly do! Whoever dares steal Zhou Baowei’s food, he’s the first, and I wish a Mount Tai meteor would fall on him.\" Zhou Baowei nodded, his words tinged with murderous intent.\n\"I’ve turned into a demon too, Lin Li, you have to understand, if I become a Buddha, there will be no demons in the world, if I become a demon, ten wives!\nNo matter that guy’s gender, I’ve decided that person will become my first wife, and I’ll send them to study in the United Kingdom to make them love the feeling of British police!\" Bai Bufan nodded, his words filled with sarcasm.\n\"Then let’s hope he doesn’t disappoint us, or another takeout thief comes along to bear our wrath.\" Lin Li nodded, \"I’ll prepare the equipment for catching the takeout thief tonight, and if he dares to steal again tomorrow, we’ll surely catch him.\"\nCompleting the task requires not just fright but also catching, Lin Li hopes he gets the message.\nAh Zu, don’t stop, there’s no Jackie Chan outside.\nAnd nothing better deters others than catching a takeout thief.\nThe task didn’t seem to stipulate that I have to catch the one who just stole, but it would be best if we can catch him.\n\"Alright, we’ll catch him!\" Hearing Lin Li’s plan, Bai Bufan’s eyes were filled with anticipation.\nBoth venting and fun.\n\"Let’s go, let’s go back and eat something for now, we’re all bros, no need to be polite.\" With the strategy confirmed, staying here any longer was pointless, Lin Li and Bai Bufan wrapped their arms around Zhou Baowei’s shoulders and headed back to the dormitory.\nThree minutes later.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan stared at Zhou Baowei.\n\"Why don’t you still be polite, huh? Who’s your bro?\" Lin Li sneered.\n\"I say the takeout thief should steal yours too, already ordered it for you, and let you eat it? Want to take all the good stuff? Bao Wei, go eat shit!\" Bai Bufan sneered.\nBeing cursed at, Zhou Baowei said nothing, simply continued attacking Lin Li and Bai Bufan’s takeout.\nIt seemed the food in front wasn’t just ordinary rice, but mixed with the takeout thief’s mother’s ashes, demanding a decisive bite.\n...\nAfter dinner, the three went to the classroom.\nThere weren’t even a few guys in the hallway for a change, and when entering the classroom, sure enough, everyone was playing on their phones.\nThe class computer was still playing music, something that would normally be strictly prohibited.\nHowever, on Nansang Campus in the afternoon, after dinner, there are about ten minutes of broadcast time, and usually one song is played each day.\n\"Hey! Kid! Give me a power supply!\" Zhang Haoyang heard the sound of the door opening behind him, turned around, and seeing it was the three of them, raised his hand to signal.\n\"Hello, I’m a shop assistant from Class Four Grade One, how can I help you?\" Lin Li immediately stepped up and bowed to ask the customer.\n\"Hi, I need a power supply I can plug into.\" Zhang Haoyang stroked his chin, looking Lin Li up and down with a lewd gaze.\n\"I’m sorry, Nansang Middle School is a legitimate school, we don’t provide such services.\" Lin Li regretfully shook his head, \"Check back with me after school.\"\n\"Hahaha damn, Lin Li, you’re still as crazy as ever, quick, quick, do you have a power bank, my phone’s about to die, emergency!\" Zhang Haoyang laughed and cursed, waving his phone for help.\nLooking up, Lin Li saw that every powered socket in the class was charging a power bank or simply a phone, even the socket above the blackboard wasn’t spared.\nLin Li took a power bank from his drawer and handed it to Zhang Haoyang: \"Deposit two hundred, three per hour.\"\n\"My Ant Credit is a solid eight hundred, and you’re charging me a two hundred deposit?\" Zhang Haoyang unceremoniously took it to charge, and as someone with a reputation as the king of credit, he questioned Lin Li upon hearing this.\n\"Then the deposit is eight hundred.\"\nZhang Haoyang: \"?\"\nThis, isn’t this wrong?\n\"I was asking you to trust my credit!\"\n\"Then promise it now.\"\n\"Get lost.\"\n\"All these mainstream playlists are so old-fashioned and follow the trend.\" Returning to his seat, Lin Li sneered at the song displayed on the projector.\n\"Then what do you usually listen to, Mr. Niche?\" Bai Bufan laughed and asked upon hearing this.\n\"’The World in Ma’s Eyes,’ ’The World in Ma’s Eyes Remix Version,’ ’The World in Ma’s Eyes 0.8 Times Speed Down-tuned Ultimate Ballad Ma Jiaqi Edition’...\" Lin Li rattled off.\nUpon hearing this, Bai Bufan gave a thumbs up in full approval: \"Can’t argue, this is indeed niche.\"\nGenerally speaking, at this somewhat immature age of Grade One, every class has those pretentious guys who like to flaunt with multimedia.",

      "content": "Chapter 370: Chapter 259 Wang Ze’s requirements are all fulfilled_3\nSome students would play their indie music to show off their unique taste, hoping for recognition; some would play a DJ track, put on a hat, and stand at the podium, constantly adjusting the multimedia volume, fancying themselves as DJ Jiahao from the class next door; or would show a stock chart and start rambling onstage with their friends, thinking they were stock gods...\nHowever, in Class 1 of Grade 4, though many were born in a peculiar way, or as dogs or clowns, there were really none of these distinguished personalities.\nAt most, Qin Zeyu liked to use multimedia for playing minesweeper.\n\"Ahem.\"\nWhile Lin Li and Bai Bufan were discussing whether Ma Jiaqi’s world was seen through the bicycle handlebars or the wheels, Wang Ze moved from the Right Guardian’s seat to the back row and coughed twice.\nNo one paid attention.\n\"Ahem, ahem.\" He coughed louder this time.\n\"Bufan, pass me a mask.\" Lin Li opened the window for ventilation while covering his mouth and reached out to Bai Bufan.\nWang Ze sighed: \"...\"\n\"Your mom.\"\n\"Lin Li, Bufan, did you check the confession wall today?\" Wang Ze directly sat on Bai Bufan’s lap, tapped the table, and said in a light tone.\n\"Nope.\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"You should pay more attention, really take a look. I feel this platform is quite necessary as it provides a channel for communication among everyone. You know, I even saw your clown highlight on the confession wall, aren’t you concerned about that?\" Wang Ze said seriously.\n\"Did you get on the confession wall again?\" Lin Li asked, frowning.\n\"What the heck? Huh? Has this spread so widely? Even you both know? Ugh, whatever, nothing much to say about it. On October 23rd at 2:56 p.m., on the confession wall of the Nansang campus, on the fifth picture of that post, they indeed called out my name, Wang Ze, for a confession.\nBut it isn’t important, no need for everyone to remember it. I’ve already kind of forgotten about it myself. After all, they’re trivial things, if you hadn’t mentioned it, I would have forgotten.\nAlthough Lin Li, you were on it too, wearing a clown skin, unlike me, original skin. Sigh, I really envy you, having a skin.\" Wang Ze scratched his head and humbly said.\nIt’s apparent that being this popular is kind of troubling for him.\nLin Li, upon hearing this, tilted his head to look at Bai Bufan behind Wang Ze.\nWang Ze?\nBai Bufan nodded.\nLin Li took another look.\nWas it you who submitted it too?\nBai Bufan shook his head.\nOK.\nLin Li then looked at Wang Ze, his expression showing a hint of pity for a moment.\nSee how you’ve fooled this kid.\n\"Sigh, honestly, being charismatic is indeed a bit of a headache,\" Wang Ze continued to say proudly, \"being too charismatic isn’t that great either, making those two girls shy, even though I’ve posted my contact information below for so long, they’re still mentally preparing themselves, not willing to add me yet.\nBut I don’t mind; I actually like this shy personality. I just hope they can be a bit taller and slimmer.\"\nWang Ze giggled foolishly, already starting to make choices.\nLin Li glanced at Bai Bufan, and Bai Bufan looked back at Lin Li.\nOne claims to be 184 but is actually 186, another claims to be 179 but is actually 181, hmm, both quite tall.\nAnd both Lin Li and Bai Bufan are slender—Lin Li used to be a pure stick-figure, now a lean physique, looking toned when shirtless, slim when clothed, which Lin Li himself considers the perfect body.\nA burly muscular type like Zhai Kai is not in Lin Li’s aesthetic preference at all.\nThat makes Wang Ze satisfied.\nPerfectly meets his taste.\n\"It should come true, Wang Ze.\" Thus, Lin Li and Bai Bufan nodded, \"Probably even taller than you, you’ve really hit the jackpot, lucky guy.\"\n\"Anything taller than me would be a no, I don’t want to have to stand on my tiptoes to kiss a guy, that’s just too weird, bro. Between 160 to 170 is perfect.\" Wang Ze firmly shook his hand after hearing this.\n\"Who on earth would want to kiss you?\" Lin Li’s face scrunched slightly in slight disgust at this remark.\n\"What?\" Wang Ze was puzzled.\n\"Nothing, continue with your wishful thinking.\" Lin Li waved his hand, \"Right now is—fantasy time.\"\n\"Ah, right, I didn’t come to you just to share this. Lin Li, recommend me some novels, those with deadly group character portrayals, please no more death-filled ones.\nI’m tired of those macho novels where the guy just kills and takes the girl. Do you have any about girls killing and taking guys in some lucky gay protagonist way? I’d love to read some of those.\"\nWang Ze temporarily stows away his drool-inducing fantasies, wondering what to do during tonight’s self-study session, so he inquires about serious matters.\n\"A gay protagonist novel, huh? Want to read something like that, Wang Ze, are you still human?\" Bai Bufan wasn’t able to hold it in upon hearing this.\n\"Bufan, I think your hostility towards gays is a bit too much. We shouldn’t hate gays; we should even thank them. They haven’t only left us with a lot of women but also took away a group of men.\nWhat we should resist is the lesbians, Bufan! They are the ones who are truly evil!\" Wang Ze said with a heartfelt tone.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Seems like... there’s a bit of logic there, so... thank the gays?\" Bai Bufan found the advice worth considering.\n\"Great, I’ve been hoping you’d realize this. Well then, Bufan, would you be willing to use your ass to thank me?\" Wang Ze, who had just been sitting on Bai Bufan’s lap, started to touch the thigh beneath him, his voice turning seductive.\n\"The Yan Kingdom’s map is that short? Get off me, damn it—\" Bai Bufan chuckled and shoved Wang Ze away.\n\"Is there anything or not? Lin Li, I’m counting on the novel to get me through the evening study.\" Wang Ze got up with a laugh and looked at Lin Li.\n\"Water Margin,\" Lin Li pointed him in a clear direction.\n[Imagined dialogue: \"Brother, will Madam mind if I join you in the mountains? I’d like to follow your lead.\"]\nYet again perfectly satisfying Wang Ze.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\n\"Makes sense, I’ll go with that for tonight.\" Wang Ze accepted and went back.\nWang Ze hadn’t been gone long when Bai Bufan, looking at his phone, tapped Lin Li.\n\"What’s up?\"\n\"The class monitor is really popular, Lin Li, there’s a super crisis heading your way.\"\n\"What is it?\" Upon hearing this, Lin Li looked towards Bai Bufan and directly took his phone.\nBai Bufan was still looking at a post on Nansang Middle School’s confession wall, and the phone interface remained there.\nAnd this post he was looking at contained seven pictures, three of which were of Chen Yu Ying from different angles, whether sitting in the audience or standing on the playground. The other four pictures were chat records, generally with commenters wanting to ’fish around’.\nNot only were there boys confessing, but also girls, though it could be seen it wasn’t admiration, just pure appreciation and a desire to make acquaintances through comments.\n—at least, on the surface.\nApparently, this post was made because the confession wall noticed several people simultaneously confessing to a single target, and they made a compilation instead of cramming them into a nine-grid post.\n\"It’s not just this one; a couple of posts earlier also have one photo, likely it’s the class monitor as well. Today the confession wall has posted nearly a few dozen posts, and I haven’t gone through them much yet. There could be others to find.\"\nBai Bufan stretched and said:\n\"She surely has wild fans, not Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu doing it.\"\nLin Li raised an eyebrow upon hearing that.\nThese people’s photography skills are really lacking, not knowing what they’re doing with each shot.\n’Suddenly’ being popular is normal; after all, Chen Yu Ying previously didn’t have the chance to ’appear openly’, and people didn’t have phones to post even if they wanted, but now they do, so in some respect she has ’stepped onto the stage’, plus everyone has mobile phones now.\nHowever, he didn’t feel much about it.\nScrolling with his finger, Lin Li moved to the comment section.\n「Old Lady on the Street: Love confession for P3! Looks nice! +1!」\n「Zou Weilun: That’s our class monitor in Class 1 of Grade 4, Chen Yu Ying.」\nYou’re really getting involved in everything.\nZou Weilun was also from Class 4, in the same dormitory as Wang Yuezhi, but Lin Li wasn’t familiar with him.\n「Ding Sihan: No need to fish or add, it won’t be approved.」\nXiaodingding, I’ve always thought you were impressive since I was young, Lin Li mused.\nThinking for a moment, Lin Li returned the phone to Bai Bufan and took out his own phone to leave a comment.\n「Old Horse in the Stable: Indeed, no need to fish or add, I heard she already likes someone, seems to be named ’Old Horse in the Stable’.」",

      "content": "Chapter 371: Chapter 260: Judging a person is nothing more than similar principles\nAlthough QQ friends’ likes don’t have a red dot notification like WeChat, comments from friends do provide alerts.\n\"Who is ’Old Horse at the Stable’? What kind of over-the-top middle-aged ID is that, is it the class president’s dad’s nickname?\"\nThis was how Bai Bufan became the first to notice Lin Li’s comment. After reading it, he turned his head in surprise to ask.\nComments from friends display the remark first, so Bai Bufan saw something different from what Lin Li himself saw.\n\"Son: ... Seems to be called ’Old Horse at the Stable’.\"\n\"It’s ’Old Horse at the Stable’, don’t mess it up, it’s a totally different meaning, have some respect,\" Lin Li frowned upon hearing this.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nHe closed his eyes hard, then opened them to look again after refreshing them a bit, and damn, it really was ’Old Welfare Chick’.\nDamn.\nWell, now it truly changed from a middle-aged to a young person’s ID.\n\"So it was your extraordinary nickname.\" To come up with such a nickname, his family must have hired some master. After Bai Bufan checked Lin Li’s QQ profile and discovered it was him, it instantly made sense.\nLin Li, who was described as extraordinary by Bai Bufan, twitched at the corner of his mouth.\nFeeling a bit unjustly accused, how could Bai Bufan dare to say his nickname was extraordinary?\n—— Bai Bufan’s current QQ nickname is \"Too Much Tax Evasion Needs Serious Investigation\".\n—— His WeChat is relatively normal because he doesn’t have a secondary account, and his contacts include family——\"Village Group All Praise My Strength\".\nCompared to this, doesn’t his seem pretty normal?\nJust when Lin Li was about to scroll through other posts.\n\"Hey, Lin Li, your comment... how should I put this, makes me feel like I need to pee,\" Bai Bufan said to Lin Li.\nLin Li put down his phone upon hearing this, frowning at the slightly amused Bai Bufan, temporarily unable to understand what nonsense this guy was spewing.\n\"Speak human language.\"\n\"Your comment, in my eyes, it’s like wanting to mark class 1-4 as my territory, but there are too many people now, I’m embarrassed to just pull down my pants and pee in the corner, so for the sake of pride, the genius me chooses to pee with my pants on.\"\nBai Bufan maintained a teasing expression, smiling at Lin Li:\n\"Peeing your pants, well, others might see it, but they can only see, only you know that warmth you’re hiding.\nLin Li, you should get what I mean, right?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nWhere did this tapeworm come from?\nLin Li chuckled.\nThen Lin Li laughed out loud, stood up: \"Of course I get what you mean, you’re saying you want to pee in the classroom, no problem, Bufan, I’ll assist you.\"\n\"In an instant, laughing, so classic, really makes one speechless.\" Seeing Lin Li a bit flustered and exasperated, to avoid getting beaten to the point of incontinence, Bai Bufan was already laughing and running away, not forgetting to review the six arts of a gentleman out loud.\n...\nAfter covering Bai Bufan’s \"body\" with endangered plants, Lin Li returned to his spot.\nThere were quite a few messages in the space.\n\"Ding Sihan, Qu Wanqiu, Chen Yu Ying, and others liked your comment.\"\n—— QQ indeed has a liking feature for comments.\n\"Ding Sihan replied to your comment: Where did you hear this rumor?\"\n\"Qu Wanqiu replied to your comment: Where did you get this inside scoop?\"\n\"Chen Yu Ying replied to your comment: 「Fist」「Fist」「Fist」\"\n\"Wang Yuezhi disliked your comment.\"\n\"Wang Yuezhi replied to your comment: According to Article 25 of the Tokyo University Public Security Management Punishment Law, spreading rumors, false reporting of danger or police, or deliberately disturbing public order through other means, is punishable by five to ten days of detention and a fine of up to 500 yuan; if the circumstances are minor, a lesser detention of under five days or a fine of up to 500 yuan can be imposed.\"\nBesides these, there were some replies from unfamiliar IDs.\nThey seemed to think that he was dreaming, so most wanted to \"pee on his head\", the only one being nicer suggested he had diabetes, at least he could sample a bit of sweetness.\nChatting under such public account posts was unnecessary, and there was no need to have a conversation for others to see, so Lin Li didn’t reply to anyone, just posted a meme in \"Three People One Dog\".\nEvening self-study started quickly, but it was basically no different from after class, everyone still did as they pleased, and no one even paid attention to the multimedia music.\nIt was rare freedom in a closed campus.\nXue Jian also came in briefly for a few minutes, but upon seeing everyone playing on their phones, he didn’t give a lecture, only saying to keep the volume down and not to be too noisy.\nSo the boys completely let loose, switching seats and organizing an internal battle.\n\"I can’t play, I’ve already uninstalled Kings of Glory.\" Zhou Baowei sent this message in the gaming chat.\nAfter seeing it, Bai Bufan looked at Zhou Baowei in surprise: \"Bao Wei, what are you doing? Have you also semi-quit gaming like Lin Li?\"\n\"It’s probably to make the phone lighter. After all, he’s already quite heavy himself, if he can’t lose weight, at least the phone can,\" Lin Li said, interjecting upon hearing this.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nCan this also turn into a humiliation session?\n\"In two weeks, I’ve reduced nearly half a month’s worth of time, isn’t that a significant achievement?\" Zhou Baowei emphasized.\nLin Li gave a thumbs up from afar, that’s quite a reduction.\n\"And who told you that deleting apps makes a phone lighter, Lin Li,\" Bai Bufan then turned to laugh and scold Lin Li for his earlier remark.\n\"That’s your own problem, if you don’t know, don’t say nonsense, storing things on a phone can make it heavier. I stored over a hundred gigs of porn and comics on my phone, and after a month, I found the phone getting heavier and I could barely hold it.\"",

I’m too embarrassed to call you out.\n\"Don’t mind this idiot, Baowei, download it quickly. Do you have data? If not, I’ll set up a hotspot for you. I haven’t even used up the rollover data from last month, you can use it to download.\" Bai Bufan urged Zhou Baowei.\n\"It’s my phone running out of space.\" Zhou Baowei revealed the real reason.\n\"Go download it in the hallway; the hallway has more space. If that doesn’t work, roll over to the school gate.\" Bai Bufan pointed outside.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nAre you serious?\n\"Isn’t your phone 256G? Normally it shouldn’t fill up so easily. Do you like taking photos so much? Doesn’t seem like it. What did you download?\" Bai Bufan pulled his hand back, confused.\nZhou Baowei answered in a second: \"It’s the hundred-something gigabytes of lewd pictures and books Lin Li sent me before.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nSo you two have this kind of bond even with me in between you?\n\"I’m sitting right between you two; my life is ruined.\" Bai Bufan stepped forward and snatched Zhou Baowei’s phone, \"Hurry up and delete some! Lust is a blade that scrapes the bone, don’t bring such dangerous stuff into the campus!\"\nUnable to resist Bai Bufan, Zhou Baowei sighed and painfully lightened his phone’s weight: \"I’m sorry, ipx-934.\"\nLin Li heard this and slowly fell into contemplation:\n\"Bufan, you mean... if lust is a bone-scraping knife, then when Hua Tuo was scraping Guan Yu’s bone to heal him, was he constantly playing adult videos for Guan Yu?\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"According to unofficial history, that’s how it was.\"\nBai Bufan is an expert on Three Kingdoms; he had to believe it.\nThe evening study session ended in this light and playful atmosphere.\nBefore biking home, Lin Li first stopped by the usual ramen shop.\n\"What’ll it be, friend?\" At this hour, there weren’t many guests, and the owner, originally sitting on a chair playing on his phone, got up to ask when he saw Lin Li.\n\"Scallion oil noodles with two poached eggs,\" Lin Li ordered first, then made a request, \"Boss, do you have any delivery seals? Can you give me a few?\"\n\"What are you going to do with those?\" The owner seemed a bit puzzled.\n\"My takeout was stolen...\" Lin Li briefly explained the day’s incident, \"...so, in case that thief continues to steal, I’d like to give a little surprise and need some delivery seals for assistance.\"\n\"Thieves are indeed very annoying, they deserve many slaps,\" the owner shared some empathy after hearing this, \"Feel free to take some from the counter.\"\nLin Li was a regular customer, and there was basic trust, plus the seals weren’t contraband, anyone could buy them on the market.\nIf I really did something bad, I wouldn’t involve him as an accomplice anyway.\n\"Thanks, boss.\"\n\"Adasi [bro], I’m behind you, eagle-like in my support, with the power of Deyang motors, and the speed of a reviving number train.\" The boss joyfully patted his chest.\nLin Li took a deep breath, glancing at the halal sign, then repeatedly confirmed his memory, and tentatively asked: \"Boss, you should be Hui, right? Why is there an accent? It wasn’t there before.\"\n\"Been overloading on short videos with snack-slang, it’s a bit overpowering, friend.\" The boss spread his hands, embarrassed.\nLin Li: \"...\"\n\"Boss, how do you speak like this, with such a strong flavor?\" Lin Li asked curiously.\n\"It’s simple,\" the owner replied without any accent this time, \"kid, if Northeastern Chinese places a random word in a random part of the sentence, then the literal translation of this snack-slang, randomly places an analogy in a random part of the sentence.\nFor example, in standard Mandarin: Can you be more generous?\nIn snack-slang, it would be like: Hey friend, dig the meat from the ant’s leg into your stomach every day?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nYou don’t say, you really don’t say.\n...\nThe next day, Thursday.\nLin Li packed two fully charged sports cameras and portable Wi-Fi into his backpack, changed into a short-sleeve and shorts, and casually threw on a jacket before biking to school.\nThere was a 3000 meter prelim in the morning and a 1500 meter in the afternoon.\nEven though for Lin Li, he was confident he could easily take first place wearing loafers and tight pants.\nBut he still wanted to give the basic laws of this world some face, pretending to take it seriously.\nToday there was no opening ceremony, so upon reaching school, Lin Li headed straight to the track.\nFrom a distance, he saw Wang Yuezhi doing warm-up exercises on the stands, his expression slightly stiff, looking very nervous.\nThere was still more than an hour until the competition started, but being an impromptu recruit, it’s understandable.\n\"It’s over, Lin Li, it’s over, over!\" Just upon approaching the class spot, before he had the chance to greet Chen Yu Ying, Lin Li heard Bai Bufan’s dog-like howls.\n\"What happened?\" Lin Li turned to look at Bai Bufan, who was running towards him, asking in confusion.\nI swear, that window lady, at the start of the term, she used to call me handsome little guy, but this morning she just called me little dude, Lin Li, don’t you know what this implies?\"\nBai Bufan wailed in pain and despair.\nLin Li felt a bit relieved: \"It implies she’s finally stopped lying.\"\n\"Yeah, I swear, she stopped—\" Bai Bufan originally wanted to empathize, then froze.\n(;☉_☉)?\nWas it really that she stopped lying?",

I’ll kill you!\" Ding Sihan’s face turned red, and with a battle cry, she rushed forward to hit Lin Li.\nThe nickname was bearable, but the signature really made her shame go crazy.\nPeople are always like this, fearing being called by their real name online and their username in reality.\nWhile dodging, Lin Li looked at Qu Wanqiu: \"Charming stepmother, I’m actually super co—\"\nQu Wanqiu: \"?\"\n\"Shut up!\"\nBefore the events even began today, Lin Li had already died once, finally reaching the base.\nWang Ze sat on a chair, looking slightly melancholic.\nBai Bufan next to him was also melancholic on the surface but actually holding back laughter.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Lin Li approached and put an arm around Wang Ze’s shoulder, asking knowingly.\n\"Those two girls are too shy, which makes me happy but also troubled. They were still shy even after a night,\" Wang Ze sighed. \"I prepared so much last night, but now I have no chance to use it. I’m anxious.\"\n\"What preparations did you make?\" Lin Li asked with some amusement.\n\"Wang Ze had us set up lighting for him last night, and after hundreds of wasted shots, he finally took a perfect picture of his abs and immediately posted it on his social media,\" Zhang Haoyang adjusted his glasses and added.\n\"It’s that gross?\" Lin Li laughed, quickly taking out his phone to check it out.\n\"Don’t bother looking, you won’t see it,\" Zhang Haoyang laughed. \"Those posts are hidden from all his friends.\"\n\"Then why post it on the market?\"\n\"Because by hiding it from us, his current friends, only the newly added ones can see it.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nCan you even do that?\n\"There’s no need to say it so loudly,\" Wang Ze got up and covered his son’s mouth, then looked at Lin Li, laughing, \"To show off my charm, I even learned some magic from Wang Yuezhi.\"\nUnfortunately, there’s no performance at the closing ceremony, or else our class might have three clowns.\nSeeing Wang Ze take things so seriously, Lin Li almost wanted to tell him the truth.\nBut Bai Bufan beside him seemed to sense Lin Li’s intention and shook his head vigorously behind him.\nLin Li smiled, shrugged it off, and changed the topic, \"Wang Ze, magic is too ordinary, do you want to learn magic?\"\n\"Magic? Do I have to turn into a girl for that?\" Wang Ze raised an eyebrow.\n\"Don’t worry, you don’t have to.\"\n\"Then I’m not interested.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"But it’s hypnotic.\"\n\"Coach, that’s exactly what I want to learn.\"\n\"Let me give you a demonstration,\" Lin Li chuckled, then walked toward Bai Bufan, snapped his fingers loudly, and chanted, \"Bufan, starting now, you will forget you are gay.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"I was never gay in the first place?\" Bai Bufan was baffled.\nLin Li said nothing, looked at Wang Ze, and pointed at Bai Bufan, looking smug, \"That’s the power of magic!\"\n\"No, you bastard! I was never gay in the first place! What kind of bullshit magic is that?\" Bai Bufan was getting anxious.\n\"See, amazing, isn’t it? Completely forgotten!\" Lin Li still responded smugly.\n\"No? Wait, damn!\" Bai Bufan’s eyes widened.\nFor a moment, he was at a loss on how to break the situation.\n\"Impossible?!\n\"No, this magic has too many flaws.\" Wang Ze looked contemptuously as if seeing a cheap trick, and walked between the two, as a master of gay jokes.\n\"Determining a man’s sexual orientation is simple, just look at his demeanor, and the criteria for judgment is pretty much the same.\"\nLin Li, Bai Bufan: \"O.o?\"\nNo.\nWait a second.\nDamn, pretty much the same?\nBut it kind of makes sense.\n\"So, this magic, while seemingly unsolvable, can easily be broken if Bufan takes off his pants. Because if he’s never been gay, then he’s straight,\" Wang Ze said casually, then looked at Bai Bufan, \"Bufan, go ahead, prove it.\"\n\"Your intentions seem off, don’t they?\"\nBai Bufan smiled, flipped a middle finger, and couldn’t help but remark,\n\"Having known Wang Ze for so long, I suddenly understand Zhao Lei’s lyrics in ’Chengdu’.\n\"It’s not just last night’s alcohol~~ that brings tears to my eyes~~\"\nBai Bufan’s singing of that lyric made Lin Li never able to look directly at the song again.\nPoor Zhao Lei.\nBai Bufan went off with Wang Ze to drink last night’s liquor, not forgetting to give Lin Li a look that seemed to suggest he was about to do something.\nLin Li stood under the shade of an umbrella, looking at the sky, waiting for time to pass, occasionally chatting with the \"three people\" beside him.\n\"Participants in the men’s three thousand meters are requested to proceed to the check-in area...\"\nChen Yu Ying had been looking sideways at the track, but at the sound of the announcement, she turned her head abruptly, her ponytail cutting a glossy arc in the sunlight. Her reaction seemed even bigger than Lin Li’s, and light fragments shimmered in her eyes like she had taken in the entire clear autumn sky.\n\"Lin Li, good luck, you’ll do great,\" Chen Yu Ying smiled as she wished him well.\n\"A bit worried and nervous,\" Lin Li sighed.\n\"No need to worry, no matter what your results are—\" she took a half step forward, tilting her head, her hands crossed behind her back, \"you’re amazing.\"\n\"Oh, class monitor, I’m not worried about that,\" Lin Li suddenly whined as he sighed again, \"I’m worried about what pose to strike on the podium since I have no experience.\"\nChen Yu Ying was startled, then burst into laughter.\nShe turned her head slightly, her eyes twinkling with laughter as it flowed with her deep gaze, \"No need to worry about that either,\"\nShe stepped back, raised her hand into a mock photo frame, capturing Lin Li within and the sun framed by her fingers, closed one eye, beaming, \"Lin Li, no matter how you pose, you look great.\"\nHer words drifted away on the wind, and suddenly Lin Li forgot to breathe.\nXiaojing, Xiaojing, I’m sorry.",

I’m afraid the class monitor might misunderstand.\nLin Li suddenly clutched his chest and half-knelt on the ground.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Chen Yu Ying, who initially had a smile on her face, immediately stepped forward with concern and asked.\n\"Sorry, I just forgot to breathe.\" Lin Li tilted his face up, his Adam’s apple bobbing in the sunlight, and said with a smile.\nChen Yu Ying: \"...\"\n\"Idiot.\" Chen Yu Ying, helpless and amused, curled her fingers from above and finally gave a light tap on Lin Li’s head.\n\"Just one tap?\" After waiting for a while without anything else happening, Lin Li looked up confused, \"Monitor, I think announcing it at midnight is too early, right? Ding Sihan and the others might not be asleep yet. How about tapping twice more, and I’ll sneak to your dormitory at three in the morning to study with you.\"\n\"That’s not the implication at all!\" Chen Yu Ying was momentarily stunned and then tapped her own forehead twice with the back of her hand, saying with a headache.\nGot it.\nThe monitor will actively come to find me at two in the morning to study, no need for me to find her.\nLooking forward to it.\nBy the way, isn’t this upwards view considered a death angle? But it still looks so good.\nDo these legs actually look longer than mine because of the proportion?\nCan play around for years.\n\"Lin Li, you’re not Sun Wukong. How could the Great Saint be as lecherous as you? You can only be Pigsy.\" She laughed and took two steps back when noticing his gaze blatantly following the line of her legs, making a crisp sound as her heel struck the ground, \"Alright, Lin Li, you better hurry up and get registered.\"\nLin Li stood up, stretched lazily, and before leaving the class stronghold, said to Chen Yu Ying:\n\"Monitor, do you really think that Brother Monkey, after subduing the Seven Fairy Maidens, did nothing?\"\n\"Friendly reminder, Brother Monkey jumped out from a stone, there are seven Seven Fairy Maidens, and also seven Calabash Brothers, Calabash Brothers can turn into a stone mountain.\"\n\"I won’t say more, those who understand will understand, those who don’t will not get it even if I explain. Monitor, don’t ask either, the stakes are too high, saying it won’t benefit you, I can only say it’s deep water, the information online has been deleted, so I can only say those who understand will understand, those who don’t, well, there’s nothing to be done.\"\nAfter saying this, Lin Li, the Zhihu expert and industry insider, left dashingly.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nThen Chen Yu Ying couldn’t help but worry a little, with such wild rumors, can Lin Li’s head withstand the blow of a thirteen thousand five hundred kilograms heavy stick?\nBut now there’s a problem that might need resolving, Chen Yu Ying said with a smile:\n\"Lin Li, where are you walking to? The registration is not that way! You’re going the wrong way! Didn’t you look at the location map?\"\nLin Li, of course, wouldn’t admit it: \"The Earth is round, this is a real-world validation of the Earth’s curvature.\"\n\"Tsk—\"\n\"Really leaving, make sure to cheer me on later, by the way, by the way, Monitor, it’s cheering with a wavy line, cheer me on~, you know what I mean?\" Lin Li checked his phone to confirm the location while winking at Chen Yu Ying.\n\"I won’t~\"\n...\nBy the time Lin Li reached the registration area, Wang Yuezhi was already there.\nThe registration area was mostly staffed by the student union and volunteer students, with only one teacher on site to handle problems students couldn’t solve.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, what should I do now?\" Lin Li walked over and patted Wang Yuezhi on the shoulder, asking.\nWang Yuezhi, extremely nervous and not noticing Lin Li’s approach, jumped a bit after being patted, and said slightly annoyed:\n\"Go over and show your student ID and number sheet to the staff, then draw your position.\"\nLin Li found a table with the first-year group’s sign hanging above it.\n\"Hello student, please show your student ID.\" The registrar politely said upon seeing Lin Li.\n\"Here it is.\"\n\"Lin Li from first-year class four... found it, the registered number is 1009, do you have your number card? Did you bring it?\" the registrar checked the name list in front and asked.\n\"I have it.\" Lin Li took off his jacket to show.\n\"Nice physique.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nAfter confirming there was no illicit equipment on both Lin Li and his number sheet, the registrar recorded in the name list, then handed over a phone: \"Press it.\"\nIt was a number generator.\n17.\n\"17, which means when I lead you all to the track, you’ll be in the seventeenth position.\" The registrar explained the significance of the number.\nFor other events, they draw lots for lanes, but for the 3000 meters, it doesn’t apply. It’s impossible to run with just eight people at a time, instead, everyone runs at once, and pre-arranging order at the starting line can prevent potential issues, such as everyone squeezing into the inner lane.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, what’s your number?\" After finishing registration, one has to wait until near the competition when the registrar leads everyone to the starting line and cannot leave arbitrarily, so Lin Li walked over to Wang Yuezhi and asked.\n\"8.\" Wang Yuezhi’s eyes were unfocused.\n\"Don’t be so nervous.\" Lin Li comforted.\n\"That’s easy for you to say.\" Wang Yuezhi glanced at Lin Li begrudgingly and said resentfully.\nAfter all, it’s not Lin Li, he doesn’t have to endure this torment.\n\"I have a way to relieve anxiety, want to hear it?\" Lin Li smiled and said.\n\"Say it.\"\n\"If you know how to smoke, have a cigarette now to calm down. If you don’t know how, learn it first, then have a cigarette to calm down.\" Lin Li gave his little life tip.\nWang Yuezhi: \"...\"\nSeriously.\nIs smoking really necessary?\n\"With free time to joke around, you’d be better off thinking about how to get a good score later. I’m just here to make up the numbers, but you’re not, don’t disappoint by getting the same score as me!\" Wang Yuezhi complained.\n\"Don’t worry, I won’t mess it up. Oh, right, Wang Yuezhi, I’m planning to use the rabbit strategy later, don’t get dragged down by me.\" Lin Li replied confidently.",

      "content": "Chapter 375: Chapter 261: Did I Make a Mistake Transmigrating as an Umbrella (Beginning of the Month, Asking for Monthly Votes)_2\nThe rabbit tactic refers to the strategy in long-distance races where one quickly takes the lead at the beginning to disrupt the rhythm of other competitors, exhausting them, thus creating an advantage for themselves or teammates.\nThe rabbit tactic places higher demands on the user, while in reality, the turtle tactic is more commonly used.\n—That is, deliberately running slowly during the race until you fall a whole lap behind and then blending in, pretending you haven’t lost that lap.\nBefore Lin Li got the system, he and Bai Bufan often used this trick.\n\"Got it,\" Wang Yuezhi nodded.\nSeeing that Wang Yuezhi wasn’t in the mood for chatting, Lin Li just sat on the ground playing with his phone, waiting for time to pass.\nUntil a voice sounded in front of him, \"Are you Lin Li?\"\nLin Li looked up to see a male student, quite tall, but unfamiliar.\nSince it wasn’t Chen Yu Ying in front of him, Lin Li wasn’t willing to talk to others from a seated position, so he stood up and patted his butt. The other person was still a little shorter than him.\nThen he spoke, \"Yes, it’s me, Lin Li. What’s up?\"\n\"Heh, when you run the 3000 meters later, just stay behind me and eat my dust.\" The other person sneered and gave a thumbs down to Lin Li.\nLin Li: \"?\"\n\"Not bros? Do we know each other?\" Lin Li stared at the other’s face with bewilderment, pondering for a while before confirming he truly didn’t know this person.\nIf he didn’t know him, what was the deal with this inexplicable hostility?\n\"The strong should mercilessly humiliate the weak. In sports competition, being weak is the original sin. Beyond that, I don’t want to say much to the future loser.\"\nThe other person just left that sentence, tilted his thumb downwards a bit more, and went to sit down nearby, playing on his phone.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nThis person is just like the young Kuang Heng, a total nutcase!\nIs he a poser? Otherwise, why does he love pretending to be cool so much, especially when he’s not?\nThough it was puzzling, Lin Li didn’t bother to go forward to confront him.\nHowever, the other person successfully caught Lin Li’s attention.\nChecking in at the registration area, this guy was named Du Hansi, from Class 14 of Grade 1.\nClass 14, Lin Li began to ponder if he had ever offended someone from Class 14?\nStill at a loss, he didn’t have any recollection of ever having conflicts with this person or the class.\nIs it an unresolved issue from the last monthly test—like Feng Kai or a friend of the guy he reported? Maybe he’s now standing up for his friend?\nOr could it be because of a previous tug-of-war game they lost, and now they’re upset?\nThere’s no way to guess without asking the person directly, but never mind.\nAt seventeen, one cannot tolerate even a bit of grievance.\nLin Li had plenty of ways to deal with this guy.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, I won’t use the rabbit tactic later. I’ve decided to switch to the poop tactic. You just follow the main group as usual,\" Lin Li reminded Wang Yuezhi.\nWang Yuezhi: \"?\"\nWhat did you just say, what b-tactic?\n...\nThe referee shouted a moment before the competition started, \"All Grade 1 boys’ 3000-meter runners, line up and follow me!\"\nNot all forty spots from the twenty classes were filled, as not many were eager to participate in such events. For example, not many classes like Class 4 filled all their slots, with only 28 participants in total.\nThe group followed to the playground.\nChen Yu Ying and Bai Bufan were already waiting at the starting line, waiting for Lin Li to approach and say, \"Lin Li, good luck~\"\nIt was a well-wishing with a wave line that pleased Lin Li.\nHe pressed his index and middle fingers together in a salute at his temple, smiling and nodding, \"Got it.\"\nThen he took off his jacket and handed it to Chen Yu Ying.\n\"If you need water in the middle of the run, just let me know when you pass by,\" Chen Yu Ying said while hanging Lin Li’s jacket on her arm and shaking the two bottles of water in her hand.\n\"Okay,\" Lin Li responded, smiling and nodding, \"but what’s more important than water is to keep cheering me on.\"\n\"Of course.\" Chen Yu Ying clinked the two bottles of mineral water together like cheerleading batons, a smile curling her lips.\n\"The gas price has risen today, Lin Li,\" Bai Bufan said as Lin Li undressed, his hand resting behind his back.\n\"Then give me yesterday’s rate.\"\n\"Please, Grade 1 boys’ 3000-meter runners, enter the track. The competition is about to begin.\"\n\"The autumn wind cheers for you, the sunlight applauds you! The 3000-meter track is your stage for sweat; the 3000-meter journey is your challenge to surpass yourself! No matter the result, each step you take is our pride! Lin Li, Wang Yuezhi, do your best! —From all your classmates in Class 4, Grade 1.\"\nThe broadcast aired the encouragement letter from the class for the two.\n\"You too, do your best.\" At the last moment, Lin Li patted Wang Yuezhi on the shoulder, walked onto the track, standing at the back with a relaxed look.\n\"On your marks—get set—bang!\"\nThe starter pistol fired.\nLin Li pressed his watch’s timer, aiming to control the pace precisely, intending to run according to the time allocation he planned before.\nLin Li started slow, even among the slowest batch.\nInitially planning to take off quickly but changing tactics, he held back for now.\nIn the crowd ahead, spotting Du Hansi, Lin Li accelerated to catch up, showing a sinister smile.\nThe other, who dared speak harshly toward him, indeed had some ability as he quickly advanced to first place.\nFollowing him, Lin Li became second.\nDu Hansi adjusted his breathing, taking large strides.\n\"...Du... Han... Si... Du... Han... Si...\" A voice came from behind.",

Han... Si...\"\nDu Hansi: \"?\"\nAs that voice persistently reappeared, Du Hansi swallowed the saliva already tasting of rust and turned around.\nIt was Mona Lisa’s smile.\n\"Hansi, will you be nice to me?\" Lin Li shyly inquired, sorrowfully recounting his past:\n\"I didn’t see my ex-boyfriend for over a month; he said he missed me terribly, so I paid my own way to find him. I even booked a hotel and a table, but he couldn’t even buy a bottle of lubricant. He just sneezed and wiped it on my back. I wanted to scold him, but considering it’s hard to meet, I held back. Later, seeing others sneeze always reminded me of the scene, so he became my ex-boyfriend.\nHansi, will you be nice to me?\" Lin Li asked again, this time with a hopeful longing for a happy life with Du Hansi.\nDu Hansi: \"???\"\nIn a daze, Du Hansi felt like something was amplifying his ears.\nLin Li should pay him for listening to this—was this even Chinese?\nNo time for confusion, because Du Hansi noticed that hand was again amplifying his butt.\nRun!\n\"Hansi~~ I have a scar on my inner thigh, do you want to see it? It’s unrelated to my obscure past, nor a memory of bullying; it’s merely a mark of time, changing with the seasons. So, I call it a seasonal scar.\"\nYet the voice refused to disappear.\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!\" Du Hansi pushed forward with all his strength, running faster than ever for a man.\nWho would’ve thought running a school event would lead to harassment!\nLin Li’s voice seemed to vanish.\nBut Du Hansi dared not look back, nor relax.\nHe ran ahead with determination, afraid that slowing down would let Lin Li catch up.\nOut of the corner of his eye, he noticed several girls watching him with anticipation on the track’s inner side, including one particularly pretty girl with a high ponytail.\nHer porcelain white wrist flickered into a shadow in the sunlight, and the folds of her shorts revealed the unique curve of youth.\nJust a few glances made Du Hansi feel like his soul was cleansed again after being tainted by Lin Li’s disgust.\nDu Hansi quickly closed his mouth, breathing heavily from the sudden acceleration, adjusting his image.\nIs now the time for fantasies, do I have a little admirer too...\n\"Go for it! Go for it—\" Seeing him approach, the girl smiled happily, waving her porcelain white arms at Du Hansi, making it hard to look away.\nDu Hansi almost fell into Love River, if only she hadn’t gotten his name wrong.\n\"—Lin Li! Keep going! Lin Li! Go~~\"\nNot only did he not fall into Love River, Du Hansi’s expression turned a bit sour.\nBecause she was cheering for Lin Li while looking at him—what did that mean?\nFeeling like he was playing a horror game, Du Hansi slowly turned around.\nIt was Mona Lisa’s bright laughter.\nWhat? Why didn’t this person make any footsteps?\nWhen Du Hansi looked down, he found that Lin Li’s running frequency was remarkably synced with his own, so he hadn’t realized someone was closely behind him!\nJust trailing him, Lin Li finally appeared human, no longer touching his butt but waving to the girl instead.\nNoticing Du Hansi’s gaze, Lin Li turned to him: \"What’s up, Hansi?\"\nHansi remained silent, simply turning back to keep up his speed.\n\"Hansi, I really want to reincarnate as an umbrella, so you can openly hold my handle,\nor reincarnate as a playground, so I can be set in your primary school, Hansi~ oh~ Hansi~ my Hansi.\"\nHowever, some things can’t be discarded, as Lin Li’s enchanting voice kept calling out his beloved’s name, almost making him unable to hold on.\nThis was Lin Li’s battle strategy—making the first-place runner sick, so the second-place runner becomes first.\nDu Hansi finally understood, Lin Li’s recent restraint wasn’t because he wanted to change his behavior, but because he was about to encounter acquaintances and needed to maintain his image.\nDu Hansi was in despair, unable to endure further torment, he confessed the truth:\n\"Lin Li, buddy, stop torturing me; those bold words—Wang Ze told me to say them. He wanted me to provoke you a bit, see if it would make you run faster.\nBuddy, forgive me, if you keep this up, I’ll have to quit the race. I just came to the school sports event for fun, not to develop psychological issues!!\"\nDue to running and exhaustion, Du Hansi’s voice seemed fragmented.",

It’s normal for Wang Ze to know him but not me.\nAnd this is totally something Wang Ze would do.\nSo it was all a misunderstanding.\n\"Sorry, sorry, it’s like the river flooded the Dragon King’s temple.\" Lin Li laughed.\nIt was certainly well-meaning on Wang Ze’s part.\n\"No worries, as long as you don’t disgust me, bro. I’m really sorry, truly sorry.\" Right now, the person Du Hansi hated the most wasn’t Lin Li, but Wang Ze.\nYour classmate’s physical fitness is insane, and you want me to provoke him?\nHe’s been keeping pace with me, running without slowing down, and can still talk smoothly without showing any signs of fatigue!\nThis kind of person could just as easily provoke me, right?\nWang Ze, I’m totally Tian Wenjing for you!\n\"I apologize to you as well.\" Lin Li glanced at the timer on his watch and casually apologized.\n\"No, no, it’s me who should apologize. I shouldn’t have challenged you.\"\n\"No, no, no, I apologize to you... Bro, if I keep talking, I’m going to run out of breath, let’s stop, stop this.\" Du Hansi pleaded.\n\"Alright, then keep it up. I won’t stay behind you, I’m going to speed up.\" Lin Li nodded.\nDu Hansi was so moved that he was about to cry.\nHe never wanted Lin Li to be behind him again in his life.\nThe place on his butt where Lin Li’s big hand touched felt numb like it was electrified. If it happened again, Du Hansi feared his Dao heart wouldn’t hold steady.\nCould it be...?\n\"You keep it up too!\" Du Hansi’s stamina distribution was completely thrown off, following him any longer would make breaking the record impossible. Since the pace was now slower than expected, Lin Li began to speed up based on the time on his watch.\nHe didn’t forget to give encouragement as he passed.\n\"Wow, amazing, Lin Li is in first place! He overtook my buddy? Could he really take first place? Unbelievable... How did he do it?\"\nAt that moment, Wang Ze, waiting in the field to cheer for Lin Li as he approached, noticed this and tapped Bai Bufan on the shoulder in shock.\nCoach, maybe I really should focus on academics.\n\"If you ask him, he’d only tell you he did it by abstaining,\" Bai Bufan, well aware of Lin Li’s habits, replied.\n\"Lin Li! Go for it! Keep it up! Take first place! Stay steady!\" As Lin Li ran closer, Wang Ze and others, including Bai Bufan, shouted their support loudly.\nLin Li nodded towards them.\n\"He waves to the girls and only nods to us, what’s up with that? I won’t say more,\" Wang Ze remarked, feeling a sense of being treated differently, and sighed.\n\"It’s probably just because he’s out of breath. Lin Li couldn’t possibly be so shallow. Even if he were, if it meant I’d drive luxury cars and live in mansions in my next life, I’d be willing,\" Bai Bufan said with a smile and a shrug.\nBai Bufan turned his gaze back to following Lin Li’s silhouette, while Wang Ze waited for the second-place runner to arrive.\nNearly half a minute later, Du Hansi finally arrived at his position.\n\"Hansi, keep it up! You ran really fast in the first lap; I thought you were going to unleash your potential. What happened? Did you slow down already? Don’t tell me you’re done?\"\nSeeing Du Hansi looking exhausted, his breathing almost out of control, Wang Ze mocked.\nHearing this, Du Hansi faced even colder than Lin Li, maintaining an eerie calm, not even nodding, but kept staring at Wang Ze until he had reached the furthest point of turning his head while running.\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nWang Ze swallowed nervously. Was... was it just his imagination?\nWhy did he sense a murderous intent in Du Hansi’s eyes?\n--\nIt’s the beginning of the month, a chance for a monthly ticket lottery, please give me your March ticket~",

To him, running used to be a torture, but now it’s become a mundane activity.\nYet, mundanity can transform into anticipation.\nWhenever he finishes the bend and starts running on the straight, Chen Yu Ying always appears in his field of vision, becoming the focus, and waving the bottle of mineral water in her hand at him.\nBoth sides of the track are like this.\nThey certainly don’t teleport. Lin Li can catch, in the corner of his eye, Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan, each time he runs past them without hearing their cheers, they immediately rush to the other side of the track, reaching there first to cheer for him again.\nCheering goes like this, the project participants only need to invest wholeheartedly in the competition, running vigorously, but the cheering personnel have many things to consider.\nThus, the mundane running now has something to look forward to, twice per lap.\nOh right, worth mentioning, during the bends, there’s Wang Ze, Bai Bufan, Zhou Baowei, the boys, all cheering collectively for him.\nOriginally, there were only two things to look forward to per lap, but with their presence, it became twice per lap.\nThey’re so noisy, these dumbasses.\n700, 800, 1200.\nThe previously empty track ahead gradually revealed figures of other runners.\nJust halfway through the course, Lin Li realized he was already in the overlapping lap section.\nOnce upon a time, he used to be the one overlapped.\nIt’s quite normal, after all among the competitors, several are just ordinary students purely here to make up the numbers, completing the run is considered a victory, the pace of the last few even appears as if they can only walk now, while Lin Li’s goal is to run at exorbitant speeds.\nThen, it’s time to overtake, Happy Lin Li.\nAfter overtaking nearly ten people, Lin Li saw the back of Wang Yuezhi.\nDespite his efforts, he could only see Yuezhi’s back. Perhaps this is the difference.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, good job.\" Lin Li leaned towards the outer lane, praised Yuezhi as he caught up.\nBeing in this ranking truly counts as impressive, Lin Li initially thought Yuezhi was among the last few, evidently, Yuezhi has also been earnestly training for long-distance running these past two weeks.\nUpon hearing this sudden voice following the footsteps behind him, Yuezhi’s pupils slowly moved right to glance at Lin Li, then returned to look ahead, mechanically continuing to move his already tired legs.\nIt’s not out of dislike but in this state, Yuezhi really couldn’t afford to do anything extra.\nBesides, he felt Lin Li was just mocking him.\nThen, a gust of wind came from behind, slightly scattering Yuezhi’s fatigue, his body felt a bit lighter.\n\"Go for it!\" Lin Li tapped Yuezhi’s shoulder and overtook him.\nIn the ear was heavy breathing and the whistling wind, the plastic particles shrieked subtly beneath his shoes, and Yuezhi’s vision watched Lin Li drift further away, intersecting with Chen Yu Ying and the others waiting for him.\nLin Li’s movements are so light, some people are born as Kua Fu, but some are born as the sun.\nAlthough annoyed, Yuezhi had to admit this fact.\nLin Li ran past where Yu Ying and the others stood, while Yuezhi watched them prepare to reach the other side of the track to cheer for Lin Li.\nJust like the previous two laps.\nBut this time it was different.\nAfter watching Lin Li leave, Chen Yu Ying didn’t leave but turned to look at Yuezhi.\nYuezhi instinctively clenched his lips, touched the upper palate with the tip of his tongue.\nAs he approached, the two bottles of mineral water clashed in front of Yu Ying, sunlight piercing through them casting a shimmering patch on her body: \"Wang Yuezhi, keep going! You can do it!\"\nAutumn goes, winter comes, spring is arriving!\nUnlike before when he could only hear cheers as he passed by coincidentally, this time, it was a special wait just for him!\nShe truly, truly has me in her heart.\nYuezhi’s eyes brightened, but speaking was too difficult, so he nodded vigorously, took a deep breath, and his eyes filled with a steadfast determination.\nHeath Ledger, Cameron Monaghan, Chen Tianming, Joaquin Phoenix... several predecessors, please give me strength! I beg of you! I’ll do anything!\nBatman, just don’t hit me this time, I’ll definitely do well!\nClenching tightly, Yuezhi ignited his little universe, starting to accelerate.\nWatching Yuezhi leave, Yu Ying turned around, Lin Li had already run to the opposite side, going there was pointless now.\nShe sipped some water to soothe her throat, hoarse from the recent back-and-forth running and yelling, and carelessly wiped the water stains off her lips.\nLin Li had just said don’t run back and forth, just wait here for him.\nHe also said to cheer for Yuezhi, he’s not having it easy either.\nWell then, I’ll follow his advice.\n...\n2200, 2600, 2800.\nThe course reached its end.\nThe slowest student has already been overlapped by Lin Li three times, but now, ahead of Lin Li is Du Hansi.\nSeems like I’m about to overlap the second place by a lap.\nFirst place is already indisputable.\nLin Li suddenly felt like laughing, Hansi’s steps are now erratic and breathing is rapid, typically though he is also nearing the finish, as a systemically trained sports student, even at this point shouldn’t be so wretched.",

If so, have you ever considered doing it without having kids?\" Lin Li said gently.\nDu Hansi: \"TAT\"\nHere it comes again.\n\"Broha—ha—no—\" Du Hansi wanted to say a complete sentence, but even two words took all his effort.\n\"Just kidding, it’s the last lap, keep it up.\" Lin Li glanced at his watch and smiled as he started the final sprint.\nThe referee, who had been watching Lin Li, the lap king, closely at the finish line, now lifted the ribbon after other runners passed.\nPeople cheering for their class had gathered at the finish line waiting for him.\n\"Lin Li, go! You’re about to break the record, damn it!\" Wang Ze roared, more excited than Lin Li.\n\"Zuo zuo zuo.\" Bai Bufan attempted to motivate Lin Li with this sound.\n\"Lin Li! Keep it up!\" Chen Tianming and Zhou Baowei shouted support at the finish line.\nLin Li raised his arms high to both sides, forming a victory pose.\nThree steps to the finish! Two steps! One step! Charge—\nLin Li stood at the finish line.\n\"Referee, what’s the time on your stopwatch now?\" Lin Li asked the referee.\nThe referee, although unfamiliar with this situation, glanced at the stopwatch and said, \"10.25.\"\n\"What are you doing? Just sprint already, Lin Li!\" Wang Ze was more anxious than Lin Li, ready to celebrate.\n\"I don’t want future freshmen at Nansang Middle School aspiring to break the record to feel too hopeless; a mountain too high will only make them lose drive. Wang Ze, you only see yourself, while I see the whole world; that’s the difference.\" Lin Li looked calmly at Wang Ze.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\n\"You’re such a show-off.\" Wang Ze laughed and cursed.\nTime was just about right after that, Lin Li stepped forward, the referee and his watch both reading ten minutes and thirty seconds, breaking the record by just over a second.\n[Do your best to participate in sect competitions, achieving first place for yourself or your sect in at least three events, with at least two being official matches (3/1; 1/2)]\nThe task progress was easily increased by one; getting another first place in the afternoon would complete it.\nBut before Lin Li could strike a cool pose, the boys swarmed up to surround him.\n\"Lin Li! Lin Li! Awesome!\"\n\"Record-breaking! Are you even human?\"\nFaced with the boys’ enthusiasm, Lin Li had only one thing to say—\n\"Who the hell slapped my butt again!\"\nSince the race was still on, they couldn’t interfere, so the boys dispersed. Now free, Lin Li walked over to Chen Yu Ying and clapped his hands: \"Class rep, water,\"\nRunning a 3000m at this pace was indeed easy for Lin Li now, but dehydration would still occur, and he could still get thirsty.\n\"On my way.\" Chen Yu Ying jogged over with Lin Li’s clothes, handing him a water bottle.\nUnlike Chen Tianming, who would worship the water back home, Lin Li unscrewed it and drank, his Adam’s apple moving in the sunlight.\nChen Yu Ying watched with a smile, admiring the smooth lines of the muscles on his forearms, the whitened fingertips gripping the bottle out of effort, and this handsome face.\nShe lowered her head to hide her blushing cheeks, but her shadow crept closer to his shoes.\nFinding an amusing game, she tilted her head and moved a bit more.\nNow it’s not just the shoes.\n\"Class rep, treating me so well, you’ve even loosened the cap for me?\" Lin Li said with a smile as he tightened the cap, having drunk half the bottle and feeling refreshed.\nThe crisp sound from crushing the empty bottle startled the shadow-stealing girl from her game.\nShe paused, then twisted the cap of the remaining water bottle before slowly looking up at Lin Li, biting her glossy lips, and blinking her eyes: \"Mm.\"\nLin Li, who had been watching, naturally noticed these small gestures, so after thinking for a moment, he blinked too and asked directly:\n\"Class rep, hurry up and tell me, did you drink from this water, I really need that good news.\"\nChen Yu Ying’s face turned even redder than Lin Li’s after the race, like it had been kissed by the sunset.\nShe averted her gaze: \"No, I didn’t. I just opened it for you.\"\nLin Li: \"Pssht, dog water.\"\n\"Lin Li—\" Such childish taunts unexpectedly amused Chen Yu Ying, who chuckled, picked up Lin Li’s clothes, and threw them at him, covering his head as she whispered: \"It’s not dog water.\"\n\"Hahaha—\" Lin Li laughed and took off the clothes carrying Chen Yu Ying’s scent. Though he wasn’t thirsty anymore, he made a point to open the water and take another sip: \"No wonder it tasted sweet.\"\n\"Tsk—where’s the sweetness?\" Chen Yu Ying turned her head away.\n\"Then it’s smelly.\" Lin Li, always receptive to feedback, immediately revised his statement upon seeing her reaction.\nNow the class rep should be satisfied, right?\n\"You’re the one who’s smelly! No water for you at the afternoon race!\" Chen Yu Ying glared at Lin Li, lightly lifting her heel and stomping down, raising her fist playfully in front of him.",

I’m not drinking—\" Chen Yu Ying asked in confusion after taking the water bottle, but before she could finish her sentence, her vision went black as a piece of clothing covered her head.\nLin Li’s clothes were washed at home, clearly different from the smell of the school laundry.\nSo Chen Yu Ying didn’t make too much of a fuss.\n\"Hold this for me, I’m going to cheer someone on.\" Lin Li’s voice came from outside the clothes.\nWhen Chen Yu Ying took off the clothes and held them in her arms again, Lin Li was already back on the track, alongside Wang Yuezhi, who still had a little over one lap to go.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, keep going! Just over four hundred meters left!\" Lin Li said to him.\nIn the Divine Hall, the strength given by the clown had all but burned out for Wang Yuezhi, who found even responding with eye contact difficult this time.\n\"Come on, I’ll run with you. Just follow me.\"\nThe time for Lin Li to use the [Wind Manipulation] hadn’t ended yet, so he ran ahead of Wang Yuezhi, then manipulated the wind on the field to drift from back to front to make it a bit easier for Wang Yuezhi to run.\nThe Nansang Middle School sports meet didn’t allow unrelated individuals to accompany runners, but Lin Li was a participant in this event.\nSo the referee just raised an eyebrow upon seeing this and didn’t say anything.\n\"Keep it up!\" Lin Li called back.\nWang Yuezhi wasn’t even supposed to be in this event; he was forced into it because of Lin Li.\nLin Li was no Wu Min; he took responsibility for his actions.\nAnd the people from Class Four, who had just been celebrating Lin Li’s victory, now realized what Lin Li was doing.\n\"Wang Yuezhi! Don’t embarrass the Wang Family! One last lap! Charge, man!\" Wang Ze leaped onto Zhou Baowei’s back, punching the air vigorously toward Wang Yuezhi.\n\"Come on.\" Zhou Baowei, holding up Wang Ze, nodded toward Wang Yuezhi as well.\n\"Squeak squeak squeak! Squeak squeak!\" Bai Bufan remained true to himself.\n\"Go, go! Even though I still don’t recognize you.\" Chen Tianming also smiled in encouragement.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, hang in there.\" The girls at the finish line offered their warmest encouragement and friendly smiles as Wang Yuezhi, who appeared almost like a dead dog, twisted his way toward them.\nThis was Wang Yuezhi’s first time running a long distance, the difference between 3000 meters and 1000 meters was more than just triple.\nIt felt as if an invisible hand was squeezing his lungs, oxygen was shredded into pieces, never filling the chest’s thirst, and his calf muscles felt like they were repeatedly pierced by thousands of steel needles. Each step felt like pulling lead-laden prosthetic legs out of a swamp, vision blurred with sweat, and cheers came through the sound of a water curtain...\nWang Yuezhi couldn’t utter a word.\nDamn, this is tough.\nBut at this moment, hearing boys he wasn’t familiar with usually cheering passionately for him, listening to girls call his name, couldn’t see clearly, couldn’t distinguish the voices, but Wang Yuezhi felt like crying.\nHe lifted his head slightly, looking at the fuzzy white figure leading him.\n\"Follow my rhythm, inhale—exhale—inhale—exhale—keep going! Only 200 meters left.\" Lin Li ran in front at a slightly faster pace than Wang Yuezhi, turning back now and then to check on Wang Yuezhi to adjust his speed while constantly offering words of encouragement.\nSome people are born suns.\nAnd at this moment, the sun was shining on him.\n\"150 meters!\"\n\"100 meters! Can you lift your legs higher?\"\n\"50 meters! The finish line is right in front, Wang Yuezhi!\"\n\"Last thirty meters, I’m stepping aside, sprint! Go all out!\"\nThe white figure moved from in front of him, Wang Yuezhi raised his head, gritted his teeth, and stretched his legs.\n\"Eighth place.\" The referee said with a smile to Wang Yuezhi as he crossed the line.\nWang Yuezhi didn’t quite catch the number, he just collapsed to the ground.\nThe result itself didn’t really matter to him, even coming last wouldn’t bother him.\nJust as he thought of lying down to catch his breath, the next second, he found himself suddenly surrounded by the guys from his class. Lin Li holding up his shoulders from behind, while others began to lift his limbs.\nHis body was airborne.\n\"Wang Yuezhi! Wang Yuezhi!\" Led by Lin Li, the boys shouted Wang Yuezhi’s name, then tossed him up and caught him repeatedly.\n\"Wang Yuezhi!\"\n\"Wang Yuezhi!\"\nWang Yuezhi’s vision was blurred by sweat, his throat choked with a ball of burning emotions. Every time he was thrown into the air, he felt his heart about to leap out of his chest, the cheers around him rushing in like a tide and receding.\nHe saw Lin Li grinning, saw the flushed faces of other guys, saw the sky spinning above him... At this moment, he felt like a feather floating lightly on the ocean called \"friendship,\" all fatigue and pain washed away.\nUntil he saw the goalpost appearing in front of his three legs.\nWang Yuezhi: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nGrass.\nWhen did you move me here?\nNo, why stop tossing me? What are you going to do by spreading my legs apart?\nWait!\nWait, damn it!\n...\nWang Yuezhi, sorely ravaged, lay on the track clutching his groin, looking utterly devastated.\nDad, if you want grandsons, better have another son quickly.\nSo that’s what it all culminated in, damn it, Lin Li, I really am &%*#@\nHowever.\nWang Yuezhi smiled.\nThis time, let’s just say I deserved it.\nI did experience a moment of beauty at this sports meet.\n\"Wang Yuezhi, want some water? Here’s a bottle, finishing the run is really impressive.\"\nHearing the refreshing familiar voice, Wang Yuezhi released his hands to act more elegantly, looking up, it was Chen Yu Ying bent slightly, handing him a bottle of mineral water.\n\"Th-thank you.\" Wang Yuezhi took it, responding with his throat still in pain.\n\"You’re welcome, take a good rest.\" Chen Yu Ying smiled, shook her head at Wang Yuezhi, and walked away hugging the remaining half bottle of water.\n\"Hehe~\"\nWang Yuezhi looked at the bottle of mineral water in his hand, feeling like his little Wang Yuezhi didn’t hurt anymore.\n\"Hehe~\"\nNot far off, Chen Tianming, who had seen the scene, squinted his eyes and took a step forward, asking seriously:\n\"Wang Yuezhi, you don’t plan to drink that water, do you? You don’t think it’s Holy Water, intending to keep it in the dorm and worship it daily, thinking it will bring you good luck, do you?\"\nWang Yuezhi looked at Chen Tianming in shock. How could this guy know the Mind Reading Technique?\n\"How did you know?\" He retorted.\n\"It’s nothing.\"\nChen Tianming sighed, didn’t respond, walked away, and then sighed again: \"Pitiful, pathetic.\"\nI wouldn’t do that.\nBrother, trust me, Qiaoqiao truly is different.\n--\nBrother, trust me, casting your vote for Tianxian will surely win you a prize.",

Ten minutes twenty-five seconds, and you even had six seconds left for some record-breaking show-off error time. Damn, even if I tried my best, I couldn’t get that time.\"\nAfter giving Wang Yuezhi an Aruban or airplane treatment, the boys who played well in the back row headed back to their class base, and Wang Ze clicked his tongue in amazement.\nLin Li, hearing this, smiled and looked at Wang Ze with a hint of mockery:\n\"Wang Ze, open a website requiring an account right now and change the password, then try setting it to ’wangze’. Do you know what’ll happen?\nThe answer is, the website will mark it with a red ’weak’ sign. Do you understand what that represents? You useless piece of junk.\"\nWang Ze: \"?\"\nYour mom.\nSuch a strong attack.\n\"Damn, there you go showing off again.\" Wang Ze laughed and cursed.\n\"But speaking of which, it’s really a pain. Some accounts force you to include uppercase letters and symbols in passwords. Seriously, those are passwords no human can accept.\nHave you ever thought that maybe I set such a weak password because my memory is weak too?\" Zhou Baowei chimed in.\nHe usually sets similar passwords for all his accounts, so if there’s a new one that he doesn’t record promptly, he easily forgets it, and it’s a hassle to recover.\n\"Isn’t that right? Research shows that pigs have top-tier memory in the animal kingdom, comparable to Bufan and primates. Bao Wei, you’re falling behind.\" Lin Li looked puzzled at Zhou Baowei and then sighed wistfully.\nZhou Baowei, Bai Bufan: \"?\"\n\"Lin Li, I’ve noticed recently you haven’t been memorizing much, yet you get everything right. What’s your trick for enhancing memory? I tried fish oil before, but it didn’t work.\"\nZhou Baowei suppressed the urge to retaliate and humbly asked for advice.\nLearn first, then take down Lin Li later.\n\"Fish oil didn’t work? Isn’t it recognized for improving memory? I was just thinking about trying it,\" Bai Bufan responded to Zhou Baowei.\n\"Not really. The main issue is my memory doesn’t even remind me to take fish oil every day.\" Zhou Baowei chuckled and scratched his head.\nLin Li, Bai Bufan, Wang Ze: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\n\"The useless thing isn’t the fish oil; it’s you!\" Lin Li, Bai Bufan, and Wang Ze couldn’t hold back anymore.\n\"Same difference, same difference.\" Zhou Baowei said sheepishly.\n\"Lin Li, hold on a sec.\" At this moment, a referee who just finished recording the last non-retiring participant’s score approached them, now free.\n\"Lin Li, are you interested in practicing sports? You have some talent in long-distance running.\" The referee asked.\nAs expected, it’s caught these people’s interest in nurturing talent.\nBeing too outstanding is truly troubling.\nAfter secretly enjoying the moment, Lin Li waved his hand: \"Thank you, teacher, but no. Learning sports won’t save Nansang Middle School. Even if fellow students are physically robust and vigorous, they’re just spectators and examples without meaning.\"\nReferee: \"?\"\nWhat the heck are you babbling about?\nBai Bufan glanced at Lin Li, thinking he was acting like Master Tree-man here again.\nHowever, Lin Li is right; studying sports won’t save Nansang Middle School, but civil engineering can.\nCivil engineering is great and needs no further words.\n\"Okay, but let’s exchange contacts. You’ll have more options in the future, and if you’re interested, you can contact me.\" The referee didn’t insist since Lin Li’s score was good, but not at genius level.\nMoreover, if he knew Lin Li was nearly eighteen, not the typical age for a high school freshman, the impressiveness would decrease.\nAs soon as the referee left, another person ran towards Lin Li and the others.\nIt was Du Hansi.\nBut the target wasn’t Lin Li.\n\"Wang Ze!! I! Screw! Your! Mom! Wen!\" Being the second place, but only just recovering now, Du Hansi tackled Wang Ze from behind, using some grappling techniques while angrily cursing.\n\"Huh? What’s up? Mad because you lost to our class? Hansi, just open a website requiring an account...\" Wang Ze acted innocently as if feeling wronged, applying his learning on the spot.\n\"What do you mean ’what’s up’? Saying I’m weak? You dared provoke Lin Li! My ass has no dignity left! You’re still asking what’s up here!\" Enraged even more by the mockery, Du Hansi clenched his fist as tight as his butt while running earlier.\nThus, the two began to ’fight’.\nLin Li, Bai Bufan, and Zhou Baowei exchanged glances.\nThey didn’t really know what was going on, but seeing one of their classmates being attacked by someone unfamiliar, why bother clarifying things? Just start swinging.\n\"Du Hansi (a guy whose name we don’t know), here we come to help you!!!\"\nWang Ze, who was almost turning the tables and riding on Du Hansi like a boss again, was suddenly thrown back to the ground by his friends.\nWang Ze looked at the three of them, excitedly starting to beat him up: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nDamn it, made friends with the wrong crowd.\n...\nUpon hearing the sounds from behind, Wang Yuezhi, feeling the sacred mineral water’s chill on his cheek, turned his head to see Lin Li, Bai Bufan, and others running towards him. At that moment, he felt like his little ’Wang Yuezhi’ shrunk as if winter came early.\nWang Yuezhi, terrified, prepared to flee.",

Doing this means you’re no longer one of the Wang Family! As we travel afar, Wang must help Wang! Damn!\" Wang Ze tried to awaken Wang Yuezhi’s conscience.\n\"Wang Yuezhi!\"\n\"You bastard!\"\n\"Agh!!\"\nThe soccer net once again bore the brunt of disaster.\n...\nSeeing Wang Ze clutching Xiao Wang, trembling on the ground, Du Hansi felt much relieved.\nThen he walked toward Lin Li: \"Lin Li, let’s add each other as friends. You don’t really know someone until you have a scuffle with them. I discover you’re quite fun as long as I’m not your target for harassment. Next time, I’ll treat you to a meal.\"\nLin Li smiled and nodded: \"Indeed, it’s fate. Well, reciprocally, next time there’s a chance, I’ll harass you instead.\"\nDu Hansi: \"?\"\nIs that what we’re reciprocating?\n\"No thanks, let’s leave it at that.\"\nThe school sports meet also had medals, but you had to wait for the broadcast notice before going to the podium to receive them.\nAnd the podium was quite simple, basically a base split into three heights, with the Nansang Middle School emblem and some other insignias on it.\nSo Lin Li and the boys continued to return first to the class’s base.\nOn the small whiteboard, the next event with classmates participating was the girls’ 3000 meters. No wonder the class leader wasn’t here; she likely went with Ding Sihan to accompany Qu Wanqiu to the check-in.\n\"Lin Li, why does ’Water Margin’ not have detailed writing in the Pan Jinlian scenes that I’m most looking forward to? I want to see Pan Jinlian hanging upside down on the grapevine.\"\nWang Ze, who had just about recovered, sat on a chair and placed his legs on Lin Li’s legs, brushing through the e-book in his hand, speaking somewhat unenthusiastically.\n\"Then you should see the ’Golden Lotus’ filled version, or you could directly search for it like a secret comic instead, it’s even colored ink style. Unfortunately, I forgot the license plate number.\" Lin Li said with a laugh.\n\"You should just interpret it live for me.\"\nLin Li raised an eyebrow, feeling interested, and got up using the whiteboard eraser as a wooden block while hitting the table:\n\"Since the audience wants to hear, I can’t keep avoiding it!\"\n\"As the story goes, Pan Jinlian, holding the bamboo pole, couldn’t grip it firmly, and accidentally dropped it out of the window, hitting someone on the head.\"\n\"Jinlian deeply bowed and said, ’I mishandled; please forgive me, sir~’\"\n\"When Ximen Qing raised his face and saw such an alluring lady, he fell into deep, peculiar fantasies...\"\nLin Li’s face already had the expected smile, while the originally also sly-smiling Wang Ze and Bai Bufan suddenly stopped smiling, simultaneously indicating Lin Li.\nLin Li immediately turned around, relieved it wasn’t Xue Jian, just Chen Yu Ying.\nChen Yu Ying put her hands behind her back, blinked, and with a hint of curiosity asked, \"What exactly was Ximen Qing fantasizing about? Was it odd?\"\nLin Li: \"...\"\nLin Li lightly coughed twice and, unfazed, continued: \"Continuing from the previous Chapter, Ximen Qing saw Pan Jinlian and began deep peculiar musings — ’Why wouldn’t the bamboo pole go upward rather than fall downward? Could it be some gravitational force from the Earth drawing the bamboo pole down?’\"\nAnd so, Ximen Qing’s three major laws...\"\nWang Ze, Bai Bufan: \"?\"\nWho the heck wants to hear about this?\nDamn, it seems Pan Jinlian dodged a bullet.\nChen Yu Ying hearing this let out a chuckle, her eyes sparkling: \"Is that what it is?\"\n\"If not, if the class leader has a different version, this is the wooden block, and the duty of storytelling falls on you. I would love to listen.\" Lin Li handed the whiteboard eraser to Chen Yu Ying, longing.\n\"No way,\" Chen Yu Ying naturally did not take it but rather laughed and said: \"Lin Li, Lin Li, you’ve got plenty of tricks.\"\n\"I’m okay. A friend has a pet Dalmatian called Bufan; that pet has loads of tricks.\" Lin Li humbly waved his hand.\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nNext time, you two can keep this playful banter between yourselves, thanks.\n\"Let’s go, Wang Ze, let’s hit the restroom.\" Bai Bufan felt he should leave, so he looked at Wang Ze.\n\"Okay, I’ve been wanting to go too, let’s!\"\n\"Based on Lin Li’s version, Newton would cry all day saying he feels like he’s lived his whole life in Ximen Qing’s shadow.\" Wang Ze got up to follow, laughing while speaking.\n\"Actually, Newton’s not as great as you think.\" Bai Bufan then chuckled to demystify for Wang Ze:\nAccording to unofficial histories, Newton, while writing Newton’s laws, originally wanted to express, \"I’m damn in love with big butts and big bosoms,\" but the publishers said, \"Writing like this is somewhat inappropriate,\" so Newton changed it to \"The larger the mass, the greater the attraction.\"\nUnderstand now, Old Newton was also a person with passion; he bore the surname Newton, and believed in Newton, trusting Newton’s judgment wouldn’t be wrong.\"\nWang Ze: \"?\"\n\"Have you started to expand the terrain of unofficial histories now?\"\n\"Just say which Newton you recognize.\"\n\"Wild Newton, I too am completely fond of big butts and big bosoms.\"\n\"I cannot fully agree.\" Bai Bufan, who once had a clash of values with Lin Li, shook his head.\nAnd thus, new disputes began.\n...\nIn the class’s base.\nWith Bai Bufan and Wang Ze vacating their spots, Chen Yu Ying took a seat beside Lin Li.",

This is the undeniable charm of a bird’s nest-head handsome guy!\"\nOnly then did Chen Yu Ying stifle her laughter, slightly tilting her head to reveal the side of her face hidden by her hand. Her clear eyes blinked a bit more frequently, casting a small shadow under her eyes. After looking at Lin Li like this for a second, she softly asked:\n\"Did they ask you face-to-face?\"\n\"Yeah, pretty brave, much braver than that what’s-his-name Tao coward.\" Lin Li nodded.\n\"Are they also from first year? Did you add them?\" Chen Yu Ying continued to ask.\n\"One is, and the other isn’t.\" Lin Li told the truth, leaning back and stretching lazily: \"Added them both, after all, it’s hard to refuse, and the one from our grade kind of suits my taste. If he hadn’t added me, I would’ve wanted to add him.\"\n\"Oh.\" Chen Yu Ying’s voice was as light as a feather.\nResponding just like that, she turned her head again, at an angle even greater than when she was secretly laughing before, her ponytail falling to just cover her side face.\nLin Li watched Chen Yu Ying’s actions, blinked, and then asked: \"By the way, the first-year one said they want to treat me to a meal, but I feel I’ve just met them, not at that level yet. Class Monitor, how do you think I should reply?\"\n\"I don’t know.\" Chen Yu Ying responded in a low voice, her mood not high, her voice seemed to be muffled in her soft chest.\nWhere Lin Li couldn’t see, the girl’s right hand held an unopened marker on the table, doodling aimlessly, lips pressed into a straight line, eyes flickering with displeasure.\n\"Hey, he’s already messaged me, Class Monitor, do you have any cute stickers? Send me a few, so I can reply to him.\"\nLooking at Du Hansi’s message on his phone, Lin Li, as if completely oblivious to someone’s change in mood, said to Chen Yu Ying.\n\"...I’ll send them to you later.\" Chen Yu Ying opened her mouth, in the end only saying this.\n\"Not now?\"\n\"My phone’s out of battery now.\"\n\"Should I borrow a power bank for you?\"\nLin Li’s voice suddenly became much clearer and the hair was lightly tugged, realizing that Lin Li, just like during lunchtime rest, was facing her and playing with her hair.\nSo she pulled her ponytail to the front, not responding about the power bank, and softly said: \"I just washed my hair today, don’t mess it up.\"\n\"Class Monitor? Are you implying my hands are dirty?!\" Lin Li’s voice carried obvious amusement.\n\"What else? You just finished running.\" Perhaps thinking it wasn’t right to keep turning away, Chen Yu Ying finally sat up straight again, glanced at Lin Li, her eyes filled with emotions as complex as a spilled palette.\n\"Seems like I need to wash my hands first, coincidentally, I kind of want to go to the bathroom, so I’m going.\" Lin Li nodded, stood up, and stretched lazily.\n\"Okay.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded, taking out her still fully charged phone, intending to delete all her cute stickers.\nHate cute stickers.\n\"Alright, I’m off, hope this time on the way some girl will ask for my WeChat, sigh, what does it mean when all guys ask for my WeChat? I haven’t even started bodybuilding, how am I starting to attract the same sex? Hope the referee and the sports student from class fourteen added me to introduce girls to me.\nSo annoying, sigh!!\"\nLin Li bemoaned loudly, as if wanting to pierce through the entire playground, afraid some people wouldn’t hear him.\nHe then slowly walked towards the bathroom, cradling his head with the back of his hands.\nChen Yu Ying’s movements paused.\nShe blinked and turned off the phone screen, seeing herself displeased.\nAt least she had been displeased, but now, the corners of her mouth were involuntarily lifting.\nCannot lift.\nBut the corners of her mouth didn’t obey, so eventually the expression turned into a hint of embarrassed shyness.\nShe lifted her head, watching Lin Li’s receding figure, he was kicking the grass on the roadside with his toes, leisurely as if taking a stroll.\nChen Yu Ying opened Lin Li’s chat list.\nChen Yu Ying began to send all her non-cute stickers one by one to Lin Li.\nNo cute ones for him, hmph.\nStill feeling unsatisfied, Chen Yu Ying’s friend list had one less \"Lin Li\" and one more \"Lin Li (Annoying version)\".\nAfter doing this, Chen Yu Ying placed her phone on the table and cradled her cheeks with both hands.\n\"Oh my~\"\n...\n\"Lin Li, what are you doing?\" Bai Bufan and Wang Ze, just out of the bathroom, asked in confusion when they saw Lin Li walking over.\nLin Li was stunned for a moment, pointing at the bathroom behind them: \"Come on, guys, I’m here not to get you two lunch, right?\"\n\"I mean, you’re using the bathroom, why are you smiling so happily?\" Bai Bufan’s curiosity pinpointed the issue.\n\"Indeed, you’re smiling like an idiot.\" Wang Ze nodded in agreement.\n\"Am I not allowed to smile? Do I need your permission?\" Lin Li flipped them off as he grumbled and walked into the bathroom: \"Typical low IQ male thinking. Forget it, I’m in a good mood, can’t be bothered with you two...\"\nThe baffled Bai Bufan and Wang Ze: \"?\"\n\"Is he nuts?\" they said in unison.",

      "content": "Chapter 384: Chapter 264: Lin Li Walks in Pain\nThe girls’ 3000 meters is much more drawn-out than the boys’.\nQu Wanqiu came in fifth. Although not in the top three, considering there were over twenty participants, it was still quite a good result.\nChen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan supported Qu Wanqiu as they slowly walked along the inner loop of the track to rest, and Lin Li and Bai Bufan followed behind.\n\"Wanqiu, that’s a great result, and you scored quite high as well,\" Chen Yu Ying and Ding Sihan praised Qu Wanqiu with smiles.\n\"Plus, the four girls who were faster than you seemed like either athletic students or long-distance enthusiasts, so it’s not surprising you lost to them.\"\n\"If I were to run the 3000 meters, I probably wouldn’t have achieved what you did. I’m not just saying this to comfort you; I’m being honest,\" Bai Bufan nodded in agreement.\n\"Indeed, fifth place is really not bad. Although I’m the first place, bracket, a record-breaking first place, I think fifth place is also quite good. It’s just four places away from first place, bracket, record-breaking first place, but it’s very commendable.\"\nOriginally smiling politely, Qu Wanqiu stopped in her tracks and turned to look at the person who stood out strangely.\n\"Didn’t you see? Little Qiuqiu ignores your praises and responds only to mine. Tell me, who is the true ruler of praise, the yellow-black king?\" Lin Li said smugly.\n\"Water,\" Qu Wanqiu replied, not amused.\nLin Li unscrewed the cap of a brand-new water bottle and handed it to Qu Wanqiu: \"Remember to drink slowly and not all at once.\"\nQu Wanqiu nodded, accepting the water: \"Thanks.\"\nThe five stopped to let Qu Wanqiu drink water.\nGulp, gulp.\n\"Hmph, I’m not concerned about you or anything. I just hope to conserve water resources by telling you to drink slowly!\" Lin Li suddenly said in a tsundere tone.\n\"Pfft—cough, cough!\" The water that just went down was sprayed out, and Qu Wanqiu turned her head angrily towards Lin Li. Even though her throat was uncomfortable, she couldn’t help but scold, \"Seriously? Lin Li? Who even asked you?\"\nBai Bufan couldn’t hold back: \"Lin Li, are you being tsundere here or something?\"\nChen Yu Ying’s focus was different from the others. She noticed the other bottle of water in Lin Li’s hand and asked, puzzled, \"Lin Li, why haven’t you finished that water yet?\"\n\"Of course, it’s because I’m not thirsty and I want to conserve water resources. It couldn’t possibly be because you, the class monitor, drank from it, so I consider it Holy Water that I should take home, put on a table, worship every day, and think it will bring me good luck, right? How could I do something like that?\"\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\n\"What do you mean by Ying Bao drank from it?\" Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu immediately went into gossip mode.\nBut before Chen Yu Ying could say anything, Lin Li had already been swept to the ground by Bai Bufan with a leg sweep.\nWith his bottom hitting the ground and his tailbone aching, Lin Li gasped for cold air. The cause of global warming was suspected to be found.\nBai Bufan went up to grab Lin Li’s collar, angrily questioning, \"Chen Tianming, I don’t care why you’re attacking your own kind, but now, immediately get off Lin Li!\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nHe got what he deserved and decided to lay there for a while where he fell. Lin Li lay on the ground rubbing his backside: \"Just joking, just joking,\"\nHe downed the remaining half bottle of water in one go and then handed it to Bai Bufan.\n\"I’m not thirsty.\"\n\"No, I meant open your mouth, I’m throwing away the trash.\"\nBai Bufan: \"?\"\nSo Lin Li lay there a while longer.\nAfter walking a circle around the inner track, Qu Wanqiu felt better and could return to the class base to sit and rest.\n\"Would the first-place winner of the high school boys’ 3000 meters, Class 4, Lin Li; second place, Class 14, Du Hansi; and third place, Class 19, Hu Feixing, please come to the podium to receive your awards.\"\nUpon hearing this, Lin Li got up and looked at Chen Yu Ying: \"Class Monitor, is your phone charged? Help me take a photo.\"\n\"Yes, it’s fully charged,\" Chen Yu Ying nodded but looked away with a guilty conscience.\n\"Let’s go!\"\nAt the podium, Du Hansi was already there, and as soon as he saw Lin Li and Chen Yu Ying approaching, he smiled and stepped forward to greet them.\nInstinctively, he focused his gaze slightly behind Lin Li on Chen Yu Ying, recalling the scene of her cheering for Lin Li, and curiously asked in a low voice:\n\"Lin Li, is she your girlfriend?\"\n\"No,\" Lin Li shook his head.\n\"Then can I...\" Du Hansi’s eyes lit up.\n\"No way,\" Lin Li interrupted directly.\n\"Oh, okay,\" Du Hansi conceded.\nIt’s not a \"not yet,\" it’s just a \"no.\"\nNonetheless, Du Hansi completely dismissed any ideas he had and dared not covet Chen Yu Ying.\nWith the experience of the 3000 meters, Du Hansi believed that if he showed any signs of interest, he might replace Chen Yu Ying as Lin Li’s new target.\nHe already found it exhausting to guard against Wang Ze all the time and couldn’t imagine adding Lin Li to the mix.\nThe referee came to distribute the medals, and after student volunteers took a photo that might be used on the school’s official page, the award ceremony was effectively over.\nBut the broadcast wouldn’t immediately call the next batch of winners, creating a five-minute gap.\nThis time was usually used by the class to take photos of their classmates.\nLin Li held an awkward pose for the photos, occasionally stepping forward to check how they turned out. Noticing a figure in his peripheral vision, he abruptly stopped and shouted at the person, \"Wang Yuezhi!!\"\n\"Wh-what?\" Wang Yuezhi, standing near the podium and watching, jumped again at the sudden shout and replied with a frown.",

I didn’t win any award.\" Wang Yuezhi was a bit surprised.\n\"You sweated for the class and contributed, how is there nothing worth photographing? The honor is yours too, don’t hesitate, just come!\" Lin Li said with a smile.\nSeeing Wang Yuezhi still not moving, Lin Li directly came down from the podium next to him, half-locked his neck and pushed him onto the podium, also hanging his own medal on him.\n\"Class monitor, take a photo!\" Lin Li then ordered.\n\"Okay.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded with a smile, \"Wang Yuezhi, look here.\"\nOriginally intending to refuse, Wang Yuezhi stood upright instantly: \"Yes!\"\nWith the look of a trained military dog, Lin Li nodded with satisfaction.\nThen Lin Li jumped up too, the two of them put their arms around each other’s shoulders.\nLaughing together, posing in strange positions, and being captured by the camera.\nAll became part of the group, brothers.\nFive minutes passed quickly, the broadcast was already calling for the next group of recipients.\n\"I will win the championship again at 1500 this afternoon. There’s still a chance, I’ll call you then, Wang Yuezhi.\" Seeing Wang Yuezhi reluctant to leave the podium and Chen Yu Ying’s phone, Lin Li said with a smile.\nWang Yuezhi didn’t respond, but suddenly felt that his student life of just studying seemed a bit boring, so he looked at Lin Li and softly said, \"Thank you.\"\nHe said it too lightly, Lin Li, who was leaning over to look at the photos taken with Chen Yu Ying, didn’t hear it.\nSo Wang Yuezhi, a bit embarrassed, still reached out and patted Lin Li.\nLin Li turned around, his face full of a grateful smile, heavily patted Wang Yuezhi’s shoulder:\n\"I’m really a genius, Wang Yuezhi, pulling you over to take photos with me was definitely the right choice; with you as the green leaf, I immediately look much more handsome. Thanks, you really helped me a lot.\"\n\"Lin Li, I was thanking—\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nWait.\nSo that was your purpose for dragging me over to take photos?\nAll this honor-sharing stuff, was it just a lie?\nDamn, how could I just have a moment wanting to thank Lin Li, am I crazy?\n\"Lin Li, your mom—\" Wang Yuezhi got angrier the more he thought about it, gritting his teeth, but seeing Chen Yu Ying next to Lin Li, realized it wasn’t the time to curse, forced to retract to a barren desert: \"—How’s her health recently?\"\nThis question, however, suddenly brought down Lin Li’s mood.\nLin Li pursed his lips, hesitated for a while before squatting down and sighed: \"My mom got sick, had a tough time yesterday.\"\nThe abrupt change in atmosphere was a bit unforeseen.\nBeside him, Chen Yu Ying heard and tilted her head, then continued selecting photos on Lin Li’s phone as if nothing happened.\nBut Wang Yuezhi’s pupils shook, isn’t he a brother? Eh? Don’t do this, I don’t want my next life to be tortured by conscience...\n\"Auntie, what’s wrong with Auntie?\" Wang Yuezhi broke into a sweat, cautiously asked.\n\"Ingrown toenail acted up.\" Lin Li sighed.\n\"Sorry, I didn’t mean to bring up—\"\nWang Yuezhi: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nAn ingrown toenail?\nThat was a tough time; not peaceful at all.\nIt’s not just Wu Min who’s unpeaceful now, because Wang Yuezhi also feels like he’s out of breath.\nLin Li is indeed too filial, it made him laugh.\nBut Chen Yu Ying’s presence again forced him to retract a lot of ’mom’.\n\"Wish! Aunt! Your! Recovery! Soon!\" So after leaving the blessing through gritted teeth, Wang Yuezhi quickly walked towards the class stronghold.\nRight after taking photos himself, finishing selfies too, Du Hansi, seeing Wang Yuezhi leaving, came over.\n\"Right, Lin Li, what do you mean by sending me those emojis? You didn’t reply when I asked.\" He recalled this matter and came to inquire Lin Li.\nChen Yu Ying heard and raised her head, blinking.\n\"I think those emoji are cute, real men must use cute emoji, so I shared them with you, you can steal according to needs.\" Lin Li shrugged and explained.\n\"But those emojis are nowhere near cute, right?\" Du Hansi checked his phone to confirm and frowned.\n\"Eh? Not cute, eh?\" Lin Li’s response awaited this question, smiled and turned to tease Chen Yu Ying, \"Class monitor, about this cute and uncute matter, you have a—\"\nEh? Where’s she?\nThe Chen Yu Ying beside him was already gone, Lin Li raised his eyes and saw that Chen Yu Ying had already dashed towards the class strong point.\nRan? Completely left him here?\nHaha, wicked woman.\n\"Um, Lin Li, why didn’t you finish? What’s cute?\" Du Hansi asked confused.\nLin Li turned back with a smile and said, \"Don’t you think every message I send is cute? What I actually meant was, the cute one isn’t the emoji, it’s me, Hansi.\"\nDu Hansi: \"???\"\n\"Also, Hansi, our class teacher said I’m soon transitioning from a commoner to a glorious group leader, that’s a promotion, seems like sharing with you, so do you want to absorb the promotion aura?\"\nAnd with my rich experience, I can check if there are any issues in your workplace and give some advice.\"\nDu Hansi ran away without turning back.\nBu Hao, Lin Li is being silly again!\nOn the other side, Wang Yuezhi heard footsteps approaching from behind, turned around, surprised to find it was Chen Yu Ying running towards him with a flushed face.\nWang Yuezhi was both surprised and happy; if he hadn’t told himself a thousand times to be reserved, he might have laughed out loud. Then he scratched his head: \"Monitor, I’m not really mad, no need to wor—\"",

Chen Yu Ying stopped and turned around, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, and confirmed, \"Wang Yuezhi, were you just talking?\"\n\"No, I wasn’t.\"\n\"Oh, oh, then I’m leaving, bye-bye.\"\n\"Bye, bye-bye TAT.\"\nWang Yuezhi reached into his pocket, but since he had a competition today, he didn’t bring his clown nose.\nNext time, I should carry it with me.\n...\nAs it was nearing noon, the class project was also drawing to a close. When Lin Li gave Zhou Baowei and Bai Bufan a look, the two of them nodded immediately and came over.\n\"Is it time to take action?\" Bai Bufan inquired.\n\"Yes.\" Lin Li nodded and then led the two to the usual spot under the dormitory where takeout was picked up.\nIt was quite early at this time, with only a cup of milk tea and two takeout orders from who knows whom.\n\"What do we do now, just hang out here pretending to wait for takeout and keep watch?\" Bai Bufan asked.\n\"If someone stays here all the time, it would be too obvious. If the thief is a coward, they might be scared off and not steal, which is not what I want to see.\" Lin Li shook his head and then took some equipment out of the bag he brought.\n\"Since there are no cameras here, we’ll make our own surveillance.\" Lin Li displayed the items and provided his answer.\n\"Is this a camera? What about this?\" Bai Bufan picked and chose, curiously asking.\n\"This is a mobile WiFi. I’ll set it up here as a hotspot later, so this action camera can livestream the footage to an app on my phone — isn’t that a perfect live surveillance?\"\nAs Lin Li explained, he took out his phone and began setting up the camera, confirming that the video was normal.\n\"Holy crap, this is awesome.\" Zhou Baowei was slightly stunned when he saw the footage in his hand, \"This thing seems quite handy for secretly filming under boys’ skirts.\"\n\"You better mean boys.\"\n\"How much is this camera?\" Zhou Baowei asked.\n\"A bit over two thousand each.\"\n\"Huh? That expensive?\" Zhou Baowei’s earlier thought extinguished, then he worried a bit, \"What if this camera and portable WiFi just placed here get taken? If someone avoids the camera, takes it, and turns it off, you’d be out both the camera and the signal device.\"\n\"Firstly, we’ll take some concealment measures, so it won’t be easily noticed. And even if it’s found, who can guess it’s streaming live? It will definitely leave some clues. And in the worst-case scenario, if it’s lost, then so be it. I don’t mind. I’m not short of this bit of money, my dude, Brother Fu!\"\nLin Li said, not caring, and proudly patted his shoulder.\nWithout the urge for luxury goods, the money in the bank and the gold under the bed are hard to imagine spending.\n\"Over two thousand each is not short of money? Lin Li, is that what happened after you made it big? Damn, I’m really done with you rich folk, I can’t take it.\" Zhou Baowei gritted his teeth slightly.\n\"Sorry, Bao Wei, I don’t eat crowdfunded meals anymore. If you want to collaborate, ask Bai Bufan, thanks.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nYour mom.\n\"Lin Li, have you completely forgotten your roots?\" Zhou Baowei raged impotently, \"Disgusting, disgusting! When will I become rich too! Whose WeChat has money, I want to exchange with AliPay.\"\n\"Bao Wei, don’t belittle yourself. You are actually closer to being a millionaire than Musk.\" Lin Li comforted Zhou Baowei upon hearing this.\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nThat’s true.\nHe’s only short of a million to be a millionaire, while Musk is short of billions.\nVictory!\n\"Lin Li, your camera’s been stolen!\" At this time, came Bai Bufan’s slightly panicked voice.\nLin Li: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nLin Li turned his head, and the camera he placed on the ground was indeed gone.\nWow, who could have stolen it?\nBesides a bungee jumping zombie, who else in this world could sneak away with something so discreetly?\n\"Ah, it got stolen so quickly. Although you don’t mind, it’s still a pity.\" Bai Bufan sighed in regret but then happily shared some good news, \"Luckily, Lin Li, I also happen to have a camera just like yours. Let’s use mine for now. Here, borrow it, remember to return it later.\"\nHe pulled out a camera from behind him, identical to the one Lin Li lost, putting it in front of Lin Li, indicating his willingness to lend it.\nSo generous, that’s what a brother is for.\nLin Li just smiled.",

Here’s the tape for you, stick it on the wall, then hide it among those grasses, I still need to go set up bait,\" Lin Li skipped the middle steps and directly instructed Bai Bufan.\nBai Bufan received the order and began to properly place the sports camera.\n——He put it in Zhou Baowei’s hand.\nAtchoo Fan, rather than completing the job, you’re choosing to transfer the work, huh?\nZhou Baowei looked at this scene and gave the middle finger, of course.\n\"But what about the bait you just mentioned? How do we know the people in ’surveillance’ are stealing takeout or just taking their own?\" Bai Bufan confirmed this point.\n\"See those two takeouts?\" Lin Li pointed to the takeout next to the milk tea.\n\"I saw them, I wanted to complain just now, who the hell orders takeout so early, won’t it be cold by noon?\" Bai Bufan nodded and laughed mockingly.\n\"Those two are the ones I ordered.\" Lin Li stared at Bai Bufan.\n\"I guessed it,\" Bai Bufan smiled, \"That’s why I cursed on purpose, I don’t have such inexplicable malice towards ordinary strangers.\"\nLin Li: \"?\"\nBattered and bruised, wine recognizing the sword seed.\nLin Li moved forward, took the takeout he ordered in advance to his side, then took out the takeout sticker from his bag.\n\"You even got these sticker things? Are you adding ingredients? Just right, I still have some nasal waste recovery system organic crystallization product.\" Installing the camera, Zhou Baowei’s eyes lit up and said expectantly.\nNowadays all takeouts are required to be sealed with stickers, mainly to prevent delivery drivers and others from tampering with the takeout during transit from the seller to the customer.\nIt’s intended to guard against people like Zhou Baowei, Bai Bufan, Lin Li.\n\"Boogers are boogers, why so fancy,\" Bai Bufan glanced disdainfully at Zhou Baowei but then nodded with expectancy, \"I can also pick a couple of cigarette butts.\"\n\"Can’t you be more respectful? What’s boogers, I prefer to call them nasal ore or nasal gems.\"\nZhou Baowei seemed ready to take out the snacks he hid in his nose to show Bai Bufan.\n\"Wait, you two, let me clarify first, deliberately adding filthy things in takeout hoping that fool steals and eats it, if the result is severe, it’s considered intentional harm or dangerous goods delivery, which is illegal.\" Lin Li quickly educated the two.\n\"That means if that fool eats the stolen takeout and something goes wrong, we’ll be legally responsible.\"\n\"If the other party holds onto this point, it’ll be troublesome for us.\"\nLin Li said slowly.\n\"Ah? Is that so, then forget it...then I’ll eat it myself.\" Zhou Baowei was a little scared and shook his head after hearing that.\nFor teenagers around fifteen or sixteen who are quite obedient, illegal activities are a terrifying concept.\n\"No, no, no, no,\" Lin Li wagged his index finger, with a cunning smile: \"We need to add some ingredient, otherwise what’s the point of me getting this sticker?\nBao Wei, what I meant by what I just said is not to back down but is that if we’re lucky enough that guy steals our takeout, when we meet, we mustn’t admit we added ingredients, insist there’s nothing dirty in it.\nEven if we want to see that guy’s disgusted reaction, we can subtly hint at it, but absolutely don’t blurt out ’Buddy, you just ate something we mixed in nasal gems’ kind of self-exposing words.\"\nZhou Baowei: \"?\"\nWas that warning what it meant?\nMy mindset was still too innocent, underestimated Lin Li.\n\"Alright....\"\n\"And rest assured, Bufan and I have rich experience getting locked up; if we frame you as the mastermind later, we have ways to bail you out.\" Lin Li gave Zhou Baowei another dose of reassurance.\nZhou Baowei was just about to breathe a sigh of relief, then suddenly felt wrong: \"Why the hell am I always the mastermind again!\"\n\"That’s not important, Bao Wei, you shut your mouth first, Lin Li, I have another question, what if the takeout thief doesn’t steal ours?\" Bai Bufan inquired at this point.\n\"That’s very important!\"\n\"Then he’s just lucky and won’t get to experience our surprise.\nBut we have surveillance, if he steals someone else’s, we can definitely notice it.\" Lin Li also ignored Zhou Baowei and explained to Bai Bufan:\n\"As long as we see someone is anxiously looking for their takeout and can’t find it, then we can immediately go down and find them, confirm it was stolen, ask them about their delivery person and their takeout packaging, then check the ’surveillance’ in our hands, find out who took it.\"\n\"Without facial features, based on clothes and height, we can definitely trace back.\"\n\"Okay! Let’s get started quickly!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 388: Chapter 265 Protect the Environment, Everyone’s Responsibility_2\nBai Bufan was already getting a little impatient.\nThe camera was quickly set up, and while it wasn’t hidden very well, being mostly covered, the camera lens was quite large. If someone deliberately looked for it, they could probably find it in a few minutes.\nBut at the point of picking up a delivery, who would think that someone had intentionally placed a ’mini-surveillance’ here?\nJust in case, Lin Li also placed another sports camera in the corner. Although it was more concealed, the shot was relatively limited.\nThen the three of them immediately returned to the dormitory with two bags of takeout.\nWhen Zhou Baowei saw Bai Bufan and Lin Li carrying takeout and wearing gloves and disposable chopsticks collected from the dorms into the bathroom, he couldn’t imagine what kind of freaky and disgusting thing these two were going to do.\n\"That’s really disgusting.\"\nCollecting nasal gems while staring at the surveillance, Zhou Baowei commented.\nSince they were not sure if their preparation would be picked up by the lucky thief, the three didn’t put too much effort into the takeout. After adding what needed to be added, Bai Bufan went downstairs to place the takeout outside the iron fence.\nBy this time, it was also approaching meal time, and the number of takeout bags on the wall had already increased by a few. Bai Bufan mixed theirs in with the others.\nAfter granting software access, Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei sat on either side upon their return, each using their own phones to view the two surveillance cameras, waiting for the thief’s grand entrance.\nHopefully, he would steal again today and not let all their efforts go to waste.\n\"Becoming a security guard before even coming of age.\" Bai Bufan looked left and right, staring at the surveillance, suddenly finding it a bit hard to hold back.\n\"Well, that’s not bad, saves you from taking forty-four years on the wrong path.\"\n\"Knock knock knock.\"\nSomeone was knocking on the dormitory door, and the standing Lin Li went up to open it.\nIt was Wang Ze.\n\"Wang Ze? Didn’t you go to eat?\" Lin Li asked somewhat puzzled.\n\"I’ve already ordered takeout, just came to check on you guys.\" Wang Ze walked in with his hands behind his back, surveyed the surroundings, and said.\n\"If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.\" Lin Li impatiently responded.\n\"Ahem,\" since Lin Li so sincerely asked, he decided to graciously answer, \"Lin Li, heh heh, I’m about to fall in love.\"\nThen he looked expectantly at Lin Li’s reaction.\n\"Don’t throw garbage into the river randomly, river management is already quite troublesome, how about protecting the environment?\" Lin Li frowned.\nWang Ze: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nDamn you.\n\"I think you just call the grapes sour because you can’t taste them.\" Wang Ze sniffed and said.\n\"I can’t taste grapes?\" Lin Li just responded with a disdainful laugh, too lazy to say more. After a bit of thought, he came to a conclusion, \"So a girl really added you?\"\n\"That’s right! Although only one added me, we’ve been chatting sporadically all morning and seem to really hit it off! This girl is worth it!\" Wang Ze excitedly said.\nLin Li: \"?\"\nWho added him.\nWas it Lin Li or Bai Bufan?\n\"What did the girl use to add you?\" Lin Li inquired.\n\"QQ, and she even liked and commented ’wow’ on my abs picture, see, all my preparation was meaningful!\" Wang Ze immediately came over to Lin Li to share.\nLin Li opened the girl’s QQ.\nGummy Bear.\nAge 1; Switzerland; stories will always end, don’t look back; an atmospheric girl avatar, a sun, a moon, a star.\nSpace visible for three days, the most recent post was from this morning, showing some scenery from a sports event, with no pictures of herself.\nBefore asking for more info about ’her’, Lin Li glanced back. He saw Bai Bufan pressing his nose with his palm, eyes fixed rigidly on the surveillance camera, looking very serious.\nIn one second, he could tell the real gender of the QQ owner.\nLin Li rubbed his own brow.\nThis move was quite impressive, surpassing the master, he hoped Bufan wouldn’t overdo it, otherwise Lin Li might even have to voluntarily tell Wang Ze the truth.\n\"What did you guys chat about?\" Lin Li asked.\n\"For now, just some small talk. I tried to muster up the courage to ask her out for lunch, but she was still a bit shy and said she had something to do at noon.\" Wang Ze said a bit sheepishly.\nLin Li: \"...\"\nShe’s quite busy at noon, probably has to work as a security guard.\n\"You haven’t even seen her picture, and you’re already asking her out for lunch?\"\n\"Can you not be so shallow, Lin Li, besides physique and looks, what kind do you like?\" Wang Ze retorted.\n\"I can’t look past those.\" Lin Li shook his head.\nAs the saying goes, without external beauty, who the hell cares about your inner beauty.\nWang Ze: \"...\"\nHopeless.\nThey won’t find common ground.\nBefore Wang Ze could say more, Zhou Baowei suddenly slapped the table: \"Here he comes, here he comes! Target spotted, taking off with our takeout! Awesome! Jackpot!\"\n\"Yes, yes, I saw it too! I was just about to say.\" Bai Bufan on the other angle also nodded.\nLin Li stepped forward for a peek, immediately snapped his fingers: \"Let’s go, downstairs!\"\n\"Huh? What are you guys doing?\" Seeing the three quickly heading towards the door, it was Wang Ze who was now a bit confused.\n\"Coming or not?\" Lin Li had already pushed the door open and was walking away, only turning back to ask.\n\"I’m coming, wait for me.\" Wang Ze nodded.\nEven though Wang Ze had no idea what Lin Li was up to, he decided to come first and figure it out later.\nEven if it was just going out to take a stroll at the bottom of the dormitory building.\n...\nAfter playing games all morning, Wang Yuhui sat up from bed and stretched his limbs.\nHis stomach was a little hungry, it was time to pick up his takeout.\nWang Yuhui rolled out of bed, with no one else in the dormitory, his roommates were probably still at the class event.\nHe wasn’t interested in participating, not even in the sports events.",

      "content": "Chapter 389: Chapter 265: Protecting the Environment is Everyone’s Responsibility_3\nArriving at the first floor, Wang Yuhui took out his phone pretending to look at it, while actually using the corner of his eye to observe the spot everyone accepted as the place to leave deliveries.\nGreat, there were already more than a dozen deliveries. If the quantity was smaller, Wang Yuhui wouldn’t take the risk to grab one.\nMoreover, there wasn’t a single student or delivery person around, making it a perfect opportunity.\nContinuing the act of playing on his phone, Wang Yuhui walked over and casually picked a delivery that didn’t look too shabby or too fancy, and left with it.\nThis way, even in the worst-case scenario where the delivery owner caught him, Wang Yuhui could always say he was distracted by his phone and accidentally took the wrong one.\nCarrying the delivery to the dormitory building, nothing happened, just like yesterday.\nSatisfying.\nStealing deliveries was just that simple and safe.\nIt’s not like he couldn’t afford a meal, but Wang Yuhui thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of taking advantage of others, especially visualizing the scene where the person he stole from was helplessly furious while he ate happily.\nFret all you want, until you’re worn out from it.\nJust thinking about it made Wang Yuhui want to laugh a bit.\nThis was even more enjoyable than when he noticed someone losing something in class and instead of reminding them, he would try to kick it into a corner.\nHarming others without benefiting himself, but it was fun.\nUnfortunately, he could only enjoy it one more time tonight and tomorrow noon, as there would be no more opportunities after the sports day ended.\nReturning to the fourth floor, Wang Yuhui unlocked his dorm room with a key.\nOut of the corner of his eye, he noticed four tall students coming up the stairs, ones he hadn’t seen on this floor before.\nBut Wang Yuhui didn’t think much of it, assuming they were just visiting from another class, which was normal.\nOpen door, close door.\nWang Yuhui sat down with the delivery, took a stack of napkins from the spot of a roommate and put it in his own napkin box, then prepared to dig in.\nFirst, the receipt.\nEnding number 9749, Mr. Lin.\nIt was a spicy stir-fry pot.\nNot bad, it was a type of food rarely provided by the cafeteria, which Wang Yuhui quite wanted to try.\n\"Mr. Lin, you won’t have lunch today, hehe.\" Wang Yuhui chuckled softly.\nThe door of Nansang Middle School’s dorm room had a peephole, and it wasn’t the one-way type. However, most rooms chose to cover it with stickers or posters for privacy, and some rooms that had lost their peephole covers would stuff a bunch of tissues in there.\nAt this moment, the wad of tissue blocking the peephole of room 403 was poked out by an index finger, floating to the ground without Wang Yuhui noticing at all.\nThe index finger retracted, replaced by an eye that bore the same amused expression as Wang Yuhui’s face.\nWang Yuhui removed the seal, opened the packaging, and pulled out the separated food. There was even a soup of seaweed and egg drop as a bonus.\nOpening the main spicy stir-fry pot, it didn’t have as much steam as the two he stole yesterday, but it was fine, not cold yet.\nThe pot was mostly yellow-brown. After a look, it was indeed made with soy sauce base, and seemed to have too much peanut butter or something similar.\nAfter taking a sip of the seaweed egg drop soup, Wang Yuhui slightly frowned, feeling that the soup tasted weird. Why did it have a bit of astringency? Was there also a hint of gamey or stinky taste?\nForget it.\nSoup was just a freebie anyway, he shouldn’t have such high expectations. Taking a big gulp, Wang Yuhui prepared to tackle the main dish.\n\"Damn, is this medium spicy?\" After eating a rib, Wang Yuhui sipped on more soup with a hiss, then complained.\nThis spicy stir-fry pot was not only spicy but so spicy it tasted somewhat bitter and astringent, especially the sauce smothered on the meat and vegetables; it tasted really odd.\n\"Damn it, this Mr. Lin, is he sick in the head, ordering such spicy food? Serves him right for missing lunch.\" Wang Yuhui cursed angrily.\nRather than blame himself for not handling spice, he’d rather blame Mr. Lin.\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Wang Yuhui gave up the idea of going back downstairs for another serving.\nSpicy is spicy, just drink more water.\nWang Yuhui pulled out his phone to play a video while eating.\nLittle John Khan, activate!\nBut this was the worst delivery Wang Yuhui had ever eaten, what kind of spicy stir-fry was this?\nHopefully, after Mr. Lin finds out his delivery is missing, he gives the shop a bad review.\n\"Damn, the small ingredients in the spicy stir-fry taste like boogers. Can this place really keep its business with people buying again?\" Holding up an unknown ingredient slathered in sauce, Wang Yuhui commented sharply.\n\"Damn, it even has the consistency of boogers. This place is impressive. What the hell is this...\" He tried to taste it but only got pure sauce flavor. His expression was hard to describe.\nNow, Wang Yuhui’s resentment towards this Mr. Lin had reached its peak.\nIncompetent, can’t even order a decent delivery.\nThe most unpleasant meal he had eaten.\nThis meal will just have to do, and he’ll be more careful to steal something good in the afternoon.\nChopsticks reaching the rice brought a soft \"click.\"\nThis wasn’t the texture of rice or the container.\nFrowning, Wang Yuhui pushed the rice aside, surprisingly finding a card beneath it.\nPicking up the lunchbox, there indeed was a rectangular brown card at the bottom.\n\"They put a positive review card in the meal? This place is really going Sima!\" Seeing this, Wang Yuhui was genuinely angry. This kind of quality control was outrageous; if he had ordered this delivery himself, he wouldn’t settle unless the shop refunded and compensated him with tens of dollars.\nJust as he prepared to discard the meal, he noticed there seemed to be writing on the front side of the card.\n\"Hmm?\"\nWang Yuhui carefully pulled the card out with his chopsticks.\nCasually, he read the words on it aloud.\n\"Bastard, did your dad’s delivery taste... taste good...\"\nWang Yuhui froze.\nThen his mind went blank.\nThere was another line below, which Wang Yuhui was unable to read.\n——\"Look at the door, your dad’s outside.\"\n\"Click.\"\nWang Yuhui turned his head; the door he had just shut was being opened by someone with a key, and at some point, the peephole, without any tissue, had an eye staring at him.\nShit!\nFor a moment, Wang Yuhui wanted to rush forward and hold the door shut, but it was too late.\n\"Click, creak——\"\nThe unlocked door, pushed open.\nBut what he saw was his roommate, Mao Jiaqi.\nThe suffocating feeling in Wang Yuhui dissipated, and after catching his breath, a wave of anger surged up, as he shouted: \"Mao Jiaqi! Are you out of your mind scaring me like that? Say something, damn it.\"\nBeing scolded, Mao Jiaqi looked at Wang Yuhui with a slightly pitying and mocking expression, shaking his head as he said: \"Wang Yuhui, I’ve got good news for you.\"\n\"What? Out with it.\" Wang Yuhui frowned.\n\"You didn’t get scared for nothing.\"\nWang Yuhui: \"?\"\nMao Jiaqi stepped aside and fully opened the door.\nThen the space opened up, and the four people behind him walked in.\nThese were, indeed, the four people Wang Yuhui had noticed earlier that had never appeared on the fourth floor before.\nAt this moment, the four people wore eerie smiles as they looked at her.\n\"Who are you... who are you, damn it?\" The heart he had just slightly eased now hung in suspension again. Wang Yuhui, although already guessing in his heart, was still desperately searching for that last glimmer of hope.\nUndoubtedly, these were Lin Li’s group of four.\nAs for Mao Jiaqi, he was Wang Yuhui’s roommate who returned during Lin Li’s group spying.\nAfter learning the rough truth of the situation, he followed Lin Li’s command and opened the door for them at the right moment.\n\"Since you have sincerely asked, I shall mercifully tell you.\" Lin Li adjusted the camera in front of him before speaking softly, with a teasing tone: \"The four of us are the Dazzling Group, and I am the Dazzle.\"\nBai Bufan’s smile froze for a moment, but then he stepped forward and casually said, \"I am the ’Group’.\"\nWang Ze’s voice was loud and hurried, \"I am the ’Buster’!\"\n\"...\"\nSeeing someone in the group not introducing themselves, Lin Li, Bai Bufan, and Wang Ze all turned around simultaneously, giving a synchronized death stare at the nonconforming Zhou Baowei.\nZhou Baowei: \"(;☉_☉)?\"\nYour mothers.\nIs this polite?",

What do you think we’re here for? What else could we be here for?\" Bao Wei, from the combo, stepped forward, smiling but through gritted teeth: \"You thieving dog scumbag taking others’ delivery? Hmm?\"\nThen, Bai Bufan also stepped forward, took a deep breath, bowed at a ninety-degree angle, and stretched out a hand to Wang Yuhui, his face slightly flushed as he said, \"Wang Tongxue, please let me date your mom! I’m begging you! I promise I will treat her well!\"\nWang Yuhui: \"?\"\nThen Wang Yuhui realized—\nHigh emotional intelligence: Let me date your mom.\nLow emotional intelligence: *Cursing your mom.*\n\"I didn’t steal the delivery!\" Ignoring Bai Bufan’s confession, Wang Yuhui frantically glanced around while retorting sharply.\n\"Then what’s this on your desk.\" Lin Li walked over, picked up a clean packaging bag and the receipt next to it, and smiled: \"Buddy, I heard from your roommate that your surname is Wang, not Lin.\"\n\"I, I took it by mistake.\"\nJust like a culprit in Conan, Wang Yuhui began a futile last-ditch struggle.\n\"Alright, if you took it by mistake, then you should have your own delivery order records, right? Come on, show them to me, maybe I’ll change my surname to yours.\"\nWatching Wang Yuhui’s pretentious act of pulling out his phone, Lin Li just felt amused.\nHearing rustling sounds, Lin Li turned his head and frowned: \"Hey, Bao Wei, chill. Save digging through trash till we’re back. We’re in front of other classmates now; leave us some dignity.\"\nZhou Baowei, caught rummaging through the trash with chopsticks: \"...\"\n\"Don’t outright assume my nickname is forcing! And I’m not rummaging the trash, look what I’ve found! Damn, this is my delivery bag; my receipt is right on it, Detective Mr. Zhou! Damn, turns out you’re a habitual offender.\"\nAfter revealing his discovery, Zhou Baowei angrily threw his chopsticks into the trash bin and looked at Wang Yuhui with eyes full of fire.\nFinally, he can avenge yesterday’s grievance.\nHe wants to avenge the big lunch he lost yesterday!\n\"Found your order number or not?\" Lin Li watched Wang Yuhui and pressed him.\nLike someone with Parkinson’s, there’s no way Wang Yuhui has an order number; he’s just messing with the phone, and caught red-handed, he reluctantly bore a flattering smile:\n\"Guys, I’m really sorry; how much was the delivery? Can I compensate you now?\"\n\"Oh, delivery’s nothing much, no rush to compensate; let’s go chat with the teacher first.\" Lin Li’s smile was bright and warm as he said this to Wang Yuhui.\n\"No!\" Wang Yuhui suddenly shouted.\n\"Don’t tell the teacher, I’m begging you; I shouldn’t have stolen the delivery; I know I was wrong, let’s settle this privately.\" Hearing Lin Li’s intention, Wang Yuhui turned pale; if this spreads, how would he continue living at Nansang Middle School?\n\"It’s not about knowing you were wrong; you just realized you’re doomed.\"\nBai Bufan said with a chuckle, hearing that.\n\"Sorry, we won’t settle privately.\" Lin Li nodded in agreement too.\n\"I can give you more money, double, triple, no, five times; I’ll give each of you a hundred bucks! Please, don’t tell the teacher!\" Wang Yuhui’s voice had a crying tone as he tried to grab Lin Li’s hand, but Lin Li avoided it.\n\"This sort of good thing?\" Wang Ze’s eyes brightened.\nCame to watch the drama, and could earn a hundred bucks? A windfall.\nBut then Wang Ze felt the death glare from the trio.\n\"Combo, now’s not the time for you to speak.\"\n\"Sorry, handsome, forcing, people, don’t mind me; you three carry on.\" Wang Ze maintained an awkward yet polite smile, gesturing for them to continue.\n\"I’m really sorry, we don’t plan to extort; we just want you to face the consequences you should, there’s no chance to settle privately, even if you brought out a million.\" Lin Li calmly refused.\nIf he really brings out a million, let’s discuss that later.\nThe system task requires ensuring the delivery thief faces the punishment he deserves, and just compensating won’t likely satisfy the system.\nAs for Bufan and Bao Wei, if they accept the 100 privately, I’ll pay out of my own pocket later.\n\"No, please, don’t tell the teacher, just let me go this time...\"\nRealizing Lin Li’s firm determination, Wang Yuhui switched targets, crying as he looked at Bai Bufan.\n\"Crying? Crying is on the clock.\" Bai Bufan immediately backed away, preventing this guy from rubbing his snot and tears on him, then sneered, \"Pleading with us is useless; plead with the teacher instead.\"\nHe and Zhou Baowei naturally supported Lin Li’s decision.\nJust earlier at the door, they heard from Lin Li about Wang Yuhui’s self-dialogue.\nThis guy is like a large item at a rookie courier station, barcode scanned but unpaid, ready to be shipped.\nA touch of innate rogue, loves to antagonize society, mere compensation really is too lenient for him.\n\"Don’t cry your damn eyes out; why didn’t you cry when you were stealing deliveries, do you need us to drag you along?\"\nWang Ze, irritated and disdainful, stepped forward at this moment, trying to pull up Wang Yuhui, planning to drag him away directly.\nAlthough this analogy might be inappropriate, it’s like: if you’re afraid, don’t cheat, and if you cheat, don’t be afraid; if Wang Yuhui just owned up, he could still be pure in a Sima way, but now crying for mercy after being caught is disgusting and revolting in a Sima sense, and Wang Ze really despises it.",

All of you get the fuck out!\" Wang Yuhui raised the mop, not caring if the stuff on it splashed onto himself, he charged at Lin Li and the others.\n\"This situation isn’t right, let’s retreat first!\" Lin Li turned back to see that The B-People combo had already run to the door, and he, The Handsome, was the slowest one running.\nYou beast.\nLin Li immediately followed and ran out.\nLin Li had a lot of ways to deal with this guy, in a real fight, Wang Yuhui would have no chance.\nBut the problem was he was holding a mop taken from the bathroom.\nLin Li had the ability for a bare blade catch, but would he dare to catch this? He wouldn’t dare.\nThe mop was covered in shit, Lu Bu reborn.\nNot only was it for close combat, but occasionally for long range too, with a chance of splash damage in normal attacks.\nRidiculously overpowered, did the designer think at all when designing this weapon?\nLuckily, his ability wasn’t like Li Jing’s, which was a hundred percent forced bare blade catch, or Lin Li couldn’t imagine how desperate he’d be.\nEven though Lin Li was a Cultivator, but with so many people around, the Qingzheng Thunder Control Technique wasn’t suitable to use, the harmful remote currents would be very obvious, easy to notice.\nFirst leave the dorm, anyway all the evidence is in hand, it’s enough, whether Wang Yuhui willingly submits or not only affects the complexity of the process.\n\"Trying to catch a delivery thief ended up bringing out Lu Bu, Handsome, are you okay?\" Bai Bufan asked Lin Li who just ran out, showing concern.\n\"I’m fine, this guy, hard to judge.\" Lin Li shook his head and looked towards the dorm.\nInside, the argument continued.\n\"Mao Jiaqi, you get out too! Get out!\"\n\"Are you sick, Wang Yuhui? You messed up my bed and we haven’t even settled that!\"\n\"Did you not hear me telling you to get out!\"\nThen Mao Jiaqi also ran out, with a stain on his white shirt, and Lin Li and the other four silently moved a bit farther away.\nThe door slammed shut with a bang.\nMao Jiaqi was also obviously angered, he yelled curses as he slapped the dorm door.\n\"What do we do now?\" Wang Ze felt as if coming was worth it, he crossed his arms and inquired.\n\"If he’s unwilling to see the teacher, then let the teacher come to see him. Bro, what do you say, will you contact your class teacher? Or should we find the dorm supervisor first?\" Lin Li shrugged indifferently, looking at Mao Jiaqi.\nAs for contacting Xue Jian, it wasn’t considered, not because they were afraid Xue Jian would find out, he eventually surely would know, but because this annoying task counting as overtime is best handled by the class teacher of the class that caused it.\n\"I’ll find the teacher now!\" Mao Jiaqi gritted his teeth, holding his phone, and walked to the stairway to make a call.\nThe efficiency was quite fast, within a few minutes, a middle-aged teacher, probably the homeroom teacher of Class Twelve, Fang Lihua, hurriedly came over.\nPresumably, he received the call while eating in the school cafeteria.\nAfter a short chat with Mao Jiaqi, Fang Lihua walked up and knocked on the door: \"Yu Hui, it’s the teacher, can you open the door for me now?\"\n\"They’re still outside, have them leave first!\"\nFang Lihua negotiated with Wang Yuhui for a while, then approached Lin Li and his three companions.\n\"I’ve heard from Mao Jiaqi about the general situation. Currently, Wang Yuhui is emotionally unstable. Would you four mind leaving for a bit? Once he calms down, we can find an opportunity to discuss the handling of this theft incident together?\"\nFang Lihua spoke slowly.\nSeeing the other three’s eyes on Lin Li, Fang Lihua also looked towards him.\n\"No problem.\" Lin Li was indifferent.\nThere’s no need for dialogue with a mentally unstable person, and besides, the four of them should eat, no need to wait here on an empty stomach for results.\nThe ones who should be anxious aren’t them.\n\"Then, teacher, we’ll leave first and contact us when you’ve calmed him down?\"\n\"Sure, by the way, could you refrain from spreading what Wang Yuhui has done for now? It’s important, whether within the school or outside.\" Fang Lihua nodded and then emphasized.\n\"We can hold off saying anything today, as for tomorrow... we’ll see tomorrow, I can’t make any promises.\" Lin Li thought a bit, then replied.\nConsider it giving Fang Lihua a deadline, don’t let it be that pacifying goes on for an entire semester without results.",

What are their names? Which class?\"\nMao Jiaqi was taken aback for a moment, then scratched his head, \"Those four... are the ’Sharp Lookers’ group.\"\nFang Lihua: \"?\"\n\"What the heck?\"\n\"Sir, I don’t know their names or class; I think they might be from class four? I’m not sure,\" Mao Jiaqi apologized.\n\"Alright, that’s noted,\" Fang Lihua replied.\nOn the way downstairs.\nWang Ze had already ordered delivery, so he went directly to pick it up. Lin Li and the other two hadn’t ordered, and they didn’t want to wait another half hour, so they went to the cafeteria.\nAfter a brief criticism of Wang Yuhui’s clownish behavior, Lin Li asked Bai Bufan, \"Bufan, did you add Wang Ze on QQ with your alt account?\"\n\"That’s right,\" Bai Bufan chuckled.\n\"Be careful, don’t really make Wang Ze go crazy,\" Lin Li warned.\n\"Don’t worry, I’ve got it under control. This afternoon, I’ll have him treat my ’little sister’ to dinner and reveal the truth then,\" Bai Bufan nodded.\n\"Alright, keep yourself safe tonight. I fear Wang Ze might lose his mind; you know how it is, as they say, ’we came, so we might as well stay.’ Lin Li patted Bai Bufan on the shoulder, advising, \"Especially since Wang Ze is naturally inclined that way; although your actions are really cold, your interest is really hot.\"\nWhat do a corpse and a swimming pool have in common? They are both cold when you enter; what do Bai Bufan and a sauna have in common? They are both hot when you enter.\nKind-hearted Bai Bufan: \"... Damn.\"\n...\n[Do your best to participate in the sect competition, winning at least three first prizes for yourself or for the sect, with at least two in the main competition (3/1; 2/2)]\n[You can now choose to complete the task and claim the reward at any time, but you won’t trigger the chance for a probability doubling.]\nIn the afternoon, the moment the finish line was crossed, Lin Li broke the Nansang Middle School sports meet’s 1500-meter men’s freshman record again by three seconds.\nThe system also issued such a notification.\nLin Li, of course, did not choose to settle; he was working towards this doubling opportunity from the start and wasn’t in a hurry.\nHis own projects only had the relay race left, which served as a finale for tomorrow’s sports meet.\n\"Lin Li, want some water? Which bottle do you want?\" As Lin Li finished the race and came into the inner field, Chen Yu Ying went up to ask.\n\"Of course, which one have you drunk from?\" Lin Li nodded, asking.\n\"I haven’t drunk from either,\" Chen Yu Ying shook her head, waving the two bottles in her hand before offering them to Lin Li, \"Here’s the difference: one is cold, and the other at room temperature.\"\nThe condensed droplets glistening on the cold mineral water bottle trickled down her slender fingers, making Lin Li slightly tempted to slurp.\nAfter knowing Bai Bufan for a while, his own habits were slightly leaning toward dog-like as well.\n\"Then I won’t drink; I plan to die of thirst, and this is all your fault. When my dehydrated body is discovered, class leader, think about how you’ll explain yourself as the culprit,\" Lin Li crossed his arms, refusing to take the bottles and insisted.\n\"Then I must really think it over seriously,\" Chen Yu Ying laughed in response.\n\"So thirsty, so thirsty, so thirsty, so thirsty...\" Thus, Lin Li began a leisurely but continuous lament.\n\"Lin Li, I’ve got water here.\" Hearing Lin Li’s words as he walked over, Bai Bufan immediately spoke up.\n\"Buzz off.\"\n\"Oh, bye-bye, you two continue,\" Bai Bufan nodded and buzzed off.\nLin Li was sure he drove Bai Bufan away because three’s a crowd, not because Bai Bufan was unwelcome.\n\"So thirsty, so thirsty...\"\nChen Yu Ying maintained a soft smile, and upon noticing several sidelong glances from Lin Li, finally burst into laughter.\n\"Alright, alright~\"\nWith slender fingers, she gently unscrewed the cap, tilting her head up, and the sunlight shone through the bottle onto her fair neck, yet the bottle’s mouth hovered just a few centimeters from her lips, and the water cascaded lightly into her mouth.\nThe crisp and pleasant sound made the air turn cool, and a drop of water slipped from the corner of her lips, but was wiped away with her hand before it reached her chin.\n\"Thinking it over, Lin Li, it’s a pity if you die after all. Now this bottle, I’ve drunk from it, you can have it, right?\" Chen Yu Ying offered the bottle and asked.\n\"And here I thought I’d have to bug-fix that; this isn’t what I imagined ’drunk from’ to mean, is it?\" Lin Li blinked.\n\"I’ve compromised, and so must you,\" Chen Yu Ying swayed the bottle using her index finger in front of him.\n\"Alright then,\" Lin Li smiled, nodded, and accepted the water.\n\"Compromising over what? Give me a turn too?\" Approaching as she heard Lin Li talk, Ding Sihan immediately asked.\n\"Go away.\"\nLin Li forgot that Ding Sihan was different from Bai Bufan.\n\"I am the great contributor to Class Four’s sports meet! Ding Sihan, how impertinent!\"\n...\n\"Bufan, help me check if there’s still a mark on the back of my sweatpants,\" Lin Li asked as he walked to Bai Bufan on the stands.\n\"Gone.\"\n\"That’s good,\" Lin Li nodded, then lazily leaned against the railing beside Bai Bufan, \"Bufan, you’re the best, saying ’buzz off’ and you actually buzz off, a natural talent for flitting away.\"\n\"I’ll take that as a compliment,\" Bai Bufan laughed.\n\"With a buddy like you, what more could I wish for? Bufan, be sure to tell me whenever you face a hardship,\" Lin Li patted Bai Bufan on the shoulder, expressing his appreciation.\n\"And then you’ll add insult to injury, right?\" Bai Bufan chuckled cynically.\n\"No, if you ever face difficulty, I’ll definitely give you a hand,\" Lin Li’s smile was warm, then he became serious, \"But remember, only once.\"\n\"Is that the extent of our friendship?\"\n\"Has nothing to do with friendship, it’s just if someone helps multiple times, that’s damn romance, not brotherhood.\"\nBai Bufan: \"(;☉_☉)?\"",

When you have a date with him at night, you might consider developing in this direction.\" Lin Li analyzed seriously and suggested.\n\"Damn it.\" Bai Bufan laughed and cursed, \"Forget it, just give me a hand, one hand is enough, thanks.\"\nIf you’re looking for a change of heart, you have to look at Bai Bufan.\nWhile chatting simply, after cheering for Qu Wanqiu during the women’s 1500 meters, the next project that needed cheering was the shot put event Zhou Baowei was participating in.\nThe two headed to the shot put field.\n\"Lin Li, Bai Bufan, go over and help out.\"\nAs they passed the high jump area, a girl failed her jump and fell from the mat.\nThe referee for this event was Class Four’s PE teacher, You Jun, so he called out to the two passing by.\nLin Li and Bai Bufan nodded, went over to set the fallen high jump bar back in place, then subtly disappeared without needing any praise from You Jun.\nYou Jun: \"?\"\nI freaking asked you two to help the girl who fell off the mat, not to fix the bar.\nEven when given the chance, you’re useless, huh?\nIf you two manage to date, I might as well eat shit.\n... Fine, Lin Li’s conditions are a bit more favorable now, but Bai Bufan, if you can date, I might as well eat shit.\n\"I’m afraid of girls, why didn’t you help her?\" Bai Bufan asked as they left.\n\"I’ve been betrayed three times, I’m afraid she’ll falsely accuse me.\" Already trained by Xiaozhou to become a master of avoiding scams, Lin Li said with an air of control.\n\"Makes sense.\"\n\"Baowei, good luck, try to get second place.\" Reaching the shot put field, Bai Bufan encouraged Zhou Baowei, who was stretching.\nAs for first place, it had already been secured by the shot put athlete from Class Nine. Zhou Baowei would need to become a second Zhou Baowei just to beat him.\n\"Try to finish the battle in seventeen minutes.\" Lin Li requested.\n\"Why seventeen minutes, do you have something going on later?\" Zhou Baowei curiously asked.\n\"Because the high school girls’ 800 meters is next, Lin Li has to cheer for the class leader.\" Bai Bufan answered for Lin Li.\n\"What if it doesn’t end in seventeen minutes?\" Zhou Baowei felt the time to test friendship had come.\n\"Baowei, I believe in you.\"\n\"According to the procedure, with so many rounds for so many people, it really can’t end in seventeen minutes. It’s not about belief or not.\" Zhou Baowei spread his hands innocently.\n\"What I mean is, because I believe in you, if you haven’t finished by then, I’ll trustingly put my back into your hands. This is the bond between brothers!\"\nLin Li placed his hand on Zhou Baowei’s shoulder and said passionately:\n\"Only you, can I entrust my back to!\"\nZhou Baowei: \"...\"\nYou friggin’.\nLow emotional intelligence: I’m going to find the class leader.\nHigh emotional intelligence: Only you can I entrust my back to.\n\"Lin Li, during the match later, can you stand on the grass, that might improve my performance, okay?\" Zhou Baowei pleaded.\n\"Haha, no thanks.\"\n\"Please, brother.\"\n\"I’m also pleading on behalf of Baowei, I really want to see this.\"\n\"This isn’t a matter of pleading, is it? You two are killing me!\"\n...\nFinally, the time came to use the special power reserved for Chen Yu Ying, [Control the Wind].\nWith only two laps in the 800 meters, and no athletes in the same grade, Chen Yu Ying came in third at the finish line, not far from first and second.\nIf Lin Li controlled the wind to blow against the first two the entire time, maybe he could help Chen Yu Ying get first.\nHowever, Lin Li felt such targeting was unnecessary.\nImproving your own performance and making others’ lower, Lin Li thought the latter didn’t quite fit.\nAs in the morning, after handing water to Chen Yu Ying, who was supported by Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu, Lin Li accompanied the three around the inner side of the track for a small cool-down walk.\nChen Yu Ying sipped the water in small sips, her brow furrowed and never relaxed. After walking for a while, she looked down at her left ankle and said somewhat uncertainly, \"When I sprinted to the finish line just now, I stepped wrong, and my ankle... seems to have twisted a bit.\"\n\"Hmm? Is it serious?\" Upon hearing this, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu immediately looked over and asked with concern.\n\"It shouldn’t be serious, just a lingering slight pain that hasn’t yet affected my walking.\" Chen Yu Ying hastily waved her hand to stop the two from worrying too much.\n\"Well, better go to the medical point to check it anyway.\" Lin Li came over.\nSince the sports meet is usually when injuries happen more easily, the school had logically set up a medical station on the field.\nEven though Lin Li had [Healing], even if [Healing] now was more powerful than when it could only half remove bruises, it was still not really up to par. It was better to let the doctors see first.\n\"Okay.\" Chen Yu Ying didn’t insist and nodded.\nArrived.\n\"It’s just a sprained ankle, not serious, rest for a day or two, and it will be fine.\" The doctor on duty took a look at Chen Yu Ying’s situation, reassured her, and sprayed some Yunnan Baiyao on her ankle.\n\"Strenuous activities can worsen the condition, so if there are any more events, it’s best to skip them; also, avoid standing for too long, nothing else really.\"\n\"Okay, thank you, teacher.\"",

Let’s go, to the stands.\"\nThere were not many empty chairs at the medical point, and students would come by one after another. It was definitely not appropriate to sit here for too long, and this place was relatively far from the class’s base.\nThe stands were just right, being closer, and Chen Yu Ying could watch the rest of the competition without having to move.\n\"Okay.\" Chen Yu Ying nodded.\nEven though Chen Yu Ying said she didn’t need help, Ding Sihan and Qu Wanqiu still supported her to the class’s seating area on the stands.\nThere weren’t many people in the stands, most were involved in activities at their respective class bases.\nThere were more pigeons here, presumably the same ones released during the opening ceremony, surprisingly not recaptured.\n\"So, Yu Ying, why don’t you sit and rest for a bit? I’ll accompany Ding Sihan to the registration?\" Qu Wanqiu and Ding Sihan didn’t sit down but asked after Chen Yu Ying was seated.\n\"Sure, I’m fine.\"\n\"Lin Li, Ying Bao is all yours now,\" Ding Sihan said, pointing at Lin Li’s nose.\n\"Just leave her to me. Don’t you all know by now what kind of person I am? I’ll definitely ruin the class rep’s purity.

Call us if anything happens, I’m off to the registration,\" Ding Sihan gave an approving nod and then went with Qu Wanqiu to the registration area.\nChen Yu Ying: \"???\"\nBefore she could question him, there was a rustling sound by her ear. Turning back, she saw Lin Li getting up, placing her coat and phone, along with other items, on the seat, and starting to roll up his sleeves.\n\"Lin Li, what are you doing?\" Chen Yu Ying asked with a slight amusement.\n\"Completing the mission Ding Sihan entrusted to me.\" Lin Li squatted in front of Chen Yu Ying, looking up into her eyes as he spoke, \"Class Rep, hurry, take off your shoes and socks, let me give you a massage.\"\n\"No way.\" Chen Yu Ying playfully glared at Lin Li and instinctively pulled her foot back towards her body.\nBut she forgot she was wearing loose sports shorts. When her thigh lifted, the shorts began to naturally fall due to gravity, revealing more than half of her fair thigh.\nJust looking at them, they seemed smooth and soft, and they probably felt very comfortable to the touch.\nSlurp slurp.\nBai Bufan, get the hell off of me!\n\"Lin Li——\"\nLin Li’s gaze was becoming more and more excessive; he didn’t even pretend not to be looking.\nWhen Chen Yu Ying realized, she put her leg down, but to her helpless amusement, when Lin Li’s neck and gaze followed her leg down, she couldn’t resist stretching out her hand to tap his head, muttering:\n\"Peeping Tom...\"\n\"Only the wrongly accused know how unjustly they’ve been accused,\" Lin Li said deeply.\n\"Lin Li, I really want to kick you, but I’m afraid it might just make you happier, what a dilemma, sigh.\" Looking at the pretending-to-be-deep Lin Li, Chen Yu Ying let out a deep sigh, filled with exasperation.\n\"Class Rep, you really see things clearly.\"\n\"Tch—\" Chen Yu Ying lightly raised her uninjured right foot and bumped her shin against Lin Li’s squatting shin, pretending it was a kick.\n\"But seriously, Class Rep, I really do have a massage technique that can speed up your ankle’s absorption of medication and self-repair. Let me try it, okay?\" Lin Li smiled as he returned to the main topic.\n\"I don’t believe it.\" Chen Yu Ying still shook her head.\n\"Class Rep, when have I ever lied to you?\" Lin Li’s expression turned even more wounded.\nFrom Lin Li’s perspective, Chen Yu Ying rested against the sky and sunlight, quietly watching him, with an increasingly rich smile and teasing look on her face.\nUh, it seems quite often.\n\"But this time, you’ll believe me, won’t you?\" Lin Li stretched out his index finger and pointed at himself, licked his lips, and flashed a brilliant smile.\nYes.\nWhen Lin Li looked at her with such a confident smile, Chen Yu Ying already believed him.\n\"But if it doesn’t get better, Lin Li, you’re done for,\" but Chen Yu Ying still said this with her mouth.\n\"Of course!\"\nChen Yu Ying glanced at Lin Li again, leaned down to undo her shoelaces, her ponytail falling down, brushing against Lin Li’s bent knee, tickling him.\nAs her sneakers came off, the dry autumn wind slipped between her toes, making them curl unconsciously.\n\"Why are the toes and heel parts of your white socks still white? Shouldn’t they be a little gray and black?\" Lin Li made a sharp comment as he stared at the pure white socks.\n\"That’s because you’re not hygienic,\" Chen Yu Ying laughed disdainfully, then hooked her fingertips under the cuff of her cotton sock, pulling it down to reveal the shiny ankle, and the faint pink mark from the sock around her ankle. She then moved it slightly forward, waving it in front of Lin Li: \"Let’s get started.\"\nFrom a close-up view, her ankle was already slightly swollen, but it wasn’t very noticeable.",

After all, as a doctor, when treating patients, gender doesn’t matter.\nEven if Bai Bufan had twisted his ankle, Lin Li would still be breathing just as hard.\nIt’s all the same.\nThe feel of her skin, cool from the recently sprayed Yunnan Baiyao, as he holds her heel, while his right thumb mischievously rubs across the arch of her foot. Chen Yu Ying’s spine suddenly straightens, her instep forming a graceful arc, suppressing the urge to laugh. She glares at Lin Li, ashamed and annoyed, \"Lin Li—\"\n\"Class monitor, don’t move around, you’re affecting my massage treatment.\" Lin Li doesn’t even look up, turning the tables on her.\nAnd then his head gets knocked.\n\"Let’s begin.\"\n[Healing], activate.\nLin Li has Chen Yu Ying keep her left foot suspended by herself while both his hands start roaming and kneading her ankle.\nAlthough there’s no need to move around to achieve healing, it’s always necessary to put on the appearance of performing a massage.\nTo ensure he can cover all the injured areas and reach the ten-second maximum duration of his ability for a single area, Lin Li kneads seriously.\n\"Class monitor, how is it, feeling a bit better?\" After several dozen seconds, seeing no response from Chen Yu Ying, Lin Li looks up and asks, puzzled.\nHis gaze follows her calf upwards, and the next moment, he unexpectedly locks eyes with hers, looking down.\n——Chen Yu Ying rests her chin on the palm, propping her hand on her thigh, attentively and quietly observing Lin Li’s massage.\nHence, the distance is very close.\nHe can even feel the strands of hair on his forehead touching Chen Yu Ying’s cheek as he looks up.\nThere’s less than ten centimeters between their eyes, and every detail on the girl’s face is unbelievably clear, under the faintly trembling eyelashes, Lin Li can see himself reflecting distinctively in her pupils.\nThe distant noise from the sports ground suddenly fades away, as if the world has paused.\nLin Li instinctively raises his hand slowly.\nPang! The sound of a referee’s gunshot rings out from afar.\n\"Class monitor? Hey, hey?\" His action stalls, and Lin Li lowers his hand, slightly leaning back to regain his senses.\n\"Hmm?\" Chen Yu Ying sits up straight, fiddling with a lock of hair that falls at her temples.\n\"I was asking if you’re feeling a bit better.\" Lin Li already has his head down again, his voice gentle as he asks.\n\"Yes,\" Chen Yu Ying nods, her eyes lowering as she looks at Lin Li’s hands, then gradually shifting to the crown of his head, whispering, \"I was feeling a dull ache, but now it’s eased a lot.\"\n\"Ha? What did I say? Isn’t it amazing? And you didn’t believe me!\" Lin Li boasts, unable and unwilling to hide his pride and demand for credit.\n\"Amazing, amazing.\" Chen Yu Ying praises with a hint of perfunctoriness, instinctively wanting to wiggle her ankle, but upon realizing Lin Li was holding it, she restrained herself.\nShe looks up towards the distant sports field.\nEh?\nChen Yu Ying suddenly notices Bai Bufan and Zhou Baowei not too far away, laughing and pointing in her direction.\nWhen they notice her gaze, they suddenly turn 180° towards the other direction, while Bai Bufan makes an imaginary jump shot, and Chen Yu Ying can almost imagine his awkward laughter.\nZhou Baowei also takes a shot but without jumping.\nNo, he jumps, as there’s a noticeable tremor in the stands.\nChen Yu Ying looks down at Lin Li in front of her, a blush flashing across her face.\nIt seems he didn’t jump after all; perhaps the vibration she felt had nothing to do with Zhou Baowei.\n\"Lin Li, I think I didn’t bring my water.\" Turning, suddenly feeling thirsty, Chen Yu Ying looks around both sides and asks.\n\"The bottle I gave you?\" Lin Li raises his head, thinks for a moment, then nods: \"You didn’t have it when you came over, probably left it at the medical station, are you thirsty now?\"\n\"Mm, a little bit.\"\nLin Li instinctively pats his pockets on both sides, then glances at his side.\nHe lifts Chen Yu Ying’s jacket to discover half a bottle of water.\n\"There’s only half a bottle left that I’ve drunk, I’ll fetch another bottle for you from the medical station later.\" Lin Li immediately says.\nHe can’t leave yet, [Healing] can’t be paused, and the ability only lasts one minute, it must not be wasted.\n\"Or you could compromise and drink from my half bottle?\" Lin Li suggests with a smile as he gestures with his chin.\n\"Let’s compromise then.\" The water is lifted, the cap effortlessly twisted open, Chen Yu Ying tilts her head back as the liquid flows from the elevated bottle mouth.\nGulps.\nThe cherry-colored lips are moistened anew, who dares to kiss?\n\"Tastes good.\" She says.\n\"Of course it does, I’ve drunk from it, it’s Sweet.\" Lin Li seamlessly transitions, as though this were not an odd thing at all.\n\"I meant I was very thirsty, dummy.\" Chen Yu Ying retorts after drinking from the nearly empty bottle, then caps it and knocks it against Lin Li’s head, \"Meaning I was so thirsty I had no choice but to compromise!\"\n\"Right.\"\nThe one-minute ability time ends, Lin Li releases his hands and stands up: \"Class monitor, the massage is about done, does it still hurt?\"\n\"It seems... it doesn’t hurt at all?\" Chen Yu Ying states uncertainly.\nShe doesn’t know if it truly doesn’t hurt anymore, or if her elevated spirits have made her overlook the slight pain that doesn’t affect much.\n\"Not for nothing, learning this massage.\" Lin Li checks, seeing that the redness and swelling in Chen Yu Ying’s ankle have completely disappeared, feeling like the treatment is done.\nIt seems that the [Healing] ability has also ’grown’ nicely with his own growth.\n\"What kind of massage is this? So magical.\" Chen Yu Ying moves her left foot for a bit more, discovering the absence of any blockage feeling, asking curiously.\n\"To whom would you give it if taught?\" Lin Li inquired.\nChen Yu Ying blinks, \"Si Han?\"\n\"Then it’s really regrettable, class monitor, this is Lin Family’s secret art, only teachable to Lin Family members.\" Lin Li has no choice but to shake his head.\nJust as Chen Yu Ying is about to laugh and tease a few words, her face suddenly flushes, unsure what she’s thought about, she turns away her gaze.\nReturn to her senses, and Lin Li is staring at his own hand.\nThankfully, without giving it a sniff, salvation isn’t beyond Lin Li yet.\n\"What are you doing, Lin Li?\" Chen Yu Ying asks.\n\"I heard hands can get athlete’s foot too.\" Lin Li turns his head to explain.\n\"They can, athlete’s foot is a fungal infection, not just...\" Chen Yu Ying nods, abruptly halting her speech, after deliberating for three seconds, she stares at Lin Li and asks, cheeks slightly puffed, \"Lin Li, what did you just think?\"\n\"I was worried the lovely feet might have—\"\nLin Li’s words are cut short by a flying water bottle.\nLin Li catches the empty water bottle with precision, then squints his eyes: \"Using my magic against me, leaving not a drop for me? Class monitor, you’ve angered me, I will retaliate in the kindest way possible.\"\n\"What do you mean by kindest way?\" Chen Yu Ying tilts her head, not quite grasping Lin Li’s meaning.\nLin Li closes the distance, smiling gently.\nThen he picks up the shoe off the ground and sprints away.\nChen Yu Ying: \"?\"\nLin Li runs to a distance, turns back and waves to Chen Yu Ying, laughing loudly as he delivers a pun so corny it borders on genius: \"Class monitor, what defeats you isn’t innocence, it’s ’shoelessness’.\"\nInnocence is indeed very kind.\n\"Lin Li!!\" Now realizing this is the kind way of retaliating, after being stunned for a while, Chen Yu Ying calls to Lin Li with a flushed face, \"Lin Li! You elementary schooler! Give it back to me!\"\nChen Yu Ying thinks she wants to scold him, that she is angry, but as the words leave her mouth, it’s as if she can hear the amusement in her own voice.\n\"Come get it yourself!\" Lin Li makes a face in the distance.\n\"Fine, I’ll come!\"\nChen Yu Ying stands up, presses her lips together, slightly puffing out her cheeks, hopping on one foot towards Lin Li,\n\"Hey, hey, hey, don’t trip! Here, here, here—\" Lin Li approaches with her shoe.\nAs the pursuit turns into a meeting problem, doves perched in the stands take flight upon the pair’s movement, the flapping of wings covering the uncontrollable pounding of two young hearts.",
